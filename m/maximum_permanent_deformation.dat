The majority of bottles {{are made from}} Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) estimated that the ratio is 55 - 60 %. The objective {{of this research is}} to determine optimum quality and the effect usage of recycled PET as partial fine aggregate replacement in modified asphalt mixture by determining the permanent deformation and stiffness behaviour. The modified asphalt mixtures were produced from content concentrate of recycled PET pallet range between 5 and 25 % of the weight of asphalt mixture with sieve size from 2. 36 mm to 1. 18 mm and 5 % weight of bitumen content as follow hot mix asphalt wearing course 14 (ACW 14) in Standard Specification of Road Work in Malaysia. The samples were subjected to Repeated Load Axial Test (RLAT) loading for 1800 cycles and axial load applied 100 kN at to determine permanent deformation of modified asphalt mixture. The Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus Test (ITSM) was used to evaluate stiffness modified asphalt sample at 25 Â°C. The result obtained from the lab testing reveals the <b>maximum</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of modified asphalt mixture reach at 20 % replacement with recycled PET. However the stiffness of PET modified asphalt mixtures tend to decrease compare to unmodified asphalt mixture. The finding indicates that PET has ability to improve permanent deformation properties of asphalt mixture.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the response of}} a full-scale dry-stack masonry structure subject to earthquake loads. The following earthquakes were applied {{to the base of}} the structure: (a) North Ridge, (b) Llolleo, (c) El Centro and (d) Llolleo for the second time. The earthquake displacement signals had to be filtered by removing the slow-varying frequency components so that the available servo-hydraulic test machine could be used. The filtering produced acceptably low error when comparing the applied histories with the real earthquake histories. A 4 x 4 m structure was constructed on a 1 o of freedom shake table out of mortarless interlocking bricks with minimum reinforcement. A 2 560 kg mass was superimposed on the structure to model the roof. The test structure was instrumented with accelerometers and LVDTs. The results showed that the simulated Llolleo earthquakes caused the most damage. This damage was minor: several bricks cracked, other bricks shifted, vertical gaps opened up between the bricks, and the skim plaster spalled in several places. The Llolleo earthquake damage was estimated to be Grade 2 on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS). During the earthquake simulations the walls deflected up to 42 mm. However, the <b>maximum</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> recorded due to bricks shifting was only 4, 6 mm - a small fraction of the wall thickness. Although the peak ground acceleration (PGA) was 0, 7 g, the maximum acceleration experienced by the structure at a door opening was 3, 4 g. The tests were concluded by applying two harmonic base excitations. The first 5 Hz harmonic test, which corresponded to the undamaged structure's resonant frequency, produced less damage than the Llolleo earthquake. The second 15 s, 3 Hz sinusoidal base motion, which corresponded to the damaged structure's resonant frequency, caused major damage (EMS Grade 4). Despite major cracks in two walls forming the characteristic "X" failure, the structure continued to support the roof mass. Video analysis clearly demonstrated that dry stacking can result in large brick movements when the base is excited. The ability of the test structure to withstand the applied earthquakes and base harmonic motions is attributed to energy absorption and dissipation due to inter-brick friction and bricks cracking and crushing...|$|E

Evaluation of guardrail system performance as an element of providing a safe environment for vehicles and to reduce occupant injuries is deemed to be vital issue.

For this purpose, the results of full-scale crash tests for different types of guardrail system are collected from previous crash tests available in the literature.

HMA mixes were prepared using varying coarse aggregate angularity properties such as low, medium and high for two aggregate types. The standardized test methods for classification of aggregate angularity are biased because of the judgement of the test personnel, therefore the study employed the use of the Aggregate Imaging System (AIMS) to evaluate the angularity characteristics. The <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> was measured using the repeated dynamic creep loading test. The research concluded that aggregate type as well as coarse aggregate particle angularity had a significant effect on the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Deformation</b> performance, and also that with an increase in coarse aggregate angularity there was an increase in the resistance of mixes to <b>Permanent</b> <b>Deformation.</b> A comparison between the measured data and predictive data of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> predictive models showed the limits of existing prediction models.

RomanoschiPermanent {{deformation}} (rutting) is {{the most}} critical load-associated distress that develops on asphalt pavements significantly affecting their performance. Past research work focused on estimating <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of asphalt mixes using empirical prediction models or prediction models based on linear elastic material models. In recent years, mechanistic and mechanistic-empirical prediction models {{have been developed to}} take into account the behavior of asphalt material (viscoelastic, viscoplastic or elasto-visco-plastic). This research project aims to evaluate existing mechanistic models that predict <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> (rutting) in asphalt mixes by comparing computed <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> to that measured in a full-scale accelerated pavement test. Six pavement sections were constructed in the Civil Infrastructure Systems Laboratory (CISL) of Kansas State University with six different asphalt mixes. The sections were loaded with up to 700, 000 load repetitions of a 22, 000 lb single axle. The transverse profiles at the pavement surface were measured periodically. For material characterization, asphalt mix samples fabricated in the laboratory, were subjected to dynamic modulus (|E*|), static creep - flow time (Ft), dynamic creep - flow number (Fn), triaxial and uniaxial strength tests, repetitive shear at constant height (RSCH) and frequency sweep at constant height (FSCH). The finite element software, Abaqus, was used to simulate and evaluate four <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> prediction models, which are: creep model, elasto-visco-plastic model, viscoelastic model and Drucker-Prager model. The predicted <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> was then compared to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> measured in CISL for the six of asphalt pavement sections. It was found that, with some improvements, creep and elasto-visco-plastic models could be used to predict <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> in asphalt mixes.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the benefits of}} geogrid reinforcement on unbound granular materials (UGMs) in terms of cross-anisotropy and stress-dependent <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> by using repeated-load triaxial (RLT) tests. One type of crushed granite material and three types of geogrid were selected for the RLT tests. The influence of the aperture type, the sheet stiffness, {{and the location of}} the geogrid was quantified in terms of the increase of resilient modulus and the reduction of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of the UGMs. The RLT test results indicated that the geogrid reinforced both the vertical and horizontal resilient moduli of the UGM but did not affect its anisotropic ratio. The geogrid with triangular apertures and high sheet stiffness placed {{in the middle of a}} UGM specimen provided the most benefits in reinforcing the cross-anisotropic resilient modulus and reducing the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> To characterize the stress-dependent <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of geogrid-reinforced UGMs, a mechanisticâempirical rutting model was proposed by incorporating a softening stress term and a hardening stress term into the TsengâLytton model.

Central to this research was the separate characterization of the contribution of the aggregate skeleton and the bituminous mortar towards resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> The mixtures considered in this research included porous asphalt, stone mastic asphalt and dense asphalt concrete. The test program comprised of modulus testing as well as monotonic tension and compression tests on the asphalt mixtures, monotonic and repeated load triaxial tests on the aggregate skeletons along with dynamic shear and direct tension tests on the bitumen and the bituminous mortar. Prior to testing, the compaction homogeneity of the aggregate skeleton and asphalt mixture specimens was examined by means of X-ray tomography. The repeated load triaxial tests conducted on the aggregate skeleton included constant and cyclic confinement tests. The cyclic confinement tests offered a more realistic means of characterizing the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behaviour of the aggregate skeleton in comparison to the constant confinement tests. In addition, the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> under cyclic confinement was higher than the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> under constant confinement.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to characterize and predict the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties of unbound granular materials (UGMs) for Pavement ME Design. First, laboratory repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests are conducted on the UGMs from 11 quarries in Texas to measure the permanent strain curves. The shakedown theory is applied to evaluate the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behavior of the selected UGMs. It is found that using Werkmeister's criteria to define the shakedown range boundaries is not suitable for the selected UGMs. Under this circumstance, new criteria are proposed to redefine the shakedown range boundaries for the flexible base materials in Texas. The new criteria are consistent with the current Texas flexible base specification in terms of aggregate classification. Second, the mechanistic-empirical design guide (MEPDG) model is used to determine the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties of the selected UGMs on the basis of the measured permanent strain curves. The determined <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties are assigned as target values for the development of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> prediction models. Third, a series of performance-related base course properties are used to comprehensively characterize the UGMs, which include the dry density, moisture content, aggregate gradation, morphological properties, percent fines content, and methylene blue value. These performance-related base course properties are assigned as the inputs of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> prediction models. Fourth, a multiple regression analysis is conducted to develop the prediction models for <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties using these performance-related properties. The developed models are capable of accurately predicting the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties of UGMs. Compared to other prediction models (e. g., simple indicators-based models and Pavement ME Design models), the developed models have the highest prediction accuracy. It is also found that the Pavement ME model-predicted permanent strains are much lower than those measured from the RLT tests. This demonstrates that the current Pavement ME Design software substantially underestimates the rutting that occurs in base course. Finally, the developed prediction models are validated by comparing the predicted and measured permanent strains of other four base materials. The obtained R-squared value of 0. 81 indicates that the developed models have a desirable accuracy in the prediction of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties of UGMs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a laboratory experiment that aimed to characterize the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behavior of coarse grained soils. To evaluate the effects of the cyclic stress amplitude, initial mean stress, and initial stress ratio on the <b>permanent</b> axial <b>deformation,</b> six series of repeated load triaxial tests were performed. The results indicate that <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of coarse grained soils increased with increasing cyclic stress amplitude. In particular, for relative low cyclic stress levels, accumulation rate of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> decreased progressively with number of cycles and eventually reached an equilibrium state. The initial stress ratio was also found to obviously facilitate the buildup of axial deformation since it means higher deviatoric stress as the mean pressure kept constant. As the initial stress ratio was less than the slope of static failure line, the experimental results indicated that the increase of initial mean stress enhanced the capability of resisting deformation. A simplified mechanistic empirical prediction model was proposed, which predicted the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> as product of four independent functions about cyclic stress amplitude, initial mean stress, initial stress ratio, and number of load cycles.

40|$|Rutting is {{recognized}} {{to be the}} major distress mechanism in flexible pavements {{as a result of}} increase in tire pressures and axle loads. Rutting is caused by the accumulation of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> in all or some of the layers in the pavement structure. The accumulation of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> in the asphalt surfacing layer is now recognized to be the major component of rutting in flexible pavements. This is a consequence of increased tire pressures and axle loads, which subjects the asphalt surfacing layer nearest to the tire-pavement contact area to increased stresses. Thus the study of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties of asphalt mixtures has become the focus of research, which aim to mitigate or reduce rutting in flexible pavements. The research work reported in this thesis aims to contribute towards understanding of the material properties and factors affecting <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> in asphalt mixtures, mechanisms of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation,</b> and methods of its prediction. The specific objectives of this research work include; review and evaluation of available models for <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of asphalt concrete mixtures, investigation of the effect of volumetric composition, loading and temperature conditions on the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of asphalt concrete, and the identification and definition of simple measures of resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> To meet the objectives of the study a laboratory investigation is conducted on several asphalt concrete specimens with varying volumetric composition. Two testing procedures are adopted; the repeated load triaxial and triaxial creep and recovery tests. The tests were conducted at two temperature levels of 25 and 50 oC under varying stress conditions. A review of literature on factors affecting <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> and available models for prediction of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> is also conducted. The literature review indicated that most of the research work done so far concentrated on evaluation of the effect on <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> response of component material properties such as aggregate gradation, aggregate angularity and binder type (or grade). Most of the studies conducted on <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> properties of asphalt mixtures were also found to be based on different testing procedures and methods of evaluation, which makes it difficult to compare them and draw firm conclusions. The literature also indicated that, as yet, there is no comprehensive model for deformation of asphalt concrete. Results of tests conducted in this study are analysed to investigate the effect of volumetric composition, particularly binder content and void content, and loading conditions on the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> response of the mixture. Both the binder content and void content are found to significantly influence the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> characteristics. The effect of loading conditions, i. e., the confining stress and the deviatoric stress, is also found to be significant. Throughout this study emphasis is placed on methods and parameters that are used to evaluate mixtures for their resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> The traditionally used parameters such as the slope and intercept of the power model are evaluated for their sensitivities to changes in volumetric composition. This evaluation is based on the premises that any measure of resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> should be sensitive to changes in volumetric composition to be good enough. It is found that most of these parameters are not sensitive to changes in volumetric composition and therefore are not suitable for comparison of mixtures made from the same materials but with varying proportion of the components. <b>Permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> in asphalt concrete is caused by both densification and shear deformation. The mode of deformation in asphalt concrete pavements, for greater part of their service life, is considered to be the shear deformation. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate mixtures for their susceptibility to shear deformation. The shear deformation manifests itself in the form of large lateral deformation relative to axial deformation. It is found that one dimensional analysis, which does not take the lateral deformation into account may lead to misleading results regarding the resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of mixtures. Therefore parameters which include volumetric and lateral strain are proposed for use in evaluation of mixtures. Substantial effort is put into modelling the accumulation of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> under repeated loading. For this purpose two approaches were selected: the cyclic hardening model based on bounding surface plasticity concept and an elasto-viscoplastic model based on strain decomposition approach. The bounding surface plasticity approach is found to be a convenient method to model the accumulation of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> It is demonstrated that deformations calculated using cyclic hardening model based on bounding surface plasticity fits the measured deformation quite well. The elasto-viscoplastic model, which is based on strain decomposition approach, provides a suitable method for analysis of creep and recovery test results. Deformations calculated using this model also fit the measured deformation quite well. Finally a new composite measure of resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> is developed. The resistance index is based on strain decomposition approach and is simple to calculate. The index incorporates a parameter related to shear susceptibility of mixtures and is sensitive to changes in volumetric composition. It is believed that this index can be used to compare and select mixtures at mixture design stage. If its applicability to other materials is proved by further research, it can also be linked to performance related specifications, as a simple measure of performance with regard to rutting. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

Based on the sensitivity analysis of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> parameters, an objective function for network training is established by considering parameter sensitivity, which can improve the accuracy of parameter identification. By comparison, {{it is found that}} RBF outperforms the BP network in this problem. The proposed inverse analysis model for earth-rockfill dams can identify the seismic deformation parameters with just a small amount of sample designs, and much calculation time can be saved by this method...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} is a viscoelastic material {{consisting of}} aggregates, filler and bitumen. The response of asphalt concrete is {{highly dependent on}} temperature, loading rate and confining pressure. <b>Permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> {{is one of the}} most important distresses developing during the flexible pavement service life. The total deformation which is visible at the pavement surface is the sum of the deformation that developed in each and every layer. In this thesis however attention will only be paid to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of the asphalt layers. The main goal of this research was to investigate and better understand the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behaviour of asphalt mixtures at 50 Â°C which is a temperature that regularly occurs in asphalt wearing courses in the Netherlands and which therefore is applied in the Dutch standard for testing the resistance to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of wearing courses. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part focuses on sample preparation, testing procedures and fundamental properties of dense asphalt concrete (DAC) and porous asphalt concrete (PAC) mixtures and skeletons. In the second part the focus is on the prediction of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> In the first part of this research special attention was paid to the following aspects: Effects of end constraints on test results Friction between the ends of the specimen and the top and bottom loading platens introduces extra confinement at the top and bottom of the specimen. In this research an extensive monotonic compressive testing program was performed on DAC and PAC mixtures under two different end contact conditions being full friction and reduced friction. âFull frictionâ was achieved by gluing the specimen to the top and bottom loading platens. âReduced frictionâ was obtained by using a sandwich-shaped friction reduction system which consisted of two thin rubber sheets and vacuum grease in between. The results show that in the case of âfull frictionâ the failure stress is overestimated and the displacement at failure is underestimated. The results also show that in the case of uniaxial testing without confinement and when using the friction reduction system, a deformation correction is needed to obtain the true deformation of the specimen. When confining pressure is applied deformations due to the friction reduction system can be ignored. The stress-strain behaviour of asphalt mixtures The <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behaviour of asphalt mixtures is highly dependent on temperature, stress conditions and number of load repetitions. A better understanding of the stress-strain behaviour of asphalt mixtures is beneficial for a better understanding of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> Therefore an extensive monotonic compressive test program was conducted on DAC and PAC at 40 Â°C and 50 Â°C with 3 various confining pressures and 5 different loading rates. The test results showed that the stress-strain behaviour of DAC significantly depends on temperature, strain rate and confinement. The results also showed that at high temperatures the PAC mixture behaves much alike a granular material with little cohesion. In this case the skeleton of PAC plays a significant role in the mechanical behaviour and this behaviour is highly dependent on the level of confinement. Behaviour of aggregate skeletons <b>Permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> develops at elevated temperatures. At elevated temperatures, the contribution of the aggregate skeleton becomes crucial. For this reason monotonic compressive tests were conducted on DAC and PAC skeletons at two strain rates and two confining pressure levels. The stress-strain behaviour of the DAC and PAC skeleton were compared with the stress-strain behaviour of both mixtures. The results implied that the bituminous mastic in DAC acts as a binder and contributes to the behaviour of the DAC asphalt mixture. The results also showed that the PAC aggregate skeleton shows typical elastoplastic behaviour regardless of the strain rates. In the second part of this thesis repeated load triaxial tests to study the development of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> were performed on the DAC mixture at 50 Â°C and the following questions related to <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of the DAC mixture were discussed. Scatter observed in <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> results A power function was used to model the obtained <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> A large scatter in the model parameters was observed even at the same stress ratio for selected test specimens. The possible relation between the scatter on one hand and the air voids content and resilient modulus of specimens on the other was studied. CT scanning was used to investigate the internal structure of the intact and tested specimens. The results showed that there is no clear relationship between air voids and the parameters describing the development of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> with increasing number of load repetitions. The results also showed that the model parameters were stress dependent and a strong relationship was found between the model parameters and the resilient modulus after 1000 load repetitions. The CT scan results showed that different failure modes took place in the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> tests and that the internal structure of specimens is important for the development of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> It is believed that part of the scatter in the test results can be explained by the variation in internal structure. Influence of loading pattern on <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> The influence of different loading pulses and rest times on the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of DAC was also investigated by performing Triaxial Repeated Load <b>Permanent</b> <b>Deformation</b> (TRLPD) test. The tests were performed at two different loading patterns, being 0. 2 s load + 1. 8 s rest and 0. 4 s load + 0. 6 s rest, and at two confinement levels of 150 kPa with a stress ratio 0. 43 and 100 kPa with a stress ratio 0. 3. The results showed that the stress ratio has a significant influence on the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> while the loading time has little influence on the development of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> At the same stress level it seems that the longer loading time does not result in larger <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> Evolution of the resilient modulus in relation to the number of load repetitions In order to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between permanent strain and resilient strain which is developed in the DAC test specimens during the repeated load triaxial tests, the evolution of the resilient modulus of DAC with the number of load repetitions was investigated and modelled. The results showed that the resilient modulus of DAC reduced during the first load repetitions and tended to take a constant value after 1000 load repetitions. Evolution of Burgersâ model parameters in relation to the number of load repetitions The measured total strain was decomposed into elastic strain, delayed elastic strain and viscous permanent strain and modelled by means of the Burgersâ model. The evolution of Burgersâ model parameters obtained at two different loading patterns was investigated in this study. It was found that the value of the parameter representing the dashpot in series, used for modelling the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation,</b> increased with increasing number of load repetitions and tended to be constant after thousands of load repetitions. This value however strongly decreased when dilation of the specimen occurred. The loading pattern had a significant influence on the value of this viscous parameter Shake down limit in <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of DAC In order to explore the existence of a shakedown limit for the tested DAC mixture, five representative <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> tests were analyzed. From this analysis it appeared that below a stress ratio of 0. 3 (the ratio of applied vertical stress to vertical stress at failure at the same confinement level) only a limited amount of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> developed after a large number of load repetitions. The stress ratio of 0. 3 is proposed to be the shake down limit at 50 Â°C for the test conditions and DAC mixture used in this research. <b>Permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> modeling based on Dissipated Energy Concept Most of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> prediction models are simply relating <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> to stress conditions and the number of load repetitions. In this study a <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> model was developed based on dissipated energy. It was shown that the initial dissipate energy, the applied stress level and the number of load repetitions explain very well the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> development.

A testing and modeling framework has been established to develop a proper <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> prediction model, referred to herein as the UIUC rutting model, with number of load applications. According to the framework, the unbound aggregate shear strength properties are incorporated into the model using the ratio of the applied wheel load shear stress to the mobilized shear strength, i. e., the Shear Stress Ratio (SSR). This requires conducting repeated load <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> tests at SSR values of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 0. 75 to determine the trends in <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> accumulation.

40|$|AbstractIn thin {{flexible}} pavements, unbound aggregate {{layers and}} subgrade, contribute {{largely to the}} rut formation of the pavement system. Therefore, realistic prediction of surface rutting requires models that can reliably capture the cumulative plastic deformation of pavement unbound materials under repeated loads. Here four models were evaluated to capture the accumulation of <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of two fine grained subgrade materials. The models were modified based on the time hardening concept allowing them {{to be used in}} a multistage repeated load triaxial (RLT) test procedure, in which a single specimen is exposed to a series of consecutive stress paths of varying magnitudes. The RLT tests were conducted on two non-plastic silty sand subgrade soils with different fines content and at four different moisture contents. The used triaxial testing system was capable of controlling the pore-air and pore-water pressures of the specimen and therefore the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> tests were carried out with controlled matric suction of the soil samples throughout the test. An effective stress approach was therefore used in the modelling. Using the test data, the model parameters were determined using a parameter optimisation algorithm and the qualities of fits achieved was analysed and compared through goodness-of-fit statistics. In general, the four <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> models were found to work satisfactorily in capturing the accumulation of the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> of the tested subgrade materials. It was concluded that the multistage RLT test procedure has the potentials to be used for characterizing the <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behaviour of subgrade soils. This can considerably reduce the effort and time required for <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> characterization of subgrade materials...|$|R

40|$|The road {{pavement}} {{is a critical}} component of the transportation infrastructure. During the service life, the {{road pavement}} is continuously subjected to the loading caused by moving vehicles. A typical flexible pavement structure consists of the asphalt surface course and the underlying base and sub- base courses. The subgrade soil is the foundation of the pavement and the performance of the pavement significantly depends on the non-linear behaviour of the subgrade under the traffic loading. Therefore, an understanding of the behaviour of the subgrade soils would increase the confidence of pavement engineers in the design. Technically, under the traffic loading, the behaviour of the subgrade soils contains two parts, which are the resilient and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> In the laboratory, resilient and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> can be determined from the repeated load triaxial test. Inherently, it is a challenge to perform the repeated load triaxial test as a routine basic test due to the complicated, time-consuming and expensive procedure. Previous studies have reported the significant influence of the subgrade soil properties and loading conditions on the resilient and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation.</b> In this study, the resilient and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> behaviour of several fine-grained soils collected from various suburbs in Melbourne were studied. The effect of subgrade soil physical properties and stress conditions on the resilient modulus and <b>permanent</b> <b>deformation</b> for the experimental soils are examined and discussed in this paper...|$|R
