Parallel processing (<b>masked</b> <b>lithography)</b> and serial local probe processing (maskless lithography) {{have both been}} utilized to produce a range of structure shapes at different length scales. The AFM is operated in the electrical conductivity mode which induces oxidation on the DLC surface. The technique offers features with structure depths as small as 20 nm (serial processing) and pattern replication of many centimeters (parallel processing). Moreover parallel processed structures may be further modified via serial patterning using the same instrumentation. As a result, complex shapes can be produced with a depth being controlled by the DLC film thickness and/or by the bias voltage parameters.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the IC-compatible {{fabrication}} of vertically tapered optical layers for use in linear variable optical filters (LVOF). The taper angle is fully defined by a mask design. Only one <b>masked</b> <b>lithography</b> step is required for defining strips in a photoresist with trenches etched therein of a density varying {{along the length of}} the strip. In a subsequent reflow, this patterned photoresist is planarized, resulting in a strip with a local thickness defined by the initial layer thickness and the trench density at that position before reflow. Hence a taper can be flexibly programmed by the mask design to be from 0. 001 º to 0. 1 º, which enables the simultaneous fabrication of tapered layers of different taper angles. The 3 D pattern of resist structures is subsequently transferred into Si or SiO 2 by appropriate etching. Complete LVOF fabrication involves CMOS-compatible deposition of a lower dielectric mirror using a stack of dielectrics on the wafer, tapered layer formation and deposition of the top dielectric mirror. Design principle, processing and simulation results plus experimental validation of the technique on the profile in the resist and after transfer of the taper into Si and SiO 2 are presented.

40|$|Lightweight nano-network {{structures}} in polymers have been fabricated and investigated for their mechanical properties. Fabrication techniques via holographic interference <b>lithography</b> and phase <b>mask</b> <b>lithography</b> were implemented for periodic and quasiperiodic bicontinuous polymer-air structures on the submicrometer length scale. For 3 D quasiperiodically nanostructured materials, quasicrystalline phase <b>mask</b> <b>lithography</b> utilizing 2 D quasiperiodic phase mask was successfully employed. 2 D hexagonal arrays of air cylinders in SU 8 polymer films and 3 D four-beam connected (3 - R 3 m) and octagonal quasicrystalline SU 8 films were fabricated and analyzed in this thesis. For investigating the mechanical properties of various nano-network structures, three different methods of mechanical characterization were applied. Atomic force microscopy with its nanometer scale resolution was adopted to conduct force measurements to probe local elastic {{properties of the}} sample. Templated by the light intensity distribution from three-beam interference, the spatial distribution of elastic modulus was observed {{in the pattern of}} 2 D hexagonal air-cylinder and a uniform SU 8 polymer film by AFM nanoindentation. A second method for mechanical characterization, the microtensile tester enabled us to evaluate a symmetry effect on the elastic and plastic properties of the polymer fibers and thin films. Large plastic deformation of 200 nm-diameter struts comprising the 3 D periodic and quasiperiodic microframes of the normal brittle bulk polymer was discovered and is an example of length-scale dependent mechanical behavior. Crack propagation and energy absorption were guided along the symmetry directions in the periodic structures. However, there was found no preferred direction of crack propagation in quasicrystalline nanostructures due to the absence of translational symmetry. (cont.) The third method, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) allowed estimation of the phonon properties in the structured films and the associated mechanical properties. The BLS measurements also confirmed the isotropy of modulus with the symmetry of the structures. The length scale dependence, the effect of structural symmetry and the processing dependence of the mechanical behavior of the various nano{{structures in}} SU 8 polymer films were observed. The hundred-nanometer length scale of 3 D nanostructures induces plastic deformation of struts under an applied force, which makes the film tougher and energy absorbing. The symmetry of the structured films determines the preferred direction of crack propagation and following fracture behavior.

Thin anodized aluminum oxide nanomask was prepared by facile self-assembly technique without using polymer buffer layer, which was utilized as a direct-contact template for oxygen plasma etch to produce near-periodic, small-neck-width NPG. The NPG exhibits a homogeneous mesh structure {{with an average}} neck width as small as ~ 11  nm.

In the 1980 s industry changed over to projection <b>lithography.</b> However, <b>mask</b> aligners were never sorted out and still today hundreds of new mask aligners are sold each year. This continuing success of <b>mask</b> aligner <b>lithography</b> is due to two basic trends in lithography: (a) Costs for leading-edge lithography tools double approximately every 4. 4 years; and (b) the number of lithography steps per wafer was increasing from a few litho layers to more than 35 layers now. This explains why mask aligners, a very cost-effective solution for uncritical litho layers, are still widely used today. In over 50 years of semiconductor industry the mask aligner system has changed tremendously. However, only little effort was undertaken to improve the shadow printing process itself.
