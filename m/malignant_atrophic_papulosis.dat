40|$|AbstractMalignant atrophic papulosisis is a rare, multisystem obliterative vasculopathy {{of unknown}} etiology, {{occasionally}} involving the cranial nerve. We describe {{the first case}} of <b>malignant</b> <b>atrophic</b> papulosisis with cranial nerve and peripheral nerve involvement in China.

40|$|Background: In 2012, a nephrologist {{reported}} {{the development of}} a multiorgan thrombotic syndromic complex resembling thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in patients who were abusing long acting oxymorphone hydrochloride; all patients had hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Objective: Herein, we report another case involving a 31 -year-old woman who self intravenously administered dissolved oral oxymorphone resulting in thrombotic sequelae  resembling Degos disease. Methods: Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded skin biopsies were prepared according to standard protocols for H&E and immunohistochemistry. Results: The clinical presentation and biopsy findings were held to be indicative of  Degos disease/malignant <b>atrophic</b> <b>papulosis</b> (MAP) but with unusual clinical features including renal failure and severe respiratory insufficiency. Given the efficacy of eculizumab in the treatment of the acute thrombotic phase of Degos disease/MAP, the patient received this drug, resulting in rapid resolution of signs and symptoms associated with her multiorgan failure. Although she developed recurrent cutaneous ulcers despite complete complement inhibition with eculizumab., her other extracutaneous manifestations did not recur. The patient’s pre and post eculizuamb skin biopsies showed a striking pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy associated with marked endothelial cell injury along with deposits of C 3 d and C 4 d within the cutaneous vasculature; the C 5 b- 9 deposits were limited to the pre-eculizumab biopsy. We discovered that her syndromic complex was a self-inflicted one related to the localized administration of dissolved oxymorphone. Conclusion: Our patient’s biopsy along with the rapid response to eculizumab indicates that this distinct thrombotic microangiopathy is another complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy syndrome. Opioid thrombotic microangiopathy has a varied clinical presentation and can mimic other catastrophic microangiopathy syndromes, all of which have in common a responsiveness to complement inhibition...|$|R

40|$|The antiphospholipid {{antibodies}} (aPL), namely, the lupus anticoagulant and the anticardiolipin antibodies, are {{a family}} of autoantibodies directed predominantly against negatively charged phospholipids. Many studies have confirmed that patients with these antibodies are prone to repeated episodes of thrombosis, fetal losses, and thrombocytopenia. The association of aPL with these clinical events has been termed the antiphospholipid syndrome. Several skin lesions {{have been found in}} patients with this syndrome, including livedo reticularis, livedoid vasculitis, thrombophlebitis, cutaneous infarctions and gangrene of digits, ulcerations, lesions resembling vasculitis (nodules, macules), cutaneous necrosis/infarctions, subungual splinter hemorrhages, and, less commonly, discoid lupus and Degos' disease (<b>malignant</b> <b>atrophic</b> <b>papulosis).</b> In this article, we review the main immunologic and clinical aspects of this syndrome with special emphasis on the dermatologic features...|$|E

Papular biopsy revealed multiple microinfarcts in the dermal collagen. The brain showed multiple small haemorrhagic infarcts of both hemispheres, the lower mid-brain, pons and a cerebellar peduncle.

The most interesting fact in this disease is the benign appearance of cutaneous lesion, hiding the occlusion of skin and visceral vessels. The author reports the case of a female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus for eight years. During her follow up, generalized skin papules were observed on the trunk and limbs, sparing her face, hands and feet, compatible with Degos` disease. Additional. imaging investigation excluded systemic involvement of the disease. Treatment with acetylsalicylic acid prevented the appearance of new cutaneous manifestations and the patient remains clinically stable on the Outpatient Clinic without complications, until this moment. Malign atrophic papulosis is a rare disease with a poor prognosis.

40|$|Abstract Definition of {{the disease}} <b>Malignant</b> <b>atrophic</b> <b>papulosis</b> (MAP), {{described}} independently by Köhlmeier and Degos et al., is a rare, chronic, thrombo-obliterative vasculopathy characterized by papular skin lesions with central porcelain-white atrophy and surrounding teleangiectatic rim. Epidemiology Less than 200 cases have been described in the literature. The first manifestation of MAP usually occurs between the 20 th and 50 th year of life. Clinical description The cutaneous clinical picture is almost pathognomonic. The histology is not consistent {{but in most cases}} it shows a wedge-shaped connective tissue necrosis in the deep corium due to a thrombotic occlusion of the small arteries. In the systemic variant, manifestations mostly occur at the intestine and central nervous system. Etiology The etiopathogenesis {{of the disease}} remains unknown, a genetic predisposition may occur. Vasculitis, coagulopathy or primary dysfunction of the endothelial cells have been implicated. Diagnostic methods Diagnosis is only based on the characteristic skin lesions. Differrential diagnosis It depends on the clinical presentation of MAP, but systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases need to be considered. Management No effective treatment exists for the systemic manifestations, while compounds that facilitate blood perfusion have achieved a partial regression of the skin lesions in single cases. Prognosis An apparently idiopathic, monosymptomatic, cutaneous, benign variant and a progressive, visceral one with approx. 50 % lethality within 2 – 3 years have been reported. Systemic manifestations can develop years after the occurrence of skin lesions leading to bowel perforation and peritonitis, thrombosis of the cerebral arteries or massive intracerebral hemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, radiculopathy, myelitis. </p...|$|E
