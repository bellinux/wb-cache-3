British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux.

She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession.

Having marched north, taking Bolton and Liverpool along the way in two bloody assaults, Rupert then intervened in Yorkshire in two highly effective manoeuvres, in the first outwitting the enemy forces at Newark with speed; in the second, striking across country and approaching York from the north. Rupert then commanded much of the royalist army at its defeat at Marston Moor, with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> falling on the poor working relationship between Rupert and the Marquess of Newcastle, and orders from the King that wrongly conveyed a desperate need for a speedy success in the north.|$|E
5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (one of our main sources of this history).|$|E

5|$|The next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, {{resulted}} in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame.</b> The Williams–Gabe combination performed {{well on the}} left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and Dicky Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and Dicky David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making some ground, passed to Williams, who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a lineout to Wales on the Irish 25, {{resulted in}} Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed to Bush, who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball to Williams to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, {{and that of the}} forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Today, <b>the</b> {{credibility}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{international development}} community is increasingly being called into question. At <b>the</b> root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem are the extremely unequal nature <b>of</b> recent growth, <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, economic {{recession in the}} North, and <b>the</b> lacklustre record <b>of</b> foreign aid in reaching those left behind. By the 1990 s, <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> Sustainable Human Development (SHD) or what is sometimes called People-Centred Development (PCD) was being hailed as a possible framework for building a newly-invigorated system of international development cooperation based on genuine North-South partnership, holistic, equitable, participatory, empowering and sustainable development. This thesis explores the implementability and transformational potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SHD/PCD paradigm by analyzing how a multilateral development agency (UNDP) and an international NGO (Action Aid) put it into practice both globally and in Uganda. Its main argument is that despite both agencies' contributions to service-delivery and training, and their genuine efforts to reorient their work towards SHD/PCD approaches, {{in the final analysis}} neither UNDP or Action Aid realize the more transformative goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SHD/PCD agenda or seriously challenge the status quo. This is partly due to the excessively abstract, unfinished, ideologically confused and contradictory nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SHD/PCD paradigm itself, (i. e., the Baroque Science Phenomenon). However UNDP and Action Aid, both of which adopted SHD/PCD to enhance their profiles, must assume <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsibility <b>blame</b> for subordinating core SHD/PCD goals to their own organizational interests (i. e., the River Pollution Phenomenon). The thesis also demonstrates how both agencies undermine their effectiveness by making a series of fallacious assumptions about both poor communities' and their own catalytic potential in an effort to reconcile the gap between their agencies' SHD/PCD aspirations and the real-life constraints facing their goals...|$|R

40|$|In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain, a {{bacterial}} infection {{which we now}} know to be caused primarily by a streptococcus, was killing women in childbirth at an alarming rate. The disease, called puerperal, or childbed, fever, was being transmitted primarily from doctor to patient by a doctor’s unwashed hands and filthy, contaminated clothing and linens. Despite this evident and, in retrospect, obvious vector, <b>the</b> doctors <b>of</b> this period never discovered how to prevent their patients from dying a gruesome and painful death. Many physicians wrote extensive accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illness but often ended their works in despair, unable to find <b>the</b> cause. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical literature <b>blames</b> this befuddlement on personality traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physicians, arguing that egos and professional hostilities prevented <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> cooperation that could have led to progress. This study attempts to show that this failure was not a product of personalities but <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern physicians’ assumptions and logic. The assumptions were the stillpowerful, but often unnoticed, dictates about the human body handed down from ancient Greek medicine. The logical errors were a product of pre-scientific notions of definition, explanation, and evidence.

40|$|More {{and more}} SME’s, which create {{entrepreneurial}} spirit and innovation, which are {{primarily responsible for}} wealth and economic growth, are internationalizing. This increases their probability of business closure due to the increased risk they face from operating in foreign markets. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> U. S. financial excesses for these business closures, {{but at the same}} time there are also SME’s withdrawing activities from foreign markets in economic stable times. This indicates that there are more and other reasons for de-internationalization and raises <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> how do SME’s close their businesses in foreign markets. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study is to explore how the drivers and determinants <b>of</b> deinternationalization affect <b>the</b> form and <b>the</b> paths <b>of</b> de-internationalization for SME’s. The aim is to provide and contribute to a better understanding of deinternationalization. This was studied through developing four case studies with Dutch SME’s with a qualitative research approach. For empirical data collection interviews were conducted with the persons closely involved with <b>the</b> de-internationalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SME’s. This in combination with the developed theoretical framework, based on a theory discussion and synthesis, provided more insight into the de-internationalization topic. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this study show that a unique combination of drivers and determinants of de-internationalization is present in each case study and <b>the</b> relative influence <b>of</b> them differs. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> de-internationalization took place in a voluntary way, due to the nature and predictability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occurring drivers. Moreover, it was found that <b>the</b> drivers <b>of</b> de-internationalization combined with the determinants influence the form in which de-internationalization can take place. It was also found that <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> deinternationalization, which SME’s have chosen, determines <b>the</b> two paths <b>of</b> deinternationalization, which are partial divestment and full market exit. This study contributes to <b>the</b> better understanding <b>of</b> de-internationalization, by identifying the forms and paths which SME’s can choose when withdrawing activities in foreign markets. Moreover, the main drivers and determinants have been identified and it was analysed how they affect the different forms and paths of de-internationalization and this was conceptualized in a model. The recommendations are, that deinternationalization should be seen as a strategic option SME’s have and should be considered in corporate strategies. Therefore, the associations with this phenomenon could be seen (more) positive...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} several ambiguities in {{the social}} exclusion literature that fuel the common criticism that the concept is redundant with respect to already existing poverty approaches, particularly more multidimensional and processual approaches such as relative or capability deprivation. It is argued that these ambiguities arise {{from the fact that}} social exclusion is generally not differentiated from poverty, even though it is widely acknowledged that social exclusion can occur in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> poverty. In order to resolve these ambiguities, I propose a re-conceptualisation of social exclusion {{in a way that is}} not grounded with reference to norms and thus is not dependent on poverty for definition. Social exclusion is defined as structural, institutional or agentive processes of repulsion or obstruction. This definition is meant to give attention to processes of disadvantage (i. e. exclusionary processes), which can occur across a social hierarchy from any social position, rather than states of deprivation (i. e. the excluded) occurring at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a social hierarchy. I argue that this resolves most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contention surrounding the concept. However, it also requires making a decisive shift of analytical dimension and abandoning <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conceptual baggage that surrounds the term. In other words, if the social exclusion approach is to provide analytical value-added over and above the relative and capability deprivation approaches, it must be differentiated from poverty, thereby drawing attention to vertically-occurring processes that are not captured by <b>the</b> horizontal conceptualisation <b>of</b> poverty. This understanding is important because it corrects the common implicit tendency in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature to <b>blame</b> inequality-induced conflict on the poor, even though we know that conflict usually involves considerable elite participation. An understanding of exclusion that is not anchored in poverty is therefore an important step in theorising why the non-poor may also come to be aggrieved by rising inequality...|$|R
