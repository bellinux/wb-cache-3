40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{consider}} spheres {{corresponding to}} any norm function on the complex plane and their images under the <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations.</b> We {{see that the}} sphere preserving property is not an invariant characteristic property of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> except in the Euclidean case. Key words and phrases: <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations,</b> mapping properties of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rotations, [...] {{generate}} all of [...] and {{the composition}} {{rules of the}} <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> show that any composition of [...] translates to the corresponding composition of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations.</b> The <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> can be represented by matricessince a common factor of [...] cancels.|$|R
50|$|These <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> {{act as the}} isometries of {{the upper}} {{half-plane}} model of hyperbolic space, and the corresponding <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> of the disc are the hyperbolic isometries of the Poincaré disk model.|$|R
25|$|The three {{generating}} circles, {{and hence}} the entire construction, {{are determined by the}} location of the three points where they are tangent to one another. Since there is a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> which maps any three given points in the plane to any other three points, and since Möbius transformations preserve circles, then there is a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> which maps any two Apollonian gaskets to one another.|$|E
25|$|Thus a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> {{is always}} a {{bijective}} holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|These {{pictures}} {{illustrate the}} effect of a single <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation.</b> The one-parameter subgroup which it generates continuously moves points along the family of circular arcs suggested by the pictures.|$|E
2500|$|Exactly {{the same}} {{argument}} works for <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> on Rn and the open semigroup taking the closed unit sphere ||x|| ≤ 1 into the open unit sphere ||x|| < 1. The closure is a maximal proper semigroup {{in the group of}} all <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations.</b> When n = 1, the closure corresponds to <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> of the real line taking the closed interval [...] into itself.|$|R
5000|$|The same {{classification}} {{is used for}} SL(2,C) and PSL(2,C) (<b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations)</b> and PSL(2,R) (real <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations),</b> {{with the addition of}} [...] "loxodromic" [...] transformations corresponding to complex traces; analogous classifications are used elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|The orientation-preserving <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> {{form the}} {{connected}} {{component of the}} identity in the Möbius group.

25|$|The {{solutions}} of Beltrami's equation restrict to diffeomorphisms of {{the upper}} halfplane or unit disk if the coefficient μ has extra symmetry properties; since the two regions are related by a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> (the Cayley transform), the two cases are essentially the same.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{navigation}} by loxodrome or {{rhumb line}} {{refers to a}} path of constant bearing; the resulting path is a logarithmic spiral, similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> makes. See the geometric figures below.|$|E
25|$|Geometrically, a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> can be {{obtained}} by first performing stereographic projection from the plane to the unit two-sphere, rotating and moving the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then performing stereographic projection (from the new position of the sphere) to the plane.|$|E
50|$|In {{the article}} on <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations,</b> it is {{explained}} how this classification arises by considering the fixed points of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> in their action on the Riemann sphere, which corresponds here to null eigenspaces of restricted Lorentz transformations in their action on Minkowski spacetime.|$|R
5000|$|The orientation-preserving <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> {{form the}} {{connected}} {{component of the}} identity in the Möbius group.

40|$|A complex {{continued}} fraction {{can be represented}} by a sequence of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> {{in such a way}} that the {{continued fraction}} converges if and only if the sequence converges at the origin. The set of divergence of the sequence of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> is equivalent to the conical limit set from Kleinian group theory, and it is closely related to the Julia set from complex dynamics. We determine the Hausdorff dimensions of sets of divergence for sequences of <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformations</b> corresponding to certain important classes of continued fractions...|$|R
25|$|Note {{that there}} are {{precisely}} two matrices with unit determinant {{which can be used}} to represent any given <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation.</b> That is, SL(2,C) is a double cover of PSL(2,C). Since SL(2,C) is simply-connected it is the universal cover of the Möbius group. Therefore, the fundamental group of the Möbius group is Z2.|$|E
25|$|Möbius transformations {{can be more}} {{generally}} defined in spaces of dimension n>2 as the bijective conformal orientation-preserving maps from the n-sphere to the n-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to Liouville's theorem a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> can be expressed as a composition of translations, similarities, orthogonal transformations and inversions.|$|E
25|$|If we {{take the}} one-parameter {{subgroup}} generated by any elliptic <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation,</b> we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the same two points.

25|$|If {{we require}} the {{coefficients}} a, b, c, d of a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> to be integers with ad − bc = 1, we obtain the modular group PSL(2,Z), a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,R) {{important in the}} study of lattices in the complex plane, elliptic functions and elliptic curves. The discrete subgroups of PSL(2,R) are known as Fuchsian groups; they are important {{in the study of}} Riemann surfaces.|$|E
25|$|If we {{take the}} one-parameter {{subgroup}} generated by any hyperbolic <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation,</b> we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the same two points. All other points flow along a certain family of circular arcs away from the first fixed point and toward the second fixed point.

25|$|If {{the support}} is not compact the same trick {{used in the}} smooth case {{can be used to}} {{construct}} a solution in terms of two homeomorphisms associated to compactly supported Beltrami coefficients. Note that, because of the assumptions on the Beltrami coefficient, a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> of the extended complex plane can be applied to make the singular set of the Beltrami coefficient compact. In that case one of the homeomorphisms can be chosen to be a diffeomorphism.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Möbius transformations map {{generalized}} circles to generalized circles since circle inversion {{has this}} property. A generalized circle {{is either a}} circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, {{it does not necessarily}} map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.|$|E
25|$|If we {{take the}} one-parameter {{subgroup}} generated by any loxodromic <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation,</b> we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the same two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, away from the first fixed point and toward the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|The Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle packing theorem can be {{interpreted}} as providing another strengthening of Steinitz's theorem, that every 3-connected planar graph may be represented as a convex polyhedron {{in such a way that}} all of its edges are tangent to the same unit sphere. By performing a carefully chosen <b>Möbius</b> <b>transformation</b> of a circle packing before transforming it into a polyhedron, it is possible to find a polyhedral realization that realizes all the symmetries of the underlying graph, in the sense that every graph automorphism is a symmetry of the polyhedral realization. More generally, if G is a polyhedral graph and K is any smooth three-dimensional convex body, it is possible to find a polyhedral representation of G in which all edges are tangent to K.|$|E
