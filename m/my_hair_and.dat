On her thirtieth birthday, June 24, 2016, she stated that she completed A Seat at the Table, her third studio album {{three days before}} her birthday, on June 21, 2016. The album was released on September 30, 2016, to widespread critical acclaim. It became her first number-one album in the United States. This made her and Beyoncé the first sisters to have both had US number-one albums in a calendar year. On October 3, 2016, Knowles went on to release two music videos from A Seat at the Table: Don't Touch <b>my</b> <b>Hair</b> <b>and</b> Cranes in the Sky; both co-directed by herself and husband, Alan Ferguson.|$|E

But I was also aware that I had a huge {{responsibility}} {{to get it right}} and do justice to those suffering in real life. [...] Because Sam has chemotherapy, I was asked if I'd be willing to shave off <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> I said, [...] "Absolutely," [...] which is why I'm bald. I've also done a lot of research, and try hard to separate my character from my life off-screen, but I feel guilty {{that at the end of}} each day I can walk away from the illness, when many aren't so fortunate." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I {{had to go back to}} him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E

500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 28, 2016, on an AfterBuzz TV live stream, Scout Durwood {{said that}} MTV had a [...] "no {{appropriation}} policy" [...] that forbid her from wearing {{her hair in}} cornrows in an episode of Mary + Jane. She said, [...] "I wanted to cornrow <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> they were like, 'That's racist.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Video Games" [...] was {{directed}} and edited by Del Rey. It features video clips of skateboarders, cartoons and shots from old movies, {{as well as}} paparazzi footage of Paz de la Huerta falling down while intoxicated. These are interspersed with shots of Del Rey singing, which she filmed herself using a webcam. When asked if she would change anything about the video's production, Del Rey stated, [...] "Had I known {{so many people were}} going to watch the video, I'd have put some more effort into it. I would have got <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> make-up done and tried not to be so pouty, seeing as everyone talks about my face all the time. And I'd have put more of a storyline into it." [...] The singer also revealed that she was [...] "trying to look smart and well turned-out, rather than 'sexy' [...] Of course I wanted to look good, but 'smart' was the primary focus." ...|$|E

2500|$|McDaniel died {{of breast}} cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the {{hospital}} {{on the grounds of the}} Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, [...] "I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today.|$|E
2500|$|Miranda's creator, Colleen Ballinger, based the {{character}} partly on young women {{that she knew}} in the performance department of her college, Azusa Pacific University. She told The Times of London, [...] "There {{were a lot of}} cocky girls who thought they were really talented, and they ... were so rude and snotty, it drove me nuts. Then I saw all these girls trying to make a career out of putting videos on YouTube ... clueless {{to the fact that they}} were terrible." [...] Ballinger said: [...] "I thought it was so stupid, because I didn't think anybody got famous off of YouTube." [...] Also, when bored in choir class, Ballinger practiced singing slightly sharp or flat to amuse her friends. At first, the [...] "Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke" [...] among Ballinger's friends. Ballinger's YouTube channel received little traffic for more than a year, but in March 2009, she uploaded a video called [...] "Free Voice Lesson" [...] that quickly became a sensation. The video consists of advice to use, and demonstrations of, techniques that real voice teachers would warn students to avoid, delivered in Miranda's arrogant, off-key way. Miranda's videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, as many viewers mistakenly believed {{the character}} was a real person, a [...] "neo-Florence Foster Jenkins". As her videos became popular, Ballinger modified the character in response to the negative comments to make it more extreme, baiting the commenters by adopting the catchphrases [...] "Haters Back Off" [...] and [...] "Haters Make Me Famous". [...] "People would make fun of <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> I made it worse. ... I took what people hated and exaggerated it more in the next video." ...|$|E
