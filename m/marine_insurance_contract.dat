50|$|The Wilburn Boat Company brought suit {{in state}} court admitting to {{breaching}} {{the terms of the}} contract, but alleging that Texas law governed the terms of the <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> and as such Fireman’s Fund is still liable (Texas state statute provides that only in the event that the breach is the cause for the subsequent loss may the insured be barred from recovery). The case was removed to federal court under diversity jurisdiction where Fireman’s Fund argued that federal admiralty law governed and as such federal admiralty law requires strict compliance with terms of a <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> in order to recover on losses.|$|E

5000|$|The Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} Wilburn Boat has {{been subject to}} {{a great deal of}} criticism. Most critics of the {{decision}} argue that it was poorly reasoned and poorly articulated.

40|$|A <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is {{a contract}} of {{utmost good faith}} (uberrimae fidei), which requires the duty of disclosure prior to {{the conclusion of a}} contract. This is essentially stated in ss. 17 and 18 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906. Despite the 100 -year application of these provisions, the defects are shown and the injustice occurs. The voluminous case laws and their complexity suggest nothing else apart from that this area of law is highly problematic. The criticisms are essentially rested upon two grounds: (1) the material fact which rests upon the view of the ‘prudent insurer’ makes it difficult for the assured to determine for himself the fact to be disclosed (2) in case of non-disclosure, the remedy of avoidance applies regardless of culpability of the party in breach. As such, the reform to the law is inevitable and the purpose of this thesis is to suggest how reform can be achieved. Two possible ways to bring the change to the law are considered. These are (1) to adopt the alternative solutions identified in other jurisdictions or (2) to re-consider whether the law on duty of disclosure as has been recognised since the seminal judgment of Lord Mansfield in Carter v. Boehm (1766) 3 Burr. 1905 has been correctly applied. This thesis concludes that the judgment of Lord Mansfield has been misunderstood in the UK and that, to constitute non-disclosure, only the deliberate intention is required and that the remedy of avoidance is justifiable upon the public policy ground. Such duty should be based upon the broad notion of good faith (bonae fidei), a flexible concept of fairness and justice. In the end, the draft provisions are formulated to reflect these suggestions.

40|$|The {{conduct of}} Marine {{insurance}} broker {{is subject to}} the general principles of agency law. However, it is also affected by the traditional customs and contemporary market practices in the field of marine insurance. As a result, marine insurance broker’s duties and liabilities have unique features which are different or not that common for other general agents. Firstly, marine insurance brokers have duties that will not be observed by other general agents who effect a contract on behalf of their principal. For example, marine insurance broker has a personal liability to pay the premium under the <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> he obtained for the assured. Secondly, marine insurance broker’s multiple roles in the course of its business frequently raise the issue of conflict of duty and interest. Thirdly, the broker’s way of placing a cover makes it hard to put the line between the broker’s service of providing information and the service of providing advice. This is crucial for assessing the broker’s liabilities when he fails to obtain the cover for the assured. These exceptional features make marine insurance broker’s duties and liabilities a valuable topic for research. However, there is no scholarly monograph which specifically considers these matters. The thesis will examine whether the exceptional duties should be reformed to comply with the general law of contract and agency. If not, is there any reform that can be made to improve the clarity, certainty and fairness of these duties. The thesis will also identify the broker’s duties that are inclined to give rise to conflict of duty and interest and analyse how the issues are being treated by the court, and regulation authorities. Then the author will make recommendations on how to avoid the conflict of duties and interest. Finally, the thesis will discuss how the broker’s liabilities are being assessed and how the brokers can protect their own risks of extensive liability by inserting a limitation of liability clause in the retainer...|$|E
40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> {{were one}} of the most {{important}} categories of federal litigation in the early nineteenth century. The increase in international conflict resulted in a corresponding increase in the risk associated with maritime activity and the number of claims insurance companies litigated in an effort to minimize losses. Accordingly, a rich body of commercial law was developed by the federal courts in which the cases were tried. One such case was McCall v. <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company, in which the Supreme Court determined the impact of the addition of a single unusual word in the clause that set forth the risks protected against, employing principles of the law of nations as well as principles of contractual construction...|$|R
50|$|Maritime {{insurance}} was {{the earliest}} well-developed kind of insurance, with {{origins in the}} Greek and Roman maritime loan. Separate <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> were developed in Genoa and other Italian cities in the fourteenth century and spread to northern Europe. Premiums varied with intuitive estimates of the variable risk from seasons and pirates. Modern <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> law originated in the Lex mercatoria (law merchant). In 1601, a specialized chamber of assurance separate from the other Courts was established in England. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a centre for trade was increasing demand for <b>marine</b> <b>insurance.</b> In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house on Tower Street in London. It soon became a popular haunt for ship owners, merchants, and ships' captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} modern period mercantile custom and {{official}} law, the latter of which was imposed by legislators and applied by judges, did not differ very much. In {{the second half of}} the sixteenth century and in the seventeenth century merchants trading in Antwerp negotiated with the urban and royal authorities for official precepts in order to tackle the fraud endemic in <b>marine</b> <b>insurance.</b> In response to these developments and in light of innovations in <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts,</b> Antwerp’s leaders adapted their legislation and renewed their judgements. After a temporary shock to relations between the urban government and the merchant community of Antwerp in the early seventeenth century, a new equilibrium was sought and found after 1650. As a result, and as had been the case before 1600, condemnation of fraudulent practices and protection of contractual liberty went hand in hand once more...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the social and {{economic}} meaning of <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> between the late medieval and the modern society. Starting from the empirical analysis of one of the early <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> which were stipulated {{in the second half of}} the 14 th century, the hypothesis is suggested that the premium rate does coincide with the estimated average frequency of sea accidents. This rate is used to observe the future in the medium of probability for managing risk business. The main thesis then arises that insurance premium is a way of giving a certain price to the uncertainty of the future, and that it finally represents the costs of its observation. A comparison with the original function of money in primitive societies based on reciprocity is finally developed in order to clarify how time construction depends on social structures...|$|R

40|$|An <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> is {{one under}} which, for some considerations, the {{policyholder}} secures to himself some benefit upon {{the occurrence of}} an uncertain event beyond his own control and adverse to his interests by transferring {{some or all of}} the risk to the insurers. Thus according to the general principle of insurance: insurance is a commodity to protect against casualties and against unforeseeable losses. An issue arises where an unfit vessel is unable to encounter ordinary perils while at sea, and where such unfitness could have been avoided had the shipowner excised due diligence to make the vessel properly equipped, manned and maintained; the risk caused by the unfitness would be foreseeable and outside the scope of insurance in principle. Thus in <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts,</b> there are corresponding rules to prevent such certain risks. The practical significance for such rules is that the insurer can value the risk properly and adjust the premium accordingly without facing certain risks caused by substandard ships. Examinations on such rules under English and Norwegian jurisdiction will be presented in this paper. The United Kingdom is well known as the international market center of marine insurance; while on the other hand an extensive and far-reaching internationalization of the Norwegian <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> Market has been observed since the early 1980 s. A comparative look between the dominating English <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> market and the competitive Norwegian <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> market should in my opinion therefore be interesting...|$|R

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 An {{increase}} {{in international trade}} has resulted in an {{increase in}} the carriage of goods by sea, which has also promoted the business of <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> on a very huge scale. <b>Marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> fall within both the admiralty jurisdiction where admiralty laws apply and special contract law where the rules and principles of contract law apply.

There are certain principles under the law of contract that are said to be profound and cannot be ousted easily by substantive law. The principle of party autonomy is one of these principles and it has gained international recognition through a number of cases. However, to date, courts are faced with difficulties in deciding whether to uphold the choice of law on jurisdiction and governing law exercised by parties or resort to substantive law, either by virtue of admiralty law or any other statutes in a country, which provisions may be contrary to the clause on choice of law under the contract. In South Africa practice has shown that courts are always reluctant to apply the clause on choice of law if they believe such application is against the public policy and interest in South Africa. This begs the question as to the precise meaning and effect of “public policy and interest” and how this principle influences the long-standing and well-established principle of party autonomy in admiralty jurisdiction. This dissertation is aimed at providing a legal response to this problem by analysing case law and the different viewpoints of various writers. It is imperative to investigate if their decisions and views answer all the uncertainties with regard to the meaning and the effect of the concept of “public policy and interest” on the principle of party autonomy.
