40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} whether an accreditation program facilitates healthcare organizations (HCOs) to evolve and maintain high-performance {{human resource management}} (HRM) systems. Design. Cross-sectional multimethod study. Setting and participants. Healthcare organizations participating in the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards Evaluation and Quality Improvement Program (EQuIP 4) between 2007 and 2011. Main outcome measures. Ratings across the EQuIP 4 HRM criteria, a clinical performance <b>measure,</b> <b>surveyor</b> reports (HRM information) and interview data (opinions and experiences regarding HRM and accreditation). Results. Healthcare organizations identified as high performing on accreditation HRM criteria seek excellence primarily because of internal motivations linked to best practice. Participation in an accreditation program is a secondary and less significant influence. Notwithstanding, the accreditation program provides the HCO opportunity for internal and external review and assessment of their performance; the accreditation activities are reflective learning and feedback events. Conclusions. This study reveals that HCOs that pursue highly performing HRM systems use participation in an accreditation program as an opportunity. Their organizational mindset {{is to use the}} program as a tool by which to reflect and obtain feedback on their performance so to maintain or improve their management of staff and delivery of care. 6 page(s...|$|R

The Warren Commission had the angles from that window to the location of the President at frames 210 and 225 of the Zapruder film <b>measured</b> by <b>surveyors.</b> It was found that the downward angle from the horizontal was 21.57 degrees at frame 210, and 20.18 degrees at frame 225. The street sloped at 3.15 degrees (3° 9') away from the Depository. This would have made the angle through the President between 17 and 18.5 degrees, assuming the President was sitting upright in his seat.

50|$|One {{typically}} sees {{further along}} the Earth's curved surface {{than a simple}} geometric calculation allows for because of refraction error.

The reverse happens if the ground is hotter than the air above it, as often happens in deserts, producing mirages.

40|$|With {{approximately}} 2200 {{land surveying}} businesses in Australia service differentiation is increasingly {{focused on the}} implementation and use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a business enabler. However the surveying profession {{does not appear to}} be using the available tools to leverage their extensive spatial knowledge to the benefit of their clients and the local community. The aim of this project was to investigate the feasibility of value added spatial data services being provided by the private survey industry. The research approach looked at the experience of related industries, collecting information on a range of <b>measures</b> from <b>surveyors</b> through a questionnaire and analysing the results to develop appropriate conclusions and recommendations. Any issues raised in the questionnaire that appeared to indicate constraints on the surveyors ability to undertake these types of services were investigated to determine if the constraint could be relaxed or removed. All of this information was then compared with the academic and professional literature to draw out lessons for the industry, consider the impacts on the profession, look at the role of digital data in the community and consider any implementation issues with GIS. The project demonstrated that it is feasible for surveyors to implement GIS using the project toolbox model. However diffusion of GIS technology is not yet pervasive in the industry meaning the wider goal of demonstrating custodianship capability for the local community is not yet achievable. While there appear to be a number of constraints to implementation, they are predominantly within the control of the surveyor...|$|R
25|$|Surveying is {{the process}} by which a <b>surveyor</b> <b>measures</b> certain {{dimensions}} that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances.

Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface {{in the form of a}} map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.|$|R
40|$|Background: Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and {{transcription}} activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) {{have been}} successfully used to knock out endogenous genes in stem cell research. However, the deficiencies of current gene-based delivery systems may hamper the clinical application of these nucleases. A new delivery method that can improve the utility of these nucleases is needed. Results: In this study, we utilized a cell-penetrating peptide-based system for ZFN and TALEN delivery. Functional TAT-ZFN and TAT-TALEN proteins were generated by fusing the cell-penetrating TAT peptide to ZFN and TALEN, respectively. However, TAT-ZFN was difficult to purify in quantities sufficient for analysis in cell culture. Purified TAT-TALEN was able to penetrate cells and disrupt the gene encoding endogenous human chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR 5, a co-receptor for HIV- 1 entry into cells). Hypothermic treatment greatly enhanced the TAT-TALEN-mediated gene disruption efficiency. A 5 % modification rate was observed in human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (hiPSCs) treated with TAT-TALEN as <b>measured</b> by the <b>Surveyor</b> assay. Conclusions: TAT-TALEN protein-mediated gene disruption was applicable in hiPSCs and represents a promising technique for gene knockout in stem cells.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, {{together}} with scientists of other institutions and countries, {{began to develop}} the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60). The term datum as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent {{with a set of}} <b>surveyor's</b> <b>measures</b> of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of latitudes, longitudes, and elevations. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see physical geodesy). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.|$|R
50|$|A third remote {{method is}} called the sine-height method or ENTS method. It {{requires}} the use of a laser rangefinder and clinometer. In this method the distance {{to the top of a}} tree is directly <b>measured</b> by the <b>surveyor</b> using the laser rangefinder. The angle to the top is measured with the clinometer. The height of the tree top above eye level: = sine Θ of angle x distance to the top the same process is used to measure the extension of the base of the tree below or even above eye level. Since the measurement is along the hypotenuse of the right triangle and both the top and bottom triangles are independent, it doesn’t matter if the tree top is offset from the base as this does not affect the calculation. In addition the top branches of the tree can be scanned with the laser rangefinder to find which top is actually the tallest and the major error of misidentifying the top can be avoided. If the true top of the tree is misidentified the height measurement for the tree will simply be short by some amount, and will not be exaggerated. The height will be correct for the target being measured. With calibration, multiple shots, and a technique to deal with scales that read only to the nearest yard or meter, tree heights can typically be measured to within one foot using this methodology. Other measurement techniques include surveying with a transit and a total station, extended baseline method, the parallax method, and the three verticals method.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of salinity, temperature, {{phytoplankton}} biomass and speciation, dissolved nitrate, dimethylsulfide (DMS) in seawater and air, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), {{were made}} in the subantarctic zone of the Southern Ocean from 40 °- 54 °S, and 140 °- 153 °E during the southern hemisphere marine First Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE 1). DMSP concentrations were highest in subtropical convergence zone (STCZ) waters, intermediate in subantarctic waters, and lowest in polar waters. DMSP appeared to decrease at frontal regions between these major water masses. In subantarctic waters, high levels of DMSP were generally associated with an increase in dinoflagellate biomass and low microzooplankton grazing rates. Lower DMSP concentrations occurred in polar waters when the diatom biomass and grazing rates were high. DMS levels <b>measured</b> on Southern <b>Surveyor</b> ranged from not detectable (nd) to 5. 6 nM (mean 1. 7 nM), with below average levels in subantarctic waters (mean 1. 25 nM), and above average levels (mean = 1. 93 nM) in polar waters. Pulses of DMS occurred as Southern Surveyor traveled south into polar waters, with a large pulse (mean = 2. 3 nM) highlighted as the vessel traveled back into subantarctic waters (46 °- 47 °S, 148 °- 151 °E) in early December. By using the dissolved DMSP (DMSPd) to DMS ratio as an index of the bacterial conversion of DMSPd to DMS some evidence was found that, in polar waters, increased microzooplankton (MZP) grazing in diatom dominated waters, may lead to above average concentrations of DMS. This {{does not appear to be}} the case when the biomass was dominated by dinoflagellates in subantarctic waters...|$|R

Refractivity is proportional to neutral density at low altitudes and electron density at high altitudes, with a transition at ~ 75 km. We use weighted least squares to decompose zonal refractivity variations into amplitudes and phases for observed wave numbers k= 1 - 4 over the entire altitude range and use the results to analyze atmospheric structure and dynamics. The data set consists of 147 refractivity profiles acquired in December 2000 at summer solstice in the Martian northern hemisphere. The measurements are at an essentially fixed local time (sunrise) and at latitudes from 67 deg to 70 degN. Thermal tides appear {{to be responsible for}} much of the observed ionospheric structure from 80 to 220 km. Tides modulate the neutral density, which in turn, controls the height at which the ionosphere forms. The resulting longitude-dependent vertical displacement of the ionosphere generates distinctive structure in the fitted amplitudes, particularly at k= 3, within plusmn 50 km of the electron density peak height. Our k= 3 observations are consistent with an eastward propagating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1. Relative to previous results, our analysis extends the characterization of tides to altitudes well above and below the electron density peak. In the neutral atmosphere, refractivity variations from the surface to 50 km appear to arise from stationary Rossby waves. Upon examining the full vertical range, stationary waves appear to dominate altitudes below ~ 75 km, and thermal tides dominate altitudes above this transition region...|$|R

Mitigating the destructive impacts relies on identification and mapping, monitoring, and trajectory forecasting. Improvements in sensor capabilities are enabling airborne and space-based remote sensing to support response activities. Key applications are improving transport models in complex terrain and improved disaster response. Understanding urban atmospheric transport in the Los Angeles Basin, where topographic influences on transport patterns are significant, was improved by leveraging the Aliso Canyon leak as an atmospheric tracer.

Vertical profiles were collected by AMOG Surveyor by leveraging local topography for vertical profiling to identify the planetary boundary layer at ~ 700 m. Topography significantly constrained plume dispersion by up to a factor of two. The observed plume trajectory was used to validate satellite aerosol optical depth-inferred atmospheric transport, which suggested the plume first was driven offshore, but then veered back towards land. Numerical long-range transport model predictions confirm this interpretation. This study demonstrated a novel application of satellite aerosol remote sensing for disaster response...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study is {{preparing}} a landform classification by using digital elevation model (DEM) which has a high spatial resolution. To reach the mentioned aim, a sub-pixel spatial attraction model was used as a novel method for preparing DEM with a high spatial resolution in the north of Darab, Fars province, Iran. The sub-pixel attraction models convert the pixel into sub-pixels based on the neighboring pixels fraction values, which can only be attracted by a central pixel. Based on this approach, a mere maximum of eight neighboring pixels can be selected for calculating of the attraction value. In the mentioned model, other pixels are supposed to be far from the central pixel to receive any attraction. In the present study by using a sub-pixel attraction model, the spatial resolution of a DEM was increased. The design of the algorithm is accomplished by using a DEM with a spatial resolution of 30 m (the Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer; (ASTER)) and a 90 m (the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; (SRTM)). In the attraction model, scale factors of (S= 2, S= 3, and S= 4) with two neighboring methods of touching (T= 1) and quadrant (T= 2) are applied to the DEMs by using MATLAB software. The algorithm is evaluated by taking the best advantages of 487 sample points, which are <b>measured</b> by <b>surveyors.</b> The spatial attraction model with scale factor of (S= 2) gives better results compared to those scale factors which are greater than 2. Besides, the touching neighborhood method is turned to be more accurate than the quadrant method. In fact, dividing each pixel into more than two sub-pixels decreases the accuracy of the resulted DEM. On the other hand, in these cases DEM, is itself in charge of increasing the value of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and shows that attraction models could not be used for S which is greater than 2. Thus considering results, the proposed model is highly capable of increasing the spatial resolution of DEM (the new DEM with high spatial resolution). In the next step, in order to prepare the geomorphology map using topographic position index (TPI), the DEM with scale factor of (S= 2) was used, touching neighborhood serves as input. The landform classes were extracted by using TPI with the new DEM; consequently, the attraction model extraction showed details of landforms that make them more separable than the landform map prepared by utilizing the 90 m spatial resolution DEM. Moreover, the results showed that the landform of the 90 m spatial resolution DEM (S= 2, T= 2) and ASTER DEM 30 m were similar to each other, these results indicate a high accuracy of the proposed attraction model...|$|R
40|$|Background: Quality of life (QoL) of {{long term}} care {{facility}} (LTC) residents is being {{recognized as an}} important outcome of care by LTC providers, researchers, and policy makers. For residents, measurement of QoL is a valued opportunity to express {{their perception of the}} quality of their daily life in the LTC facility. For clinicians, self-reported QoL provides useful information in planning and implementing resident-centred care. Purpose: The purposes of this study were: (1) to examine the distributional and psychometric properties of the interRAI Self-Report Nursing Home Quality of Life Survey (interRAI_QoL Survey); and (2) to explore the relationship of selected socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of residents and LTC facility attributes with residents’ self-reported QoL. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional observational study. A convenience sample of 48 volunteer LTC facilities from six Canadian provinces was involved in this study. Nine hundred and twenty eight (928) residents agreed to participate in this study. Resident inclusion required an interRAI Cognitive Performance Scale score of 0 (intact) to 3 (moderate impairment). Residents’ self-reported QoL was <b>measured</b> by trained <b>surveyors</b> using the interRAI_QoL Survey instrument. Residents’ socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from the most recentResident Assessment Instrument –Minimum Data Set 2. 0 prior to the QoL interviews. LTC facility attributes were measured by a survey form specifically designed for this purpose. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participating LTC facilities, the sample of residents, and residents’ self-reported QoL. Psychometric tests for reliability (test-retest and internal consistency) and validity (content and convergent) were conducted. Bivariate analyses were conducted to examine the relatioships between QoL and resident and facility charateristics. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of residents’ QoL. Results: The study confirmed the feasibility of assessing LTC facility residents’ self-reported QoL. The findings showed positive ratings of some aspects of residents’ daily lives while negative ratings in other aspects. Psychometric tests showed that the interRAI_QoL Survey instrument had test-retest reliability, internal consistency, content validity and construct (convergent) validity. Several resident and facility characteristics were associated with self-reported QoL. Religiosity and highest education level attained were significantly and positively associated with QoL. Other resident characteristics such as age, gender and marital status were not. Mild cognitive impairment, depression, aggressive behaviour, hearing impairment, bowel and bladder incontinence, and extensive assistance in activities of daily living were significantly but negatively associated with QoL. LTC facility ownership showed significant association with QoL. Residents in municipal LTC facilities followed by private LTC facilities reported higer QoL in contrast to charitable LTC facilities. Profit status, accreditation and leadership stability were not associated with QoL. Residents in rural settings reported significantly higher QoL than those in urban settings. Facility size (measured in number of beds), registered nurse hours of care, nursing staff turnover, and ratios of registered to non-registered nursing staff did not have a significant association with QoL. However, higher management hours and total hours of care had significant and positive associations with residents’ overall QoL. Multiple linear regression showed that residents’ religiosity, degree of social engagement, post secondary education, dependence in activities of daily living, and positive global disposition, and LTC facilities situated in rural settings and ownership type together accounted for 24 % (adjusted R 2 = 0. 24) of the variance in overall QoL (the dependent variable). In logistic regression, low QoL was used as the binary dependent variable. Residents who were religious, were socially engaged and had a positive global disposition were less likely to report low QoL. In contrast, residents with dependence in activities of daily living and post secondary education {{were more likely to report}} low QoL. Residents in LTC facilities located in rural settings and operated by municipal or private operators were less likely to report low QoL compared to charitable facilities. Strengths and Limitations: This study had several strengths, including a sample of 928 residents who self-reported on their QoL and the use of RAI-MDS 2. 0 for objective, external indicators of QoL. This study had several limitations, including response bias due to method of sample selection, inability to draw causal inferences due to study design; limited generalizability due to use of a convenience sample, lack of monitoring of surveyors for the integrity of resident interviews, and exclusion of residents with cognitive performance scale scores of more than three or inability to communicate in English. Future research should address these limitations. As well, future research should conduct more stringent psychometric analyses such as factor analysis and use multi-level modeling procedures. Implications: The findings of this study have implications for improving residents’ QoL, LTC facility programming, future research, and social policy development. Conclusion: QoL can be measured from resident self-reports in LTC facilities. Self-reports from residents may be used by clinicians to plan and implement resident-centred care. There are significant associations of residents’ QoL with select resident socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and facility attributes. Some of these resident characteristics and facility attributes may serve as predictors of QoL...|$|R
