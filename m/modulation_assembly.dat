40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} delimits the cell, {{which is the}} basic unit of living organisms, and is also a privileged site for cell communication with the environment. Cell adhesion can occur through cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. Adhesion proteins such as integrins and cadherins also constitute receptors for inside-out and outside-in signaling within proteolipidic platforms. Adhesion molecule targeting and stabilization relies on specific features such as preferential segregation by the sub-membrane cytoskeleton meshwork and within membrane proteolipidic microdomains. This review presents {{an overview of the}} recent insights brought by the latest developments in microscopy, to unravel the molecular remodeling occurring at cell contacts. The dynamic aspect of cell adhesion was recently highlighted by super-resolution videomicroscopy, also named videonanoscopy. By circumventing the diffraction limit of light, nanoscopy has allowed the monitoring of molecular localization and behavior at the single-molecule level, on fixed and living cells. Accessing molecular-resolution details such as quantitatively monitoring components entering and leaving cell contacts by lateral diffusion and reversible association has revealed an unexpected plasticity. Adhesion structures can be highly specialized, such as focal adhesion in motile cells, as well as immune and neuronal synapses. Spatiotemporal reorganization of adhesion molecules, receptors and adaptors directly relates to structure/function <b>modulation.</b> <b>Assembly</b> of these supramolecular complexes is continuously balanced by dynamic events, remodeling adhesions on various timescales, notably by molecular conformation switches, lateral diffusion within the membrane and endo/exocytosis.

40|$|At low ionic strength, Acanthamoeba myosin-II polymerizes into bipolar minifilaments, {{consisting}} of eight molecules, that scatter {{about three times}} as much light as monomers. With this light scattering assay, we show that the critical concentration for assembly in 50 -mM KCl is less than 5 nM. Phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain over the range of 0. 7 to 3. 7 P per molecule has no effect on its KCl dependent assembly properties: the structure of the filaments, the extent of assembly, and the critical concentration for assembly are the same. Sucrose at a concentration above a few percent inhibits polymerization. Millimolar concentrations of MgCl 2 induce the lateral aggregation of fully formed minifilaments into thick filaments. Compared with dephosphorylated minifilaments, minifilaments of phosphorylated myosin have a lower tendency to aggregate laterally and require higher concentrations of MgCl 2 for maximal light scattering. Acidic pH also induces lateral aggregation, whereas basic pH leads to depolymerization of the myosin- II minifilaments. Under polymerizing conditions, millimolar concentrations of ATP only slightly decrease the light scattering of either phosphorylated or dephosphorylated myosin-II.

40|$|Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neuro-degenerative disorder affecting ∼ 1 % {{of people over}} the age of 65. Neuropathological hallmarks of PD are prominent loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and formation of intraneuronal protein inclusions termed Lewy bodies, composed mainly of α-synuclein (αSyn). Missense mutations in αSyn gene giving rise to production of degradation-resistant mutant proteins or multiplication of wild-type αSyn gene allele can cause rare inherited forms of PD. Therefore, the existence of abnormally high amount of αSyn protein is considered responsible for the DA neuronal death in PD. Normally, αSyn protein localizes to presynap-tic terminals of neuronal cells, regulating the neurotransmit-ter release through the <b>modulation</b> of <b>assembly</b> of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex. On the other hand, of note, pathological examina-tions on the recipient patients of fetal nigral transplants provided a prion-like cell-to-cell transmission hypothesis for abnormal αSyn. The extracellular αSyn fibrils can in-ternalize to the cells and enhance intracellular formation of protein inclusions, thereby reducing cell viability. These findings suggest that effective removal of abnormal species of αSyn in the extracellular space as well as intracellular compartments can be of therapeutic relevance. In this re-view, we will focus on αSyn-triggered neuronal cell death and provide possible disease-modifying therapies targeting abnormally accumulating αSyn...|$|R

40|$|<b>Modulation</b> of ribosomal <b>assembly</b> is a {{fine tuning}} {{mechanism}} for cell number and organ size control. Many ribosomal proteins undergo post-translational modification, but their exact roles remain elusive. Here, we report that ribosomal protein s 10 (RPS 10) is a novel substrate of an oncoprotein, protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT 5). We show that PRMT 5 interacts with RPS 10 and catalyzes its methylation at the Arg 158 and Arg 160 residues. The methylation of RPS 10 at Arg 158 and Arg 160 {{plays a role in}} the proper assembly of ribosomes, protein synthesis, and optimal cell proliferation. The RPS 10 -R 158 K/R 160 K mutant is not efficiently assembled into ribosomes and is unstable and prone to degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In nucleoli, RPS 10 interacts with nucleophosmin/B 23 and is predominantly concentrated in the granular component region, which is required for ribosome assembly. The RPS 10 methylation mutant interacts weakly with nucleophosmin/B 23 and fails to concentrate in the granular component region. Our results suggest that PRMT 5 is likely to regulate cell proliferation through the methylation of ribosome proteins, and thus reveal a novel mechanism for PRMT 5 in tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the role}} of the {{microtubule}}-binding domain of the tau protein in the <b>modulation</b> of microtubule <b>assembly</b> is widely established, other possible functions of this protein have been poorly investigated. We have analyzed the effect of adenovirally mediated expression of two fragments of the N-terminal portion - free of microtubule-binding domain - of the tau protein in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). We found that while the expression of the tau (1 - 230) fragment, as well as of full-length tau, inhibits the onset of apoptosis, the tau (1 - 44) fragment exerts a powerful toxic action on the same neurons. The antiapoptotic action of tau (1 - 230) is exerted at the level of Akt-mediated activation of the caspase cascade. On the other hand, the toxic action of the (1 - 44) fragment is not prevented by inhibitors of CGN apoptosis, but is fully inhibited by NMDA receptor antagonists. These findings point to a novel, physiological role of the N-terminal domain of tau, but also underlay that its possible proteolytic truncation mediated by apoptotic proteases may generate a highly toxic fragment that could contribute to neuronal death...|$|R

Although HS 1 contains a 37 -amino acid tandem repeat motif and a C-terminal Src homology 3 domain and {{is closely related to}} the cortical-actin-associated protein cortactin, it lacks the fourth repeat that {{has been shown to be}} essential for cortactin binding to filamentous actin (F-actin). In this study, we examined the possible role of HS 1 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that HS 1 co-localizes in the cytoplasm of cells with actin-related protein (Arp) 2 / 3 complex, the primary component of the cellular machinery responsible for de novo actin assembly. Furthermore, recombinant HS 1 binds directly to Arp 2 / 3 complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of 880 nM. Although HS 1 is a modest F-actin-binding protein with a K(d) of 400 nM, it increases the rate of the actin assembly mediated by Arp 2 / 3 complex, and promotes the formation of branched actin filaments induced by Arp 2 / 3 complex and a constitutively activated peptide of N-WASP (neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein).

40|$|AbstractControl of {{organelle}} abundance is {{a fundamental}} unsolved problem in cell biology. Mechanisms for number control have been proposed in which organelle assembly is actively increased or decreased to compensate for deviations from a set-point, but such phenomena have not been experimentally verified. In this report we examine the control of centriole copy number. We develop a simple scheme to represent organelle inheritance as a first-order Markov process and describe two figures of merit based on entropy and convergence times {{that can be used}} to evaluate performance of organelle number control systems. Using this approach we show that segregation of centrioles by the mitotic spindle can shape the specificity of the steady-state centriole number distribution but is neither necessary nor sufficient for stable restoration of centriole number following perturbations. We then present experimental evidence that living cells can restore correct centriole copy number following transient perturbation, revealing a homeostatic control system. We present evidence that correction occurs at the level of single cell divisions, does not require association of centrioles with the mitotic spindle, and involves <b>modulation</b> of centriole <b>assembly</b> as a function of centriole number during S-phase. Combining our experimental and modeling results, we identify two processes required for error correction, de novo assembly and number-limiting, and show that both processes contribute to robust and stable homeostatic control of centriole number, yielding a system capable of suppressing biological noise at the level of organelle abundance...|$|R
40|$|Activation of NLRP 3 inflammasome is {{important}} for effective host defense against invading pathogen. Together with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD domain (ASC), NLRP 3 induces the cleavage of caspase- 1 to facilitate the maturation of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), an important pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL- 1 β subsequently plays critical roles in inflammatory responses by activating immune cells and inducing many secondary pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although the role of NLRP 3 inflammasome in immune response is well defined, the mechanism underlying its assembly modulated by pathogen infection remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which enterovirus 71 (EV 71) facilitates the assembly of NLRP 3 inflammasome. Our results show that EV 71 induces production and secretion of IL- 1 β in macrophages and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) through activation of NLRP 3 inflammasome. EV 71 replication and protein synthesis are required for NLRP 3 -mediated activation of IL- 1 β. Interestingly, EV 71 3 D protein, a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was found to stimulate the activation of NLRP 3 inflammasome, the cleavage of pro-caspase- 1, and the release of IL- 1 β through direct binding to NLRP 3. More importantly, 3 D interacts with NLRP 3 to facilitate the assembly of inflammasome complex by forming a 3 D-NLRP 3 -ASC ring-like structure, resulting in the activation of IL- 1 β. These findings demonstrate a new role of 3 D as an important player in the activation of inflammatory response, and identify a novel mechanism underlying the <b>modulation</b> of inflammasome <b>assembly</b> and function induced by pathogen invasion...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A 40, 000 -dalton {{protein that}} affects the {{assembly}} properties of actin in a Ca t+-dependent manner has been purified from Dictyostelium discoideum. Gel filtration chromatography indicates that the native form of this protein is a monomer. A major effect of this protein {{is to reduce the}} sedimentability of F-actin in a stoichiometric fashion. Nearly complete loss of sedimentability is observed at ratios of the 40, 000 -dalton protein to actin of greater than 1 : 10. At low stoichiometries, this protein can accelerate the rate of actin assembly under certain experimental conditions. These effects of the 40, 000 -dalton protein on the actin assembly properties described above require calcium ion. The 40, 000 -dalton protein does not exert its effects by proteolyzing actin. Furthermore, peptide maps demonstrate that this protein is not a proteolytic fragment of actin. It has been clear {{for a number of years}} that the actin in nonmuscle cells is constantly being reorganized in response to functional demands such as endocytosis, locomotion, and cytokinesis (4, 8). It seems likely that these reorganizations occur via <b>modulations</b> of the <b>assembly</b> state of actin. Accordingly, many laboratories have embarked on a search for proteins that can be demonstrated to have an effect on the assembly properties of actin (3, 6, 7, 10 - 15, 22, 23). Anumber of such proteins have been found, including a category ofCa"-activated factors (17). We have been searching for such factors in amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum, an organism which has a number of advantages for biochemical, developmental, and genetic studies on motility (19).

40|$|The {{cytokine}} IL- 16 is a CD 4 ligand with proinflamatory, immunoregulatory and antiretroviral properties. Like {{many other}} cytokines, IL- 16 is synthesised as a precursor protein (pro-IL- 16) and processed by caspase- 3. Pro-IL- 16 is a 67 kDa protein expressed in {{cells of the}} immune system. Part of the amino terminal region comprises conserved SH 3 -binding domains and the C-terminal region contains three PDZ domains, one fragment of which forms the secreted IL- 16. The aim of this work was to identify additional interaction partners of pro-IL- 16, knowledge of which would allow the functions of pro-IL- 16 and IL- 16 to be further elucidated. Using YTH-screening, the closely related F-actin binding proteins HS 1, Abp 1, Lasp 1 and cortactin were shown {{to interact with the}} proline rich region of pro-IL- 16. The interaction between pro-IL- 16 and a further binding partner, the microtubulin binding protein Hook 3, was not investigated further. The interaction of HS 1, Abp 1, Lasp 1 and cortactin with pro-IL- 16 was verified using YTH specificity tests and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between HS 1 and pro-IL- 16. By substituting proline with alanine in both PXXP-motifs of the pro-IL- 16 proline-rich region and by cloning SH 3 deletion mutants, it was possible using in vitro binding assays to confirm the binding of the HS 1 protein SH 3 domain to the N-terminal PXXP motif of pro-IL- 16. The binding of endogenous IL- 16 to HS 1 was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The colocalisation of HS 1 and pro-IL- 16 and molecular complexes of the cytoskeleton was demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Because the interacting partners identified, HS 1, Abp 1, Lasp 1 and cortactin, are F-actin binding proteins involved in the <b>modulation</b> of actin <b>assembly,</b> the possible involvement of pro-IL- 16 in the organisation of the immunological synapse is under investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Tousled-like kinases are {{involved}} in chromatin assembly, DNA repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation. Previous evidence indicated that TLK 1 B can promote repair of plasmids with cohesive ends in vitro, but it was inferred that the mechanism was indirect and via chromatin assembly, mediated by its interaction with the chromatin assembly factor Asf 1. We recently identified Rad 9 as a substrate of TLK 1 B, and we presented evidence that the TLK 1 B-Rad 9 interaction plays some role in DSB repair. Hence the relative contribution of Asf 1 and Rad 9 to the protective effect of TLK 1 B in DSBs repair is not known. Using an adeno-HO-mediated cleavage system in MM 3 MG cells, we previously showed that overexpression of either TLK 1 B or a kinase-dead protein (KD) promoted repair and the assembly of Rad 9 in proximity of the DSB at early time points post-infection. This established {{that it is a}} chaperone activity of TLK 1 B and not directly the kinase activity that promotes recruitment of 9 - 1 - 1 to the DSB. However, the phosphorylation of Rad 9 (S 328) by TLK 1 B appeared important for mediating a cell cycle checkpoint, and thus, this phosphorylation of Rad 9 may have other effects on 9 - 1 - 1 functionality. Results Here we present direct evidence that TLK 1 B can promote repair of linearized plasmids with incompatible ends that require processing prior to ligation. Immunodepletion of Rad 9 indicated that Rad 9 was important for processing the ends preceding ligation, suggesting that the interaction of TLK 1 B with Rad 9 is a key mediator for this type of repair. Ligation of incompatible ends also required DNA-PK, as addition of wortmannin or immunodepletion of Ku 70 abrogated ligation. Depletion of Ku 70 prevented the ligation of the plasmid but did not affect stimulation of the fill-in of the ends by added TLK 1 B, which was attributed to Rad 9. From experiments with the HO-cleavage system, we now show that Rad 17, a subunit of the "clamp loader", associates normally with the DSB in KD-overexpressing cells. However, the subsequent release of Rad 17 and Rad 9 upon repair of the DSB was significantly slower in these cells compared to controls or cells expressing wt-TLK 1 B. Conclusions TLKs play important roles in DNA repair, not only by <b>modulation</b> of chromatin <b>assembly</b> via Asf 1, but also by a more direct function in processing the ends of a DSB via interaction with Rad 9. Inhibition of Rad 9 phosphorylation in KD-overexpressing cells may have consequences in signaling completion of the repair and cell cycle re-entry, and could explain a loss of viability from DSBs in these cells. </p...|$|R
