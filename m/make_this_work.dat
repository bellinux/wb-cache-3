Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line [...] "Let me tell you somethin' / Never / Have I ever / Been a size 10 in my whole life." [...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus.

500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> he sought Imogen Holst's advice.

2500|$|The 45RFE and 545RFE {{automatic}} transmission in the WJ was notable. It included three planetary gear sets {{rather than the}} two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, {{and it would have}} been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a [...] "4-speed automatic". In 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts.
