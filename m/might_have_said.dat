25|$|If {{someone had}} said {{just five years}} ago that black, white, young and old, {{straight}} and gay, liberal and anarchist would all be standing together giving a standing ovation to a police commander in Brixton, people <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> they had smoked one spliff too many.|$|E
25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to find out what he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E
500|$|The Court {{held that}} the report made by the prison medical officer was {{obviously}} a decision but that alone did not make him a [...] "decision-maker" [...] in the sense explained by Lord Diplock. This was because the officer's report that the appellant was fit for caning did not have legal effect– the District Court judge was duty bound to impose the sentence of caning irrespective of what the officer <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> in his report. Hence, {{it was not a}} case for judicial review at all. The Court also said that another example of non-decision-making conduct was a police officer arresting a person suspected of committing an offence.|$|E

2500|$|When Sousa Mendes issued these visas and {{thousands}} of others, it was a deliberate act of disobedience to the decree of an authoritarian dictatorship. [...] "Here was a unique act {{by a man who}} believed his religion imposed certain obligations," [...] said Paldiel. [...] "He said, 'I'm saving innocent lives,' as simply as he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'Come, walk with me in my garden.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, the {{axiom of choice}} was often used implicitly, {{although}} it {{had not yet been}} formally stated. For example, after having established that the set X contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "let F(s) be {{one of the members of}} s for all s in X." [...] In general, it is impossible to prove that F exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1908, Jeannette Huntington Riley {{noted in}} a letter written for {{a history of the}} Adriel Ely family that [...] "Orville Hungerford was a dignified and some <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> a cold, stern man; but to me, only a young girl, he was always {{exceedingly}} kind. I am always proud to say I had an uncle who went to Congress when it meant something!"

2500|$|After French refused {{permission}} to retreat, Smith-Dorrien noted (6 May 1915) that the planned counterattack {{was a complete}} failure with casualties higher than predicted by GHQ. Smith-Dorrien's eventual offer to resign (6 May) was ignored, and on that same day French used the 'pessimism' of the withdrawal recommendation {{as an excuse to}} sack him from command of Second Army altogether. [...] "Wully" [...] Robertson is said to have broken the news to him with the words [...] " [...] 'Orace, yer for 'ome [...] " [...] (Robertson was a former enlisted man who dropped his aitches), although by another account he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] " [...] 'Orace, yer thrown [...] " [...] (a cavalry metaphor).|$|E
2500|$|After {{two weeks}} of hearing {{witnesses}} and reviewing evidence, the Committee determined that the trial had been fair and a new trial was not warranted. They assessed the charges against Thayer as well. Their criticism, using words provided by Judge Grant, was direct: [...] "He ought not to have talked about the case off the bench, and doing so was a grave breach of judicial decorum." [...] But they also found some of the charges about his statements unbelievable or exaggerated, and they determined that anything he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> had {{no impact on the}} trial. The panel's reading of the trial transcript convinced them that Thayer [...] "tried to be scrupulously fair." [...] The Committee also reported that the trial jurors were almost unanimous in praising Thayer's conduct of the trial.|$|E
2500|$|Flynn in his 2007 book What Is Intelligence? further {{expanded}} on this theory. Environmental changes {{resulting from}} modernization— such as more intellectually demanding work, {{greater use of}} technology and smaller families— have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or a priori answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words 'dog' and 'rabbit' [...] ), whereas someone a century ago <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or a posteriori answer, which depended on what {{happened to be the}} case at that time).|$|E

2500|$|In November 2008, Clarkson {{attracted}} {{over 500}} complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. The BBC stated the comment was a comic rebuttal {{of a common}} misconception about lorry drivers and was within the viewer's expectation of Clarkson's Top Gear persona. Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006, wrote a [...] "strongly worded" [...] letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked. Clarkson dismissed Mole's comments in his Sunday Times column the following weekend, writing, [...] "There are {{more important things to}} worry about than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> on a crappy BBC2 motoring show." [...] Andrew Tinkler, chief executive of the Eddie Stobart Group, a major trucking company, stated that [...] "They were just having a laugh. It's the 21st century, let's get our sense of humour in line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Set in {{the rural}} Midwestern United States, {{including}} sections of Wisconsin, Iowa and South Dakota, Main-Travelled Roads offers a portrait of agrarian society. Garland's descriptive detail sheds light on the hardships of prairie life, contrasting {{the natural beauty of}} the land with the oppressive drudgery and economic hopelessness of farm existence. [...] Defined by harsh weather, squalid living conditions, intensive labor and heavy mortgages, the rural farm setting serves as a constant factor in every human drama in Garland's collection. [...] Garland casts aside the classic myth of the West as a place defined by [...] "bountiful free land" [...] and magnificent vistas. In [...] "Mrs. Ripley's Trip", Garland writes that [...] "poverty was a never-absent guest," [...] a description that holds true for most of the stories in the author's collection. [...] Describing a young man gazing over a valley of hills and wheat in [...] "The Return of the Private", Garland writes, [...] "An observer <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He is looking down upon his own grave"." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Knowles states: [...] "I was skinny {{up until}} {{about the second}} grade, when I started to bulk up. [...] Then I was the big kid. [...] I was tall, stocky, and they wanted me on the {{football}} team. Also, I was never ostracized as weird just because I was a film geek, because my parents would come to school and show 16mm films, or teach leatherworking and jewelry classes, which all the kids thought was cool[...] [...] [...] It {{never occurred to me}} that I was fat until the fifth grade, when a new kid at school started causing problems. [...] That's when Dad showed me José Ferrer as Cyrano de Bergerac; when someone hurls an insult at him, he says, 'Is that all? Ah, no, young sir, you're too simple. [...] You <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> a great many things. [...] Why waste your opportunity?' And then he names a score better than himself.

2500|$|When Darwin proved {{unable to}} persevere at medical studies, his father {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican parson. Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: [...] "from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say 'credo quia incredibile'. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. John Bird Sumner's Evidences of Christianity which set out the logic that the unbelief of sceptics gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either [...] "Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter." [...] The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had [...] "no right to deny" [...] that such events were probable. Jesus's religion was [...] "wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world" [...] and there was [...] "no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability." ...|$|E
