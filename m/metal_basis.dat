The transformation of molecular precursor to solid film {{begins with an}} understanding of molecular structure, proceeds through delivery of the molecule to the surface and ends with the decomposition of precursor on the surface to form a deposit. An understanding of the physical and chemical processes leading from molecule to film enables the utilization of chemical precursors in effective deposition processes. Single crystal X-ray crystallography was used to study the structure of [NO] 0. 5 [NO 2] 0. 5 [Zr(NO 3) 5] and [NO] 0. 5 [NO 2] 0. 5 [Hf(NO 3) 5]. Infrared spectroscopy was employed to identify the nature of the cation in the crystal structure, and characteristic absorptions of both nitronium and nitrosonium cations were observed. Fluidized bed reactor technology has been used to study the sublimation behavior of solid-state chemicals. Fluidization behavior, precursor mass transfer rates and delivery uniformity for aluminum trichloride were studied and the results reported. Mixed metal oxide nanolaminate films of hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide interspersed with layers of silicon oxide have been deposited on silicon substrates by a combinatorial atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. Exposure of repeated cycles of co-dosed alkoxide precursors Hf[OC(CH 3) 3] 4 and Zr[OC(CH 3) 3] 4 with counter-reactant pulses of Si[OC(CH 3) 3] 3 (OH) formed films of uniform thickness (± 5 %) and uniform silicon oxide concentration (85 % per total <b>metals</b> <b>basis).</b> The hafnium and zirconium concentrations exhibited smooth gradation across the film from 18 % - 82 % (per Hf and Zr <b>metals</b> <b>basis).</b> Self-limiting deposition rates of 1. 5 nm / cycle were measured, and a linear relationship of film thickness to number of deposition cycles was observed, both consistent with a true ALD process.

Single precursor depositions have been performed and compared to computational models created using CFD-ACE in order to further the understanding of the interaction of fluid dynamics and chemistry in the combinatorial chemical vapor deposition process.

Ligand basis sets of TZD quality or better are {{required in order to}} have a low BSSE (6 - 8 kJ/mol or less) for both the metal-ligand and the metal-metal bond. When the ligand s, p basis set is of double-ú quality, the BSSE is significant for the metal-ligand bond (16 - 22 kJ/mol depending on the polarization functions), but it is partly canceled by a basis set incompleteness error of opposite sign. For the metal-metal bond, the BSSE for DZ s, p ligand bases is unacceptably large (33 - 57 kJ/mol), leading to much too high bond energies if no correction for BSSE is applied. In general, the bond energies after correction for BSSE are rather stable. It is remarkable that for the metal-metal bond, but not for the metal-ligand bond, there is for all pure s, p ligand bases after correction for the BSSE a discernible basis set incompleteness error (ca. 15 kJ/mol), which only disappears after adding at least one polarization function.

40|$|Graphene {{growth at}} low {{temperatures}} (below 500 o C) on copper catalyst by CVD method was studied. The {{goal of this}} study is to determine a minimum growth temperature for growing graphene with high quality. In this study, the catalyst used for growing graphene was copper foil (Sigma-Aldrich, code: 1001328641, 25 µm in thickness, 99. 98 % trace <b>metals</b> <b>basis,</b> cut into 2 x 1 cm 2 in size)  annealed at 900 o C, while the precursor used was poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) heated at 140 o C. In graphene growth, two different growth temperatures of 350 o C and 450 o C were varied. The graphene films grown on copper foil catalyst were characterised using SEM and Raman spectroscopy. While, the films transferred onto quartz/glass/grid substrates were characterised by using SEM, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, four point probe and TEM. Results of this study showed that the 450 o C-grown samples produce a better quality graphene film compared to the 350 o C-grown samples. In other words, the minimum temperature of graphene growth is at least 450 o C for a Cu foil, since this temperature has to be sufficiently high to activate carbon diffusion and rearrangement on the catalyst surface [...] </p...|$|R
