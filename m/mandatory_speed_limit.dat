The upper house insisted on a [...] recommended limit until a thorough study of the effects of a mandatory limit could be conducted. Accordingly, the Federal Highway Research Institute conducted a multiple-year experiment, switching between mandatory and recommended limits on two test stretches of autobahn. In the final report issued in 1977, the Institute stated the <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> could reduce the autobahn death toll but there would be economic impacts, so a political decision had to be made due to the trade-offs involved. At that time, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit. The fatality rate trend on the German autobahn mirrored those of other nations' motorways that imposed a general speed limit.|$|E
50|$|The Richtgeschwindigkeit (German Advisory or Suggested Speed of Travel) is a {{legal term}} in Germany {{describing}} the advisory speed limit for roads without a <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> Autobahns (German plural form: Autobahnen) have an advisory speed limit of 130 km/h on non-signposted sections.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{advisory}} {{speed limits}} varies {{from country to}} country, but they are generally used to reduce speed along short stretches of dangerous road, such as on the tight curves of an off-ramp or on a busy shopping street. The advisory speed limit when not posted is generally {{the same as the}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in ideal conditions.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the above uses, the term 'regime change' {{can also be used}} in a more general sense, particularly in academic work, to refer to a change in political institutions or laws that affect the nature of the system as a whole. For example, the end of the Bretton Woods system was a regime change in the international system, as was the repeal of the National <b>Mandatory</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> in the United States. Regime changes are often viewed as ideal opportunities for natural experiments by social scientists.|$|E

The <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> along Quimpo Boulevard is 40 kilometer per hour (㎞/h) but her car was caught speeding at 57 ㎞/h. Sources stated that the traffic enforcers were at first hesitant upon seeing who they were apprehending but Sara insisted that they instead confiscate her driver’s license and fine her for violating the speed limit law.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{in charge}} of the RRL's traffic and safety division, Smeed's views on speeds and {{accidents}} were well reported {{at the time of the}} introduction of a <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on UK roads: [...] "If I wanted to stop all road accidents I would ban the car and introduce an overall speed limit, for there is no doubt that speed limits reduce accidents. Of course, roads with higher speeds often have lower accident rates. It is only on the safer, clear roads that you can drive fast - but that does not prove that you are driving more safely." ...|$|E
50|$|Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling, usually {{abbreviated}} to MIDAS, is a distributed network of traffic sensors, mainly inductive loops, (trialling {{at the moment}} radar technology by Wavetronix and magneto-resistive wireless sensors by Clearview Intelligence) which are designed to alert the local RCC (Regional Control Centre) to traffic flow and average speeds and in ATM (Active Traffic Management) zones, set variable message signs, advisory <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> along with <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in ATM sections with little human intervention. Companies such as RAC, TomTom and Google use this traffic flow data via halogens reporting systems.|$|R

In Germany, where significant sections to the Autobahn network do not have <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> the death rate on such highways was 1.74 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km, about half the U.S. rate for Interstate-type highways.

5000|$|The sump buster uses a non-mechanical solid mass of {{concrete}} (sometimes other aggregates or metal) to demobilise a vehicle when {{access to a}} restricted area is attempted. When (for instance) a car attempts to transverse the sump buster, the device will demolish the vehicle's oil pan (literally [...] "busting the sump"). The track (distance between wheels {{on either side of}} the vehicle) and ground clearance on permitted vehicles (usually, but not restricted to buses) is such that they may clear the device with ease. In some cases, advisory or <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are given.|$|R

5000|$|The M42 {{scheme was}} {{initially}} run {{as an experiment}} and a Highways Agency report into {{the first six months}} of the scheme showed a reduction in variability journey times of up to 27%. [...] The journey time statistics can be broken down to show that northbound journey times were reduced by 26%, equating to an average reduction of 4 minute as compared to the period when the variable <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> were on but the hard shoulder was not being used and 9% southbound (equating to 1 minute) during the afternoon rush hour. The report also indicated a fall in the number of accidents from over 5 a month to 1.5 per month on average. The Agency did state that normally accident statistics should be compared over a 3-year period, so the initial results should be treated with caution. They also stated that no accidents had been caused by hard shoulder use as a normal lane. The report also stated that there had been a 10% fall in pollution and 4% fall in fuel consumption. [...] The report also indicated a compliance rate of 98% to the indicated <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> when using the hard shoulder. [...] For comparison before the introduction of <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> at road works, the compliance rate was 10% as opposed to 89% afterwards, showing a similar effect.|$|R
50|$|Active Traffic Management (ATM) was {{launched}} {{as a pilot}} scheme on the M42 operating between junction 3a and 7 with <b>mandatory</b> variable <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> hard shoulder running, better driver information signs and a new incident management system. This system allows operators to open and close any lane to traffic {{in order to help}} manage congestion or an incident. Since it started in 2006 journey times have decreased by 26% northbound and 9% southbound and journey time variability has decreased by 27%. Due {{to the success of the}} trial this system was later extended northbound to junction 9 of the M42 (and onto the adjacent M6 to Junction 5) and southbound along the M40 to Junction 15 as part of the first phase of a nationwide roll out of the rebranded 'Managed motorways; concept.|$|R
40|$|Smart {{motorway}} schemes aim {{to address}} congestion issues and improve journey time reliability by utilising {{a set of}} advanced Intelligent Transport Systems applications and making use of the existing road space as much as possible. The M 42 Smart Motorway Pilot, introduced in September 2006 by the Highways Agency (known as Highways England since April 2015), established the concept of Hard Shoulder Running (HSR) {{for the first time}} in the UK, together with variable <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> during periods of congestion. Following the success of the Pilot, smart motorways are being rolled-out to other sections of Highways England’s strategic road network. This research has been carried out to understand the performance of smart motorways and its limiting factors. A review of the concept of highways capacity was carried out to understand the parameters that influence traffic conditions during smart motorway operations. This was followed by a series of analysis using empirical data which examined the performance of existing smart motorways schemes on the M 42 and M 6 motorways near Birmingham, UK. Overall, smart motorway schemes have significantly reduced average journey times and journey time variability, improved motorway capacity and smoothed traffic flow. The level of benefits observed varied from one scheme to another mainly due to the different site conditions (road geometry, traffic demand and patterns). However, each scheme consistently demonstrated considerable improvements when compared to non-smart motorway conditions. One of the aims of smart motorways is to improve the distribution of traffic between lanes. Examination of the data showed that hard shoulder utilisation increased with traffic demand, however, it was potentially underutilised and influenced by the proportion of traffic leaving at the next junction. A multivariate analysis was carried out to establish a model which described motorway capacity during smart motorway operations using various traffic parameters. The findings from this research can be applied to assist in the application of smart motorways both in and outside of the UK, to reduce wasted time for commuters, business trips and freight movement. It is recommended that the study is taken further with the newly introduced smart motorway schemes, which will include additional parameters such as local physical characteristics of the road (e. g. width, gradient, curvature) and the operation of All Lane Running...|$|R
30|$|Overall, as {{discussed}} above, cars {{at high speeds}} use more fuel than cars at intermediate speeds and thus cause more exhaust emission. Carslawa et al. [9] found for motorway-type roads an average savings in CO 2 of about 6  % when <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> control was used, compared with baseline conditions. For most other types of roads, speed control had very little effect on emissions of CO 2, {{and in some cases}} can result in increased emissions for urban roads with low <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Following Jules Bianchi's {{accident}} at the Japanese Grand Prix, the FIA {{announced plans to}} introduce a <b>mandatory</b> <b>speed</b> limiter to cars that could be remotely activated from Race Control {{in the event of}} a yellow flag. Labelled [...] "Virtual Safety Car" [...] (VSC), the system is an alternative to the use of an actual safety car and was first tested during practice at the United States Grand Prix. The system originally aimed at restricting drivers to a [...] <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> under specific yellow flag situations, following reports that Bianchi had been travelling at [...] when he left the circuit. Similar trials were conducted in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, with VSC ultimately being managed through specified sector (delta) times rather than a <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in affected sectors.|$|R
