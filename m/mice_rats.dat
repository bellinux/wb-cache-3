5|$|Species can be arboreal, fossorial (burrowing), or semiaquatic. Well-known rodents include <b>mice,</b> <b>rats,</b> squirrels, prairie dogs, porcupines, beavers, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils and capybaras.

5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, <b>mice,</b> <b>rats)</b> {{strongly}} reflects UV {{light and}} this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals, {{including}} the six most species-rich orders, {{belong to the}} placental group. The three largest orders in numbers of species are Rodentia: <b>mice,</b> <b>rats,</b> porcupines, beavers, capybaras and other gnawing mammals; Chiroptera: bats; and Soricomorpha: shrews, moles and solenodons. The next three biggest orders, depending on the biological classification scheme used, are the Primates {{including the}} apes, monkeys and lemurs; the Cetartiodactyla including whales and even-toed ungulates; and the Carnivora which includes cats, dogs, weasels, bears, seals and allies. According to Mammal Species of the World, 5,416 species were identified in 2006. These were grouped into 1,229 genera, 153 families and 29 orders. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) completed a five-year Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List, which counted 5,488 species.|$|E

5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, <b>mice,</b> <b>rats,</b> hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E

[URL] The species cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies infliximab, bevacizumab, and an anti-VEGF-B antibody, 2 H 10, {{in humans}} and rodents was determined. METHODS: The binding of infliximab to human, <b>mouse,</b> and <b>rat</b> TNF-α, of bevacizumab to human, <b>mouse,</b> and <b>rat</b> VEGF-A, {{and of the}} 2 H 10 antibody to human, <b>mouse,</b> and <b>rat</b> VEGF-B was evaluated by ELISA. The sequence of human, <b>mouse,</b> and <b>rat</b> TNF-α and VEGF-A at the binding sites for infliximab and bevacizumab were compared. RESULTS: Infliximab bound to human TNF-α, but no binding to <b>mouse</b> or <b>rat</b> TNF-α was detected between 10 pg/mL and 10 μg/ml. Sequence comparison of the binding site revealed four changes in mouse and five in rat TNF-α compared with human. Bevacizumab bound strongly to human VEGF-A, but showed 5 -log weaker binding to both <b>mouse</b> and <b>rat</b> VEGF-A. There was a single amino acid substitution in <b>mouse</b> and <b>rat</b> VEGF-A at the bevacizumab binding site. The 2 H 10 antibody displayed a similar binding profile to human, <b>mouse,</b> and <b>rat</b> VEGF-B. CONCLUSIONS: The species cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies should be determined prior to their use in preclinical animal models.

25|$|Although glucose {{is usually}} {{assumed to be}} the main energy source for living tissues, there are some {{indications}} that it is lactate, and not glucose, that is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species (the notable ones being <b>mice,</b> <b>rats,</b> and humans). According to the lactate-shuttle hypothesis, glial cells are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Because of this local metabolic activity of glial cells, the extracellular fluid immediately surrounding neurons strongly differs in composition from the blood or cerebro-spinal fluid, being much richer with lactate, as was found in microdialysis studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} {{carcinogenic}} to {{animals such as}} <b>mice,</b> <b>rats,</b> horses and cattle when ingested, although they will usually avoid it unless nothing else is available. Young stems are quite commonly used as a vegetable in China, Japan and Korea. However, some researchers suspect a link between consumption and higher stomach cancer rates. The spores have also been implicated as a carcinogen. Danish scientist Lars Holm Rasmussen released a study in 2004 showing that the carcinogenic compound in bracken, ptaquiloside or PTA, can leach from the plant into the water supply, which may explain {{an increase in the}} incidence of gastric and esophageal cancers in bracken-rich areas.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{expression}} profiles of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the intestine of <b>mouse,</b> <b>rat</b> and human. Total RNA was isolated from the duodenum and the mRNA expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide arrays. Detected genes from the intestine of <b>mouse,</b> <b>rat</b> and human were ca. 60 % of 22690 sequences, 40 % of 8739 and 47 % of 12559, respectively. Total genes of metabolizing enzymes subjected in this study were 95, 33 and 68 genes in <b>mouse,</b> <b>rat</b> and human, respectively.

Strong sexual dimorphism in the SMM changes with age was displayed by <b>mouse,</b> <b>rat,</b> and guinea pig, whereas the hamster and rabbit were statistically monomorphic. The <b>mouse,</b> <b>rat,</b> and hamster attain a maximal SMM at about 1 year of age, whereas in the guinea pig and rabbit the decrease in SMM starts after 2 years.
