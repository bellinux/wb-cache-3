40|$|As an {{alternative}} to force-feedback, vibrotactile feedback provides tactile information, with minimal cost and complexity. A prototype vibrotactile sensor and display was developed for a deep-sea manipulator. Vibrations were sensed with four strips of piezo-electric film embedded in a hard silicone rubber layer just beneath the jaw surface. An integrated vibration display was mounted onto {{the end of a}} modified master controller. The vibration display played the vibrations sensed at the jaw surface back to the human operator through two methods. The first shook a mass within the display providing a high frequency response. The second directly excited the fingertip pads through two paddles providing low frequency response. The system was tested underwater at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) both at sea while operators performed normal benthic tasks and in a test tank located onshore. For the tank, operators correctly identified the relative hardness of three blocks made of different materials [...] wood, aluminum and <b>machine</b> <b>wax.</b> <b>For</b> the first time MBARI operators were able to tactilely sense their deep-sea environment...|$|R

30|$|Development of {{suitable}} {{thermodynamic model}} is essential <b>for</b> <b>wax</b> investigation. Thermodynamic models are very useful and economical {{to predict the}} wax deposition conditions especially in places, where access to them is difficult and costly. In addition, experimental studies are time consuming and have considerable errors. Currently, two kinds of thermodynamic models <b>for</b> <b>wax</b> prediction exist {{that are based on}} flash calculations. These models are classified as multi-solid (MS) and solid solution (SS) thermodynamic models. In the SS approach, it is assumed that all components contribute in wax formation, and over-estimate the amount of the precipitated wax (Vafaie-Sefti et al. 2000). SS models use two different types of equation of state (EOS) and activity coefficients simultaneously for non-ideality description of the liquid state which makes these models, thermodynamically inconsistent (Rahimpour et al. 2013). However, MS model uses only EOS for non-ideality of phases in equilibrium. The MS model does not require any adjustable mixture parameters which makes it very simple and accurate in practice (Rahimpour et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There {{are various}} methods of ear wax {{extraction}} {{and there are}} no specific guidelines on this subject. Many times we ask patients to instil some <b>wax</b> softening product <b>for</b> a few days and revisit <b>for</b> <b>wax</b> removal. This revisits result in increased cost, discomfort and loss of time. We conducted this study to determine the effectiveness of same-day ear wax removal as an office procedure with one or more techniques. Our secondary objective was to find the association between various factors and successful wax removal. Methods: During the study period, all patients with ear wax managed by a single ENT surgeon were included. History and examination were done and findings noted. One or more methods including probe, forceps, hooks, curette, suction, wax softening with wax softening agents, syringing were applied <b>for</b> <b>wax</b> removal. Complete wax removal was noted as success. Results: There were a total of 63 cases of ear wax among 34 participants. Wax was successfully removed in 52 (82. 5...|$|R
40|$|Wax {{deposition}} in subsea pipelines {{is a significant}} economic issue in the petroleum industry. A mathematical model has been developed to predict the increase in both the deposit thickness and the wax fraction of the deposit using a fundamental analysis of the heat and mass transfer for laminar and turbulent flow conditions. It {{was found that the}} precipitation of wax in the oil is a competing phenomenon with deposition. Two existing approaches consider either no precipitation (the independent heat and mass transfer model) or instantaneous precipitation (the solubility model) and result in either an overprediction or an underprediction of deposit thickness. By accounting for the kinetics of wax precipitation of wax in the oil (the kinetic model), accurate predictions <b>for</b> <b>wax</b> deposition <b>for</b> both lab‐scale and pilot‐scale flow‐loop experiments with three different oils were achieved. Furthermore, this kinetic model <b>for</b> <b>wax</b> precipitation in the oil was used to compare field‐scale deposition predictions for different oils. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 201...|$|R
