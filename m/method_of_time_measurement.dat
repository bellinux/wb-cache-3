Our aim was also to estimate the quantity of fuel necessary to perform these operations as well as the CO 2 emission. Working’s day activity study was selected as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>measurement.</b> Data was collected from 8 clear-cuts during the logging of 327 m 3 of timber. On average, the most time-consuming operation was delimbing (26 % of total time). Felling took 15 % and bucking 18 % of total time. Breaks took up a significant proportion of time (10 % of total time), as well as technical maintenance, change of workplace and preparation of work-place that each took up 9 %. The average exploitation productivity of lumberjacks reached 7. 5 m 3 h- 1 and fuel consumption was 0. 14 l m- 3. Results on the duration of operational times confirm earlier research, however due to final felling conditions and large dimensions of trees fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2 were smaller than those given in the existing literature. The most time-consuming operation for coniferous was delimbing (Scots pine 29 %, Norway spruce 36 % of working time) and for the broadleaves it was bucking (silver birch 27 %, black alder 28 % of working time). Workers’ operational productivity depended on tree species and was the greatest in the case of Scots pine (15. 2 m 3 h- 1) and the smallest in the case of Norway spruce (6. 2 m 3 h- 1).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} digitally set delay lines in conjunction with MUTEX time comparison circuits, to measure on-chip signal path timing differences to accuracies of better than 10 ps.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of informal care into economic evaluations {{of health care}} is troublesome. The debate focuses on the valuation <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on informal caregiving, while <b>time</b> <b>measurement,</b> a related and may be even a more important issue, tends to be neglected. Valid <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> is {{a necessary condition for}} the valuation of informal care. In this paper, two <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> are compared and evaluated: the diary, which is considered the gold standard, and the recall method, which is applied more often. The main objective of this comparison is to explore the validity <b>of</b> the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on providing informal care. In addition, this paper gives empirical evidence regarding the measurement of joint production and the separation between 'normal' housework and additional housework due to the care demands of the care recipients. Finally, the test-retest stability for the recall method is assessed. A total of 199 persons giving informal care to a heterogeneous population of care recipients completed the diary and the recall questionnaire. Corrected for joint production, informal caregivers spent almost 5. 8 h a day on providing informal care. If one assumes that respondents take into account joint production when completing the recall questionnaire, the recall method is a valid instrument to measure time spent on providing informal care compared to the diary. Otherwise, the recall method is likely to overestimate the time spent on providing informal care. Moreover, the recall method proves to be unstable over time. This could be due to learning effects from completing a diary. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

Blood pressure (BP) measurements show heterogeneity depending on the <b>method</b> and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> sexual dimorphism and measurement errors, making genetic dissection difficult. Methods and results We studied 1550 adults aged 25 - 74 years, not on any antihypertensive treatment, resident in Monza, Italy (PAMELA study) {{all of whom had}} home, clinic and ambulatory BPs measured. We analysed 3705 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (1324 typed and 2381 imputed) across 168 genes for association with these traits. No SNP achieved an experiment wide significance level of P less than 3 x 10 (- 4) for any of the phenotypes studied. We selected 28 top candidate SNPs for further analysis of phenotypic heterogeneity and sexual dimorphism using a gene-centric strategy calculating empirical P values by permutations within each gene by including genic SNPs with an r(2) less than 0. 5. The association signals were not consistent across all the BP phenotypes, whether compared by genes or by physiological pathways. The top SNPs in WNK 1, ADRA 1 A, ADRA 1 B, DRD 1, NOS 1 and PON 3 showed significant sex interaction for BP and when analysed separately by sex showed evidence of dimorphism with opposite direction of effect for the same allele in the two sexes. Conclusion In the largest study of its kind, we show that sex and BP measurement methods {{have a significant impact on}} association signals. These findings might explain previous inconsistencies in studies on cardiovascular candidate genes and should have major implications for the design and interpretation of association studies.

40|$|The {{operational}} life of {{wireless sensor network}} based distributed sensing systems {{is limited by the}} energy provided by a portable battery pack. Owing to the inherently resource constrained nature of wireless sensor networks and nodes, a major research thrust in this field is the search for energy-aware <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> operation. Communication is among the most energy-intensive operations on a wireless device. It is therefore, the focus of our efforts to develop an energy-aware <b>method</b> <b>of</b> communication and to introduce a degree of reconfigurability to ensure autonomous operation of such devices. Given this background, three research tasks have been identified and investigated {{during the course of this}} research. 1) Devising an energy-efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> communication in a framework of reconfigurable operation: The dependence of the energy consumed during communication on the number of bits transmitted (and received) was identified from prior research work. A novel <b>method</b> <b>of</b> data compression was designed to exploit this dependence. This method uses the time-limited, orthonormal Walsh functions as basis functions for representing signals. The L 2 norm of this representation is utilized to further compress the signals. From Parseval’s relation, the square of the L 2 norm represents the energy content of a signal. The application of this theorem to our research makes it possible to use the L 2 norm as a control knob. The operation of this control knob makes it possible to optimize the number of terms required to represent signals. The time-limited nature of the Walsh functions was leveraged to inject dynamic behaviour into our coding method. This time-limited nature allows decomposition of finite time-segments, without attendant limitations like loss of resolution that are inherent to derived, discrete transforms like the discrete Fourier transform or the discrete time Fourier transform. This decomposition over successive, finite time-segments, coupled with innovative operation of the previously mentioned control knob on every segment, gives us a dynamic scaling technique. The amount of data to be transmitted is in turn based on the magnitude of the coefficients of decomposition of each time-segment, leading to the realization of a variable word length coding method. This dynamic coding method can identify evolving changes or events in the quantity being sensed. The coefficients of decomposition represent features present in successive time-segments of signals and therefore enable identification of evolving events. The ability to identify events as they occur enables the algorithm to react to events as they evolve in the system. In other words the data transmission and the associated energy consumption are imparted a reconfigurable, event-driven nature by implementation of the coding algorithm. Performance evaluation <b>of</b> this <b>method</b> via simulations on machine generated (bearing vibration) and biometric (electro-cardio gram) signals shows it be a viable method for energy-aware communication. 2) Developing a framework for reconfigurable triggering: A framework for completely autonomous triggering <b>of</b> the coding <b>method</b> has been developed. This is achieved by estimating correlations of the signal with the representative Walsh functions. The correlation coefficient of a signal segment with a Walsh function gives a picture of the amount of energy localized by the function. This information is used to autonomously tune the abovementioned control knob or, in more proper terms, the degree of thresholding used in compression. Evaluation of this framework on bearing vibration and electro-cardio gram signals has shown results consistent with those of previous simulations. 3) Devising a computationally compact <b>method</b> <b>of</b> feature classification: A <b>method</b> <b>of</b> investigating <b>time</b> series <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> dynamic systems in order to classify features buried in the signal measurements was investigated. The approach involves discretizing time-series measurements into strings of pre-defined symbols. These strings are transforms of the original time-series measurements and are a representation of the system dynamics. A <b>method</b> <b>of</b> statistically analyzing the symbol strings is presented and its efficacy is studied through representative simulations and experimental investigation of vibration signals recorded from a rolling bearing element. The method is computationally compact because it obviates the need for local signal processing tasks like denoising, detrending and amplification. Results indicate that the method can effectively classify deteriorating machine health, changing operating conditions and evolving defects.
