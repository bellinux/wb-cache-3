500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E

Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial—"Goldfaden has written better things"—he nonetheless acknowledges, [...] "that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted <b>my</b> <b>teeth.</b> I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... I thank you for the happiness you gave us... I thank you Shmendrick—my beloved—my own." ...|$|E

I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory." [...] Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, [...] "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits {{because this is what}} all actors want – something massive like this to sink <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> into.

500|$|The Baltimore Suns David Zurawik was {{critical}} of the show's characterization and comedy, but {{was impressed by the}} staging of [...] "Don't Stop Believin', calling it [...] "so elevating and inspirational that it almost redeems all the stereotypes and lame humor that come before. Grit <b>my</b> <b>teeth</b> as I did at how one-dimensionally empty-headed the writing could be, I will still be back for the start of this series in the fall because of its musical punch." [...] Tom Jicha for The Sun Sentinel similarly claimed of the episode that: [...] "A lively score and appealing performers somewhat compensate for overly familiar characters and plotting", while Rob Owen for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette agreed: [...] "It's the music that makes Glee a gleeful delight. Without the song-and-dance production numbers, this Fox pilot would be just another high-school-set comedy-drama." ...|$|E

Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in My Favorite Wife, a [...] "first rate comedy" [...] according to Life magazine, which became RKO's second biggest picture of the year, with profits of $505,000. [...] After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in the American Revolution-set The Howards of Virginia, which McCann considers to have been Grant's worst film and performance, his last film {{of the year was}} in the critically lauded romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story, in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn's character.

In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe. Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth.
