The data were subjected to analytical studies. Of the 388 participants who responded completely to both questionnaires, 172 (44. 3 %) had urinary incontinence; 143 were women (36. 9 %) and 29 men (7. 5 %). The mean age of the women was 46. 0 years (range 18. 0 to 76. 0) and that of men was 47. 5 years (range 22. 0 to 76. 0). Compared with continent participants, women and men with mixed urinary incontinence had a significantly higher IPSS severity (P = 0. 0002 and P = 0. 0014, respectively). In terms of contribution on QOL impairment, the women and men with mixed urinary incontinence considered it significantly more bothersome compared with continent participants (P = 0. 0004 and P = 0. 0003, respectively). These data showed that urinary incontinence was relatively common among apparently healthy women, but not men, and type of incontinence had a different impact on the degree of being bothersome in both sexes. 健康診断のために当院の健診センターを訪れた男女に, 国際前立腺症状スコア(IPSS) と生活の質の指標(IPSS-QI) および泌尿生殖器関連困窮度調査表(UDI- 6) を用いたアンケート調査を行い, 通常の日常生活を送っている人々における下部尿路症状(LUTS) と尿失禁症状の出現頻度, および尿失禁症状のLUTSとIPSS-QIに与える影響を検討した。対象となった 388 人の中, 172 人(44. 3 %) が何らかの尿失禁症状を有していた。その中 143 人が女性(36. 9 %) で, 29 人が男性(7. 5 %) であった。女性の平均年齢は 46. 0 歳, 男性の平均年齢は 47. 5 歳であった。尿禁制者に比べ, 混合性尿失禁を有する男女においてIPSS重篤度は有意に高く, 一方, 生活の質に及ぼす影響では, 混合性尿失禁を有する男女は, 尿禁制者に比べ有意に強い困窮度を訴えていた。得られた結果は, 尿失禁は通常の日常生活を送る女性においては, 男性とは異なり, 比較的ありふれた症状であり, また尿失禁の型は異なる困窮度を男女共に与えることを示していた。(著者抄録...|$|R

Commercially available dipsticks were used. The time from urine collection to dipstick analysis was within 60 minutes. The mean age of women was 48. 2 years (range 10 to 82) and that of men was 49. 9 years (range 7 to 89). Approximately 30. 1, 1. 5, and 0. 7 % of the women had hematuria, proteinuria, and hematoproteinuria, respectively; and 11. 4, 4. 0, 1. 5 % {{of the men had}} the corresponding urine abnormalities, respectively. Hematuria was 2. 6 times more common in women than in men, and proteinuria was 2. 7 times more common in men than in women. The positivity of hematuria increased linearly with age in women (Rs = 0. 943, P = 0. 0350). On the other hand, the positivity of proteinuria or hematoproteinuria was not correlated with age (P = 0. 8386 and P = 0. 0639, respectively). In men, the positivity of hematuria or hematoproteinuria was not correlated with age (P = 0. 0845 and P = 0. 0845, respectively). However, the positivity of proteinuria in those more than 30 -year age group increased linearly with age (Rs = 1. 000, P = 0. 0455).

40|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{evidence}} of the actual effects of general health screenings, it is still being discussed whether the screenings should be a public offer. There {{is a lack of}} scientific investigations concerning the influence of health screening on individual level over time, especially in relation to the screened people who have been cleared and the people who have declined the screening offer. Only few researchers have conducted detailed investigations regarding the individual’s underlying reasons for declining the screening and how it feels to be declared in or out of risk of illness. In this thesis I have explored understandings and experiences among those who were {{invited to participate in the}} Ebeltoft project – a <b>multiphasic</b> health <b>screening,</b> where among other things the participants’ cardiovascular risk score (CRS) was estimated. I have conducted three studies in order to investigate the following three aims 1) How do people with a high CRS identified in the screening, balance health related advice with the life they wish to lead or are able to lead? 2) How do people interpret and act after the screening has shown they are out of risk of a high CRS? 3) Which understandings and experiences can be found among the persons who declined participating in the screening offer? The empirical data are drawn from qualitative semistructured interviews with 14 screened persons, who from the Ebeltoft project were estimated to have a high CRS, 22 screened persons without a high CRS and 18 persons who declined the screening offer. The study is descriptive, analyzed with systematic text condensation and the interpretation is inspired by the Health Belief Model (HBM), Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy and Hollnagel & Malterud’s thoughts on shifting attention from risk factors to health resources. The analysis has demonstrated that a high CRS can give rise to alarm, shock, surprise, and hope (article I). The message of being out of CRS can give reason to relief, feels calming and reduce health worries (article II), while those who did not accept the offer of health screening feared that examinations and results could affect their health and happiness in a negative direction (article III). Among health screened people with a high CRS we found much differentiated conceptions on whether and how the result should have consequences, and several participants made extensive initiatives to change their lifestyle (article I). Participants without a high CRS had attached importance to the confirmation from the experts to their own feelings of being in good health and that their lifestyle therefore was acceptable and could proceed without changes (article II). In time and especially if the quality of life was highly compromised or if difficult circumstances in life arose, the initiated life changes could for those with a high CRS fade into the background (article I), while participants without a high CRS after some time no longer would give much thoughts to the screening results (article II). People who had declined to participate in the health screening, expressed that nevertheless most illness cannot be prevented and that oneself can do several things to prevent illness. They explained how they balanced their own evaluations of being healthy with consideration to the risk of illness caused by heredity or present lifestyle factors and the fear of what screening may give occasion for. Moreover they expressed that a doctor should be for the sick and old people and otherwise only when needed (article III). Practitioners can apply the results from this thesis to 1) be attentive to the emotional reactions that may occur from participating and that these reactions may be connected to the decline of such a screening offer, 2) know that screened persons with a high CRS have decided on the size of the life style changes, that screened people without a high CRS in accordance with the result feel healthy, but some may be unsure of their own body-feeling and lead a worrying lifestyle, that non screened persons attach importance to self-responsibility and 3) that initiatives and attitudes found within health screened people and the people who declined can be perceived as resources by looking at what the participants have succeeded in, focusing on what they can instead of what they lack to do. In general the findings indicate that it may be more important to add – that is to make use of the human beings’ own resources - instead of subtracting by looking for risks or weaknesses. </p...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Parity {{was found}} to be closely related to {{adiposity}} and prevalence of obesity in a population sample of 17 688 non-pregnant women aged 25 - 84. The women took part in <b>multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> examinations in various parts of Finland in 1966 - 72. The relationship between parity and obesity was independent of other factors such as geographical area, region, marital status, occupation, smoking habits, or incapacity for work. Pregnant women were considered to be an important target population for nutritional education. It is a common experience that the excess deposit of fat acquired during childbearing tends to remain {{for a long time after}} delivery. Parity may thus be an important determinant of obesity. We report here an association of parity with adiposity and prevalence of overweight in a large sample of Finnish women. Material and methods In 1966 - 72 the Social Insurance Institution's mobile clinic carried out <b>multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> examinations in 31 population groups in different parts of Finland. ' The main emphasis was on examinations for cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. Altogether 56 000 persons aged 15 or over were examined. The overall participation rate was 82 %. All the 17 688 non-pregnant women aged 25 - 84 were included in the present study. As part of the examination, weight and-height were measured. Obesity was defined as a Quetelet's index (weight/height 2) of 30 kg/M 2 or more. Other data were collected by a questionnaire, which was checked by a specially trained nurse. Parity was classified according to the total number of births by the time of the examination. Because both parity and prevalence of obesity were strongly age-dependent even within the 10 -year age groups, age-adjustment between the categories of parity was performed by analysis of covariance. Possible confounding by other factors was studied by analysis of covariance. The following variables were included: age (continuum); marital status (four groups); geographical area (six areas); region (rural, urban); occupation (nine groups) 2; smoking (never...|$|E

The question "Do you have difficulty seeing distant objects?" had a low sensitivity and high specificity, rendering it unsatisfactory for use in mass population screening for visual impairment.

40|$|<b>Multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} as one method of controlling access to the medical care system. The suggestion was probably {{based on the assumption}} that screening can identify most of the problems that would be found by the physician.

Forty-seven persons seeking employment were examined independently by both methods. Only 17 % of the conditions were identified in common by both screening and clinical evaluation. Twenty-six percent of the conditions were found by clinical evaluation alone and 57 % by screening alone. The study was replicated in a small group of clinic patients, with similar results. The two methods of patient evaluation appear to supplement each other rather than substitute for each other.

40|$|SETTING: The {{penitentiary system}} of the ex-USSR state of Georgia. OBJECTIVES: To measure the {{prevalence}} of active pulmonary tuberculosis and drug-resistant disease among prisoners. To identify factors associated with active tuberculosis and multidrug resistance (MDR). DESIGN: A comprehensive <b>multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> survey for tuberculosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis was 5995 per 100, 000 prisoners (n = 448 cases among 7473 inmates). Of all the strains, 215 (77. 9 %) were resistant {{to at least one}} drug and 37 (13. 0 %) were MDR. Independent risk markers associated smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis with included prison stay of 2 years or more, body mass index < 20 kg/m 2, accommodation in a large size prison, previous anti-tuberculosis treatment, cough of 2 weeks or more and loss of appetite. Risk markers associated with MDR were a prison stay of less than 2 years and being over 25 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In Georgia, the excess risk for tuberculosis among prisoners is unprecedented, suggesting that prisons represent a significant reservoir of tuberculosis. Only a comprehensive strategy for tuberculosis control in prisons, including prison reform, control of anti-tuberculosis drugs, and prompt and efficient diagnosis and treatment of patients can {{have an impact on the}} tuberculosis burden in the prison system...|$|E
40|$|Our aim in this {{observational}} {{study was to}} evaluate the feasibility of a <b>multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> project for the detection and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders among cancer patients in a natural setting. One hundred sixty-five patients with cancer, consecutively admitted to the Oncology Division of San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital, were recruited to the study. All patients had solid tumors; {{the majority of them}} were colon, breast, and lung cancers. All patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Patients screened as positive were administered the following instruments by a psychiatrist: the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and a validated scale for the rapid dimensional assessment of psychopathology (SVARAD). The BDI, HARS, and SVARAD were administered again at 4 and 10 weeks to all treated patients. Out of 45 patients administered the SCID-I, 37 had a mood or anxiety disorder. Adjustment disorders were identified in 20 patients, depressive disorders in 14, and anxiety disorders in three patients. Most patients were prescribed psychotropic medications: mirtazapine was prescribed to 15 patients, citalopram to 13 patients, and escitalopram to four patients. A significant improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety was observed on all measures (P<. 001). Although the design of the study prevents any firm conclusions about effectiveness, this study suggests that including psychiatric expertise in an oncology division is feasible and may lead to improved detection and treatment of psychiatric disorders among cancer patients.

There is considerable information on the prevalence of urinary abnormalities in out-patient clinics and in hospital wards (1 - 6). The presence of urinary abnormalities in asymptomatic children has also been examined (7 - 9). But there is little information on the prevalence of urinary abnormalities in the general (healthy) adult population. We report the results of simple (dipstick) examinations in about 21 000 (15 000 men and 6000 women) presumably healthy employed adults. The urinalysis {{was part of a}} comprehen-sive <b>multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> program described elsewhere (10, 11). Women make up only about one third of the subjects, a characteristic of the working population that was screened (12). However, the relative age distribution of both sexes is quite similar and close to that of working adults in Israel. Because we are dealing with employed groups, only about 4 % are over 65 years old and individuals younger than 20 years are not included...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE-To {{assess the}} risk of {{cardiorespiratory}} symptoms and mortality in non-smokers who were passively exposed to environmental smoke. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of cohort from general population first screened between 1972 and 1976 and followed up {{for an average of}} 11. 5 years, with linkage of data from participants in the same household. SETTING [...] Renfrew and Paisely, adjacent burghs in urban west Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 15, 399 Men and women (80 % of all those aged 45 - 64 resident in Renfrew or Paisley) comprised the original cohort; 7997 attended for <b>multiphasic</b> <b>screening</b> with a cohabitee. Passive smoking and control groups were defined {{on the basis of a}} lifelong non-smoking index case and whether the cohabitee had ever smoked or never smoked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Cardiorespiratory signs and symptoms and mortality. RESULTS [...] Each of the cardiorespiratory symptoms examined produced relative risks greater than 1. 0 (though none were significant) for passive smokers compared with controls. Adjusted forced expiratory volume in one second was significantly lower in passive smokers than controls. All cause mortality was higher in passive smokers than controls (rate ratio 1. 27 (95 % confidence interval 0. 95 to 1. 70)), as were all causes of death related to smoking (rate ratio 1. 30 (0. 91 to 1. 85] and mortality from lung cancer (rate ratio 2. 41 (0. 45 to 12. 83)) and ischaemic heart disease (rate ratio 2. 01 (1. 21 to 3. 35)). When passive smokers were divided into high and low exposure groups on the basis of the amount smoked by their cohabitees those highly exposed had higher rates of symptoms and death. CONCLUSION [...] Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke cannot be regarded as a safe involuntary habit...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to obtain information}} on the dietary intake of Oregon preschool children and {{to determine the effect}} of certain socio-environmental variables on the nutrient intake of these children. Three hundred boys and girls who were attending Well Child or <b>Multiphasic</b> <b>Screening</b> Clinics in 11 counties participated in this project. A home economist interviewed the parent to obtain the child's dietary intake and socio-environmental data of the family. Dietary intake was determined by 24 -hour recall or 3 -day records. Nutrient intake was compared to the 1974 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA); intakes below 67 percent of the RDA were considered low. Correlations of socio-environmental factors with nutrient intake were determined by simple linear regression and multiple regression analysis. The mean and median of the children's intake of vitamin A, exceeded the RDA. While the median of their niacin intake was just below the RDA, the mean and median of their iron intake was below the recommended level. Protein and riboflavin were consumed abundantly, with 0 and 3. 3 percent of the subjects, respectively, failing to receive two-thirds of the RDA. Sixty-three percent of the children ingested diets that supplied two to three times the RDA for protein. The nutrients most commonly lacking were iron, ascorbic acid, calcium and thiamin, with 39. 7, 18. 7, 15. 3, and 13. 0 percent, respectively, of the children having low intakes. Forty-one percent of the children received a nutrient supplement, which was not included in these calculations. The percentage of children consuming diets containing less than 67 percent of the RDA increased with age for the intakes of vitamin A, thiamin, and kilocalories. Low intakes of iron, on the other hand, declined with age. Riboflavin intake was lowest among the four- to six-year-old children. Adequacy of ascorbic acid, niacin and calcium did not show any relation to age. The socio-environmental variables examined were geographic location (urban, rural, or metropolitan), number of siblings as well as education and occupation of each parent. Other socio-environmental variables considered were whether or not the family received public assistance or had contact with the Cooperative Extension Service personnel and bulletins. When multiple regression analysis was ascorbic acid, thiamin, riboflavin, calcium, protein, and kilocalories performed, the only significant correlation (p < 0. 05) was observed between the intake of ascorbic acid, mother's education, and mother's profession. Four socio-environmental variables were significantly correlated (p < 0. 05) with the intake of one or more nutrients by simple linear regression. A significant correlation was found between mother's education and the intakes of ascorbic acid, calories, and thiamin. A significant correlation was observed between mother's profession and the intakes of niacin and ascorbic acid. Father's education was found to be significantly related to the intake of thiamin. The only significant, negative correlation was found between the intake of thiamin and the number of siblings...|$|E
