25|$|In 1983, Howard Gardner's Frames of Mind: The Theory of <b>Multiple</b> <b>Intelligences</b> {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} traditional types of intelligence, such as IQ, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He {{introduced the}} idea of <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligences</b> which included both interpersonal intelligence (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and intrapersonal intelligence (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).|$|E

This study believes that incorporating the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Intelligence</b> theory into learning materials is able to add more values towards the usability aspects of learning materials. In accordance, this paper aims at describing an attempt in designing a learning material that incorporates the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Intelligence.</b> In particular, the aims of the paper are (1) to suggest on how the elements of <b>Multiple</b> <b>Intelligence</b> could be incorporated into learning materials and (2) to outline the design and development of a sample of learning material that incorporates the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Intelligence.</b> User-centered design (UCD) approach is used as part of the methods in the design process, which involves three stages: (1) requirement gathering, (2) prototype development, and (3) user testing. This study involves children and teachers at kindergartens. As the results, an initial design of the learning material that incorporates the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Intelligence</b> is obtained and discussed in this paper at length...|$|R
40|$|The paper focused {{attention}} on comparing the effect of inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach and non-inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach on achievement of pupils in some selected primary schools. Two primary schools were selected purposively with one intact class from each school. Each intact class of thirty (30) pupils was randomly assigned to the two groups used for the study. A total of sixty (60) pupils {{were used in the}} study. The two groups were assigned each to the inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach group and the non- inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach group. The research design was a quasi-experimental design, involving a pretest and post-test in achievement of students. The reliability of the test instrument was established at 0. 75 which was considered adequate. A pretest- was administered to the pupils. The pupils were taught science concepts based on the curriculum of the ministry of education for a period of eight (8) weeks using the inquiry- based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach and non- inquiry <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach for group A and B respectively after which the post-test- was administered.. Findings using the statistical tools of mean, median, standard deviation the one way analysis of covariant (ANCOVA) were used to proffer answers to the generated research questions and hypotheses revealed that there was significant difference between the achievement scores of pupils in science for the use of non- inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach and non- inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach on. It was also statistically established that the effect of inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach was on achievement is science was better. Conclusion and recommendations such as introducing and enhancing the use of inquiry based <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> approach in primary and secondly schools were made...|$|R
25|$|Although {{theories}} of intelligence {{have been discussed}} by philosophers since Plato, intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident {{with the development of}} that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single factor known as general intelligence, multiple factors (e.g., Gardner's theory of <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligences),</b> or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the Stanford-Binet IQ test and the WISC are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as gifted are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as phonological awareness. In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality traits are also important, with people higher in conscientiousness and hope attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.|$|E

500|$|Harris and Graeme-Evans based {{the series}} around an {{underlying}} educational structure, primarily using Howard Gardner's Theory of <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligences.</b> It is recognised that each child learns {{in a different}} way, and each cast member has a specific segment within the show which targets a different aspect of learning, ranging from logical-mathematical thinking to a focus on linguistic skills, to cater to a child's individual learning approach. Harris observed that most viewers had a favourite cast member, believing that children generally [...] "respond more favourably to the presenter who models the learning style they prefer". The use of multiple segments is also designed to hold the attention span of young children. The skills of pre-numeracy and pre-literacy are a focus of the educational theory, to prepare children for learning at school, while also encouraging self-confidence and expression. According to the show's website, Hi-5 also uses Piaget's theory of cognitive development, providing a learning experience that promotes individual growth.|$|E

2500|$|In theory, {{individuals}} who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, {{and their ability to}} cooperate in order to work as part of a group.

[...] Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate." [...] Gardner has equated this with emotional intelligence of Goleman.|$|E
2500|$|Intelligence {{tests and}} psychometrics have {{generally}} found high correlations between {{different aspects of}} intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner's theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of general intelligence rather than <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligences</b> (MI). The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of empirical evidence, and its dependence on subjective judgement.. [...] However research by Dweck (2006), referred to as Growth Mindset Theory, shows that individuals with low correlations can attain also high correlations through intelligence growth. [...] This challenges the notion of fixed or static intelligence levels that general intelligence tests measure. More importantly, it challenges the notion that intelligence test scores are an accurate predictor for future ability.|$|E

Mathematics is {{a source}} of fear for many students and many struggle while learning mathematics. Most believe {{that they do not have}} the ability to learn mathematics and this perception decreases their motivation. The relationship between teaching and learning mathematics has been improved by integrating various approaches into the mathematics lessons. By 2000 s, <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> theory was taken into consideration as one such approach in Turkey. This study aimed to explore whether there was a correlation between 6 th grade students’ <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> types and their preferences of components of math lessons addressing <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> theory. The study was completed with fourteen 6 th grade students with ages ranging from 11 - 13 years at Ankara Bilkent Laboratory and International School, Turkey. In the first session of the study, students’ <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> types were identified by administering a <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> survey. Then several mathematics lesson activities based on <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> theory were implemented during 2 math lessons in block schedule to discover students’ preferences of learning mathematics. In the next session students were expected to describe how their learning was affected by classroom activities based on the <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligence</b> theory. Students reflected on which activities they liked and which activities were most effective by rating the activities in the given reflection forms. Students’ reflections and their personal intelligence types were correlated. It was found that bodily-kinesthetic intelligence was rated to be the most dominant intelligence among the participating 6 th grade students. However, lesson activities addressing linguistic and mathematical-logical intelligences correlated highest with students’ mathematical learning. Yılmaz, BegümM. S...|$|R

2500|$|The {{ideas on}} the zone of {{development}} were later developed {{in a number of}} psychological and educational theories and practices.

Grounded in developmental theories of Vygotsky and Feuerstein, who maintained that human beings are not static entities but are always in states of transition and transactional relationships with the world, dynamic assessment received also considerable support in the recent revisions of cognitive developmental theory by Joseph Campione, Ann Brown, and John D. Bransford and in theories of <b>multiple</b> <b>intelligences</b> by Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg.
