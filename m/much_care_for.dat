Although Kipling did not <b>much</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> his new house, whose design, he claimed, left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy, {{he managed to}} remain productive and socially active.|$|E
2500|$|As for Robert Southey, Byron satirised Southey's poem [...] "A Vision of Judgment"— which {{celebrates the}} late King George III's ascent to heaven—with his own The Vision of Judgment. Although Hazlitt {{says he does}} not <b>much</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Byron's satires (criticising {{especially}} the heavy-handedness of the early English Bards and Scotch Reviewers), he grants that [...] "the extravagance and license of [...] seems a proper antidote to the bigotry and narrowness of" [...] Southey's.|$|E
2500|$|Truman {{was stunned}} by the decision, which he {{continued}} to attack years later in his Memoirs. Justice Black was concerned enough that Truman would take the decision personally that he invited Truman and his fellow Justices to a party at his home. Truman, still smarting from the defeat, was mollified somewhat by Black's hospitality; as he told Black, [...] "Hugo, I don't <b>much</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> your law, but, by golly, this bourbon is good".|$|E

60|$|The senior bailie of Perth {{listened with}} {{surprise}} to the legend which it had pleased Gow to circulate; <b>for,</b> though not <b>much</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the matter, he had always doubted the bonnet maker's romancing account of his own exploits, which hereafter he must hold as in some degree orthodox.|$|R

[...] "I tell you, Mr. Easterfield," [...] he said presently, [...] "that I did not know until now how <b>much</b> I <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> that girl. I don't mind saying this to you because you come to me like a friend, and I believe in you. Yes, sir, I did not know how <b>much</b> I <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> her, and it is pretty hard on me to find out how little she <b>cares</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the highly}} {{contentious}} 1981 campaign, Mandanici {{was the target}} of death threats and wore a bulletproof vest while campaigning. According to one author, the election of 1981 was [...] "without question" [...] the [...] "wildest election" [...] in city history, a clash [...] "between two bombastic politicians with hard-charging styles"Mandanici and Paoletta"who did not <b>much</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> each other." [...] In that campaign, a car was firebombed outside the city Republican headquarters and two cars were blown up in Mandanici's driveway. Mandanici lost the election by just 64 votes. [...] His loss was attributed to the federal indictments as well as Mandanici's unpopular demand for a 50% pay raise, which the common council approved.|$|E
2500|$|Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker {{replaced}} Burnside on January 26, 1863. Stanton did not <b>much</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Hooker, who had loudly denounced Lincoln's administration, and {{had been}} insubordinate while serving under Burnside. He would have preferred for Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans to head the army; Lincoln disregarded Stanton's opinion. As Thomas and Hyman tell it, Lincoln [...] "chose Hooker because that general {{had a reputation as}} a fighter and stood higher in popular esteem at that moment than any other eastern general." [...] Hooker spent considerable time strengthening the Army of the Potomac, especially regarding morale. Hooker's first major engagement with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was the Battle of Chancellorsville in early May 1863. Lee had Thomas [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson engage Hooker's rearguard in a precipitous flanking maneuver. Stonewall Jackson's maneuver was skilfully employed, resulting a Confederate victory when the fighting ended on May 6, leaving 17,000 casualties.|$|E
2500|$|After another {{military}} {{conference in}} Santiago, Maroto, his wife, {{and most of}} the troops left for Valparaíso, from where they sailed to Peru. Pezuela, now the new viceroy, who still didn't <b>much</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Maroto, considered nonetheless that [...] "if perhaps he was not so skillful a commander in the unfortunate battle of Chacabuco, at the very least he performed with the valour and serenity expected of a Spaniard and an honourable officer," [...] for which he received due consideration. Maroto was then sent to Cuzco at the head of two companies from Talavera which had remained in Peru, with instructions to organize a new battalion. Unhappy with everything and everybody, on February 22, 1818 he was appointed President and Head of Government of the City and Province of Charcas, in Alto Perú, a village far removed from war, where he performed a notable administrative labor. After the 1820 Revolution in Spain, and once having received appropriate stipulation, Maroto proclaimed the Constitution in Charcas October 23, 1820. Four of his children were born and baptized in Charcas: Manuel María Rafael, María del Carmen Agustina, Margarita Antonia, and Justa María Mercedes Rufina. Rafael Abdón Ignacio, Víctor, Cándida, and Faustino were born later, the last the child of a maidservant with whom he had a relationship during his stay in [...] Asturias, and whom he did not initially acknowledge, but to whom he had to grant a pension following the accusation formulated by his mother.|$|E
