M-17 was joined by Bypass US 112 (BYPUS112) along the Willow Run Expressway to a southern freeway bypass of Ypsilanti. M-17 continued past the end of BYPUS112 at US112/Michigan Avenue along a two-lane highway to US23. It then followed US23 back to Washtenaw Avenue in Pittsfield Township to rejoin the original alignment of M-17 west to Ann Arbor.
