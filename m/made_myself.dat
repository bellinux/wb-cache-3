[...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{prolific}} {{during his}} short career, and {{now one of}} the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, [...] "I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> remember'd.

2500|$|Helen joined Benny Goodman in December 1939, {{with whom}} she {{recorded}} a number of celebrated songs, including the hit song [...] "The Man I Love." [...] Helen recorded 55 studio recordings with Goodman. She told the Pop Chronicles radio series: [...] "Benny would look right above your eyebrows, in the middle, {{right on top of}} the brow. He was a very strange man." [...] Forrest also stated, [...] "The band I joined was sensational, but few special arrangements were written for me. I sang choruses, and <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> fit to the music. Benny used to drive me crazy by 'noodling' behind me on clarinet while I sang." [...] Goodman was also reported to have been a perfectionist and a very difficult man to work with. In August 1941, Forrest quit the orchestra [...] "to avoid having a nervous breakdown". [...] After leaving Goodman, Forrest briefly recorded with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert gave Dune {{one star}} out of four, and wrote, [...] "This {{movie is a}} real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, {{pointless}} excursion into the murkier realms {{of one of the}} most confusing screenplays of all time." [...] Ebert added: [...] "The movie's plot will no doubt mean more to people who've read Herbert than to those who are walking in cold", and later named it [...] "the worst movie of the year." [...] On At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Ebert, Siskel began his review by saying [...] "it's physically ugly, it contains at least a dozen gory gross-out scenes, some of its special effects are cheap—surprisingly cheap because this film cost a reported $40–45 million—and its story is confusing beyond belief. In case I haven't <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> clear, I hated watching this film." [...] The film was later listed as the worst film of 1984 and the [...] "biggest disappointment of the year" [...] in their [...] "Stinkers of 1984" [...] episode. Other negative reviews focused on the same issues as well as on the length of the film.|$|E

2500|$|The Futuristic {{movement}} {{also influenced}} {{the concept of}} dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine. [...] The altitude of a flying plane, {{the power of a}} car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience. [...] The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian [...] Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her [...] "Aerodanze" [...] and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance {{as the result of a}} deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: [...] " [...] I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked and him who loves {{violence}} His soul hates," [...] bear on God's instruction in [...] "Take the Levites." [...] The Midrash taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous," [...] imply that God never raises a person to high rank before first testing and trying that person. If the person stands the trial, God raises the person to high rank. The Midrash found this {{to have been the}} case with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and so also with the tribe of Levi. The Midrash taught that the Levites devoted their lives to the sanctification of God's Name. When the Israelites were in Egypt, the Israelites rejected the Torah and circumcision, as implied by Ezekiel's rebuke of them in [...] "Thus says the Lord God: 'In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and <b>made</b> <b>Myself</b> known to them in the land of Egypt'"; and afterwards, [...] says, [...] "They rebelled against Me, and would not hearken to Me [...] [...] [...] then I said I would pour out My fury upon them." [...] So God brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and during that time God slew all the wicked Israelites, as [...] reports, [...] "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me." [...] The Levites, however, were all righteous and practiced the Torah; as [...] says, [...] "For they have observed Your word, and keep Your covenant." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] "covenant" [...] referred to circumcision, as [...] says, [...] "This is My covenant [...] [...] [...] every male among you shall be circumcised." [...] And the Midrash taught that when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, the Levites did not participate, as [...] says: [...] "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp [...] [...] [...] and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him." [...] When Moses told them in [...] "Put every man his sword upon his thigh," [...] they did so and respected no persons. Moses accordingly blessed them in [...] saying, [...] "Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him.'" [...] When God thus saw that the Levites were all righteous, and that they stood the test, as [...] says, [...] "Whom You did prove at Massah," [...] God decided, as reported in [...] "The Levites shall be mine." ...|$|E
