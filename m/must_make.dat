5|$|In {{the world}} of Hibiki's Magic, {{in order to gain}} magic one <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a sacrifice. It can be a {{physical}} sacrifice, such as Ahito experiencing pain, or a mental sacrifice, such as Shirotsuki losing his memories. Hibiki tries to help by making the sacrifices a little more bearable.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} chess were amended {{to make this}} clear. Today, it is settled that the player <b>must</b> <b>make</b> that move (or resign). The same is true if an enpassant capture is the only move {{to get out of}} check.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2012, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Wii U launch title Nintendo Land, which hosts Luigi's Ghost Mansion, a multiplayer minigame based on Luigi's Mansion. In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have to drain the energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, <b>must</b> <b>make</b> all the other players faint before time runs out.|$|E

5|$|BART hosts {{car sharing}} {{locations}} at many stations, a program pioneered by City CarShare. Riders can transfer from BART and complete their journeys by car. BART offers long-term airport parking through a third-party vendor at most East Bay stations. Travelers <b>must</b> <b>make</b> an on-line reservation {{in advance and}} pay the daily fee of $5 before they can leave their cars at the BART parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant <b>must</b> <b>make</b> the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They <b>must</b> <b>make</b> sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above the surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
5|$|The top scorer(s) in {{each game}} retain {{the value of}} their {{winnings}} in cash, and return to play in the next match. Non-winners receive consolation prizes. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant. Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who <b>must</b> <b>make</b> several flights to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E

5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation <b>must</b> <b>make</b> the set a group, and {{the second}} operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E
5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel <b>must</b> <b>make</b> Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator <b>must</b> <b>make</b> sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

5|$|During {{the trek}} towards the Black Sun, Cole is injured by {{entities}} and Ryan sacrifices his own safety to keep Jodie alive. Eventually, Jodie confronts Nathan near the Black Sun. He commits suicide to reunite with his family. As Jodie shuts down the condenser, {{she has a}} vision—Aiden is her stillborn twin brother. Jodie <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a choice: {{go back to the}} world of the living, or go on to the Infraworld and be reunited with everyone she has lost. By the story's end, the Infraworld has become a widespread threat in the not-so-distant future. Jodie prepares to confront the threat.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} 24, series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran executive-produced La Femme Nikita for its entire five-year run on USA Network. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, {{and the lead}} {{characters}} of both series are placed in situations in which they <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between 24 and La Femme Nikita. Several actors from La Femme Nikita have portrayed similar roles on 24, a number of story concepts from La Femme Nikita have been revisited on 24, {{and many of the}} creative personnel from La Femme Nikita worked on 24 in their same role.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it <b>must</b> <b>make</b> its meaning crystal clear.|$|E

5|$|Max {{is given}} the {{opportunity}} to go to San Francisco and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realizing that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by availing herself of the time travel abilities in the first place. The only way to prevent it is for Max {{to go back to the}} beginning and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay in order to spare Chloe.|$|E
5|$|PA 222 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-78/PA 309 {{in the community}} of Dorneyville in South Whitehall Township in Lehigh County, where the road continues southwest as US 222 towards Reading. From this interchange, PA 222 heads northeast on four-lane divided Hamilton Boulevard, passing between Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom to the north and businesses to the south. Direct access to Dorney Park is limited to PA 222 southbound, as northbound traffic <b>must</b> <b>make</b> a left turn onto Lincoln Avenue to access the park. After passing the amusement park, the route splits into two carriageways, with PA 222 north remaining on Hamilton Boulevard and PA 222 south following the newer Hamilton Boulevard Bypass to the north. A short distance to the east, the road intersects Cedar Crest Boulevard, a major northsouth arterial in the Allentown metropolitan area.|$|E
