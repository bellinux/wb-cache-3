40|$|A sensitive, fast, and stability-indicating isocratic reverse-phase ultra-performance liquid {{chromatography}} method {{was developed and}} validated for quantitative simultaneous determination of sodium <b>methylparaben,</b> <b>sodium</b> propylparaben and ketorolac tromethamine in topical dosage forms. Separation of all peaks was achieved by using acquity ethylene bridged hybrid C 18 (50 × 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 μ) as stationary phase, mobile phase used was triethylamine buffer (pH 2. 5) :tetrahydrofuran:methanol (665 : 35 : 300, v/v/v) with isocratic mode at a flow rate of 0. 40 ml/min. All component were detected at 252 nm with 10 min run time. The described method {{was found to be}} linear in the concentration range of 248 - 744 μg/ml for ketorolac tromethamine, 20. 8 - 62. 4 μg/ml for sodium methylparaben and 2. 38 - 7. 13 μg/ml for sodium propylparaben with correlation coefficients more than 0. 999. Method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, solution stability, filter equivalency, and robustness as per International Conference on Harmonization guideline. Formulation was exposed to the stress conditions of peroxide, acid, base, thermal, and photolytic degradation and proven all components were well separated in the presence of degradants...|$|E

40|$|Fungal {{activities}} of food additives, potassium sorbate, <b>methylparaben,</b> <b>sodium</b> benzoate, propylparaben, sorbic acid and plant activators harpin-protein and potassium dioxide were comparatively examined with ipradion in vitro conditions on two isolates of Botrytis cinerea obtained from strawberry fruits. Food additives and plant activators showed inhibitory effect {{at different levels}} on the mycelial growth of fungus isolates. According to the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC), sorbic acid (300 μg mL - 1 for each isolate) and comparison fungicide ipradion (10 μg mL - 1 for each isolate) displayed the highest inhibition effect on the radial mycelial growth of fungal isolates. Similar efficacy was obtained at the highest dose (1000 μg mL - 1) from other additives propylparaben (for both isolates), potassium sorbet and methylparaben (for isolate 1) and from plant activator potassium oxide. It was detected that all alternative substances has high inhibition activity according to ED 50 values. Methylparaben, harpin-protein and potassium oxide revealed efficacies similar to ipradion. While harpin-protein {{did not have any}} effect on B. Cinerea germination, other alternative substances excluding potassium sorbate inhibited germination completely at differing doses. Potassium oxide and food additives except potassium sorbate inhibited the spore germination of isolates by 50 % at doses between 25 - 345 μg mL - 1. MIC value of ipradion on spore germination of isolate- 1 and isolate- 2 was determined as 10 and 30 μg mL - 1, while ED 50 values were determined as 2. 9 and 12. 5 μg mL - 1, respectively. Data obtained from the research verified that food additives may be used in traditional and organic agriculture individually, or in appropriate combination with each other or with fungicides. Moreover, the study put forth that harpin-protein and potassium oxide not only activate plants against pathogens, but they may also have toxic effect on different growth periods of fungus. Although ipradion works only with two isolates, its MIC and ED 50 values were considered noteworthy in terms of the resistance risk of B. cinerea...|$|E
