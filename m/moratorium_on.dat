5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev came {{to power}} in the Soviet Union on March 11, 1985, and the next day {{negotiations}} on nuclear and space-based weapons began in Geneva. A few weeks later, he proposed a <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> the development of nuclear and space weapons during the period of negotiations, and in July, he proposed to ban nuclear testing. Reagan rejected the proposals.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} legislation to place a one-year <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new Colorado health insurance mandates with independent Rep. Kathleen Curry, {{as part of a}} proposal to overhaul the states insurance mandate commission. However, they announced {{at the start of the}} session that their proposal would not include an immediate <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> insurance mandates, and the legislation was killed on its first hearing in a House committee. Roberts also withdrew one of her proposals to continue a pilot program for training of Certified Nursing Assistants, on account of its cost. Roberts also sponsored a contentious piece of legislation with general election opponent Sen. Bruce Whitehead, negotiated by Governor Ritter's office, to require utilities to convert some Front Range coal-fired power plants to natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The IWC {{has set a}} {{quota of}} 19 fin whales per year for Greenland. Meat and other {{products}} from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within Greenland, but export is illegal. Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC's <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> commercial whaling because both countries filed objections to it.|$|E

5|$|The {{parliament}} of Croatia declared Croatia's {{independence and}} dissolved {{its association with}} Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. The Croatian parliament's decision was partially boycotted by left-wing parliament deputies.

5|$|Dewey's {{obituary}} ran in over 270 {{national and}} international newspapers and his death was announced on Japanese television. A public memorial service was held in December 2006 and his cremated remains were buried outside of the library. Despite numerous offers, the library placed a two-year <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> getting a new cat. In January 2009, the library board voted to have a permanent prohibition against any other cats or pets at the library, to avoid problems for patrons with allergies.|$|E

50|$|In November 2013, {{voters in}} three Colorado cities (Boulder, Fort Collins, and Loveland) {{approved}} ballot initiatives to impose or extend <b>moratoria</b> <b>on</b> hydraulic fracturing. At the same time, Broomfield voters narrowly defeated an anti-fracking initiative.|$|R
5|$|The {{international}} businesses {{remained with}} the old banks for winding up. Glitnir and Kaupthing, shorn of their Icelandic operations, obtained <b>moratoria</b> <b>on</b> payments to creditors (similar to Chapter 11 protection) from the District Court of Reykjavík on 24 November.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 {{death row inmates}} who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged {{brutality}} to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Fisher {{returned}} to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto Fear God and dread nought. This, combined with a government <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the Gallipoli Campaign with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.|$|E

5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cinema}} closed, it was {{purchased}} by Develop UK, and several {{attempts were made to}} turn the building into a Wetherspoons pub. However these were rejected by the council twice, once in the initial planning application, and also in a subsequent appeal. The application was denied due to the <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new food and drink licences in Withington, part of the town's unitary development plan. In 2002 the building {{was purchased by}} Arrows International. They applied for planning permission in December 2002 to demolish part of the cinema, reconstructing it as five ground floor shops, with 21flats on the upper floors. These plans were withdrawn as they were seen as overdeveloping the site.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 an {{insurgency}} {{known as the}} Log Revolution took place in Croatia, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and, after the RSK declared its intention to unite with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a breakaway state. By March 1991 the conflict escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> Croatia and the RSK's declarations followed, after which their decisions were implemented on 8 October.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{presence of}} bright, new condominium development in America’s cities {{is changing the}} composition and appearance of these urban landscapes. Long-time local residents in gentrifying areas are confronted daily with the impacts of development, and are searching for tools to preserve their communities and keep them affordable. One response has been proposed <b>moratoria</b> <b>on</b> condominium construction. This approach aims to stop the influx of more affluent individuals into urban neighborhoods by preventing the construction of higher-end condominiums. This Note examines the validity of such <b>moratoria</b> <b>on</b> condominium construction as an exercise of the police power. Through a comparison to rent control ordinances and condominium conversion moratoria, it argues that valid condominium construction moratoria can be implemented to address social and economic concerns. The Note concludes, however, that valid construction moratoria are not always the most appropriate or effective growth management tool to address a gentrifying community’s needs...|$|R

5|$|In July {{an attempt}} by Representative (and future Vice President) Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to impose a one-year <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> the {{proposed}} system-wide cuts failed 214-197. In the end the Senate approved a smaller cutback, citing a 24% spike in Amtrak ridership after an oil shock during the summer, but the North Coast Hiawatha remained on the chopping block. In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E
5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{promotions}} to field marshal came in 2012, eighteen {{years after the}} <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> routine promotions to the rank, when Queen Elizabeth II promoted Prince Charles, her son and heir apparent, to the five-star ranks in all three services, in recognition of support provided for her in her capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces. At the same time, Guthrie, who relinquished the post of CDS and retired from active service in 2001, was promoted to honorary field marshal. In June 2014 former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Walker of Aldringham was also promoted to honorary field marshal.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} based on the {{incomplete}} hull of the Italian passenger ship Ausonia, which was being built in Hamburg. The conversion was proposed by the Air Department of the Reichs Navy Office, but it was abandoned after negotiations within the German Navy over a proposed <b>moratorium</b> <b>on</b> new ships {{at the end of the}} war. After World War I ended, high inflation in Germany added to the cost of the ship, and as a result, the Italian shipping company for whom the ship was originally built, declined to purchase her. The vessel was therefore sold to shipbreakers and dismantled in 1922.|$|E
