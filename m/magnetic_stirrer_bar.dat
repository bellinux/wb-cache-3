50|$|The {{apparatus}} is assembled {{as in the}} diagram. (The diagram {{represents a}} batch apparatus {{as opposed to a}} continuous apparatus.) The mixture is put into the round bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping granules (or a Teflon coated <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>bar</b> if using magnetic stirring), and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. The fractional distillation column is set up with the heat source at the bottom on the still pot. As the distance from the stillpot increases, a temperature gradient is formed in the column; it is coolest at the top and hottest at the bottom. As the mixed vapor ascends the temperature gradient, some of the vapor condenses and revaporizes along the temperature gradient. Each time the vapor condenses and vaporizes, the composition of the more volatile component in the vapor increases. This distills the vapor {{along the length of the}} column, and eventually the vapor is composed solely of the more volatile component (or an azeotrope). The vapor condenses on the glass platforms, known as trays, inside the column, and runs back down into the liquid below, refluxing distillate. The efficiency in terms of the amount of heating and time required to get fractionation can be improved by insulating the outside of the column in an insulator such as wool, aluminium foil or preferably a vacuum jacket. The hottest tray is at the bottom and the coolest is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray are at equilibrium. The most volatile component of the mixture exits as a gas at the top of the column. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, which cools it down until it liquefies. The separation is more pure with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.) Initially, the condensate will be close to the azeotropic composition, but when much of the ethanol has been drawn off, the condensate becomes gradually richer in water. The process continues until all the ethanol boils out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the sharp rise in temperature shown on the thermometer.|$|E

Drift influence was effectively be reduced. The temperature sensor is a platinum thin-film thermistor with a nominal impedance of 1 kOhm. Dissolved oxygen concentration is monitored using an amperometric Ultra Micro Electrode Array (UMEA) which exhibits good selectivity and low flow dependence. Viable biomass concentration is monitored using impedance spectroscopy. Yeast suspension conductivity was found to increase linearly with the biomass concentration for frequencies above 1 MHz. The sensors were fabricated using cleanroom techniques and meet the floorplan of a 96 -well microtiterplate. The sensor array was first calibrated with respect to conventional measurement methods in lab-scale fermentors with a working volume of 4 liters. The sensors were then applied in an array consisting of two microreactors with a working volume of 100 microliter. Therefore, the sensors were placed underneath bottomless wells taken from 96 -well microtiterplates.

On the same piece of weighing paper, weigh all the solids sequentially as followed: Pd(OAc) 2 (2. 3 mg, 0. 010 mmol, 10 mol%), Ac-Gly-OH (2. 4 mg, 0. 020 mmol, 20 mol%), AgOAc (50 mg, 0. 30 mmol, 3. 0 equiv.) and the substrate (0. 10 mmol). The solids were carefully transferred into the bottom of a 35 mL pressure vessel pre-equipped with a Teflon-coated <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>bar.</b> - HFIP (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -Hexafluoro- 2 -propanol) (0. 60 mL) was added to the mixture to wash down the solids on the sides of wall, followed by ethyl acrylate (22 µL, 2. 0 equiv.) and then another 0. 60 mL of HFIP. - Cap the tube tightly and submerge it into a pre-heated 90 °C (controlled by a digital temperature probe) oil bath. - Leave the reaction stirring for 24 hours. - Lift vessel out of the oil bath and filtrate the reaction mixture through a short pad of Celite® into a 50 ml round bottom flask after it cools down. - Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. - Isolate the desired product by preparative silica gel thin-layer chromatography eluting with hexane:ethyl acetate to yield the desired olefinated product. ### Timing - Toluene derivatives: 42 hours (electron-donating substituents); 48 hours (electron-withdrawing substituents) - Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives: 24 hours ### Troubleshooting - Toluene derivatives - Poor separation of the major meta-isomer from the minor isomers: Preparative thin-layer chromatography is usually the first choice to achieve better separation. Repetitive running of the thin-layer chromatography using less polar eluent is recommended to achieve good resolution. - Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives - Problem: Poor separation of mono-olefinated meta-isomer from the di-olefinated meta-isomer (when applicable), and poor separation of the major meta-isomer from the trace minor isomers for some substrates. - Solutions: Especially for those substrates with di-olefinated product, preparative thin-layer chromatography is usually employed to achieve better separation. Repetitive developing of the thin-layer chromatography (3 to 5 times) using relative less polar eluent is recommended. ### Anticipated Results Typical isolated yield of toluene derivatives should be 46 – 98 % depending on the substituents on the aromatic ring and olefins used. Typical yield of hydrocinnamic acid derivatives should be 67 – 93 % depending on the substituents on the aromatic ring. Longer reaction time than 24 hours may lead to more di-olefinated products; however, shorter reaction time could cause incomplete reaction. ### References 1. Engle, K.
