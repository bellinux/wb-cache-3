5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored <b>Multi-Purpose</b> <b>Vehicle</b> program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E

25|$|The {{creation}} of the Komodo first started on October 26, 2011 when President Yudhoyono personally visited a PT Indonesian Aerospace weapon system exhibition. During his visit, he gave a challenge to Pindad's Product Development Team to make an indigenous 4×4 tactical vehicle. Pindad's Special Vehicle Division technicians bore the responsibility to make the said vehicle. In the course of developing the vehicle, Pindad looked at other armored tactical vehicles that were being produced and sold such as the Armored <b>Multi-Purpose</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> the Nexter Aravis and the Sherpa Light family. During the visit, PT Pindad president Adik Aviantono Sudarsono was told to prepare on the production process of the vehicle when President Yudhoyono requested Pindad to have a working prototype ready in two months after his visit. Production of the Komodo was based at Pindad's factory in Bandung, West Java. The {{creation of}} a working Komodo prototype was completed in March 2012.|$|E
25|$|The first {{efforts of}} the Kontogouris {{brothers}} involved attempts to build a light truck called Hellas in Germany. In 1957, they acquired rights to a production technology of a <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> developed by Swiss engineer Dr. Wilfried Fahr. In 1961, Kontogouris created their first company (FARCO) in Thessaloniki, Greece, to produce the vehicle, called FARMOBIL, with BMW 700 flat-2 engine. Ironically, this smart vehicle was not certified for the Greek market and all production was exported to several countries around the world. In 1963, the company was acquired by Chrysler and renamed it Chrysler Hellas S.A. In 1967, production in Greece was stopped by the American company, and was transferred to other countries. Meanwhile, in 1961 ambitious plans {{were made by the}} Kontogouris Brothers for a new company (to be called NAMCO) with a new factory in Patras, Greece to produce under licence a German-designed (Neckar) three-wheeler truck and other vehicles, but were not materialized.|$|E

2500|$|Heavier-duty SUVs are {{typically}} designed with a truck-style chassis with separate body, while lighter-duty (including cross-over models) are {{more similar to}} car construction, which {{are typically}} built with a unitary construction (where the body actually forms the structure). Originally designed and built to be work vehicles using a truck chassis, SUVs were not comprehensively re-designed to be safely used as passenger vehicles. The British television Fifth Gear programme staged a [...] crash between a first generation (1989–98) Land Rover Discovery with a separate chassis and body, and a modern Renault Espace IV with monocoque (unit) design. This traditional truck-based SUV offered less protection for occupants than that offered in the modern <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> with unitary construction. In some SUV fatalities involving truck-based construction, lawsuits against the automakers [...] "were settled quietly and confidentially, without any public scrutiny of the results—or the underlying problems with SUV design", thus hiding the danger of vehicles such as the Ford Bronco and Explorer compared to regular passenger cars.|$|E
