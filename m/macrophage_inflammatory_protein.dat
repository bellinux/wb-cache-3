They activate human granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) which can lead to acute neutrophilic inflammation. They also induce the synthesis and release of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6 and TNF-α from fibroblasts and macrophages.

40|$|Although {{inflammation}} is {{a primary}} means for fighting infection, improper regulation of inflammation can result in life threatening conditions. Statins, prescribed to lower cholesterol, also have anti-inflammatory properties.

This study establishes a method for investigating if inhibition of CDC 42, a potential master regulator, is sufficient to mimic the anti-inflammatory properties of statins and thus revealing if CDC 42 plays a central role in mediating the anti-inflammatory action of statins on macrophages.

Results: MIP- 1 alpha was significantly reduced (P = 0. 05), while MIP- 1 beta was significantly increased (P = 0. 05). Plasma MCP- 1 was reduced, although not significantly, while RANTES was significantly increased (P = 0. 05).

50|$|ATL {{is usually}} a highly {{aggressive}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with no characteristic histologic appearance except for a diffuse pattern and a mature T-cell phenotype. Circulating lymphocytes with an irregular nuclear contour (leukemic cells) are frequently seen. Several lines of evidence suggest that HTLV-1 causes ATL. This evidence includes the frequent isolation of HTLV-1 from patients with this disease and the detection of HTLV-1 proviral genome in ATL leukemic cells. ATL is frequently accompanied by visceral involvement, hypercalcemia, skin lesions, and lytic bone lesions. Bone invasion and osteolysis, features of bone metastases, commonly occur {{in the setting of}} advanced solid tumors, such as breast, prostate, and lung cancers, but are less common in hematologic malignancies. However, patients with HTLV-1-induced ATL and multiple myeloma are predisposed to the development of tumor-induced osteolysis and hypercalcemia.

The DNA-binding activity of the NF-kappa B protein directly correlated with mRNA expression for the genes encoding the proinflammatory cytokines and the free radical scavenging enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Both the p 50 and p 65 NF-kappa B subunits were detected on gel supershift assays. Minimal NF-kappa B activity was observed following exposure of C 3 H/HeJ macrophages to lipopolysaccharide. The antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide decreased the level of NF-kappa B activation in the J 774 cells. This correlated with decreased expression of cytokine mRNAs and tumor necrosis factor bioactivity.

40|$|Lymphokines (LK) t are polypeptides that mediate {{many of the}} {{regulatory}} functions of the immune system. Among these are a set of molecules that are produced by T cells in response to receptor-mediated stimuli and act upon B lymphocytes, macrophages, other cells of hematopoietic lineage, and on the T cells themselves (1). It has recently been demonstrated that crosslinkage of Fc receptors on growth factor-dependent mast cell and myeloid cell lines stimulates the production ofsome of these "T cell-derived " molecules, including IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 3, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (2 - 5). Non-transformed mast cell lines have also been reported to secrete IL- 6, IL- 1, TNFa {{and several of the}} <b>macrophage</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>proteins</b> in response to cross-linkage, of high affinity FcE receptors (3, 5). We have recently shown that a population ofspleen cells that lack both B cell and T cell markers and do not express the NK cell marker asialo-GM 1 on their surface produce IL- 4 in response to incubation on culture dishes coated with IgE (6). The response of these cells to plate-bound (PB) IgE is inhibited by low concentrations of soluble IgE, strongly suggesting that it is mediated by cross-linkage ofa high affinit...|$|R
