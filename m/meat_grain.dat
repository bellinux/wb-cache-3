5000|$|Shortly {{after its}} foundation, the new workhouse is {{recorded}} {{as having a}} farm, dairy and gardens in which food was grown.

Children at the workhouse appear to have received some education at this time, as the purchase of copy and spelling books, easy readers, bibles and catechisms is also recorded. The prison reformer John Howard visited the workhouse on 1 August 1788, on which date it had only 44 inhabitants, and gave the following account of conditions: The house is visited weekly by the gentlemen of the town in rotation. It was clean, and great attention seems to be paid to the inhabitants. The rooms are too low, and the upper parts of the windows too far from the ceilings. Five shillings a month is allowed for tobacco and snuff, yet the use of tea, though purchased with their own money, is ordered to be punished by confinement in the dungeon.|$|E

Adana, a major city in South East Turkey (Adaniya in Hittite in the former Neo-Hittte, Luwian Kizzuwadna region) is famous for its kebabs and according to studies Hittite cuisine contained a strong element of meat skewer (Shish Kebab). Various books are written in Turkish about the Hittite cuisine and the Hittite University in Çorum in Turkey has published articles about Hittite cuisine recently.Hittite food recipes were generally similar to that of contemporary civilizations, especially in regard to meat ad dairy dishes, but were unique with regard to the plants used in cooking, as Anatolia has its own unique vegetation.Wine was consumed by the Hittites on regular basis and used for religious festivals and rituals.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{agri-food}} {{chains are}} more global {{than ever and}} are characterized by increased imports and exports and global sourcing of products, resulting in increased cross-border transaction risks. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the typical risks regarding agri-food supply chains involved in cross-border transactions and to assess their importance as perceived by agri-food managers. The analysis takes into consideration four different agrifood value chains (<b>meat,</b> <b>grain,</b> olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits). Following an explorative approach and a qualitative technique, a series of face to face in-depth interviews was conducted. Results indicate that risk perception may be quite different across countries, value chains, tiers of the supply chain, as well as across respondents. The prevalence of Market dynamics risks was pointed out in most of the interviews, yielding the impression that many operators identify the market as the most difficult environment. Differences in risk perception between fresh produce (fruit/vegetables and meat) and processed food chains (grain and olive oil) are probably interrelated to the different degree of integration within these supply chains, the different level of standardization achieved and the different causes of risks that are inherent to the nature of the product.

40|$|This lecture {{considers}} {{the complexity of}} challenges of the agricultural transition {{from the perspective of}} farmers, who act at the intersection between the ecology, economy and policy. The lecture will start by providing an overview on the resource requirements for our global production chains of life stock and <b>meat,</b> <b>grain</b> and legume farming and say some words on the human diet, and food and feed conversion efficiency of energy-intake through food. This lecture also places a fresh emphasis on the development of local knowledge and locally specific arming and nutrition practices that are adapted to local environments, as a necessary complement to agricultural science striving to make universal claims. This leads on to basic insights on needs for knowledge production in agriculture, and merits and limitations of action research and engaged research, raising questions on how farmers, scientists and citizens might better collaborate to inform choices in food production and consumption. For the future there are some indications on a new trend on new more decentralised governance of the food system including citizen’s involvement in French organic certification and Community based Auditing and citizens science in communities in Australia to work with farmers on reducing environmental impacts and address ensuing trade-offs for farmers as a community...|$|E

40|$|Most {{agricultural}} products are produced on farms {{where there is}} a mix of activities, resulting in a range of co-products. This raises the issue of how best to model these complex production systems for Life Cycle Assessment, especially where there are benefits imparted by one activity in the mixed farming system to another. On the mixed farm studied, there were significant two-way reference flows (representing 288 t CO 2 -e/year or 10 % of the total farm emissions) between activities producing distinct products (wool, <b>meat,</b> <b>grain)</b> and these were modelled using system expansion. Cropping and sheep activities were modelled as separate sub-processes in the farming system, with unique inputs and outputs identified for each. Co-production from the sheep activity was modelling using allocation, comparing biophysical and economic relationships. Using an economic allocation resulted in different estimates of global warming impact for sheep co-products, with figures varying by 7 - 52 %. When compared to biophysical allocation, economic allocation shifted the environmental burden to the higher value co-products and away from the high resource use products. Using economic allocation, for every kilogram of wool produced there was an estimated 28. 7 kg of CO 2 -e emitted. Amongst the live animal products, the stud rams had the highest estimated carbon footprint (719 kg CO 2 -e/ram). Amongst the crops, estimates of emissions for the cereal grains averaged 202 kg CO 2 -e/tonne grain, canola 222 kg CO 2 -e/tonne and lupins 510 kg CO 2 -e/tonne, when modelled to include the benefits of the mixed farming system...|$|E
40|$|AB Background: Several {{observational}} {{studies suggest}} an inverse association of protein with blood pressure (BP). However, {{little is known}} about the role of dietary protein from specific sources in BP. Method: We examined the relation between several types of dietary protein (total, plant, animal, dairy, <b>meat,</b> <b>grain,</b> fish, soy, and nut) and incident hypertension in 2241 participants from the Rotterdam Study, aged at least 55 years, who were free of hypertension at baseline. Hazard ratios, with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), for incident hypertension during 6 years of follow-up were obtained per standard deviation (SD) of energy-adjusted intake of protein. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) smoking, educational level, alcohol, intake of carbohydrates, other nutrients, and other types of protein (if applicable). We conducted stratified analyses by age (cut-off 70 years), sex, and BMI (cut-off 25 kg/m 2). Results: The risk of hypertension in the total cohort (1113 cases) was not related to intake of total protein or types of protein (all hazard ratios ~ 1. 00 per SD). Sex and BMI did not significantly modify the associations of dietary protein with hypertension. In 559 participants aged at least 70 years, the intake of animal protein was positively related to risk of hypertension (hazard ratio 1. 37 per SD, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 72). For participants aged below 70 years no association was found (hazard ratio 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 81 - 1. 06). Conclusion: Total dietary protein or types of protein are not related to incident hypertension in this older population. In the more aged, however, high intake of animal protein may increase the risk of hypertension, which warrants further investigatio...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{have been}} farming {{plants and animals}} for over 10, 000 years. <b>Meat,</b> <b>grain,</b> {{medicinal}} ingredients, fabrics and cloths can all be produced efficiently and cheaply on farms or synthesised. If there is plentiful supply then why does the wildlife trade continue to threaten populations of our remaining natural environments? Clearly the available products do not present an appropriate substitute for the wild product given their prices, attributes or availability. Farming the desired species is therefore an intuitively neat solution to trade issues facing some species. However, I argue and present data to support that argument, that farming is not a panacea for wildlife trade problems. This thesis begins by outlining a theoretical framework around the impact which farming might have upon the poaching of species from the wild. Once the pre-requisites for a successful farming policy to protect wild populations were identified the thesis began to test these for existing trades. Chapters 2 and 3 quantitatively examine the substitutability of wild and farmed products with data from the Atlantic salmon (Salmo sa/ar) market in the UK and the bear bile (Ursus spp.) markets in China. Chapter 3 examines demand for wildlife derived pharmaceuticals by examining the health seeking behaviour in a dual system of traditional Chinese and western medicines. The fifth chapter estimates the total size {{of the market for}} wild bear bile after 3 decades of competition from legal farmed bile. The thesis then tests the assumption that competition from the farmed alternative will significantly diminish the incentive to hunt bears for bile by interviewing rural Cambodians. The last two chapters represent methodological work incidental to the core work of this thesis. A novel method to measuring attitudes was developed (and used in chapter 5) to measure moral attitudes towards bear bile use. Finally a method for measuring the marginal value of small changes in available habitat was developed and published {{during the course of this}} thesis.
