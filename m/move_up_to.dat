The champions of the Midland Combination, West Midlands (Regional) League and Leicestershire Senior League continued to gain promotion to the Alliance, although in 2008 the new East Midlands Counties Football League was formed at the Step 6 level and it was anticipated that successful teams from the Leicestershire Senior League, which is officially a Step 7 league, would now <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the new league and that the champions of the new league would in turn <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Alliance if they fell within its coverage area.|$|E

5|$|The Ascensio Scholarum, {{inherited}} from the College of St Omer, in its present form, is the opening address of the headmaster {{at the beginning of}} the year to the entire school gathered in the Academy Room. Previously, it was a formal transition for pupils from one playroom to the next {{at the beginning of the}} year, which involved a pupil from each year announcing to the playroom of the year below them that the next playroom had been vacated by the senior pupils.

5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E

5|$|Continuing with Jaguar in 2004, Webber {{qualified}} sixth for {{the first}} race of the season, the , but faced his second consecutive retirement from his home race, this time {{as a result of}} a gearbox failure. At the following race, the , Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career up to that point by splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up second on the grid. The race was less rewarding with a near-stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> ninth place but during an exciting battle with Ralf Schumacher, they collided, forcing Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation to make up for the lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty which left him even further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end of his race as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23.|$|E
5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it.

Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. Cedric Daniels is interviewed, having been praised by Prez, Major Valchek's son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case.

5|$|The current youth {{programme}} {{has been}} developed from Baden-Powell's original Scout training scheme, which aimed to encourage personal achievement and {{provide a framework for}} the activities of the Scout Troop. In the Boy Scout section, this consisted of the award of badges for Tenderfoot, Second and First Class Scout and finally King's Scout, which were earned by passing tests {{in a wide variety of}} skills associated with the outdoors, health and good citizenship. With the creation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, a similar system was devised, the awards being Tenderpad, First Star and Second Star, and an award called the Leaping Wolf was added later which required Cubs to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Scout Troop. In parallel with this scheme, Cubs and Scouts were able to earn Proficiency Badges for specific skills and hobbies, an idea that Baden-Powell probably copied from Ernest Thompson Seton. The test requirements for Baden-Powell's scheme were revised in 1944 and again in 1958 without altering the basic structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog can travel far {{in a single}} day or night; {{distances}} of 1.0 to 1.5km have been recorded. Tagging experiments have shown that some can <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3km in total, and that some travel several kilometres from the closest breeding habitat. However, the species evidently tends to return to or remain at an identified site, provided the habitat stays appropriate for its needs, or else it will move away. The green and golden bell frog also favours areas with the greatest habitat complexity, and as such, this is a core component of habitat-based strategies to protect the species. In general, the frogs stay within areas of 100–700m2 The frog is well equipped for survival on land. It can rehydrate by absorbing moisture through its ventral skin, and evaporative water loss occurs at a rate, indicative of a watertight skin. very low Some have been observed up to 400m from the nearest body of water.|$|E
5|$|Webber's two {{following}} {{races in}} Malaysia and Australia were cut short due to mechanical problems.

Webber had taken {{the lead of the}} race on lap 21, becoming the first Australian to lead the Australian Grand Prix since John Bowe had done so in the early laps of the non-championship 1984 Australian Grand Prix.

5|$|Gadret and Dupont then showed {{climbing}} prowess in {{the first}} of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time taken. This moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place. Dupont finished eighth on this stage to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> eighth overall. Gadret gained further time against the vast majority of the field in the Giro's queen stage, stage 15, by finishing fifth and moving up to fourth place in the overall standings. Dupont struggled, coming in 22nd on the day, to fall to 15th overall. Gadret finished the race in fourth place, holding it after each of the remaining stages. Dupont took back a little time against some of the other riders in the field in stages 17 and 20, to improve his final position to 12th. Gadret's fourth place was the team's best overall placement in a Grand Tour in their history, bettering the sixth place attained by Cyril Dessel in the 2006 Tour de France.|$|E
