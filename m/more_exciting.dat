5|$|I {{knew they}} were wanting to include car chases to make the drama much <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> to watch. The only trouble was that the cars around this era weren't very fast.|$|E
5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight <b>more</b> <b>exciting.</b> The scene required several weeks of rehearsal {{and more than a}} week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} years, {{the running}} order was not {{decided by the}} drawing of lots, but instead by the producers, {{with the aim of}} making the shows <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out. The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene on}} the poop {{duplicated}} the previous one, save that the men were <b>more</b> <b>excited,</b> <b>more</b> frightened. They were babbling and chattering all together.|$|R
60|$|The two {{men were}} having a few <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> words, their voices just audible.|$|R
50|$|In Season Two, Mike O'Malley was noticeably <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> {{and loud}} when announcing a Power Surge.|$|R
5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The {{difference is}} that the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, offers more puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering <b>more</b> <b>exciting,</b> yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} never meant to be a true biographical film to Ip Man's life, but to broadly touch on the {{elements}} from his life. Most of the central turns of the plot are there only for the purpose of making a movie <b>more</b> <b>exciting,</b> including the scenes depicting duels between Ip Man and the Japanese, including Consul General Miura Yoshiaki (三浦義秋), as well as Ip Man encountering hardship during the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the Big Four is generally seen {{to have had a}} positive impact on tennis, making the sport <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being from European countries, this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America. It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E
60|$|As {{they became}} <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>excited,</b> both Charlotte and Bervie ended in unconsciously raising their voices.|$|R
60|$|Amelius {{told her}} plainly. She {{became more and}} more interested, <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>excited,</b> as he went on.|$|R

5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish {{near the bottom}} of the final standings, exceeded expectations, with the latter eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> than any traditional sporting match he had ever seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which deserved the same level of respect of traditional sports.|$|E
5|$|Planning began a {{month before}} the {{original}} Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used {{as the basis for the}} characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III.|$|E
5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, depicting executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo. Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burn it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposed!" [...] I cried, {{with much}} <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> {{interest}} than I {{would have shown}} if I had taken proper thought before speaking.|$|R
60|$|I gazed everywhere, growing <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> and thrilled. Another {{shot from}} above, farther off {{and from a}} {{different}} rifle, augmented our stirring expectation.|$|R
60|$|A {{dozen men}} had sprung clamoring {{to their feet}} before he sat down. One, <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> than the rest, got the ear of the company.|$|R
5|$|Between 1900 and the 1930s, {{the number}} of runs scored by batsmen, and the {{proportion}} of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play {{and the extent to which}} batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> games.|$|E
5|$|Born in Temora, New South Wales, {{near the}} {{regional}} centre of Wagga Wagga, Kerry {{was one of}} two sons born to a car salesman. Kerry's mother was a swimming teacher who ran her own aquatic school. Kerry was taught to swim by his mother, whom he regarded as a perfectionist who emphasised technique and turned him to backstroke. Kerry grew up participating {{in a wide range of}} sports, representing Wollongong High School in tennis, athletics and swimming. He also competed four times in the state cross-country championships. Once his family had moved to the seaside city of Wollongong, Kerry developed a love of the surf. He found the ocean water much <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> due to its unpredictability. Kerry steadily rose through the surf lifesaving ranks, competing at the state and national championships. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first competitive race at the age of 12 in 1971. At the time, Brad Cooperwho went on to win the 400m freestyle at the 1972 Summer Olympicswas living in Wollongong and he and Kerry trained together on a regular basis. In 1974, Kerry competed in the Australian Age Championships in freestyle, before moving north to train with John Rigby in Brisbane, Queensland in the following year. At the time of his move, Kerry was ranked around 200th in the world in backstroke.|$|E
25|$|The rule {{experimentation}} {{was based}} on the previous season of play in the AHL, and {{was based on}} creating a <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> game and will create more scoring opportunities, and therefore more goals.|$|E
60|$|So {{he changed}} his skin then and there, and the Leopard was <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> than ever; {{he had never seen}} a man change his skin before.|$|R
60|$|She spoke almost passionately, being <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> by Mac's {{repressed}} emotion {{than she}} had ever been by Charlie's most touching demonstration, though she did not know why.|$|R

25|$|Various rules {{concerning}} {{have applied}} during {{the history of}} one day cricket, {{with the aim of}} encouraging the batsman to play shots and make the game faster and <b>more</b> <b>exciting.</b> The current rules applying to One Day Internationals were first introduced as trial rules in July 2001, and are also used for some other limited overs tournaments.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the laptop}} segment was the {{fastest-growing}} {{segment of the}} PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores. Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> devices that consumers demanded.|$|E
25|$|On January 26, 1993, the Dunes {{closed its}} doors for good. A {{liquidation}} sale {{was conducted by}} National Content Liquidators to clear the property of its contents {{as a prelude to}} the building's demolition. Like many of the legendary properties of its era, it could no longer compete with the newer and <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> megaresorts that were being built.|$|E
60|$|The more I {{thought of}} it the <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> I became, until my fingers raced madly {{back and forth over}} those bewildering little hills and valleys upon that bit of paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{am not a}} negro, {{and never}} was a negro," [...] {{answered}} Tubbs, getting <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>excited.</b> [...] "I shall report this to my parents when I arrive home." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{the talk}} ran on, the {{newcomers}} getting <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> every moment. They had their guns with them, and {{looked as if}} they meant to do serious harm to our friends.|$|R
25|$|Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the semi-fictional Headingley Cricket Club's matches, the comic and slightly melodramatic plot of Cricket has star player Donald torn between his team and his girlfriend Emma – as she decides to abandon watching cricket for what appears to be a far <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> life at the race track with the caddish Vincent.|$|E
25|$|The general grey slate {{and back}} gardens of Plymouth, {{as seen from}} the Great Western made the {{surprise}} of Saltash Bridge all the <b>more</b> <b>exciting.</b> Up and down stream, grey battleships were moored in the Tamar and its reaches. Hundreds of feet below, the pathetic steam ferry to Saltash from the Devon bank tried to compete with Brunel's mighty bridge.|$|E
25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets are even <b>more</b> <b>exciting.</b> We {{were interested in}} making the technology very visible, but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} being able to see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
60|$|So Mr. Edwards {{put on his}} hat, {{and stepped}} to the door. The dog was {{standing}} up in the sleigh, and looking wildly around. When he saw Mr. Edwards, he seemed <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> still.|$|R
60|$|Gradually {{the circle}} round the combatants narrowed. A few {{discreet}} exclamations of admiration greeted Déroulède's most successful parry. De Marny was getting <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>excited,</b> {{the older man}} more and more sober and reserved.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lavender {{had been}} growing <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> at each word he overheard, for a scheme of really stupendous {{proportions}} was shaping itself within him. He suddenly rose, and said: [...] "I have an idea." ...|$|R
