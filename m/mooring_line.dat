5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a <b>mooring</b> <b>line,</b> leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E

Scale model tests in open water have been conducted (September 2007) in Lake Erie and structural dynamics modeling was done in 2010 for larger designs. Nautica Windpower's Advanced Floating Turbine (AFT) uses a single <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> and a downwind two-bladed rotor configuration that is deflection tolerant and aligns itself with the wind without an active yaw system. Two-bladed, downwind turbine designs that can accommodate flexibility in the blades will potentially prolong blade lifetime, diminish structural system loads and reduce offshore maintenance needs, yielding lower lifecycle costs.|$|E

Four days before leaving, the Luisa anchored at the mouth of the Patuxent River, underneath Calvert Cliffs State Park, to transfer 6 guns, 26 rifles, 18 pistols, 17 sabers, and 30 barrels of gunpowder and ammunition.

40|$|As {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} exploration moves progressively toward greater water depths, it becomes more challenging to predict the environmental forces and global responses of floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) systems and the dynamic behaviour of the <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> and risers. The validation of complex numerical models through scale model experimental testing is restricted by the physical limits of the test facilities. It is not feasible to install the equivalent full length <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> and riser systems and select an appropriate scale model for reducing the uncertainties in the experimental test programme for deepwater and ultra-deepwater conditions. The combination of an appropriate scale FPSO model with a suitable level of equivalent effect reduced depth using a hybrid passive truncated experimental methodology for the <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> and risers is a practical approach. Following recent discoveries, FPSO has been proposed for a portion of the planned development in the southern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in water depth ranging from 1000 to 2000  m. Based on a scale model and a hybrid passive truncated experimental method for <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> and risers, this paper investigates the global response of an FPSO, as well as the dynamics of <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> and risers in the context of prevailing environmental conditions for field development in a specific deepwater location in GOM. The experiments revealed that the main horizontal motion response of the FPSO (surge) under non-collinear loading condition is almost two-times that of the collinear loading condition. The <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> in the non-collinear condition are more sensitive to the dynamic response and risers appear to have an important influence on the low frequency damping...|$|R

Bitts aboard wooden sailing ships (sometime called cable-bitts) were large vertical timbers mortised into the keel and used as the anchor cable attachment point.

2500|$|Mooring {{lines are}} usually made from manila rope or a {{synthetic}} material such as nylon. Nylon {{is easy to}} work with and lasts for years, but it is highly elastic. This elasticity has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that during an event, such as a high wind or the close passing of another ship, stress can be spread across several lines. However, should a highly stressed nylon line break, it may part catastrophically, causing snapback, which can fatally injure bystanders. The effect of snapback is analogous to stretching a rubber band to its breaking point between your hands and then suffering a stinging blow from its suddenly flexing broken ends. Such a blow from a heavy <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> carries much more force and can inflict severe injuries or even sever limbs. [...] Mooring lines made from materials such as Dyneema and Kevlar have much less elasticity and are therefore much safer to use. However, such lines do not float on water and they do tend to sink. In addition, they are relatively more expensive than other sorts of line.|$|E

He cut the <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> to ease the strain, but when the rope parted and the log swung clear he was faced by another risk; unless they could reach the gravel bank, they would go down the rapid. He could not find bottom now, and while he tried the log struck the next canoe. His canoe swerved outshore, the row was drifting fast, and he shouted as he felt for the ax.|$|E

50|$|In early August 1992, {{the ship}} {{received}} an extensive refit, including her main steam plant. Later that same month, {{as the ship}} was unable to be leave on its own power, its <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> were reinforced with anchor chain and steel cables to keep it moored to the pier as Typhoon Omar approached the island of Guam. On 27 August 1992, {{under the command of}} Capt. Robin Y. Weber, the ship weathered the initial pass of the eye of Super Typhoon Omar. After a relative calm and then the final pass of the eye of Typhoon Omar, White Plains was torn from her moorings. The ship with its skeleton crew rode out Omar's 150 mph winds in Apra Harbor. The ship ultimately ran aground on the coral beach. The responsibility for the safe mooring of a ship during repair lies with the shipyard. At the beginning of the repair availability the ships first lieutenant meet with Ship Repair Facility Guam engineers and developed a plan to moor the ship {{in the event of a}} typhoon. The plan took into account the surface area of exposed portions of the ship and pounds per square inch of expected force generated by typhoon winds along with the strength of pier cleats, bollards and deadmen. The plan required more lines than were a part of the ship's normal complement. An agreement was reached about which lines would be provided by the ship and which would be provided by the shipyard. All lines were to be of nylon construction. On the morning of the storm's approach the shipyard riggers used springlay <b>mooring</b> <b>lines.</b> Springlay is a combination of wire and synthetic fiber and does not stretch. Nylon <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> can stretch up to a third of their length with no damage to the line. Despite the first lieutenant's protest of the incompatibility of the two types of <b>mooring</b> <b>lines,</b> the shipyard's riggers claimed they had no other lines available. This resulted in the springlay <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> holding almost the full force of the winds while the strength of the nylon <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> was not fully utilized. The springlay lines gave way followed by the nylon lines. In the weeks following Typhoon Omar, the eyes of two other typhoons passed over the ship while still in the shipyard. During these events the original mooring plan was utilized using all nylon <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> and the ship rode out both typhoons with no problems.|$|R
