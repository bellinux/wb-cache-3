25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> was {{demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic tape sound recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders. Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of The Lost Weekend in late 1945, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett began to {{collaborate}} on a film about the problems faced by American military personnel stationed in Europe following World War II. Wilder went to Europe to research the project, but his visits to the concentration camps so disturbed him he returned to Hollywood determined to write and direct a musical comedy instead. He had known Bing Crosby since the crooner's days with Paul Whiteman, and he and Brackett had contributed to Crosby's 1940 film Rhythm on the River. Since Crosby was Paramount's leading star and Wilder was the studio's top director, {{it was easy to}} convince executives to greenlight a collaboration between the two. Wilder recalled reading about a Danish inventor who had demonstrated a <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> device for Franz Joseph I of Austria in the hope the Emperor would help finance his invention, and he and Brackett used this bit of historical fact as the starting point for their screenplay, which initially was titled Viennese Story.|$|E

500|$|Following Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 was {{purposely}} {{conceived and}} developed to {{be a different}} kind of Supermarionation series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on characterisation and plotlines subscribing more to the spy thriller genre than science fiction. Co-creator Gerry Anderson explained, [...] "The show majored on its characters, which I thought were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware." [...] Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as The Wicked Lady, handling recording tape on a daily basis. While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities, explaining, [...] "I read somewhere that the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording,</b> where material could be stored or transferred to another tape." [...] When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, Fireball XL5, the surname [...] "Ninety" [...] had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring an earthquake, the {{physical}} and the chemical transformations along a slip zone lead to an intense deformation within the gouge layer of a mature fault zone. Because the gouge contains ferromagnetic minerals, it {{has the capacity to}} behave as a magnetic recorder during an earthquake. This constitutes a conceivable way to identify earthquakes slip zones. In this paper, we investigate the <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> of the Chelungpu fault gouge that hosts the principal slip zone of the Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw 7. 6, 1999, Taiwan) using Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project core samples. Rock magnetic investigation pinpoints the location of the Chi-Chi mm-thick principal slip zone within the 16 -cm thick gouge at ~ 1 km depth. A modern magnetic dipole of Earth magnetic field is recovered throughout this gouge but not in the wall rocks nor in the two other adjacent fault zones. This <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> resides essentially in two magnetic minerals; magnetite in the principal slip zone, and neoformed goethite elsewhere in the gouge. We propose a model where magnetic record: 1) is preserved during inter-seismic time, 2) is erased during co-seismic time and 3) is imprinted during post-seismic time when fluids cooled down. We suggest that the identification of a stable <b>magnetic</b> <b>record</b> carried by neoformed goethite may be a signature of friction-heating process in seismic slip zone...|$|R

2500|$|The first delay {{effects were}} {{achieved}} using tape loops improvised on reel-to-reel <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> systems. By shortening or lengthening the loop of tape and adjusting the {{read and write}} heads, {{the nature of the}} delayed echo could be controlled. This technique was most common among early composers of Musique concrète (Pierre Schaeffer), and composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, who had sometimes devised elaborate systems involving long tapes and multiple recorders and playback systems, collectively processing the input of a live performer or ensemble. Audio engineers working in popular music quickly adapted similar techniques, to augment their use of plate reverb and other studio technologies designed to simulate natural echo. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, several sound engineers began making devices for use in recording studios and later more compact machines for live purposes. Guitarist and instrument designer Les Paul was an early pioneer in delay devices. A landmark device was the EchoSonic made by American Ray Butts. It is a portable guitar amplifier with a built-in tape echo, which became used widely in country music (Chet Atkins) and especially in rock and roll (Scotty Moore).|$|E
