30|$|In addition, {{although}} Time-to-Line Crossing (TLC) {{is considered}} to be a useful indicator in driving simulator trials, it is often difficult to measure it in real traffic conditions without a specially equipped research vehicle [41]. Also, if the lane markings do not match with the safe track of the vehicle, as this is perceived by the driver, invalid and difficult to interpret results are emerging [42]. Therefore, the average and the <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> were selected to be measured instead. The <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> was measured in addition to the average lateral deviation, because the later often leads to misleading results (i.e. a driver who often follows a straight track may have the same average lateral deviation with someone that systemically deviates from his/her track). Nevertheless, for the measurement of the lateral deviation, high definition sensors and constant lane width are required. Also, it was chosen to measure the average lateral deviation instead of the standard deviation of lateral deviation (which is being proposed by several researchers), since due to the relatively small differentiations, the standard deviation of lateral position is significantly related with the duration of the data [40], which is not long enough in our case.|$|E

So the airport and regulatory authorities try to get a solution imposing a fine to the aircraft which its actual trajectory differs from the nominal one more than a <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation.</b> But, which is the value of this deviation?. The current situation is that many operators have to pay {{a lot of money for}} exceeding a deviation which has been established without operational criteria.

40|$|Accidents {{statistics}} show that multiple-event accidents (MEAs) represent a considerable and increasing proportion of all vehicle traffic accidents. MEAs are characterized by having at least one vehicle subjected {{to more than one}} harmful event. MEAs now comprise approximately 25 % of all passenger vehicle accidents. This thesis aims to make systematic progress towards developing a vehicle Post Impact Control (PIC) function so as to avoid or mitigate any secondary event in MEAs. To characterize the vehicle motion control problems for PIC, a number of MEAs from an accident database were analyzed. Post impact vehicle dynamics were studied considering the overall accident scenarios of exemplar cases. Reduction of kinetic energy and path <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> were found to be most critical and beneficial for the vehicles after impacts. To understand the mechanism of influencing the post impact vehicle path, numerical optimization was applied to minimize the <b>maximum</b> path <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation.</b> It was found that effective control can be achieved across a wide range of kinematic conditions, by switching between three sub-strategies established at vehicle body level. Results also showed that active front-axle steering, in addition to individual-wheel braking, provides significant control benefits, although not for all post-impact kinematics. For closed-loop design of the path control, a Quasi-Linear Optimal Controller (QLOC) was proposed and verified with the numerical optimization results. The design method is novel – it well combines the linear co-states dynamics and nonlinear constraints due to tyre friction limits. The algorithm was further adapted to penalize both longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> path <b>deviations,</b> using a generalized cost function. To verify the function with driver interaction, a number of exploratory methods were investigated regarding the driver safety, as well as the capability and accuracy to reproduce the real-world post-impact vehicle kinematics. A scheme of the function design for real-time implementation was proposed and applied to the experiments in a driving simulator environment...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{statistics}} show that multiple-event accidents (MEAs) possess an increasing fraction of all vehicle traffic accidents. They are characterized by having at least one vehicle subjected {{to more than one}} harmful event, such as collision with another vehicle. MEAs now comprise approximately 25 % of all passenger vehicle accidents. The scope of the research presented in this thesis is to develop vehicle Post Impact Control (PIC) strategies in order to avoid or mitigate any secondary events in MEAs. To characterize the problematic areas for PIC, an analysis was conducted in an in-depth accident database: cars which have potentials to gain safety benefits from PIC were identified; several representative accident cases were selected; post impact vehicle dynamics were analyzed taking the overall accident scenario into account; benefit measures were determined for each case. It was found that reduction of kinetic energy and path <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> would be mostly beneficial under post impact circumstances. To analyze the capability of influencing vehicle path after the first impact, trajectory optimization was done using braking sequences which minimize the <b>maximum</b> path <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation.</b> It was found that effective control across the very wide range of post impact kinematic conditions can be significantly achieved by switching between three sub-strategies established on vehicle body level. The resulting interventions were found to be qualitatively different to classical Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems, and also to interventions proposed in other studies on post-impact control which prioritize the minimization of any large post impact yaw rate or longitudinal velocity. For closed-loop implementation of the path controller, one of the three sub-strategies is particularly challenging: control of global lateral force and yaw moment simultaneously. A closed-loop quasi-linear optimal controller (QLOC) was proposed and verified against the trajectory optimization results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} vehicle path control directly after an initial light collision. Accident statistics have shown that 25 % of all passenger car accidents {{have at least one}} vehicle exposed to subsequent collisions after the initial one. In previous research, an optimal path controller has been designed to minimize the collision risk in terms of the <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> from the original path on a straight road. The present paper further develops the controller for minimizing the maximum off-tracking on curved roads. A simple cost function which penalizes a combination of longitudinal and lateral terminal velocity is applied to approximate the original cost function, i. e. maximum off-tracking in curve. The weighting factor in the cost function is adaptable in connection with the prescribed road curvature and vehicle post-impact kinematics states. This cost function is found to be favourable for the closed-loop implementation of the optimal control. Results from numerical optimizations have shown the equivalence between the two different cost functions, and satisfactory performance of the closed-loop controller...|$|E

Two basic skills are identified as underdeveloped in the robots participating in the 1999 RoboCup competition: Vision and agility. The goal of this research project {{is to develop a}} robot equipped with these two skills. All aspects of the robot being a mechatronic system are covered, including an omnidirectional propulsion system, an omnidirectional vision system, and a simple ball handling mechanism for dribbling a soccer ball. Video cameras are used as sensors, and a video image recognition algorithm is developed that computes both robot and ball position. A robust trajectory planning algorithm based on a global coordinate system is developed. It computes a robot trajectory surrounding a set of control points in given orientations, accounting for the interaction between robot and ball. A controller closes the feedback loop from sensors to actuators keeping the robot on its predetermined course. An experimental validation examines sensor accuracy, performance of actuators and controllers, and the overall skill to dribble a ball along a given trajectory. The vision system computes both robot and ball position 25 times per second. The average error of the robot position is below 10 mm, the average error of the ball position is below 5 percent of the ball's distance from the robot. All driving tests are carried out using a benchmark slalom course. The actuators behave as expected according to their specifications, they allow dynamic driving with longitudinal and lateral accelerations of up to 4 m/s². In that extreme case, the controllers manage the robot to stay on its course with <b>maximum</b> total and <b>lateral</b> <b>deviations</b> below 0. 25 m and 0. 1 m, respectively.

40|$|The thesis further {{develops}} a Post Impact Stability Control (PISC) function {{so as to}} improve the performance to avoid multiple-event accidents. The function is integrated in a vehicle dynamics control architecture. The high-level control target is set to minimize the <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> from the initial desired path. This is achieved by integrating an active steering control strategy with the existing electronic stability control function (ESC). The control task is realized by active control of front steering angle and individual wheel braking. The integrated PISC function is verified across various post-impact kinematics conditions, using a high-fidelity vehicle simulation model in CarMaker®. A vehicle states estimator is designed using a simplified 3 -DOF two-track vehicle model. This estimator is essential for testing real-time implementation concepts. It was found that a well-estimated vehicle lateral velocity is important to guarantee a well-performed PISC function. The controller is also compared favourably to the other benchmark functions, i. e. PIB and PISC(without integration of ESC). Towards real-time implementation, two active steering configurations are simulated: Steer-by-Wire and Electronic Power Assist Steer (EPAS).

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} in vivo study was to {{evaluate}} whether a difference exists between the maxilla and the mandible regarding the precision of implant placement utilizing a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) -derived mucosa-supported stereolithographic (SLA) template. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty implants (44 maxilla, 36 mandible) were placed in 18 fully edentulous jaws (10 maxillas, eight mandibles) using a mucosa-supported SLA surgical template. A voxel-based registration technique was applied to match the postoperative and preoperative CBCT scans. RESULTS: Vertical deviation (p[*]=[*]. 026) at the implant hex and angular deviation (p[*]=[*]. 0188) were significantly lower in the maxilla than in the mandible. The global linear deviation and lateral deviation at the implant hex were not significantly different. At the implant apex, the average maximum vertical deviation was within 1 [*]mm (0. 1 - 4. 6 [*]mm). The average <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> was 1. 8 [*]mm (0. 9 - 5. 5 [*]mm) in the maxilla and 2. 3 [*]mm (0. 5 - 5. 5 [*]mm) in the mandible when a 15 -mm-long implant was placed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal {{control of a}} vehicle, after a light impact during a traffic accident. To {{reduce the risk of}} {{secondary}} events, the control target is set: to minimize the <b>maximum</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> from the initial path. In previous analysis path control was achieved by the active control of individual wheel braking. The present paper examines potential benefits from the additional control of front steering angles. Numerical optimization is used to determine optimal control sequences for both actuator configurations. It is found that steering provides significant control benefits, though not for all post-impact kinematics. For all cases considered, the optimal control operates at the boundary of the control domain of available forces and moments. This domain is expanded when steering is available, and there exists an expanded range of conditions for which coupled control of yaw moments and lateral forces is the most effective control strategy. The sensitivity of vehicle response to the individual actuator controls is studied; it reveals this sensitivity is related to the actuator bandwidth and the lack of any dynamic cost in the longitudinal direction. This motivates a further analysis which includes longitudinal and lateral dynamics in the cost function. This is broadly related to real-world crash risks. Further, different versions of such cost functions are compared as a basis for implementation in a closed-loop controller...|$|E

However, existing research {{appears to be}} contradictory regarding the direction of this deviation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to gain more insight into the walking trajectory of neglect patients. Twelve right hemisphere stroke patients (six neglect, six no neglect), eight left hemisphere stroke patients (none neglect) and 10 healthy control subjects were instructed to walk towards a target while a two-dimensional ultrasonic positioning system recorded their walking trajectory. Patients' recovery of walking ability was assessed and they were tested for the presence of neglect. Neglect patients showed a larger <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> in their walking trajectory compared to stroke patients without neglect or controls. Neglect patients with good walking ability showed a deviation to the contralesional side. Neglect patients with limited walking ability showed a deviation to the ipsilesional side. Within the neglect group we found no relation between the severity of neglect and <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation.</b> Differences in walking ability may account for the contradictory results between studies regarding the <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> in neglect patients' walking trajectory. We suggest that when a neglect patient's walking ability is limited, walking towards a target becomes a dual task: heading control and walking. A limited walking ability will cause a higher task priority of walking compared to heading control. This shift in task priority may be causing the change in walking trajectory deviation.
