Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> good at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made him think of her as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{attempted}} {{to patch up}} the marriage in January 1951 by inviting Northrup and baby Alexis to Palm Springs, California where he had rented a house. The situation soon became tense again; Richard de Mille, nephew of the famous director Cecil B. de Mille, recalled that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} turmoil and dissension in the Foundation at the time; he kept accusing Communists of trying to take control and he was having difficulties with Northrup. It was clear their marriage was breaking up – she was very critical of him and he told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fooling around with Hollister and he didn't trust her." [...] Hubbard enlisted de Mille and another Dianeticist, Dave Williams, in an attempt to convince her to stay with him. John Sanborne, who worked with Hubbard for many years, recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|She {{personally}} {{taught her}} own children and exposed them to new ideas and inventions. She gave lessons to her younger son, Louis, until he was ten years of age. He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, {{and she had the}} great gift of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family. And she was also entirely free from prejudice about politics or colour and things of that kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Two Swedish {{models were}} {{cast as the}} Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams. Ekland had been {{interested}} in playing a Bond girl since she had seen Dr. No, and contacted the producers about the main role of Mary Goodnight. Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because [...] "she was elegant and beautiful {{that it seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the perfect Bond girl". When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for The Man with the Golden Gun, she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role, as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's [...] "generous looks" [...] made her a good contrast to Adams. Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on Diamonds Are Forever, to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga {{at the start of the}} film, because he found it an interesting idea to [...] "put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand".|$|E
500|$|Six {{months later}} he was in back in Ireland, and in August Olivia was visiting Valentine Fox with her husband where she {{received}} news of her father's death. She left for an extended stay in Torquay where she stayed until September before leaving for a visit to Scotland with her husband. Yeats left Ireland for Paris to visit Maud in November, and {{did not return to}} London until January 1897, with Maud following close behind and arriving in London in February. Yeats wrote of Maud's visit: [...] "Maud wrote to <b>me...</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in London & would I come to dine. I dined with her & my trouble increased—she certainly had no thought of the mischief she was doing– & at last one morning.... found my mood did not answer hers and & burst into tears—'There is someone else in your heart' she said. It was the breaking between us for many years". The affair ended that spring when Yeats again returned to Ireland. Olivia did not visit him again at Woburn Place for many years, according to Yeats biographer Richard Ellmann.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final home, Garden Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his partner Jim Hutton, saying to her, [...] "You would have been my wife {{and it would have been}} yours anyway." [...] Mercury was also the godfather of Austin's oldest son, Richard.|$|E
500|$|... "There's {{a spirit}} there that's just very {{interesting}} to <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> charming {{and there was something}} about her so intriguing to watch", stated Rhimes in response to Pomepo's portrayal of her character. Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was going to focus on the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back." [...] In response to Izzie's arc, Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette's death will have on her, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the song}} was first released, Rick Melbourne, a breakfast radio announcer, {{produced}} a parody version of the song, including the lyrics [...] "God help me, she told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sixteen".

[...] After she left my office because {{she was unable to}} meet <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> kidnapped 300 meters from my office. We are against violence by any group, and we call the government and U.S. forces to stop raiding houses, arresting women.

2500|$|Being {{the son of}} Ali Bourguiba and Fattouma Khefacha, who was 40 when he was born, Bourguiba {{stated that}} his mother was ashamed to {{conceive}} a child at that late age, her last pregnancy being seven years old at the time. Meanwhile, his father wondered whether he could raise his son at this old age. Habib Bourguiba later described his birth in these words: [...] "When she conceived me, it was for her, the unfortunate, a catastrophe. She was already forty years old. Many of her pregnancies weakened her. I was told that when she gave birth to <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so ashamed of having a child at that age that she stifled her cries for deliverance while gritting her teeth with a towel placed in her mouth. Nevertheless, she was relieved to give birth to a boy, avoiding the catastrophe that would have been that of a girl. That was how Habib Bourguiba, last of his siblings was born.|$|E
2500|$|Ewa Podleś {{likewise}} {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{enough to hear}} her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything {{in front of my}} eye." [...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's [...] "scantily clad" [...] attire {{has been}} commented {{on in the}} British tabloid press, with Tony Stewart from [...] the Daily Mirror {{suggesting}} that Gemma Bissix might [...] "turn up in Albert Square starkers next". In May 2008, Clare was shown dressed as Princess Leia, and according to Stewart she looked like [...] "a porno version" [...] of the Star Wars character, [...] "in white hot pants and a skimpy top that [...] her galactic orbs to bounce about". In {{an article in the}} Daily Mail, the journalist suggested that the character had quickly made a name for herself [...] "thanks to her plunging necklines and knee-high boots [...] dressed in a tight, short silver dress and fishnet tights [...] her love of fitted clothes has attracted the attention of many of Albert Square's male residents." [...] Commenting on her character's revealing clothing, Bissix has said, [...] "I wasn't aware {{she was going to be}} so scantily clad. I knew she was going to be a minx but not that she was going to wear so little so often. Samantha Janus [...] told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in low-cut tops all the time when she started so I think it's a bit of an initiation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her acting was {{no great}} things, they say-—ladylike, but frightened. Her voice is lovely, and as to her looks-—people rave about them. Tell <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not Lady Travis Underwood's daughter?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1923 and 1924, Delysia made further Broadway appearances, in The Courtesan, {{a musical}} comedy, {{and in the}} Shubert revue, Topics of 1924. In 1925 she {{returned}} to the Cochran stable, starring in his revue On With the Dance, much of which was written and composed by Noël Coward. During rehearsals for the show, Cochran disliked Coward's song [...] "Poor Little Rich Girl", written for Delysia, and he wanted to cut it. He backed down in the face of implacable resistance from the author and the performer, and it became Coward's first hit song. Delysia became proprietarial about the number, and was outraged when Coward contemplated giving it to Gertrude Lawrence to sing in New York. Harding writes, [...] "'Noel', she screamed with excellent command of idiom if not of accent, 'is a sheet and a boogairr.'" [...] Coward later wrote of Delysia, [...] "Everything she did she did well, with a satisfying authority and assurance. She was occasionally temperamental and flew into a few continental rages but to <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> always easy to work with and extremely agreeable." [...] Cochran, too, found Delysia a congenial colleague; in his several volumes of autobiography he makes many references to her loyalty and good nature.|$|E
2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day I was born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I just think it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E
2500|$|Her 1977 {{appearance}} {{on the cover of}} Time magazine under the banner [...] "Torchy Rock" [...] was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock. At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear, Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover, and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image {{she did not want to}} project. In 2004, she was interviewed for CBS This Morning and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, [...] "Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her Svengali. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> everything that feminism's about." [...] Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a [...] "negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold". Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the Time cover did not appear to help the situation.|$|E
