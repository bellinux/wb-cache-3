40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> have been {{investigated}} {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. Most of these therapies use thermal energy to ablate prostatic tissue. The major common problem with all these new <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> has been the lack of long-term data concerning efficacy, re-intervention rates and side-effects.

40|$|Portal biliopathy (PB) {{can involve}} the whole biliary system and this article mainly {{introduces}} extrahepatic PB {{that involves the}} extrahepatic bile duct, the cystic duct, and the gallbladder. This disease is relatively rare in clinical practice, and most doctors {{do not have enough}} knowledge of this disease. Since this disease involves the rich vascular systems and the fine biliary system, its therapeutic regimens should be selected carefully; improper therapeutic regimens may easily cause massive hemorrhage and bile duct injury, make patients' conditions worse, and even threaten their lives. At present, there is still no standard flow chart for the treatment of PB around the world. Endoscopic therapy and surgical interventional treatment are commonly used <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> in clinical practice. This article reviews the pathogenesis of PB and <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> currently used in clinical practice, in order to provide a basis for scientific diagnosis and treatment of this disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{benign prostatic hypertrophy}} (BPH) causing bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms increases with our ageing population. Treatment of BPH traditionally begins with medical therapy and surgical intervention is then considered for those whose symptoms progress despite treatment. <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgical <b>therapies</b> have been developed as an intermediary {{in the treatment of}} BPH with the aim of decreasing the invasiveness of interventions. These therapies also aim to reduce morbidity and dysfunction related to invasive surgical procedures. Multiple treatment options exist in this group including mechanical and thermo-ablative strategies. Emerging therapies utilizing differing technologies range from the established to the experimental. We review the current literature related to these <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> and the evidence of their effectiveness in treating BPH. The role of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgical <b>therapies</b> in the treatment of BPH is still yet to be strongly defined. Given the experimental nature of many of the modalities, further study is required prior to their recommendation as alternatives to <b>invasive</b> surgical <b>therapy.</b> More mature evidence is required for the analysis of durability of effect of these therapies to make robust conclusions of their effectiveness...|$|R

30|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a primary}} malignant tumor of the liver that accounts for an important health problem worldwide. Only 10 – 15 % of HCC patients are suitable candidates for hepatic resection and liver transplantation due to the advanced stage of the disease at time of diagnosis and shortage of donors. Therefore, several <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> image-guided <b>therapies</b> for locoregional treatment have been developed. Tumor ablative techniques are either based on thermal tumor destruction, as in radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation, laser ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound, or chemical tumor destruction, as in percutaneous ethanol injection. Image-guided catheter-based techniques rely on intra-arterial delivery of embolic, chemoembolic or radioembolic agents. These <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> image-guided <b>therapies</b> have revolutionized the management of inoperable HCC. This review provides a description of all <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> image-guided <b>therapies</b> currently available, an up-to-date overview of the scientific evidence for their clinical use, and thoughts for future directions.|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis (IPN) is {{a challenging}} complication of acute pancreatitis {{and can lead}} to poor prognosis. Over the years, open necrosectomy has become the main treatment modality for IPN, but it will cause high incidence rate of complications and mortality rate. In recent years, with the rapid development of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> surgery, many scholars have performed <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> treatment for IPN patients and achieved good outcomes. This article introduces five <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> treatment techniques, i. e., percutaneous catheter drainage, <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> retroperitoneal necrosectomy, endoscopic drainage+necrosectomy, laparoscopic necrosectomy, and “advanced” therapeutic strategy, pointed out that different <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> techniques had different indications, and <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> should be selected based on IPN patients′general conditions to improve their outcome...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the fight against cancer. It focuses on patients with hepatic malignancies. Interventional oncology (IO) is a rapidly evolving sub-speciality of interventional radiology with an increasing role in the management of cancer patients. Over the past two decades interventional radiologists together with scientists have ridding the tidal wave of technological innovation to introduce multiple novel cancer treatments. IO procedures are <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive,</b> targeted <b>therapies</b> that are associated with low complication rates and short hospital admissions. Such therapies offer clear advantages over surgical procedures and intense chemotherapeutic regimes that put a larger burden on both the health care budget and patients. In this thesis several novel <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>therapies</b> are investigated. PART I focuses on image-guided percutaneous RFA. PART II discusses transarterial liver therapies, such as transarterial chemoembolisation, radioembolisation and percutaneous hepatic perfusion. PART III investigates ways to improve the management of patients that undergo IO procedures...|$|R
