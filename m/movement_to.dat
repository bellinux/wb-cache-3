5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing <b>movement</b> <b>to</b> attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and {{convince}} them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist <b>movement,</b> <b>to</b> join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E

In the Las Vegas sportsbook, betting against first <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> favorites and betting with last <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> underdogs generates statistically significant profits. The offshore sports-book appears to be efficient, with the only strategy generating positive, but insignificant returns, being betting against first <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> favorites.
