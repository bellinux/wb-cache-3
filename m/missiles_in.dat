5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense {{confrontation}} between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> Cuba. On October 22, 1962, Admiral Horacio Rivero was {{the commander of the}} American fleet sent by President John F. Kennedy to set up a quarantine (blockade) of the Soviet ships. On October 28, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered the removal of the Soviet <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> Cuba, and Kennedy ordered an end of the quarantine of Cuba on November 20, bringing an end to the crisis.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense {{confrontation}} between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> Cuba. On October 22, 1962, Admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr. was {{the commander of the}} American fleet sent by President John F. Kennedy to set up a quarantine (blockade) of the Soviet ships.

Admiral Rivero later served as U.S. Ambassador to Spain (1972–75).|$|E
5|$|The ship's main air-defence {{armament}} {{is composed}} of two 4x8-cell vertical launching systems (VLS) allowing for up to 32 Barak 8 (medium-long range) air-defence <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> addition, four AK-630 CIWS are fitted for close-in defence.|$|E
25|$|Observation Island was the {{platform}} for the first at-sea firing of the Polaris <b>missile</b> <b>in</b> 1959 and also {{the platform}} for first at-sea firing of the Poseidon <b>missile</b> <b>in</b> 1969. In 2014, the ship {{was one of two}} Missile Range Instrumentation Ships that had been operated by the Military Sealift Command.|$|R

5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> that {{they are designed to}} loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E
5|$|Project Emily was the {{deployment}} of American-built Thor intermediate-range ballistic <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom between 1959 and 1963. Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command operated 60 Thor missiles, dispersed to 20 RAF air stations, {{as part of the}} UK nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|With the {{background}} of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the deployment of Soviet RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 10minutes' striking distance from Moscow.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 22 Italian Tornados were {{deployed}} in the NATO-organised Operation Allied Force over Kosovo in 1999, the IDS variant {{was used in the}} bombing role while the ECR variants patrolled the combat region, acting to suppress enemy anti-aircraft radars, firing 115 AGM-88 HARM <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> response to anticipated violence during the 2010 Afghanistan elections, Italy, along with several other nations, increased its military commitment in Afghanistan, dispatching four IDS Tornados to the region.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Lehnsherr is {{tracking}} down Schmidt, while Xavier graduates from the University of Oxford. In Las Vegas, CIA officer Moira MacTaggert follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Schmidt (now known as Sebastian Shaw), with mutant telepath Emma Frost, cyclone-producing Riptide, and teleporter Azazel. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the Joint War Room, Hendry advocates deployment of nuclear <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> Turkey. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.|$|E

5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> West Germany. This {{deployment}} would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Royal Navy Lynxes {{worked in}} {{combination}} with US Seahawks during the Gulf War. The American helicopters lacked an effective anti-ship missile, but had superior surveillance capability compared to the British Lynx. They would locate hostile boats for the British helicopters, which would then attack the target with its Sea Skua <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> total, Lynx helicopters flew nearly 600sorties during the Gulf War, while their crews and engineers maintained flying rates three times their norm.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> combat against the Allied forces. The missiles arrived too late to alter {{the course of the}} war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction by providing each superpower with Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles that could carry nuclear warheads.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E
5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} well, {{there were signs}} that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev told Mikoyan of {{his idea}} of {{shipping}} Soviet missiles to Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet <b>missiles.</b> <b>In</b> early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E
5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range <b>missiles</b> <b>in</b> Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.|$|E
