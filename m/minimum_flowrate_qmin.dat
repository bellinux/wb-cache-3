This paper emphasizes that the cheapest MSA is not necessarily the one with the lowest cost per unit mass of MSA, but rather the one with the lowest overall cost of removal of the mass load, which depends on both the MSA cost and its permissible concentration change. It also demonstrates the importance of consideration of the composition levels of the MSAs in relation to the target compositions of the rich streams and to the capital cost implications of the resulting mass transfer driving forces. In this respect the use of the GCC is superior to procedures developed so far. We illustrate the principles presented by application to two example problems...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a revised methodology to minimise pressure drop through a steam system heat exchanger network (HEN). This {{is based on}} previous work where network pressure drop is minimised after utility flow through the network {{has been reduced to}} its minimum. With the minimum utility flow as a parameter, the proposed methodology enlarges the solution space of the problem in an attempt to find a better pressure drop solution. The resulting minimum pressure drop found using this method is an improvement of 1. 1 % and 7. 4 %, in two case studies respectively, on the current HEN minimisation problem formulation. The method is then extended to maintain boiler efficiency with the same <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate.</b> Due to the simpler nature of the problem of maintaining boiler efficiency the proposed methodology did not yield improvements to the steam flowrate however a wider variety of network configurations was found. The steam flowrate to a HEN can be substantially reduced with the application of process integration. Reducing the steam flowrate to the HEN involves creating series heat exchanger connections, which ultimately increase the pressure drop to the system. The reduced steam flowrate also compromises the return condensate temperature and consequently reduces the efficiency of the steam boiler. A HEN optimisation and design methodology exists whereby the <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate</b> to a heating utility system can be found and the pressure drop through the HEN can be minimised. This methodology does not however incorporate the full solution space of potential network configurations. This is as a result of network conditions of optimality which fix the outlet temperature of condensate streams leaving heat exchangers in order to achieve a globally optimal <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate.</b> The <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate</b> can still be achieved by relaxing the optimality conditions and allowing for variable heat exchanger outlet temperatures. Solutions of this nature are referred to as degenerate and are formulated with bilinear terms forming part of the energy balance constraints. The presence of bilinear terms results in a nonlinear, nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The bilinear terms are catered for in the methodology by the reformulation and linearisation technique of Quesada and Grossmann (1995) as well as the transformation and convexification technique of Pörn et al (2008). The reformulation and linearisation approach proved to be the most successful for the proposed problem. By utilising the larger solution space created by incorporating degenerate solutions into the HEN design process, many HEN design variables can potentially be further optimised once a <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate</b> has been achieved. Consequently, this thesis concerns the optimisation of a steam system HEN by finding the <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate</b> to the system and using it as a parameter while relaxing the conditions of network optimality to create solutions which can be degenerate. The complexities of MINLPs in the degenerate solutions are explored and a methodology to further optimise network pressure drop through heating networks is proposed. The methodology was also used to maintain boiler efficiency with a reduced steam flowrate which was achieved, but not improved upon from previous methodologies. While this methodology does not guarantee an improved HEN pressure drop, solutions adhering to the conditions of network optimality also fall within the solution space of the proposed methodology, therefore solutions achieved with current techniques from literature will not be compromised.

40|$|Historically, it {{has been}} assumed that the inlet and outlet low {{activity}} waste plenums would be designed such that a nearly uniform velocity profile would be maintained at every axial cross-section (i. e., providing nearly 100 percent use of the resin bed). With this proposed design, we see a LAW outlet distributor that results in significant non-axial velocity gradients in the bottom regions of the bed {{with the potential to}} reduce the effectiveness'' of the overall resin bed. The magnitude of this efficiency reduction depends upon how far up-gradient of the LAW outlet these non-axial velocities persist and to what extent a ''dead-zone'' is established beneath the LAW outlet. This can impact loading and elution performance of the ion-exchange facility. Currently, no experimental studies are planned. The primary objective of this work was, through modeling, to assess the fluid dynamic impact on ''effective'' resin volume of the full-scale column based on its normal operation using a recently proposed LAW outlet distributor. The analysis effort was limited to 3 -D flow only analyses (i. e., no follow on transport analyses) with 3 -D particle tracking to approximate the impact that a nonaxial velocity profile would have on bed ''effectiveness''.

40|$|Steam is {{a commonplace}} utility in {{chemical}} processing plants across the globe. The many benefits of steam ensure its continued use, but {{concerns about the}} cost of energy and of the equipment associated with steam systems has {{led to the development of}} a number of techniques to reduce energy and capital costs. One such topic is the reduction of boiler purchase cost, brought about by a reduction in steam flowrate. Recent publications have shown that the flowrate of steam required for heating purposes can be minimised by employing hot liquid reuse, with systematic methods developed for targeting the <b>minimum</b> <b>flowrate,</b> and synthesising the heat exchanger network. In this work, a mathematical analysis has been performed to gain insight on how choosing different steam levels affects the <b>minimum</b> total steam <b>flowrate.</b> The analysis covered both the traditional practice of only utilising latent heat, as well as the new practice of hot liquid reuse. It was found that the lowest flowrate obtainable occurs in the case of hot liquid reuse, when only a single high pressure steam level is considered. Since the need to provide shaft work or generate electricity necessitates the presence of steam turbines on plants, the inclusion of additional steam levels is unavoidable. For this reason, a novel MINLP formulation was developed to provide a holistic coverage of the heat exchanger network and the power block. The purpose of the new formulation is to target the <b>minimum</b> total steam <b>flowrate,</b> whilst simultaneously selecting the optimum saturation temperatures for the additional steam levels, designing the turbines to meet shaft work requirements and synthesizing the heat exchanger network. Application of this new method to a case study yielded a 28. 6 % reduction in total steam flowrate, compared to common design practice. i I, Sheldon Grant Beangstrom, with student number 27069771, declare that:  I understand what plagiarism entails and am aware of the University of Pretoria‟s policy in this regard.  This dissertation is my own, original work.

The target system is a typical VAV system devoted to the ventilation, cooling and air conditioning functions. The procedure consists in a series of operations to be applied to the system, considered as a set of connected components and taking into account the following constraints: 1) time availability 2) intrinsic limitations of the system 3) reference performances. The proposed procedure is divided in two sets of actions: 1) a number of preliminary actions allowing to take the best benefit of the subsequent phases: a) identification of available measurement points b) identification of actuators characteristics c) identification of control strategies d) aeraulic network calculations e) selection of measurement techniques and experimental design 2) the verification tasks themselves: The philosophy of the verification process is to bring the system into a number of states which allowed each specific check to be carried out. The organisation of the procedure tries to optimize the time spent for commissioning by logically sequencing the operations according to the following order: 1) test in manual (ie not controlled by the BEMS) operation 2) test in manual (ie not controlled by the BEMS) stop 3) test in normal operation 4) test at maximum flowrate 5) test at <b>minimum</b> <b>flowrate</b> 6) test in automatic stop The paper will provide the specific operations to be carried out at each step and will illustrate the whole process with the prototyping work performed on the CA-MET building in Namur...|$|R
40|$|Feasibility {{study of}} the {{separation}} of azeotropic mixture chloroform – methanol by heterogeneous batch extractive distillation is checked for water as a heavy heterogeneous entrainer in a batch rectifier. The main peculiarity of this process compared with the well known heterogeneous azeotropic distillation process is the withdrawal of the saddle binary heteroazeotrope chloroform – water thanks to the continuous feeding of the entrainer at the column top. First, the feasibility study of heterogeneous extractive distillation is carried out for determining essential operating conditions such as <b>minimum</b> entrainer <b>flowrate</b> and the proper range of reflux ratio, which provide the expected top and bottom product composition in a batch rectifying column.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of an extractive distillation process {{relies on the}} choice of the extractive agent. In this contribution heuristic rules for entrainer selection and for the design of entrainers through computer-aided molecular design are reviewed first. The potential of the generated alternatives is then evaluated by their selectivity at infinite dilution and by the rectification body method (RBM). It is shown that a screening based on selectivity alone is not sufficient and could possibly lead to an unfavorable entrainer choice. The <b>minimum</b> entrainer <b>flowrate</b> and the <b>minimum</b> energy demand, calculated from the RBM, allow a more comprehensive evaluation of different entrainer alternatives. In a third step a rigorous MINLP optimization of the entire extractive flowsheet for the remaining entrainer candidates is executed to fix the remaining design degrees of freedom and to determine the best entrainer. Since a number of alternative entrainers have already been eliminated, only a few optimization runs are necessary. These steps form a framework which facilitates the systematic generation and evaluation of entrainer alternatives.

40|$|The {{development}} of a novel combined "ultrasonic/thermal" with "ultrasonic multiple reflections" clamp-on meter for measuring a wide flowrate range of clean liquids in small diameter pipes is presented. Current existing flowmeters based on ultrasound cannot measure very low flowrates for single phase liquids. The ultrasonic/thermal technique can measure single phase flows in the range 0 to 0. 6 m s' in pipes with diameters as small as 15 mm. It can also detect and measure reverse flows. The <b>minimum</b> <b>flowrate</b> for the ultrasonic multiple reflection technique is about 0. 55 m s', and theoretically, the measurement accuracy increases with increased flow velocity. The ultrasonic/thermal technique {{is based on a}} heating element and transducer pair(s) which can be clamped to the outside of a pipe. With the heaters switched on, the changes in the temperature of the pipe and the liquid inside it result in changes in transit time. The flowrate can be therefore estimated by either the transit time difference across the pipe at the two symmetric locations with respect to the heater centre, or at one location with a heater off/on comparison. The latter approach was felt to be the promising for low flowrate measurements and therefore selected for the numerical and the experimental investigations. The multiple reflection technique was developed based on the conventional transit time flowmeter. This technique extended the measuring range of the flowmeter and provided cross calibration for the ultrasonic/thermal technique. A computer model was developed for the ultrasonic multiple reflection technique. However, there was insufficient experimental data to confirm the computer prediction. Results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the meter are presented. For vertical pipes an axisymmetric model was used, but the presence of buoyancy forces required the use of a 3 -D model for horizontal pipes. Temperature and velocity distributions and ultrasonic transit times have been computed and are presented. In order to overcome the problem of mode conversion and refraction at the pipe wall/transducer mounting interface, novel transducers and mounting blocks are presented. A prototype heater and ultrasonic transducer system together with electronics for signal generation and transit time measurement have been designed and constructed. A hydraulic system has also been designed and constructed for testing the developed clamp-on flowmeter. Experimental results from this apparatus are presented and compared with the CFD predictions, and a technique for compensating for variations in inlet temperature is described.

40|$|Niro {{designed}} and built five near-identical milk evaporators for Fonterra’s production site at Clandeboye and five at the Edendale site. Tubes in the Clandeboye evaporators often fouled excessively and occasionally blocked, requiring water blasting to clear them. Large amounts of undesirable foam from milk were observed in the second effect of some evaporators. This {{was known to be}} related to fouling and early shutdowns. The fouling increased the cleaning chemical and utility usage, and the evaporator downtime. The problems were believed {{to be related to the}} liquid distribution system at the top of the tubes. Evaporator liquid distribution has received relatively little research but it has been shown that the efficiency of evaporation reduces when there is poor wetting. Some estimates were available from previous work for the <b>minimum</b> <b>flowrates</b> required to obtain a complete falling film inside a tube. Many tasks were performed to assess the performance of the liquid distribution systems. The minimum wetting rates of three different milks were found in a model evaporator tube under isothermal, heat transfer and evaporation conditions at 60 ºC. Numerous measurements of evaporators at Clandeboye were made to thoroughly analyse the evaporator performance. The overall heat transfer coefficients and wetting rates were calculated throughout the evaporators. Physical measurements were taken of the dimensions of the distribution systems in every evaporator. Many potential problems were found including warping, inconsistent hole sizes and fabrication faults. An analysis of the tube and distribution hole arrangements showed that every pass had some liquid misdistribution which was confirmed by a water trial. The evaporators were inspected before cleaning after 22 hours of whole milk production and after 5 hours of milk protein concentrate (MPC) production. There was considerable fouling at the bottom of some tubes that received low whole milk flows and large particles of MPC were blocking distribution plate holes. Observation and analysis showed that the foaming was likely to be caused by an upward flow of vapour from some passes which disrupted the downward flow of milk. As a result of this project there is sufficient confidence to justify modification of effects 2 and 4 of the evaporators. Sixteen tubes in effect 4 will be welded shut and the distribution systems in effects 2 and 4 will be redesigned to give a better liquid distribution. For effect 2, vertical tubes called ‘vapour risers’ should be installed to allow the vapour to flow upwards through the distribution plate without creating foam. The heights of the partitions dividing the effect 2 passes will be modified to encourage any foam in pass 1 to flow preferentially to pass 2. Installing a filter after the MPC direct steam injector will reduce the number of blocked distribution plate holes. Both modifications are expected to enable the evaporators to run continuously for 20 hours instead of 15 hours, giving up to 33 % fewer cleans. The cleaning costs are approximately $ 700 and milk losses are approximately $ 200 per clean. The modifications should save up to $ 438, 000, based on cleaning and water blasting in the 2003 - 2004 milk powder season.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Steam is commonly used as the hot utility in the processing industry. The common method of designing the hot utility heat exchanger network (HEN) is to place all of the heat exchangers in a parallel configuration, and to utilize the latent heat of saturated steam. Recent work has shown how process integration {{and the use of}} hot condensate can minimize the flowrate of steam through the hot utility. This leads to debottlenecking of the boiler in retrofit designs, or the ability to purchase a smaller and cheaper boiler in a grassroots design. The purpose of this work stems from two main observations. Firstly, the work in published literature has been limited largely to only a single steam level. Many plants have more than one level of steam available, especially if a portion of high level steam is used to operate a turbine which produces exhaust steam at a lower level. Secondly, most modern process integration is conducted as a black-box design using mathematical models. Not all engineers who might want to apply these techniques have access to the expensive solvers and computers required to solve these models. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to develop a graphical technique that will allow one to design a HEN for <b>minimum</b> steam <b>flowrate</b> in the presence of multiple steam levels. This will be useful both as an educational tool, and to enable engineers with limited access to facilities to apply these techniques using basic drawing packages. The methodology used to apply these techniques involves constructing a limiting feasible utility curve of the cold process streams, and then systematically shifting a number of utility lines to fulfill the energy requirements. In an illustrative example of a grassroots design, application of this synthesis method resulted in a 24 % reduction in steam flowrate, a 13 % reduction in the capital cost of the steam system and an 8 % reduction in the energy demanded from the boiler by the process. mp 201...|$|R

The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s <b>minimum</b> acceptable <b>flowrate</b> is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow rangeability, and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, impeller suction and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in running clearances and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total head, pump protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical seal peripheral?s design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety.

40|$|There were 5 {{control valves}} and 2 manual valves for the liquid {{nitrogen}} distribution system {{that needed to}} be sized and procured for the upgrade. This engineering note documents the calculations done to properly size these valves. A table summarizes the valve choices. The raw calculations are attached as an appendix. The calculations jump around a bit. No effort was made to re-organize or rewrite them for the reader. The sizing calcs. on Pages 1 through 4 were first pass calcs. based on pure liquid to the valves with no attention to flashing/choking. The calcs on pages 5 through 8 then refine the calculations by considering the LN 2 to the valve inlets to be two phase with quality of 0. 032. This is a real situation if the LN 2 subcooler is out of service for use as a He cooldown heat exchanger. Also, flashing would occur for this situation and is taken into account. The end result of this refinement pushed the Cv values up by about a factor of 3 over the initial calcs. of pages 1 through 4. The results of the refined (correct) calculations pages 5 through 8 appear in the table above. The required operating Cv's are smaller than commercially available LN 2 control valves. Therefore it has been decided to use Fermilab Saver type control valve assemblies with the valve bullet Cv 1 s listed above. The bullets are 100 : 1 equal percentage types and provide better control at the lower percentage of valve Cv values. See flow characteristic data and curve for these valves in appendix B. The manual valves will be commercially purchased, probably a Cryolab model CV 3 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CV 8 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CVI model V- 1060 - 050 -VJ. Pages 8 - 10 calculate a <b>minimum</b> required cooldown <b>flowrate</b> as referenced in Cryogenic Systems by Barron. This was done to be sure the valves and piping system did not choke the warm flow so much that cooldown could not be achieved. The minimum mass flow rate needed for a simultaneous, serial cooldown of the refrigerator, solenoid and VLPC system was 6. 4 g/s. This warm flow would get choked by an opening less than 0. 175 -inch in diameter. A valve with only 10 psi differential across it with this flowrate would need to be Cv= 0. 85. These numbers show that cooldown will be achievable. Firstly, the flow through these components is not serial. The flows get split and sent to vent separately. Secondly, the valves are located upstream of the heat load. And lastly, the Cv of the valves are larger than 0. 85 except for the solenoid which has a very low heat load/small flow split and the VLPC's. The VLPC flow split brings the minimal required Cv for a valve situated at the warm outlet of the LN 2 circuit to be 0. 26. I foresee no, problems cooling down the LN 2 components...|$|R
