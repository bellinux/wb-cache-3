40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the asynchronous torque components (average cage, <b>magnet</b> <b>braking</b> torque and pulsating) for a single-phase capacitor-start, capacitor-run permanent magnet motor. The computed envelope of pulsating torque superimposed over the average electromagnetic torque leads to an accurate prediction of starting torque. The developed approach is realized by means of a combination of symmetrical components and d-q axes theory and it can be extended for any m-phase AC motor - induction, synchronous reluctance or synchronous permanent magnet. The resultant average electromagnetic torque is determined by superimposing the asynchronous torques and <b>magnet</b> <b>braking</b> torque effects...|$|R

50|$|Both {{power off}} brakes are {{considered}} to be engaged when no power is applied to them. They are typically required to hold or to stop alone {{in the event of a}} loss of power or when power is not available in a machine circuit. Permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>brakes</b> have a very high torque for their size, but also require a constant current control to offset the permanent magnetic field. Spring applied brakes do not require a constant current control, they can use a simple rectifier, but are larger in diameter or would need stacked friction disks to increase the torque.|$|R
5000|$|Power off brakes stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The bulk {{of these}} {{features}} are concentrated {{at the base of}} the attraction; foremost among these is the tower's permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>braking</b> system. Using the principles of magnetism, these brakes slow down the falling gondola gently, yet rapidly, without actually contacting the gondola. These magnets do not require electricity to produce their magnetic fields, and as such they are able to function even in the event of a total power failure. Lastly, pneumatic plungers [...] "catch" [...] the slowly descending gondola and allow it to settle to the tower base. Like the magnetic brakes, these plungers do not require power to function properly. Acrophobia requires the rider to be at least fifty-four inches tall.|$|R

It has high-speed air brakes which were original equipment on the F-104; high-speed drogue parachutes deployed at 700 mph; and low-speed drogue parachutes deployed once the speed drops to below 350 mph. The vehicle also has an Anti-skid neodymium rare-earth <b>magnet</b> eddy-current <b>brake.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{changing}} {{magnetic field}} will induce eddy currents in the conductor. These currents will dissipate {{energy in the}} conductor and generate drag force. It is found that Aluminium is the best material as conductor compared to Copper and Zinc. Also, {{it is found that}} the larger thickness of disc, more number of turns of electromagnet and higher electrical conductivity of conductor influences the generation of greater <b>braking</b> torque. Permanent <b>magnet</b> eddy current <b>brake</b> uses Neodymium – Iron – Boron (NdFeB) magnets. The analysis of permanent magnet eddy current shows that the parallel magnetised eddy current topology has the superior braking torque capability. In electrically controlled eddy current braking system subjected to time varying fields in different wave forms, the triangular wave field application resulted in highest braking torque. Electromagnetic brakes were found to interfere with the signalling and train control system. Permanent <b>magnet</b> eddy current <b>brakes</b> are a simple and reliable alternative to mechanical or electromagnetic brakes in transportation applications. Greater the speed greater is the eddy current braking efficiency. Hence, author intends to work on the development and investigation of permanent <b>magnet</b> eddy current <b>braking</b> system...|$|R
50|$|Permanent magnet type - A {{permanent}} <b>magnet</b> holding <b>brake</b> {{looks very}} similar to a standard power applied electromagnetic brake. Instead of squeezing a friction disk, via springs, it uses permanent magnets to attract a single face armature. When the brake is engaged, the permanent magnets create magnetic lines of flux, which can in turn attract the armature to the brake housing. To disengage the brake, power {{is applied to the}} coil which sets up an alternate magnetic field that cancels out the magnetic flux of the permanent magnets.|$|R
50|$|For {{permanent}} <b>magnet</b> motors, dynamic <b>braking</b> {{is easily}} achieved by shorting the motor terminals, thus bringing the motor to a fast abrupt stop. This method, however, dissipates {{all the energy}} as heat in the motor itself, and so cannot be used in anything other than low-power intermittent applications due to cooling limitations. It is not suitable for traction applications.|$|R
40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} braking system and method is provided for selectively braking a motor using an electromagnetic brake having an electromagnet, a permanent magnet, a rotor assembly, and a brake pad. The brake assembly applies when the electromagnet is de-energized and releases when the electromagnet is energized. When applied the permanent <b>magnet</b> moves the <b>brake</b> pad into frictional engagement with a housing, and when released the electromagnet cancels the flux {{of the permanent}} magnet to allow a leaf spring to move the brake pad away from the housing. A controller has a DC/DC converter for converting a main bus voltage to a lower braking voltage based on certain parameters. The converter utilizes pulse-width modulation (PWM) to regulate the braking voltage. A calibrated gap is defined between the brake pad and permanent <b>magnet</b> when the <b>brake</b> assembly is released, and may be dynamically modified via the controller...|$|R
40|$|Neodymium – Iron – Boron (NdFeB) {{permanent}} magnets of 12. 5 mm thickness and 50 mm diameter are chosen for analyses {{because of their}} higher remanence and coercivity. Experimental analyses were carried out with Copper discs of thickness 4 mm, 6 mm and 8 mm at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, 4000 rpm and 5000 rpm. Experiments were conducted with three different positions of magnets such as 2 coaxial magnets, single magnet and single magnet with sudden application conditions. The brake parameters recorded are % speed reduction, deceleration and time taken. In 2 coaxial <b>magnets</b> condition, <b>brake</b> parameters are better in 6 mm thick disc. In single <b>magnet</b> condition, the <b>brake</b> parameters in 6 mm thick disc {{are found to be}} more consistent than 4 mm and 8 mm thick discs. In single magnet with sudden application condition, in 4 mm thick disc, the brake parameters are found better. During analysis, very high repulsion was experienced by magnet with 8 mm thick Copper disc at all the above mentioned speeds in single magnet with sudden application condition. For high speed train applications, single magnet condition with 6 mm thick disc may be suitable. For high speed automotive applications, single magnet with sudden application condition with 4 mm thick disc may be suitable...|$|R
5000|$|An {{eddy current}} brake {{consists}} of a conductive piece of metal, either a straight bar or a disk, which moves through the magnetic field of a magnet, either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. When it moves past the stationary magnet, the magnet exerts a drag force on the metal which opposes its motion, due to circular electric currents called eddy currents induced in the metal by the magnetic field. Note that the conductive sheet is not made of ferromagnetic metal such as iron or steel; usually copper or aluminum are used, which are not attracted to a <b>magnet.</b> The <b>brake</b> does not work by the simple attraction of a ferromagnetic metal to the magnet.|$|R

40|$|Road {{and rail}} {{vehicles}} and aircraft rely mainly or solely on friction brakes. These brakes pose several problems, especially in hybrid vehicles: significant wear, fading, complex and slow actuation, lack of fail-safe features, increased fuel consumption due to power assistance, and requirement for anti-lock controls. To solve these problems, a contactless magnetic brake has been developed. This concept includes a novel flux-shunting structure {{to control the}} excitation flux generated by permanent <b>magnets.</b> This <b>brake</b> is wear-free, less-sensitive to temperature than friction brakes, has fast and simple actuation, and has a reduced sensitivity to wheel-lock.

25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the <b>braking</b> <b>magnet,</b> causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|R
