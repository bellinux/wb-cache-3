40|$|<b>Melanomas</b> develop due to {{malignant}} {{transformation of}} melanocytes, which {{are derived from}} the neuroectoderm. Although the majority of <b>melanomas</b> are cutaneous, they occasionally arise from extra-cutaneous tissues as well which contain melanocytes, such as uvea, leptomeninges, or the mucosa. <b>Melanomas</b> can be melanotic or amelanotic. Approximately, 15 - 20 % of all malignant <b>melanomas</b> arise in head and neck region and over 80 % of these involve the skin. Mucosal malignant <b>melanomas</b> are very rare and may affect the upper aero-digestive tract (UADT). Their incidence is approximately as low as 0. 5 - 3 % of all malignant <b>melanomas.</b> Majority of noncutaneous head and neck malignant <b>melanomas</b> affect the ocular origin and only 6 - 8 % originate in the mucous membranes of the UADT. Nasal mucosal <b>melanomas</b> account for < 1 % of all <b>melanomas</b> and < 5 % of all nasal tract neoplasms. The incidence of amelanotic <b>melanomas</b> (AMs) has been estimated to be between 1. 8 and 8. 1 % of all <b>melanomas.</b> We present a case of 62 -year-old lady presenting with epistaxis and a mass in left nasal cavity, diagnosed as AM and managed by wide local excision and primary reconstruction in our institution...|$|R
40|$|Background Uveal <b>melanomas</b> {{can develop}} in the choroid, ciliary body and iris. In choroidal and ciliary body <b>melanomas,</b> {{specific}} chromosomal changes correlate with metastatic disease. Iris <b>melanomas</b> have a better prognosis than choroidal <b>melanomas,</b> {{and it would be}} interesting to know if they share chromosomal changes. In addition, iris <b>melanomas</b> might harbour UV-induced mutations of tumour suppressor genes, such as PTEN and CDKN 2 A. Methods Twenty iris <b>melanomas</b> were analysed for chromosome 1 p, 3, 6, 8, 9 p and 10 q abnormalities using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. These results were correlated to clinical follow-up data using statistical analyses...|$|R
5000|$|Uveal tumors can {{originate}} from melanocytes residing within the iris. Benign melanocytic tumors, such as iris freckles and moles (nevi), are common and pose no health risks, unless they {{show signs of}} malignancy, in which case they are classified as iris <b>melanomas.</b> Though derived from uveal melanocytes, iris <b>melanomas</b> share {{more in common with}} cutaneous (skin) <b>melanomas,</b> in that they frequently harbor BRAF mutations associated with ultraviolet damage. [...] Iris <b>melanomas</b> are much less likely to metastasize than other uveal <b>melanomas,</b> and less likely to impair vision if detected and treated early. Approximately 5% of uveal <b>melanomas</b> involve the iris.|$|R
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being <b>melanoma</b> of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because <b>melanoma</b> {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E

The prognosis is not worse than that of <b>melanomas</b> with the same thickness, mitotic rate, or presence of ulceration on other sites. <b>Melanomas</b> of the nail apparatus behave similar to <b>melanomas</b> in other localizations.

40|$|<b>Melanomas</b> are {{the most}} common oral {{malignancy}} in dogs. Cell proliferation and connexin expression has been shown to differ in canine melanotic and amelanotic oral <b>melanomas.</b> This study aimed to analyze the c-Kit protein expression in melanotic and amelanotic <b>melanomas</b> from canine buccal cavity. A total of 34 canine buccal <b>melanomas</b> (19 melanotic and 15 amelanotic). were collected. The amelanotic <b>melanomas</b> presented faster evolution and higher incidence of metastasis than melanotic tumors. A significantly higher number of c-Kit positive cells were observed in amelanotic neoplasms. In addition, the intensity of c-Kit immunolabeling was predominantly stronger in amelanotic <b>melanomas.</b> These results confirm a potential role for c-Kit in canine oral <b>melanomas</b> with clear differences in expression patterns between the two histological types of tumor, melanotic and amelanotic. This study highlights the importance of a detailed study of c-Kit mutations in canine oral <b>melanomas</b> to better understand the molecular mechanisms implicated in the development of this disease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Melanomas</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common skin tumors in horses. 1, 2 Several therapies for the {{treatment}} of melanomatosis exist, including the administration of the H 2 receptor antagonist Cimetidine. Cimetidine has been found to slow down growth of the primary tumor and preventing disease progression, by acting as an immunomodulator. 3, 4 The aim of this study was to try to confirm the positive effects of cimetidine on <b>melanomas</b> in a group of 41 grey horses. The 41 Horses of the 63 horses on the Heilan International Equestrian club with different degrees of melanomatosis were given Cimetidine 2, 5 mg/kg/TD for three months. Every 30 days the location, number and size of the <b>melanomas</b> were registered. Differences in number of <b>melanomas</b> after three months were tested using descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon signed test. In this population of horses 65 % had <b>melanomas.</b> After the three months of cimetidine administration a significant growth in number of <b>melanomas</b> was found comparing the first and the last measurement. In this study the positive effects of cimetidine on <b>melanomas</b> cannot be confirmed. In contrast, we found an actual growth in number of <b>melanomas</b> after three months of cimetidine administration...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) in <b>melanomas</b> and the expressive difference of VEGF and COX- 2 between <b>melanomas</b> with and without vasculogenic mimicry(VM). METHODS Sixty cases of malignant <b>melanomas</b> embedded in paraffin were studied. The tumors were divided into a high-grade malignant group and a low-grade malignant group based on their tumor type, atypia and survival time of the patient. Then tissue microarrays were produced from these paraffin-embedded tumor tissues which were stained for VEGF, COX- 2 and PAS. The difference in expression between VEGF and COX- 2 in the malignant <b>melanomas</b> was compared using a grid-count. In addition, the tumors were also divided into mimicry and non-mimicry groups based on their PAS staining. Then {{the differences between the}} PAS positive and negative areas of the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS In malignant <b>melanomas</b> with VM, VEGF and COX- 2 expression was less in tumors in which VM was absent, but VEGF, C 9 expression in high-grade malignant <b>melanomas</b> was higher than that in low-grade grade malignant <b>melanomas.</b> Expression of VEGF was correlated with COX- 2 expression. CONCLUSION VM exists in some high-grade malignant <b>melanomas.</b> The differences and relations between VEGF and COX- 2 showed that some high-grade malignant <b>melanomas</b> possess a unique molecular-mechanism of tumor metastasis and blood supply...|$|R
25|$|<b>Melanoma</b> is {{the second}} most common type of vulvar cancer and causes 8–10% of vulvar cancer cases.

25|$|Neither {{sentinel}} {{lymph node}} biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin <b>melanoma,</b> including <b>melanoma</b> in situ, T1a <b>melanoma</b> or T1b <b>melanoma</b> ≤ 0.5mm. People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and already have a 97% 5-year survival rate. Because of these things, sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} is unnecessary health care for them. Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic studies should not be performed only based on identifying this kind of <b>melanoma,</b> as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates. To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling {{may be used as}} auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} time trends and latitude differentials in the thickness distributions of invasive <b>melanomas</b> diagnosed in Australia between 1990 and 2006 {{using data from}} population-based cancer registries. Trends in incidence rates were calculated by sex, age group, thickness, year at diagnosis and latitude. For thin (4. 00 mm) <b>melanomas</b> continued to increase over the entire period (males + 2. 6 (+ 1. 9,+ 3. 4); females + 1. 6 (+ 0. 6,+ 2. 6)). Recent reductions {{in the incidence of}} thin <b>melanomas</b> were observed among young (< 50 years) males and females, contrasted by an increase in thin <b>melanomas</b> among older people, and increases in thick <b>melanomas</b> among most age groups for males and elderly (75 +) females. A strong latitude gradient in incidence rates was observed, with rates being highest in northern, more tropical areas and lowest in the most southern regions. However, the magnitude of the increase in thick <b>melanomas</b> was most pronounced in southern parts of Australia. The observed trends in thin <b>melanomas</b> can most likely be attributed to the impact of early detection and skin awareness campaigns. However, these efforts have not impacted on the continued increase in the incidence of thick <b>melanomas,</b> although some increase may be due to earlier detection of metastasising <b>melanomas.</b> This highlights the need for continued vigilance in early detection processes.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of occupational incidence data for malignant <b>melanomas</b> and squamous-and basal-self carcinomas {{of the skin}} in England and Wales from 1970 to 1975 is reported. The occupational pattern for <b>melanomas</b> of the trunk and limbs differed markedly from the pattern for <b>melanomas</b> of the head, face and neck. Office work {{was associated with a}} large excess of <b>melanomas</b> of the trunk and limbs. In contrast, outdoor work was associated with an excess of <b>melanomas</b> of the head, face and neck; and was also associated with an excess of squamous-and basal-cell carcinomas of the skin. This suggests that prolonged occupational exposure to sunlight is an important cause of squamous-and basal-cell carcinomas and of <b>melanomas</b> of the head, face and neck, but not of <b>melanomas</b> on other parts of the body. The high rate of lesions on the trunk and limbs in office workers may reflect their sunbathing or other recreational habits; but it contrasts clearly with other indoor work, where there is a generally low rate of all forms of skin cancer...|$|R

25|$|The {{most deadly}} form of skin cancer, {{malignant}} <b>melanoma,</b> is mostly caused by DNA damage independent from UVA radiation.

40|$|The {{development}} of new primary <b>melanomas</b> in patients treated with vemurafenib has been reported recently {{in a study by}} Perier-Muzet et al.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dermoscopy {{allows the}} early {{detection}} of <b>melanomas.</b> The preoperative determination of Breslow index by dermoscopy could be useful in planning the surgical approach and in selecting patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy. OBJECTIVES: This study aims at describing the dermoscopic features of thin <b>melanomas</b> and comparing <b>melanomas</b> in situ with invasive <b>melanomas</b> {{less than or equal}} to 1 mm thick. METHODS: This was an observational retrospective study in which the dermoscopy photographs of 41 thin <b>melanomas</b> were evaluated. Three observers evaluated together 14 dermoscopic criteria. RESULTS: Among thin <b>melanomas,</b> the most frequent criteria were presence of asymmetry in two axes in 95 % of cases (39 cases), 3 or more colors in 80. 4 % of cases (33 cases), atypical dots or globules in 58. 5 % of cases (24 cases) and atypical network or streaks in 53. 6 % of cases (22 cases). The group of invasive <b>melanomas</b> presented with a higher frequency and statistical significance (p < 0. 05) 3 or more colors (OR: 16. 1), milky red areas (OR: 4. 8) and blue-white veil (OR: 20. 4), and a greater tendency to have streaks or atypical network (OR: 3. 66). CONCLUSIONS: Thin <b>melanomas</b> tend to have asymmetry in the two axes, 3 or more colors, atypical dots or globules and atypical network or streaks. <b>Melanomas</b> in situ tend to have up to 2 colors, no blue-white veil and no milky red area. Invasive <b>melanomas</b> tend to have 3 or more colors, a milky red area, blue-white veil, and atypical network or streaks. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Ocular and {{cutaneous}} <b>melanomas</b> {{arose in}} new inbred lines of transgenic mice having an integrated recombinant gene comprised of the tyrosinase promoter, expressed in pigment cells, and the simian virus 40 early-region transforming sequences. The tumors were hypomelanotic and were histopathologically similar to corresponding human <b>melanomas.</b> Eye <b>melanomas</b> often originated {{at a young}} age, chiefly from the retinal pigment epithelium, also from the choroid, and rarely from the ciliary body. The eye tumors grew aggressively, were highly invasive, and metastasized to local and distant sites. The earliest formation of these tumors was associated with higher copy numbers of the transgene; mice of different single-copy lines varied greatly in age of onset and frequency of eye tumors. Coat pigmentation was reduced in almost all lines, to various extents. Primary skin <b>melanomas</b> arose later and less frequently than eye <b>melanomas.</b> Hence they were at early stages and of unknown long-range incidence in this investigation, in which autopsies covered the first half-year of life. For both ocular and cutaneous <b>melanomas,</b> the transgenic mice offer numerous possibilities for experimental study of mechanisms underlying formation and spread of <b>melanomas...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{family history}} of <b>melanoma</b> greatly {{increases}} a person's risk because mutations in several genes {{have been found in}} melanoma-prone families. People with a history of one <b>melanoma</b> are at increased risk of developing a second primary tumor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are {{required}} to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice.

40|$|Vulvar <b>melanomas</b> {{are seen}} in about 3 % of all <b>melanomas.</b> The {{percentage}} reaches 10 % of all malignant tumors of the vulva. The {{mean age of the}} patients is approximately 55 years. The first symptoms noticed by the patients are bleeding, pruritus, or a mass in the groin. Vulvar <b>melanomas</b> are mostly located at the labia minora. The differential diagnosis comprises different pigmented lesions, such as seborrheic keratosis, nevocellular nevus, lentigo, or hyperpigmentations of different origin. There is no typical histopathological pattern, but mostly <b>melanomas</b> of this site are of the mucosal-lentiginous type. As treatment modalities, most investigators propose a complete excision for <b>melanomas</b> thinner than 1 mm, and for thicker <b>melanomas</b> a wide excision. Recent investigations have shown that hemivulvectomies or vulvectomies do not show a better survival. The question of a prophylactic ipsilateral lymph node dissection is not answered yet. The survival rates depend on the tumor thickness and/or the infiltration level. The importance of an early diagnosis should be stressed in vulvar <b>melanomas,</b> especially through an accurate inspection of the vulva at the time of a genital examination. In addition, vulvar self examinations are an excellent possibility for early diagnosis. This allows a definite treatment and vulvar conservation...|$|R
50|$|Despite this {{relatively}} high sensitivity—HMB-45 {{does have its}} drawbacks.

40|$|One to two {{per cent}} of primary {{cutaneous}} <b>melanomas</b> share clinical features with benign melanocytic and non-melanocytic skin lesions, {{and even at}} histology recognition of their malignant nature is problematic, mainly {{due to the lack}} of an intraepithelial component, their nodular aspect and the monotonous cell population throughout the lesion. These tumours were termed minimal deviation <b>melanomas</b> (MDMs) by Reed et al. and later naevoid <b>melanomas</b> by Schmoeckel et al. The name MDM suggests the concept of a more favourable outcome for these <b>melanomas</b> that do not (yet) show the typical features of fully evolved lesions able to metastasize, although naevoid <b>melanomas</b> seem to behave like 'common' <b>melanomas.</b> In a retrospective analysis of nine cases of MDM collected from our database and followed for a median duration of 112 months, we faced similar clinical and histological pitfalls and observed local recurrence following marginal resection.
