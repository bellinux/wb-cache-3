5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing parents frequent visiting to hospitalised children became the norm {{and there was}} a <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> placing homeless children with foster carers, rather than in institutions, and a <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the professionalisation of alternative carers. In hospitals, the change was given added impetus by the work of social worker and psychoanalyst James Robertson who filmed the distressing effects of separation on children in hospital and collaborated with Bowlby in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E

5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|As the Mongols of the Ilkhanate {{continued}} to <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the Holy Land, city after city {{fell to the}} Mongols. The typical Mongol pattern was to give a region one chance to surrender. If the target acquiesced, the Mongols absorbed the populace and warriors into their own Mongol army, which they would then use to further expand the empire. If a community did not surrender, the Mongols forcefully took the settlement or settlements and slaughtered everyone they found. Faced with the option of subjugation to or combat with the nearby Mongol horde, many communities chose the former, including some Christian realms.|$|E

5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead {{a greater emphasis on}} Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E

5|$|On 30December, the JTWC {{reported}} that Rewa had become {{equivalent to a}} category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early {{the next day the}} BoM {{reported that}} the system had developed into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly turned and started to <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24hours before the system started to weaken during 3January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160°E.|$|E
