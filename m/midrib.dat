5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the <b>midrib.</b> In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the <b>midrib</b> on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the <b>midrib,</b> into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
25|$|Flavescens Group, {{swiss chard}} (Syn. B. v. subsp. v. convar. cicla. var. flavescens) - Chard leaves have thick and fleshy <b>midribs.</b> Both the <b>midribs</b> and the leaf blades {{are used as}} vegetables, often in {{separate}} dishes. Some cultivars are also grown ornamentally for their coloured <b>midribs.</b> The thickened <b>midribs</b> {{are thought to have}} arisen from the spinach beet by mutation.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} diversity {{associated with}} citrus leaf <b>midribs</b> was characterized for citrus groves that contained the Huanglongbing (HLB) pathogen, which {{has yet to}} be cultivated in vitro. We employed a combination of high-density phylogenetic 16 S rRNA gene microarrays and 16 S rRNA gene clone library sequencing to determine the microbial community composition for symptomatic and asymptomatic citrus <b>midribs.</b> Our results revealed that citrus leaf <b>midribs</b> can support a diversity of microbes. PhyloChip analysis indicated that 47 orders of bacteria in 15 phyla were present in the citrus leaf <b>midribs,</b> while 20 orders in 8 phyla were observed with the cloning and sequencing method. PhyloChip arrays indicated that nine taxa were significantly more abundant in symptomatic <b>midribs</b> than in asymptomatic <b>midribs.</b> “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” was detected at a very low level in asymptomatic plants but was over 200 times more abundant in symptomatic plants. The PhyloChip analysis results were further verified by sequencing 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries, which indicated the dominance of “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” in symptomatic leaves. These data implicate “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” as the pathogen responsible for HLB disease...|$|R
50|$|The Karinding is Sundanese {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} from West Java and Banten, Indonesia. It is usually made from bamboo and <b>midribs</b> of palm trees. Karindings made of palm tree <b>midribs</b> are traditionally used by male players, and bamboo instruments {{are used by}} female players.|$|R
5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent <b>midrib</b> on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a <b>midrib</b> of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
25|$|The traps {{are very}} similar, with leaves whose {{terminal}} section {{is divided into}} two lobes, hinged along the <b>midrib.</b> Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are sensitive to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells {{at the base of the}} trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the <b>midrib.</b> These cells respond by pumping out ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the <b>midrib)</b> or cause rapid acid growth. The mechanism is still debated, but in any case, changes in the shape of cells in the <b>midrib</b> allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut, flipping rapidly from convex to concave and interring the prey. This whole process takes less than a second. In the Venus flytrap, closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{commonly}} cultivated fern, especially A. niponicum var. pictum. It thrives in {{many kinds of}} shady garden conditions and produces thick colonies of gray-green fronds with reddish <b>midribs.</b> 'Pictum' is also {{considered to be a}} cultivar; varieties and cultivars are bred to achieve <b>midribs</b> in many shades of red.|$|R

25|$|It grows as a {{prostrate}} shrub with a lignotuber or underground stems. The {{leaves are}} from 7 to 15cm long, on a petiole from 2 to 6cm in length. They are finely divided almost {{back to the}} <b>midrib,</b> into narrow lobes up to 4cm in length. Lobes near the leaf tip are sometimes themselves so divided.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, simple, and {{oblanceolate}} with crenate margins and pinnate venation; in autumn {{the leaves turn}} a bold red color. Dark trichomes are present on the upper <b>midrib</b> surface. The flowers are small, with 5 petals and 5 sepals, and produced in corymbs of 10-25 together. Hypanthium is urn-shaped. The fruit is a small pome, with an astringent flavor.|$|E

25|$|Dedicated cutting blades {{are wide}} and thin, and often have grooves known as fullers which lighten the blade {{at the cost}} of some of the blade's stiffness. The edges of a cutting sword are almost parallel. Blades {{oriented}} for the thrust have thicker blades, sometimes with a distinct <b>midrib</b> for increased stiffness, with a strong taper and an acute point.|$|E
25|$|In younger plants, the lamina {{is usually}} {{narrower}} towards the base, becoming more oblong as the plant matures. The apex may sometimes be slightly , with the tendril joining the lamina on the underside, up to 4mm before the apex. Occasionally {{the two halves}} of the lamina may meet the <b>midrib</b> unequally at different points along its length, up to 3mm apart in some specimens.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundant}} sori {{are dark}} brown and variable in shape, fusing {{with one another}} as they grow. The sori are covered with firm, white indusia. In wild specimens, they are found beneath the costa (<b>midrib</b> of the pinnae). As a sterile tetraploid hybrid, the spores are seen to be misshapen and abortive under microscopic examination. The species has a chromosome number of 144 (2 × 72) in the sporophyte.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of Africa, the whole leaf blades are usually {{prepared}} with the <b>midribs</b> as one dish.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Zanzibarensis' is also tall (2 - 3 m), with large, mid-green leaves (50 cm long) {{that have}} white <b>midribs.</b>|$|R

25|$|The weevil {{goes through}} a single {{life-cycle}} each year. Adults pass the winter months in surrounding leaf litter and become active throughout late April and early May. Before leaf buds on Yellow-poplar, Sassafras, or Magnolia trees open, weevils attack the buds and leave their distinctive feeding marks. Mating takes place throughout May and early June. The eggs are laid in the <b>midrib</b> {{on the underside of}} leaves, about one to three eggs per site. There are generally four or five punctures at each oviposition site, resulting in 12 to 15 eggs per leaf. The eggs hatch in a few days to reveal legless, C-shaped grubs. Newly hatched larvae move from the <b>midrib</b> into the leaf where they feed as leaf miners for three to four weeks. Once they are ready to pupate, the grubs spin reddish-brown cocoons in one of the main mining halls they created as larvae. They remain in these cocoons until the second week of June where they then emerge as adults. The new adults then continue on their journey to eat yet more leaves until mid or late July. From this time onward, they generally disappear into new leaf litter to await the coming spring months.|$|E
25|$|Adult weevils create brown, rice-sized feeding pits. They chew {{through the}} leaf epidermis, and if {{prolonged}} feeding continues can create small {{holes in the}} leaves. Large weevil infestations can also cause severe leaf browning. Weevil larvae are internal miners and will eat the <b>midrib</b> of the leaf as they mature. Mined leaves will eventually break if enough injury occurs. While these weevils do harm foliage they shouldn’t affect the overall health and longevity of established trees. They are often more of a nuisance than a serious problem and generally only create aesthetic harm.|$|E
25|$|A pugio was {{a dagger}} used by Roman soldiers. It was {{probably}} a sidearm. Like other items of legionary equipment, the dagger underwent some changes during the 1st century. Generally, it had a large, leaf-shaped blade 18 to 28cm long and 5cm or more in width. A raised <b>midrib</b> {{ran the length of}} each side, either simply standing out from the face or defined by grooves on either side. It was changed by making the blade a little thinner, about 3 mm, and the handle was also made out of metal. The tang was wide and flat initially, and the grip was riveted through it, as well as through the shoulders of the blade.|$|E

50|$|The {{grass is}} {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant for its palm-like pleated leaves. Some cultivars have striped leaves and 'Rubra' has purple <b>midribs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{second major}} group of pitcher plants are the monkey cups or {{tropical}} pitcher plants {{of the genus}} Nepenthes. In the hundred or so species of this genus, the pitcher is borne {{at the end of}} a tendril, which grows as an extension to the <b>midrib</b> of the leaf. Most species catch insects, although the larger ones, such as Nepenthes rajah, also occasionally take small mammals and reptiles. Nepenthes bicalcarata possesses two sharp thorns that project from the base of the operculum over the entrance to the pitcher. These likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the fluid within.|$|E
25|$|Beta vulgaris is an {{herbaceous}} biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to 120cm (rarely 200cm) height; cultivated {{forms are}} mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. vulgaris); or brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen and woody {{in the wild}} subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is oblanceolate to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent <b>midrib,</b> with entire or undulate margin, 5–20cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The upper leaves are smaller, their blades are rhombic to narrowly lanceolate.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} scales (squamae) {{were either}} iron or bronze, or even alternating metals {{on the same}} shirt. They could be tinned as well, one surviving fragment showing bronze scales that were alternately tinned and plain. The metal was generally not very thick, 0.5mm to 0.8mm (0.02 to 0.032 in) perhaps being a common range. Since the scales overlapped in every direction, however, the multiple layers gave good protection. The size ranged from as small as 6mm (0.25in) wide by 1.2cm tall up to about 5cm (2in) wide by 8cm (3in) tall, with the most common sizes being roughly 1.25 by 2.5cm (0.5 by 1 in). Many had rounded bottoms, while others were pointed or had flat bottoms with the corners clipped off at an angle. The scales could be flat, slightly domed, or have a raised <b>midrib</b> or edge. All the scales in a shirt were generally of the same size; however, scales from different shirts varied significantly.|$|E
