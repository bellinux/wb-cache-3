When a unit's HP is reduced to zero they are removed from the battle as a casualty.

25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the M.52 was cylindrical and, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was constructed of high tensile steel with light-alloy covering. The fuselage had the <b>minimum</b> cross-section <b>allowable</b> around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle-like arrangement placed over the upper area around it. The engine was positioned with its center of gravity coincident with that of the aircraft and the wings were attached to the main structure just aft of the engine. The use of a shock cone in the nose was another key design choice; the inlet cone slowed incoming air to the subsonic speeds determined by the engine, but with lower losses than a subsonic aircraft pitot intake. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used. The nose wheel was positioned close to the pilot's feet and the main wheels were fitted onto the main fuselage, folding out under the wings when deployed.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{perturbations}} are {{a natural}} phenomenon in volunteer computing systems. Scheduling parallel applications with precedence-constraints {{is emerging as}} a new challenge in these systems. In this paper, we propose two novel robust task scheduling heuristics, which identify best task-resource matches in terms of makespan and robustness. Our approach for both heuristics {{is based on a}} proactive reallocation (or schedule expansion) scheme enabling output schedules to tolerate a certain degree of performance degradation. Schedules are initially generated by focusing on their makespan. These schedules are scrutinized for possible rescheduling using additional volunteer computing resources to increase their robustness. Specifically, their robustness is improved by maximizing either the total allowable delay time or the <b>minimum</b> relative <b>allowable</b> delay time over all allocated volunteer resources. Allowable delay times may occur due to precedence constraints. In this paper, two proposed heuristics are evaluated with an extensive set of simulations. Based on simulation results, our approach significantly contributes to improving the robustness of the resulting schedules. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operating}} pressure heads on water application uniformity in microirrigation submain units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between operating pressure head and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for operating pressure heads in a small range (usually between the <b>allowable</b> <b>minimum</b> and maximum operating pressures of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased operating pressure head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the <b>allowable</b> <b>minimum</b> operating pressure head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as operating pressure increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between wetted perimeter and discharge is sometimes {{used as an}} expedient technique for determining the <b>minimum</b> flow <b>allowable</b> for environmental purposes. The critical minimum discharge is supposed to correspond {{to the point where}} there is a break {{in the shape of the}} curve (usually a logarithmic or power function). Below this discharge, wetted perimeter declines rapidly. The appearance of a break in the shape of the curve is strongly dependent on the relative scaling of the axes of the graph. This subjectivity can be overcome by defining the break in shape using mathematical techniques. The important break in the shape of the curve can be systematically defined by the point where the slope equals 1, or where the curvature is maximized. These two methods were applied to Karoon River, Iran. Seven cross section were selected. Their survey data were used to derivate {{relationship between}} wetted perimeter and discharge. After determining breakpoints on the curves, corresponding value of discharge was calculated from the curves. Analysis of results showed that the slope method has reasonable and accurate output. Finally, the amount of environmental flow for Karoon river was calculated as 209. 4 cms...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for testing timing constraints of real-time systems. Our tests are automatically derived from specifications of <b>minimum</b> and maximum <b>allowable</b> delays between input/output events in the execution of a system. Our test derivation scheme uses a graphical specification formalism for timing constraints, and the real-time process algebra Algebra of Communicating Shared Resources (ACSR) for representing tests and process models. The use of ACSR to describe test sequences has two main advantages. First, tests {{can be applied to}} an ACSR model of the software system within the ACSR semantic framework for model validation purposes. Second, ACSR has concise notation and a precise semantics that will facilitate the translation of real-time tests into a software test language for software validation purposes. 1 Introduction The Algebra of Communicating Shared Resources (ACSR) is a process algebraic formalism tailored specifically to the domain of concurrent real-time systems, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Verifying timing {{properties}} of real-time systems by traditional approaches {{that depend on}} {{the exploration of the}} entire system state space is impractical for large systems. In contrast, testing allows the search for violations of a property to be narrowed to a relatively small portion of the overall state space, based on assumptions regarding the structure of an implementation. We present a domain testing based technique for verifying timing constraints of real-time systems, given timing constraints specified as <b>minimum</b> and maximum <b>allowable</b> delays between input/output events. The testing methodology is presented in a process algebraic setting where it is an efficient alternative to model checking for verifying system timing properties.
