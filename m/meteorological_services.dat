5|$|On October 19, the Mauritius <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Services</b> (MMS) {{released}} {{their summer}} 201516 outlook. An average season, with around seven to nine cyclones forming, was expected. MMS {{also indicated that}} the equatorial region {{to the north of}} Mauritius, east of Agaléga and west of Diego Garcia, could be significantly conducive for cyclone formation.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national <b>meteorological</b> <b>services,</b> scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the national <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> of each nation, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and {{can be compared to}} the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, the JTWC uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin. These classifications are Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm, Typhoon and Super Typhoon. In addition, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau has its own scale in Chinese but uses the Typhoon Committee scale in English.|$|E

5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Services.</b> Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national <b>meteorological</b> <b>services,</b> scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. According to NOAA, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1950 and 2005 contained 10.3 tropical storms, 6.2 hurricanes, 2.7 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season are occasionally considered as well.|$|E

5|$|Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane {{started to}} issue special {{advisories}} {{to support the}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a cyclone warning. The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day, while the warnings for Vanuatu were maintained until late on October 25, when RSMC Nadi discontinued them.|$|E
5|$|On December25, a {{cold front}} dragged over the central Mozambique Channel. A weak {{circulation}} {{formed in the}} Channel and moderate convection appeared on December27. Then on December30, RSMC La Reunion designated this low pressure as a zone of disturbed weather and was classified as a tropical depression on January1, 2002. The JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) early on December31 and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 08S the next day. As it moved further eastwards it strengthened quickly from a tropical depression into a severe tropical storm, with the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Services</b> of Madagascar giving it the name Cyprien on January1. Cyprien soon became {{a serious threat to}} western Madagascar. Convection began to dissipate as wind shear increased and that resulted in quick weakening to a tropical depression. As it made landfall on western Madagascar, it dropped heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{north of}} Rodrigues Island on March30, Hudah {{produced}} moderate winds, though effects to infrastructure and crops {{on the island}} were minimal. During {{the night of the}} following day, Hudah passed near the Saint Brandon archipelago. A weather station on the island maintained by the Maritius <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Services</b> reported a minimum pressure of roughly 996mbar (hPa; 29.42inHg) and a maximum sustained wind measurement of 70km/h (45mph). During the night of April1, the cyclone passed approximately 35km (20mi) south of Tromelin Island, producing strong winds. A Météo-France station on the isle recorded sustained winds of 125km/h (80mph) and a gust of 180km/h (110mph). A minimum pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg) was also recorded. Due to a lack of sustainable infrastructure on the latter two islands, damage was minimal.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} the season, several <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> and {{scientific}} agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16 El Niño event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} over the names used at various times, with names being dropped for religious and political reasons. Female names were exclusively used in the basins at various times between 1945 and 2000, and were the subject of several protests. At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> and retain their names throughout their lifetimes. Due to the potential for longevity and multiple concurrent storms, the names reduce the confusion about what storm is being described in forecasts, watches and warnings. Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists once storms have one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than , depending on which basin it originates in. Standards vary from basin to basin, with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific, while {{a significant amount of}} gale-force winds are required in the Southern Hemisphere. The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name, at meetings of the World Meteorological Organization's various tropical cyclone committees.|$|E
5|$|In advance of, and during, each {{hurricane}} season, several {{forecasts of}} hurricane activity are issued by national <b>meteorological</b> <b>services,</b> scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States NOAA's National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at CSU, Tropical Storm Risk, and the United Kingdom's Met Office. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained roughly 12tropical storms, 6hurricanes, 3major hurricanes, and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index of 66–103units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.|$|E

5|$|On January23, the ITCZ spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} to {{the southwest}} of Diego Garcia, west of Helinda and east of Gretelle. The system quickly developed an organized central dense overcast, but failed to become a tropical cyclone {{due to the lack}} of a circulation in the region. Late on January24, the system developed into a tropical depression, by which time the Mauritius <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Services</b> had named it Iletta. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm, but further development halted on January25. Due to a nearby trough, the storm tracked to the southeast. Iletta resumed intensification on January26, quickly reaching peak 10winds of 100km/h (65mph); the JTWC meanwhile estimated peak 1minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened Iletta, and within 24hours the storm had decreased from peak intensity to tropical depression status. After the trough passed the storm, Iletta turned to the north under the influence of a ridge to the south, dissipating on January30 about 305km (190mi) east-southeast of where it initially formed.|$|E
5|$|In late January {{into early}} February, the ITCZ {{produced}} areas of convection around {{the northern tip of}} Madagascar. One such convective system spawned a {{low pressure area}} between Tromelin island and Agaléga, which initially was still located within the ITCZ. On February5, the system developed into a tropical depression, and failed to intensify further while executing a clockwise loop off northeastern Madagascar. After the convection increased, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on February8 and was named Josie by the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Services</b> of Madagascar. Subsequently, the storm moved across northern Madagascar and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February9 as a tropical depression, its structure deteriorated. Josie turned to the southwest around western Madagascar, and despite warm waters it initially failed to re-intensify much. On February11, Josie re-attained tropical storm status, and subsequently turned to the south due to a broad area of low pressure in the region. The storm quickly intensified once moving far enough away from Madagascar, becoming a tropical cyclone on February13 and soon after reaching peak 10winds of 140km/h (85mph); in contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). While near peak intensity, the eyewall of Josie passed over Europa Island. An approaching cold front turned the cyclone to the southeast, bringing the storm over cooler waters and causing weakening due to increased wind shear. On February16, Josie became extratropical well to the south of Madagascar, and dissipated the next day.|$|E
