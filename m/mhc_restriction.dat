In the illustration far below, a different view, one can see an entire DQ with a bound peptide in a similar cleft, as viewed from the side. Disease-related peptides fit into these [...] "slots" [...] much like a hand fits into a glove. When bound, peptides are presented to T cells. T cells require presentation via MHC molecules to recognize foreign antigens — a requirement known as <b>MHC</b> <b>restriction.</b> These cells have receptors that are similar to B cell receptors, and each cell recognizes only a few class II-peptide combinations. Once a T cell recognizes a peptide within an MHC class II molecule, it can stimulate B-cells that also recognize the same molecule in their B cell receptors. Thus, T cells help B cells make antibodies to the same foreign antigens. Each HLA can bind many peptides, and each person has 3 HLA types and can have 4 isoforms of DP, 4 isoforms of DQ and 4 Isoforms of DR (2 of DRB1, and 2 of DRB3, DRB4, or DRB5) for a total of 12 isoforms. In such heterozygotes, it is difficult for disease-related proteins to escape detection.|$|E

We inoculated BALB/c (H 2 d) mice with 17 DD yellow fever vaccine to investigate the correlations between approaches used for epitope discovery: ELISPOT assays, binding assays, and prediction software. Our results showed a good agreement between ELISPOT and binding assays, which seemed to correlate with the protein immunogenicity. PREDBALB/c prediction software partially agreed with the ELISPOT and binding assay results, but presented low specificity. The use of prediction software to exclude peptides containing no epitopes, followed by high throughput screening of the remaining peptides by ELISPOT, and the use of MHC-biding assays to characterize the <b>MHC</b> <b>restrictions</b> demonstrated to be an efficient strategy.

40|$|Recent {{studies with}} chimeras of hematopoietic and lymphoid system have {{revealed}} crucial restrictions on cellular interactions and immunologic functions {{attributable to the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 (1 - 7). Most of this work has, thus far, used models employing semi-allogeneic chimeras or chimeras in which graft-vs. -host interactions were either ongoing or a real possibility (8, 9). This has been necessary {{because of the difficulty}} of establishing long-lived chimeras between histocompatible donors and recipients across major histocompatibility barriers. When insufficient immunosuppression (e. g., radiation) is given, the donor hematopoietic grafts are rejected by classical immunologic mechanism or do not take as a consequence of allogeneic resistance (10). When sufficient immunosuppression is given, graft-vs. -host reactions (GVHR) occur that are often lethal (9). Consequently, to date, only a few fully allogeneic chimeras have been studied (9, 11 - 17). As would be predicted from studies with the semi-allogeneic chimera (1, 2), these chimeras have shown evidence of varying degrees in immunoincompetence, but the studies are far from complete.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which T cells are tolerized to self antigens are unknown (1 - 3). It is known that most T lymphocytes only react to foreign antigens presented {{in the context of}} determinants encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ~ (4). One possible explanation for the existence of <b>MHC</b> <b>restrictions</b> is that such T lymphocytes do not recognize nominal (i. e. non-MHC encoded) antigens per se, but rather recognize an antigenic complex composed of nominal antigen plus an MHC-encoded determinant. From this perspective, T cell tolerance to nominal self antigens could not result from the deletion of T cell clones that recognize and bind self antigens directly, but would have to result from the deletion of clones with specificity for complexes composed of nominal self antigens + self-MHC (5). Thus, T cell tolerance to nominal self antigens, like T cell reactivity to nominal foreign antigens, would be MHC restricted. In contrast, if individual T ceils express two distinct recognition specificities, one for nominal antigens and one for MHC determinants, it is conceivable that T cells might be tolerized by recognition of nominal antigen...|$|R

40|$|The {{finding that}} the {{interactions}} of T lymphocytes are genetically restricted by genes within the major histocompatibility complex has been firmly established in many systems (1 - 5). In mice, helper, proliferating, and delayed-type hypersensitivity T cells are restricted by genes in the I-A, and for selected antigens the I-E, subregion of the H- 2 complex (1, 6 - 11). In contrast, cytolytic T lymphocytes and contact sensitivity effector T cells are generally restricted by genes in the K or D regions of the major histocompatibility complex (3 - 5, 10, 12). In many suppressor T cell systems, the T cell interactions are controlled by still another series of genes within the H- 2 complex, i. e., the I-J or I-C subregions (13 - 18). Thus, it appears that most products of the majer histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 can serve as restricting elements for immune responses. The commitment of T cells to various MHC products is most frequently attributed to mechanisms involving associative recognition (19, 20). This theory of genetic restriction assumes that antigen is presented to T cells {{in the context of}} specific MHC gene products.

40|$|Copolymer 1 (Cop 1) is a {{synthetic}} basic random copolymer of amino acids {{that has been}} shown to be effective in suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and is being tested as a candidate drug for multiple sclerosis. It has been previously demonstrated that Cop 1 is immunologically cross-reactive with the autoantigen myelin basic protein (BP) and competitively inhibits the response to BP of T-cell lines and clones of different major histocompatibility complex (<b>MHC)</b> <b>restrictions,</b> of both mouse and human origin. In the present study we demonstrated the direct binding of Cop 1, using its biotinylated derivative, to MHC molecules on living antigen-presenting cells. Binding of biotinylated BP and peptide p 84 - 102 (an immunodominant epitope of BP) was also demonstrated. Cop 1 and BP bound in a promiscuous manner to different types of antigen-presenting cells of various H- 2 and HLA haplotypes. The specificity of the binding was confirmed by its inhibition with either the relevant anti-MHC class II antibodies or unlabeled analogs. Cop 1 exhibited the most extensive and fast binding to antigen-presenting cells. In addition, Cop 1 inhibited the binding of biotinylated derivatives of BP and of p 84 - 102 to the MHC class II molecules and even displaced these antigens when already bound. Thus, these results suggest that Cop 1 indeed competes with BP for MHC binding and, thereby, inhibits T-cell responses to BP. The binding of Cop 1 to different DR alleles, probably because of its multiple MHC binding motifs, may indicate its potential as a broad-spectrum drug for multiple sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Swine {{leukocyte}} antigen (SLA) class I molecules play {{a crucial}} role in generating specific cellular immune responses against viruses and other intracellular pathogens. They mainly bind and present antigens of intracellular origin to circulating MHC I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Binding of an appropriate epitope to an SLA class I molecule is the single most selective event in antigen presentation and the first step in the killing of infected cells by CD 8 + CTLs. Moreover, the antigen epitopes are strictly restricted to specific SLA molecules. In this study, we constructed SLA class I complexes in vitro comprising viral epitope peptides, the extracellular region of the SLA- 1 molecules, and β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m) using splicing overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR). The protein complexes were induced and expressed in an Escherichia coli prokaryotic expression system and subsequently purified and refolded. Specific binding of seven SLA- 1 proteins to one classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and four porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) epitope peptides was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) -based method. The SLA- 1 ∗ 13 : 01, SLA- 1 ∗ 11 : 10, and SLA- 1 ∗ 11 : 01 : 02 proteins were able to bind specifically to different CTL epitopes of CSFV and PRRSV and the <b>MHC</b> <b>restrictions</b> of the five epitopes were identified. The fixed combination of Asn 151 Val 152 residues was identified as the potentially key amino acid residues influencing the binding of viral several CTL epitope peptides to SLA- 1 ∗ 13 : 01 and SLA- 1 ∗ 04 : 01 : 01 proteins. The more flexible pocket E in the SLA- 1 ∗ 13 : 01 protein might have fewer steric limitations and therefore be able to accommodate more residues of viral CTL epitope peptides, and may thus play a critical biochemical role in determining the peptide-binding motif of SLA- 1 ∗ 13 : 01. Characterization of the binding specificity of peptides to SLA class I molecules provides an important basis for epitope studies of infectious diseases in swine, and for the rational development of novel porcine vaccines, as well as for detailed studies of CTL responses in pigs used as animal models...|$|R
50|$|A {{reconciliation}} {{of the two}} models was offered later on suggesting that both co-receptor and germline predisposition to MHC binding play significant roles in imposing <b>MHC</b> <b>restriction.</b> Since only those T cells {{that are capable of}} binding to MHCs are selected for during positive selection in the thymus, to some extent evolutionary pressure selects for germline TCR sequences that bind MHC molecules.

Much less is known about the specificity of intrathymic T cells.

These responses require the interaction of thymocytes with Ia-bearing accessory cells.

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (<b>MHC)</b> 1 <b>restriction</b> {{is a term}} used to indicate the obligate recognition of self-MHC products by immune T cells. In the particular case of helper T cells (TH), immune response-associated (Ia) molecules are recognized in context with foreign antigens {{on the surface of}} antigenpresenting cells (APC). This dual recognition of antigen plus Ia is a fundamental aspect of immune response (Ir) gene control of T cell antigen-induced responsiveness (reviewed in reference 1). Earlier reports using anti-Ia antisera to inhibit the proliferation of bulk populations ofT cells strongly suggested that Ia antigens were involved in the immune response (2 - 4). Recent studies have demonstrated that Ia antigens are directly responsible for certain Ir gene effects. First, some antigen-reactive T cell clones, restricted to Ia antigens of responder strain b, could not respond to antigen in the context of Ia antigens of the congenic strain B 6 C-H- 2 bm~ 2 (bml 2) (5).

40|$|The rare {{patients}} {{who are able to}} spontaneously control HIV replication in the absence of therapy show signs of a particularly efficient cellular immune response. To identify the molecular determinants that underlie this response, we characterized the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire directed at Gag 293, the most immunoprevalent CD 4 epitope in the HIV- 1 capsid. HIV controllers from the ANRS CODEX cohort showed a highly skewed TCR repertoire that was characterized by a predominance of TRAV 24 and TRBV 2 variable genes, shared CDR 3 motifs, and a high frequency of public clonotypes. The most prevalent public clonotypes generated TCRs with affinities at the higher end of values reported for naturally occurring TCRs. The high-affinity Gag 293 -specific TCRs were cross-restricted by up to 5 distinct HLA-DR alleles, accounting for the expression of these TCRs in HIV controllers of diverse genetic backgrounds. Transfer of these TCRs to healthy donor CD 4 + T cells conferred high antigen sensitivity and polyfunctionality, thus recapitulating key features of the controller CD 4 response. Transfer of a high-affinity Gag 293 -specific TCR also redirected CD 8 + T cells to target HIV- 1 capsid via nonconventional <b>MHC</b> II <b>restriction.</b> Together, these findings indicate that TCR clonotypes with superior functions are associated with HIV control.

40|$|Our {{studies have}} shown that {{oxytocin}} (OT) is the dominant peptide of the neurohypophysial (NHP) family that is expressed by thymic epithelial/nurse cells (TEC/TNC). Both in specific RIA and ICC analyses, vasopressin (VP) immunoreactivity is considerably lower in TEC. OT is not secreted by TEC/TNC, but it is presented as the self antigen of the NHP family to developing pre-T cells. The process of T-cell education in recognizing the NHP family involves an active cooperation between this neuroendocrine gene/protein family and the immunoglobulin family. This cooperation is illustrated by the identification in plasma membranes of human TEC of a 55 -kDa protein bearing a neurophysin (10 kDa), as well as a MHC class I heavy chain-related domain (45 kDa). Since both OT and VP genes are transcribed in the thymus, the site of this cooperation should be located at posttranscriptional level. From these data, it appears that thymic T-cell education to the NHP family involves specific pathways which are not strictly superimposible to those dlineated using peripheral dedicated APC. Although MHC class I pathways are needed, it appears that thymic T-cell education to NHP self is not restricted in an allelic fashion. This offers significant advantages for the selection of the human T-cell repertoire.

In agreement with these in vitro findings, specific immunisation failed to significantly alter the course of E 7 -associated tumour development in K 14 E 7 xA 2. 1 mice. These data are consistent with a model of central deletional CTL tolerance to E 7 -encoded epitopes recognised in the context of two distinct <b>MHC</b> class 1 <b>restriction</b> elements, and with the possibility of peripheral T-cell anergy maintained by expression of E 7 in the skin.
