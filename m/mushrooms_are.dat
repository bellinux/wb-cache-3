5|$|Agaricus hondensis <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> toxic, and {{consuming}} {{the fruit}} bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> edible. They {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine to treat lumbago, numbed limbs, and as an antihemorrhagic. Bioactive compounds that have been identified from the fruit bodies include pulveravinA, pulveravinB, vulpinic acid, and pulverolide. <b>Mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> also used in mushroom dyeing to produce the colors yellow, gold, greenish yellow, orange, or olive, depending on the mordant used.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> {{prepared}} in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. <b>Mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius violaceus <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} edible, {{but they}} are not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty.

5|$|These toxic {{mushrooms}} resemble several edible species (most notably caesar's mushroom and {{the straw}} mushroom) commonly consumed by humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning.

5|$|Edible <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> {{well-known}} {{examples of}} fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea), oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.).|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the molds Sepedonium ampullosporum, S.laevigatum, and S.chalcipori. In Sepedonium infections, a {{white to}} powdery yellow mold covers {{the surface of}} the fruit body. The <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species, {{including}} the fungus gnats Mycetophila fisherae and M.signatoides, and flies such as Pegomya winthemi and species of the genera Sciophila and Mydaea.

5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed, and the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%.

5|$|Widely {{distributed}} in the Northern Hemisphere, Tricholoma vaccinum is found in northern Asia, Europe and North America. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with spruce or pine trees, and its <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> found on the ground growing in groups or clusters in late summer and autumn. Although some consider the mushroom edible, it is of poor quality and not recommended for consumption. The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been the subject}} of considerable research.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E

5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata <b>mushrooms</b> <b>are</b> salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Morphologically, {{the dark}} colour of the gills and stem, {{lack of a}} strong taste, and {{characters}} of the cystidia (large cells found on the <b>mushrooms)</b> <b>are</b> the most distinguishing characteristics of X.setulipes. These features allow the species to be readily distinguished from other, similar species, including X.cauticinalis and X.brunneola. Its ecology and habitat are also distinct, but {{it is unclear whether}} they can serve as certain identifying characteristics. Within the genus Xeromphalina, X.setulipes is classified in the section Mutabiles, along with several other species. It seems most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, but, according to Esteve-Raventós and colleagues, further analysis is required to accurately judge the relationships between the species of Xeromphalina.|$|E
