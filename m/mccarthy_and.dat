5|$|At MIT, Kotok earned bachelor's and master's {{degrees in}} {{electrical}} engineering. He {{was influenced by}} teachers such as Jack Dennis and John <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> by {{his involvement in the}} student-organized Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC), which he joined soon after starting college in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> {{his chief}} counsel, Roy Cohn, of {{improperly}} pressuring the Army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, {{a former aide}} to <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the Army as a private. McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.|$|E
50|$|Embarrassing defeats for Cork in 2001 and 2002 saw {{the team}} reach rock bottom and call a players' strike just before Christmas in 2002. Had the strike failed {{it could have}} meant the end of <b>McCarthy's</b> <b>and</b> his and his teammates' careers, however, {{in the end the}} county board relented and met the demands.|$|R

5|$|Research done by <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences {{were more likely to}} develop ambivalent attachments. The study also {{found that children}} with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|The next day, McNish, <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Vincent {{were picked}} up. They {{were unable to}} {{recognise}} Worsley, freshly shaven, when he stepped ashore. The James Caird, which had been pulled up the beach and turned over {{to serve as a}} shelter, was also retrieved.|$|E
5|$|Connie Mack {{holds the}} Major League Baseball {{record for most}} games won as a manager, with 3,731, and most managed with 7,755. Bruce Bochy has the most wins among active managers, with 1,618, and games managed, with 3,222, as {{of the end of}} the 2013 season. The all-time leaders in championships won in the World Series era (1903–present) are Joe <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Casey Stengel, who each won seven championships with the New York Yankees.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new REA enterprise information reference model that integrates the transaction reference model of Mc- Carthy and the conversion reference model of Hruby {{into a single}} model that accounts for both inter-enterprise and intra-enterprise processes. This new reference model should {{make it easier to}} represent services in REA models by allowing an explicit duality between transfer and trans- formation events, where <b>McCarthy’s</b> <b>and</b> Hruby’s reference models can only represent duality between one kind of events. First, {{the state of the art}} in REA reference models is addressed by presenting <b>and</b> compa- ring <b>McCarthy’s</b> <b>and</b> Hruby’s models. Second, the new, integrated REA reference model is presented...|$|R
2500|$|These {{published}} charges enraged {{the ranking}} Democratic member of McCarthy's committee, Senator John McClellan of Arkansas, who {{together with his}} colleagues, Stuart Symington and Henry [...] "Scoop" [...] Jackson, marched into <b>McCarthy's</b> office <b>and</b> demanded that Matthews be fired. <b>McCarthy</b> refused <b>and</b> reiterated his support for Matthews.|$|R

5|$|House Republicans {{planned to}} hold a {{non-binding}} caucus vote on October 8, followed by the official floor vote on October 29. The winning candidate requires a 218-vote majority to win. Multiple ballots may be cast if {{the majority of the}} House cannot agree on a candidate. While <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Chaffetz both said they would vote for the winner of the caucus vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism is the {{practice}} of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence. The term refers to U.S. Senator Joseph <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> has its origins in the period in the United States known as the Second Red Scare, lasting roughly from 1947 to 1956 and characterized by heightened political repression {{as well as a}} campaign spreading fear of Communist influence on American institutions and of espionage by Soviet agents.|$|E
5|$|Republican Donald Trump, {{the winner}} of the 2016 presidential election, is {{currently}} serving as the 45th President of the United States. Current leadership in the Senate includes Republican Vice President Mike Pence, Republican President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin <b>McCarthy,</b> <b>and</b> Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.|$|E

5|$|White House Press Secretary James Brady was {{the most}} seriously wounded victim; he was left paralyzed from a gunshot wound to the head. He would die 33 years later in 2014 of causes that a Virginia medical {{examiner}} ruled were {{directly related to the}} 1981 shooting. Hinckley also wounded Secret Service agent Tim <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Washington D.C. police officer Thomas Delahanty.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.|$|E

5|$|Jason Chaffetz {{initially}} {{declared his}} candidacy to challenge <b>McCarthy,</b> <b>and</b> Bill Flores declared his candidacy after McCarthy withdrew, but both dropped out later {{to express their}} support for Paul Ryan, who entered the race after being widely viewed as a potential frontrunner. Daniel Webster of the Republican Party and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the Democratic Party were also declared candidates. Ryan won the rescheduled caucus vote on October 28, and was elected Speaker of the House the next day, with 236 votes to Pelosi's 184 and Webster's 9. Three votes went to undeclared candidates.|$|E
5|$|Kotok was a {{precocious}} {{child who}} skipped two grades before college. At MIT {{he became a}} member of the Tech Model Railroad Club, and after enrolling in MIT's first freshman programming class, he helped develop some of the earliest computer software including a digital audio program and what is sometimes called the first video game (Spacewar!). Together with his teacher John <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> other classmates, he was part of the team that wrote the Kotok-McCarthy program which took part in the first chess match between computers.|$|E
5|$|Robert Kennedy {{was chosen}} by McCarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee, but {{resigned}} after six months due to disagreements with <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Committee Counsel Roy Marcus Cohn. Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy's popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy's campaigns. The Kennedy patriarch hoped {{that one of his}} sons would be president. Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E

5|$|During {{a severe}} local {{recession}} in 1985 the 36-year-old hotel, still {{the second largest}} in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting, was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center. In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> the hotel opened its last annual St Patrick's Day party to the public. That evening, some {{people who had been}} at the opening night party in 1949 reportedly attended a semi-formal event in the hotel's Emerald room. A few employees had been with the hotel since its first year of operation. The building was demolished 1 June 1987 (McCarthy died 18 months later) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot. The Institute of Biosciences and Technology, a component of the Texas A Health Science Center has since been built on the site and ironically, along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds, the hotel's multi-story parking garage was retained.|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, ABC {{confirmed}} via a {{press release}} that New Year's Rockin' Eve would return for its 2012–13 edition. Ryan Seacrest, Jenny <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Fergie reprised their roles as host, Times Square reporter and Hollywood host, respectively. Carly Rae Jepsen, Neon Trees, Psy with MC Hammer, and Taylor Swift performed live in Times Square, while the Hollywood segments of the show included performances by Brandy, Flo Rida, Ellie Goulding, Jason Aldean, Justin Bieber, Karmin, OneRepublic, Pitbull and The Wanted. The primetime hour {{of the program was}} preceded by a two-hour tribute special, New Year's Rockin' Eve Celebrates Dick Clark. Clark's legacy was also recognized by the Times Square Alliance, organizers of the ball drop: a triangular Waterford Crystal panel engraved with Dick Clark's name was presented to his widow Kari Wigton, and installed on the ball.|$|E
