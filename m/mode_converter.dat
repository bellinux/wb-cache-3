Resistors may be applied for waveshaping, damping of oscillatory waveforms, stabilization of nonstable systems, and power flow balancing. The losses involved by the application of conventional resistors may be eliminated by the synthesis of artificial, loss-free resistive elements which replace the conventional ones. The conventional resistor converts the electrical energy absorbed at its terminals into heat; however, {{it has been found}} that creation of a resistive characteristic is not necessarily followed by such energy conversion. It is possible to synthesize a Loss-Free Resistor (LFR) by the combination of a switched <b>mode</b> <b>converter</b> and a suitable control circuit. The LFR is a two-port element that has a resistive i-v curve at the input terminals. The power absorbed at the input is transferred to the source that powers the total system, so in principle no losses occur.|$|E
