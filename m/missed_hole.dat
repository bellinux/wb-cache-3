40|$|The {{photonic}} {{properties of}} {{two classes of}} wavelength-sized cavities are reported for deeply etched InP/InGaAsP/InP planar photonic crystals. The high aspect, deeply etched structures are studied as potential building blocks for nonmembrane type photonic devices in standard InP photonic integrated circuits. The first class consists of cavities of one unit cell {{in one direction and}} varying size in the other planar direction. The studied class includes a Fabry-Perot type cavity with one row of <b>missing</b> <b>holes,</b> a simple single <b>missing</b> <b>hole</b> defect cavity, and a cavity consisting of two holes which have been slightly shifted and reduced in hole radius. The best observed quality factor of 65 in this class is obtained for a single hole defect cavity. The second class is comprised of cavities which are derived from a three missing row defect in one direction and varying size in the other direction. This includes a Fabry-Perot type cavity with three rows of <b>missing</b> <b>holes,</b> a point defect cavity consisting of seven unetched holes and a six hole ring cavity.

40|$|Because {{decisions}} made by human inspectors often involve subjective judgment, {{in addition to being}} intensive and therefore costly, an automated approach for printed circuit board (PCB) inspection is preferred to eliminate subjective discrimination and thus provide fast, quantitative, and dimensional assessments.

Therefore, an algorithm for PCB defect classification is presented that consists of well-known conventional operations, including image difference, image subtraction, image addition, counted image comparator, flood-fill, and labeling for the classification of six different defects, namely, <b>missing</b> <b>hole,</b> pinhole, underetch, short-circuit, open-circuit, and mousebite.

The core of this algorithm {{is based on the assumption}} that the deformation is continuous and predictable in a short temporal interval. While the camera can only capture part of a whole surface at any time instant, partial surfaces reconstructed from different times are assembled together to form a complete 3 D surface for each time instant, even when the shape is under severe deformation. A mesh warping algorithm based on linear mesh deformation is used to align different partial surfaces.

Here we report the growth of heavily electron doped Li-NH 3 intercalated FeSe single crystals that are free of such complexities and allow access to the intrinsic superconducting properties. Our results show extremely large electronic anisotropy in both normal and superconducting states. Moreover, the anomalous transport properties appear in normal state, which are believed related to the anisotropy of relaxation time and/or temperature dependent electron carrier concentration. In view of the great chemical flexibility of intercalants, our findings provide novel platform to understanding of superconductivity origin of FeSe-related superconductors.

As a result, no such pre-planed time slot is required and the center frequencies can be accordingly chosen/adjusted after receiving the wideband signal. In addition, the prior multi-frequency technique only {{make use of the}} position of integral virtual sensor. For the proposed technique, all the positions including fractional ones can be directly presented and utilized. One can select any sensors of interest by adjusting a particular center frequency.

Due to the periodic arrangement of air holes in a silica fiber, the transmission spectrum of such a structure displays photonic band gaps (PBGs), i. e., frequency ranges where radiation with certain direc-tions of the wave vector cannot penetrate into the fiber cladding.
