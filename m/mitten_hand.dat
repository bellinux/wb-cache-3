40|$|Type VH {{collagen}} is {{the major}} component of anchoring fibrils (1), structures which extend below the lamina densa of the epidermal basement membrane in stratified squamous epithelia. Both qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of anchoring fibrils have been demonstrated in the hereditary skin disorder, dystrophic epidermolysis builosa (EB) (2). This disease is characterized clinically by inappropriate blistering and scarring of the skin and mucous membranes after minor mechanical trauma. Both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of dystrophic EB occur, and of the various subtypes generalised recessive (Hallopeau-Siemens) is the most severe (3). Patients suffer from generalised blistering and scarring from birth. This results in pseudosyndactyly, <b>mitten</b> <b>hand</b> deformities, microstomia and oesophageal stenosis. Other complications such as malnutrition, anaemia, and squamous cell carcinoma may als...|$|E
60|$|And Mme. la Duchesse, folding her <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> before her, seemed mutely to {{be asking}} the same question.|$|R
6000|$|... "The gale is breaking," [...] he told me, {{waving his}} <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> at a starry segment of sky {{momentarily}} exposed by the thinning clouds.|$|R
60|$|The lad knelt down, slipped one arm {{about his}} comrade's neck, {{and took the}} <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> in his own. Shannon smiled up at him feebly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Professor Jeffer. He {{just took}} an observation," [...] {{answered}} Chet, as he crawled into the igloo and slapped his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> {{to get them}} warm.|$|R
60|$|The lad, however, seemed impelled to talk, and stamped up {{and down}} beating his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands,</b> with the swivel of his slung carbine jangling as he moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'm not mistaken, we'll get a lie-off to-morrow." [...] Harding struck {{one of the}} oxen {{with his}} <b>mittened</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "Pull out, Bright, before you freeze!" ...|$|R
60|$|John Messner clung with <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> to the bucking gee-pole {{and held}} the sled in the trail. With the other <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> he rubbed his cheeks and nose. He rubbed his cheeks and nose every little while. In point of fact, he rarely ceased from rubbing them, and sometimes, as their {{numbness}} increased, he rubbed fiercely. His forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap, the flaps of which went over his ears. The rest of his face was protected by a thick beard, golden-brown under its coating of frost.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know I will do anything, my dearest, {{which an}} old woman can do for a young one!' Stephen {{squeezed}} the <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> which she held as she went on: ...|$|R
60|$|Even Mrs. Eppingwell's {{lips were}} at last {{set in a}} stony smile, and her eyes, seeing, saw not. Often she stopped, {{pressing}} a <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> to her heart, gasping and dizzy.|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Barrington {{watched her}} with a little gleam of {{approval}} in his eyes. [...] "You are not sorry {{to come back to}} this and Silverdale?" [...] he said, sweeping his <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> vaguely round the horizon.|$|R
60|$|Margaret's <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> {{rested on}} my arm as we {{balanced}} to the easy roll of the ship. We had paused from our promenade, which we now take each day, religiously, as a constitutional, between eleven and twelve.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the door}} opened {{abruptly}} and Beth came in. Her cheeks were glowing red from contact with the wind and her dark tailor-suit glistened with tiny drops left by the melted snow. In her <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> she waved a letter.|$|R
60|$|Betty {{had never}} heard it and though she was brave, when the howl from the forest had its answer in another howl from the creek thicket, she slipped her little <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> under Wetzel's arm {{and looked up at}} him with frightened eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Diana," [...] breathed Anne, {{squeezing}} Diana's <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> {{under the}} fur robe, [...] "isn't it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really {{look the same}} as usual? I feel so different {{that it seems to}} me it must show in my looks." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{race was}} now kept up by Sam Baker, Joe Davis, and Butts. These three were {{struggling}} on and panting loudly, while their comrades danced about, clapped their <b>mittened</b> <b>hands,</b> and shouted, [...] "Now then, Sam!--go in and win, Joe!--Butts, forever!" [...] and such-like encouraging cries.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But the rope, Kid' It's bran' new, an' sure yer bread's {{not that}} heavy it needs raisin' with the like of that?' Bettles {{by this time}} had faced around. Father Roubeau, the humor of the {{situation}} just dawning on him, hid a smile behind his <b>mittened</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was early}} {{next morning when}} they {{stepped out of the}} stove-warmed car into the {{stinging}} cold of the prairie. Fur-clad figures, showing shapeless in the creeping light, clustered about them, and Winston felt himself thumped on the shoulders by <b>mittened</b> <b>hands,</b> while Alfreton's young voice broke through the murmurs of welcome.|$|R
60|$|The {{crowd was}} {{watching}} curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It {{seemed like a}} conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of speech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.|$|R
60|$|At length, Blake {{managed to}} seize {{it with his}} <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> and after rolling it in a cloth and giving it to a porter, {{advanced}} towards Mrs. Keith, his face red with exertion but contrite, and the cloak, which had come unhooked, hanging down from one shoulder. She glanced at him in a puzzled, half-disturbed manner when he stopped.|$|R
60|$|Then the big fur caps came off, {{while the}} men with the hard brown faces {{clustered}} thicker about the pair, and awkwardly held out <b>mittened</b> <b>hands.</b> They were most of them speaking, and, though {{it was difficult to}} catch all they said, she heard from those at the back odd snatches which did not please her.|$|R
6000|$|Smoke, {{scooping}} {{the light}} snow away with <b>mittened</b> <b>hands,</b> paused to consider, scooped again, and again paused. [...] "No," [...] he decided. [...] "There's been travel both ways, {{but the last}} travel was up that creek. Whoever they are, they're there now--certain. There's been no travel for weeks. Now what's been keeping them there all the time? That's what I want to know." ...|$|R
60|$|The men {{spread out}} at a low command, and Breckenridge smiled mirthlessly as he remembered the {{restrained}} eagerness with which he had waited outside English covers when the quarry was a fox. He could feel his heart thumping furiously, and his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> would tremble on the bridle. It seemed that the fugitive kept them waiting a horribly long while.|$|R
60|$|At last, Blake {{managed to}} seize {{it with his}} <b>mittened</b> <b>hands.</b> He rolled it in a cloth {{and gave it to}} a porter, and then {{advanced}} toward Mrs. Keith, his face red with exertion but contrite, and the cloak, which had come unhooked, hanging down from one shoulder. She glanced at him in a puzzled, half-disturbed manner when he stopped.|$|R
60|$|Betty {{kept her}} eyes glued to her book, and when that was not in use, upon the <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> crossed before her, {{resolute}} against distraction, and every prayer turning into a petition for her sister's welfare; but Eugene gazed, open-eyed and open-mouthed, oblivious of his beloved hole, and Harriet, though keeping her lids down, and her book open, contrived to make a full inspection of the splendid apparition.|$|R
60|$|Instinctively we {{drew closer}} {{together}} {{in the bottom of}} the boat. I felt her <b>mittened</b> <b>hand</b> come out to mine. And thus, without speech, we waited the end. We were not far off the line the wind made with the western edge of the promontory, and I watched in the hope that some set of the current or send of the sea would drift us past before we reached the surf.|$|R
60|$|They stood {{listening}} {{for a minute}} or two, intent and high-strung, and heard only the wailing of the wind, for the birches once more swayed about them. It was almost dark, for the moon was still behind a cloud. As he moved his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> on the Marlin rifle, Leland forgot that he was stiff in every limb. Then a voice rang, harsh and commanding, out of the shadows above them.|$|R
60|$|Shorty {{opened the}} door, felt {{the bite of}} the cold, and shrank back to pull down his ear-flaps and <b>mitten</b> his <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|Morganson dashed up the hillside--at {{least he}} started to dash up. The next {{he knew he was}} coming out of a faint and {{dragging}} himself to his feet. He went up more slowly, pausing {{from time to time to}} breathe and to steady his reeling senses. At last he crawled over the trunk. The moose lay before him. He sat down heavily upon the carcase and laughed. He buried his face in his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> and laughed some more.|$|R
60|$|They went on by, half-seen, dim {{shadows that}} jostled one another among the trees; and, when the voices and the {{trampling}} grew less distinct, the trooper moved {{out into the}} trail, with his carbine in his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands.</b> The trap was sprung, for, if {{one or two of}} the outlaws succeeded in breaking through, it was evident that they must, at least, leave their beasts behind. With the farmer close behind him he moved cautiously a little nearer his comrades and then stood still again.|$|R
60|$|Firmly {{snapping}} {{the door}} to, {{she crossed the}} corridor, with its gloomy, yellow-ochre walls, and its infinite vista of brown, numbered doors. The lift was going down; and wrapped to the ears in the high cloak, with every one of her auburn hairs in its place, she waited motionless for it to stop at her floor. The iron gates clanked open; she entered. There were already three occupants, {{a man in a}} great white waistcoat, with a large, smooth face like a baby's, and two old ladies in black, with <b>mittened</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
6000|$|In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking {{watch and}} ward. Separated from her staircase, all the week, by {{the length of}} iron road {{dividing}} Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs. 'Your foot on the last step, my lady,' said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, {{with the aid of}} her threatening <b>mitten,</b> <b>'and</b> all your art shall never blind me.' ...|$|R
60|$|He plunged {{in among}} the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, {{travelling}} light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek-bones with his <b>mittened</b> <b>hand.</b> He was a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi!" [...] said Long Jack, with a {{scoop of}} his <b>mittened</b> <b>hand.</b> The cod's liver dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who snorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the {{backbone}} flew over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's astonished mouth. After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along {{as though they were}} alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.|$|R
60|$|Ippegoo, {{entering}} at once {{into the}} spirit of the fun, arose and gave chase. Excelling in speed as much as his opponent did in strength, the youth soon overtook him, managed to trip him up, and fell on the top of him. He was wildly cheered by the delighted crowd, and tried to punish Okiok; but his efforts were not very successful, for that worthy put both his <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> over his head, and, curling himself up like a hedgehog, lay invulnerable on the ice. Poor Ippegoo had not strength either to uncoil, or lift, or even move his foe, and failed to find a crevice in his hairy dress into which he might stuff snow.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} dark. The wind had the coldness {{of death in}} it, and when the lights of Lone Hollow had faded behind the obscurity closed round me like a thick curtain. Still, trusting to an instinctive sense of {{direction}} men acquire in that land, I pushed on for the big coulée--one of those deep ravines that fissure the prairie and much resemble a railway cutting. This one was larger than the rest, and Carrington Manor stood near one end of it. The horse evidently had little liking for the journey, and {{did his best to}} shorten it, while I had hard work to keep my <b>mittened</b> <b>hands</b> from freezing as we swept onward through the night.|$|R
