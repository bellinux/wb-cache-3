5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} <b>Mary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Joseph</b> on fossil-hunting expeditions {{to make more}} money for the family. They offered their discoveries for sale to {{tourists}} on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.|$|E
5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, <b>Mary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Joseph,</b> and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E

25|$|Campbell married Joseph Willford in 1770 in Mt. Pleasant Township. Some sources {{place this}} {{in what was}} then York, but is now Adams County, Pennsylvania. The same sources have <b>Mary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Joseph</b> Willford {{continuing}} in York/Adams County from 1770 until they moved to Washington (now Greene) County, Pennsylvania. But tax rolls from Lack Township, situated in the Tuscarora Valley, Cumberland (now Juniata) County strongly suggest that they lived in this township from 1766 until at least 1782. A possible candidate for the place of their marriage is a town a few miles southeast of Mifflintown and adjacent to Lack Township which was later (from 1847) known as Mount Pleasant. Some time during or after 1782 they moved to Bald Ridge Farm, Dunkard Township, in present-day Greene County, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|In August 1968 the Universal House of Justice {{called for}} a conference {{to be held in}} Palermo to commemorate from the {{movement}} of Bahá'u'lláh from Gallipoli to the Most Great Prison. This event was compared with the migration of Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees to the region of Aleppo, the journey of Moses towards the Promised Land, the flight into Egypt of <b>Mary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Joseph</b> with the infant Jesus, and the Hegira of Muhammad. The setting for the observance was chosen, as the religion's first Oceanic Conference, in light of the anniversary on the sea which bore it, as well as important steps in the progress of the religions of Christianity and Islam as well as the Bahá'í Faith (noting `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West across it.) With such themes as a backdrop it was also a purpose of the conference to raise the spirits of Bahá'ís, increase the rate of pioneers traveling to goal areas, and the state of funds. The national assembly of Italy undertook the organizing of the conference by appointing Teresa Taffa, Sohrab Payment, and Maud Bosio as coordinators of the conference. Over 2300 Bahá'ís from around the world arrived from 67 countries and served as a prelude to the visit to the Holy Land {{on the occasion of the}} Centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's arrival in 'Akká on August 31, 1868. The main site of the conference was at the Fiera del Mediterraneo. Provisions were available for simultaneous translation of the conference from English to Italian, Spanish, Persian, German and French. Professor Alessandro Bausani, as Chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy, welcomed everyone to the conference and noted the attendance of ten Hands of the Cause and all the members of the Continental Board of Counselors were introduced. Speeches reviewed a range of topics across 3 days - the circumstances of Bahá'u'lláh's trip, the cornerstone of the unity of mankind as a core teaching of the religion, the propagation of The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah as a collection of his works written around this anniversary, reports on the status of some of the communities in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East as well as a summary of the worldwide community, the progress of the then being built Bahá'í House of Worship in Panama, a history of Akká and events in Bahá'u'lláh's lifetime. Giornale di Sicilia, a daily paper of Palermo, ran an article about interviewing Dizzy Gillespie in Bergamo noting his religion as Bahá'í in.|$|E

[...] When Jesus goes missing, they find him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions, and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers; Mary scolds Jesus for going missing, to which Jesus replies that he must [...] "be in his father's house" [...] (...)

He holds his hat in hand, and his pattens are respectfully removed, left lying on the ground. They gaze reverently at the newborn figure of Jesus who lies on Mary's robe. [...] Mary's features have a softness and sweetness more characteristic of Christus's later paintings and remarkably similar to his Madonna of the Dry Tree, according to Maryan Ainsworth. [...] Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels.|$|E
