25|$|The {{above-mentioned}} linearity of Planck's mechanical assumptions, {{not allowing}} for energetic interactions between frequency components, was superseded in 1925 by Heisenberg's original quantum mechanics. In his paper submitted on 29 July 1925, Heisenberg's theory accounted for Bohr's above-mentioned formula of 1913. It admitted non-linear oscillators as models of atomic quantum states, allowing energetic interaction between their own multiple internal discrete Fourier frequency components, on the occasions of emission or absorption of quanta of radiation. The frequency of a quantum of radiation {{was that of}} a definite coupling between internal atomic meta-stable oscillatory quantum states. At that time, Heisenberg knew nothing of matrix algebra, but Max Born read the manuscript of Heisenberg's paper and recognized the <b>matrix</b> <b>character</b> of Heisenberg's theory. Then Born and Jordan published an explicitly matrix theory of quantum mechanics, based on, but in form distinctly different from, Heisenberg's original quantum mechanics; it is the Born and Jordan matrix theory that is today called matrix mechanics. Heisenberg's explanation of the Planck oscillators, as non-linear effects apparent as Fourier modes of transient processes of emission or absorption of radiation, showed why Planck's oscillators, viewed as enduring physical objects such as might be envisaged by classical physics, did not give an adequate explanation of the phenomena.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cryptographic technique that encrypts secret information using a coding image by transforming the pixels {{of this image}} from the intensity domain to the characters domain using a hash function. In the proposed technique, the coding image {{will be used to}} encrypt the secret information at the sender and decrypt it at the receiver using the pixels whose intensity values are transformed to <b>characters.</b> A <b>matrix</b> of <b>characters</b> corresponding to the coding image is generated where each <b>character</b> in this <b>matrix</b> corresponds to a pixel in the coding image and each character in the secret information is mapped to a <b>character</b> in the <b>matrix</b> of <b>characters.</b> The locations of <b>characters</b> in the <b>matrix</b> of <b>characters</b> that correspond to pixels in the coding image and correspond to characters in the secret information forms the pixels map. The pixels map is encrypted using a secret key before being sent to the receiver on a secure communication channel different from that used to send the coding image and at different times. Upon receiving the coding image and the encrypted pixels map the receiver uses the secret key to decrypt the pixels map and uses the coding image and the hash function to generate the <b>matrix</b> of <b>characters.</b> Each location in the pixels map is used to retrieve a <b>character</b> from the <b>matrix</b> of <b>characters</b> in order to decrypt the secret information.

The electron energy loss spectra is shown to change dramatically as a function of q...|$|E

Key feature of the proposed scheme is the <b>matrix</b> <b>character</b> of the formulation, which results in a set of condensed equations of motion.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Berkovits pure spinor {{formalism}} of covariant quantization of supermembrane, we attempt to construct a M(atrix) theory which is covariant under $SO(1, 10) $ Lorentz group. We first construct a bosonic M(atrix) theory by starting with the first-order formalism of bosonic membrane, which precisely gives us a bosonic sector of M(atrix) theory by BFSS. Next we generalize this method to the construction of M(atrix) theory of supermembranes. However, it seems to be difficult to obtain a covariant and supersymmetric M(atrix) theory from the Berkovits pure spinor formalism of supermembrane because of the <b>matrix</b> <b>character</b> of the BRST symmetry. Instead, in this paper, we construct a supersymmetric and covariant matrix model of 11 D superparticle, which corresponds to a particle limit of covariant M(atrix) theory. By an explicit calculation, we show that the one-loop effective potential is trivial, thereby implying that this matrix model is a free theory at least at the one-loop level.
