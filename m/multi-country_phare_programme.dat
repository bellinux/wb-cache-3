40|$|Nuclear Safety in Europe {{is one of}} the EU's primary concerns, {{therefore}} the EU decided to take a prominent role to help the New Independent States and countries of Central and Eastern Europe {{to ensure the safety of}} their nuclear reactors. The EU TACIS and <b>PHARE</b> <b>programmes</b> in nuclear safety have been undertaken since 1991. The European Commission's Directorate General External Relations (EC DG RELEX) and Directorate General EuropeAid Co-operation Office (EC DG AIDCO), are responsible for programming and management of implementation of TACIS projects. DG Enlargement (EC DG ELARG) is responsible for programming <b>PHARE</b> <b>programmes,</b> but implementation of most projects has been deconcentrated and decentralised to the Beneficiary Countries. In these activities the TSSTP Unit at the JRC/IE in Petten, The Netherlands, is the technical and scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates General. Several PHARE projects aiming at improving nuclear safety have been successfully implemented for a number of plants from Central and Eastern Europe. In some cases major safety issues have been addressed by means of multi-country projects and results have been disseminated to the rest of the nuclear community. Although a lot of information has been exchanged at a bilateral level, further effort is needed to collect the project results in a systematic way and make them available by means of the internet. At present the TSSTP Unit is implementing two projects for dissemination of PHARE project results. This activity will take a better advantage of today's communication technologies and ensure the management of the acquired knowledge through preservation and user-friendly access and retrieval of the project results. The paper provides an outline of the TSSTP Unit relevant knowledge preservation initiative, a description of the web-based informatics platform used to support the dissemination of PHARE project results, and summarizes the results from the major PHARE Nuclear Safety projects.

40|$|Hungary {{has been}} in a {{transition}} process since the fall of the Iron Curtain. This process has resulted in important developments in regional policy. The introduction of a western style policy system seems, however, not to have affected regional inequality to any noticeable extent as measured by income per captia. There are still large disparities between the richest counties and the remaining counties in terms of this indicator. However, single indicator approaches to regional inequality have been criticised. Therefore in this paper we adopt a multidimensional approach to analyse regional inequality. For the counties of Hungary the multidimensionality of inequality is taken into account by using a multiple of social and economic indicators that are combined into a composite index. Theil's second measure of multidimensional inequality and principal component analysis are used to construct the composite index. The results thus obtained are used to identify the least-favoured and the most-favoured regions. We find that there are substantial differences between the single indicator approach based on per capita income and the multidimensional approach. Moreover, we argue that the EU <b>Phare</b> <b>Programmes</b> for Hungary have helped the economic development in developed regions situated on the EU border {{but at the same time}} have stimulated disparities within Hungary...|$|R
