60|$|Pulci, who is {{the first}} genuine romantic poet, in point of time, after Dante, seems, at first sight, in the juxtaposition, like farce after tragedy; and indeed, {{in many parts of}} his poem, he is not only what he seems, but follows his saturnine countryman with a {{peculiar}} propriety of contrast, much of his liveliest banter being directed against the absurdities of Dante's theology. But hasty and most erroneous would be the conclusion that he was nothing but a banterar. He was a true poet of the <b>mixed</b> <b>order,</b> grave as well as gay; had a reflecting mind, a susceptible and most affectionate heart; and perhaps was never more in earnest than when he gave vent to his dislike of bigotry in his most laughable sallies.|$|E

Here, it is hypothesized that different <b>mixing</b> <b>orders</b> result in different assembly structures, which may affect the siRNA delivery efficiency. To investigate the effects of <b>mixing</b> <b>orders</b> on siRNA delivery efficiency in two human breast cancer cell lines, three ternary complexes with different <b>mixing</b> <b>orders</b> of siRNA/PCD/HA were prepared and characterized: <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> I (initially prepared siRNA/PCD binary complex further coated by negatively charged HA), <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> II (initially prepared HA/PCD binary complex further incubated with siRNA), and <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> III (initially prepared siRNA/HA mixture further electrostatically compacted by positively charged PCD). With an optimized siRNA/PCD/HA charge ratio of 1 / 20 / 16, the particle sizes and zeta potentials of these ternary complexes were 124. 8 nm and 27. 3 mV (<b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> I), 147. 5 nm and 29. 9 mV (<b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> II), and 128. 8 nm and 19. 4 mV (<b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> III). Also, the effects on stability, cellular uptake, and gene silencing efficiency of siRNA formulated in ternary complexes with different <b>mixing</b> <b>orders</b> were investigated. The results showed that <b>mixing</b> <b>orders</b> I and III displayed better siRNA transfection and protection than <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> II in human breast cancer MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells. More interesting, at the siRNA/PCD/HA charge ratio of 1 / 20 / 16, the gene silencing effects on vascular endothelial growth factor expression in MDA-MB- 231 cells were as follows: <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> III &gt; <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> I &gt; <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> II. Based on these results, a likely explanation for the difference in functionality dependent on <b>mixing</b> <b>orders</b> is the formation of different assembly structures. These results may help future optimization of siRNA ternary complexes for achieving better delivery efficiencies, especially for target-specific siRNA delivery to cells with HA receptor overexpression.

6000|$|Our author {{probably}} {{had good reason}} to call his illustrious friend his [...] "refuge." [...] The Morgante Maggiore, the work which has rendered the name of Pulci renowned, was an attempt to elevate the popular and homely narrative poetry chanted in the streets into the dignity of a production that should last. The age {{was in a state of}} transition on all points. The dogmatic authority of the schoolmen in matters of religion, which prevailed in the time of Dante, had come to nought before the advance of knowledge in general, and the indifference of the court of Rome. The Council of Trent, as Crescimbeni advised the critics, had not then settled what Christendom was to believe; and men, provided they complied with forms, and admitted certain main articles, were allowed to think, and even in great measure talk, as they pleased. The lovers of the Platonic philosophy took the opportunity of exalting some of its dreams to an influence, which at one time was supposed to threaten Christianity itself, and which in fact had already succeeded in affecting Christian theology to an extent which the scorners of Paganism little suspect. Most of these Hellenists pushed their admiration of Greek literature to an excess. They were opposed by the Virgilian predilections of Pulci's friend, Politian, who had nevertheless universality enough to sympathise with the delight the other took in their native Tuscan, and its liveliest and most idiomatic effusions. From all these circumstances in combination arose, first, Pulci's determination to write a poem of a <b>mixed</b> <b>order,</b> which should retain for him the ear of the many, and at the same time give rise to a poetry of romance worthy of higher auditors; second, his banter of what he considered unessential and injurious dogmas of belief, in favour of those principles of the religion of charity which inflict no contradiction on the heart and understanding; third, the trouble which seems to have been given him by critics, [...] "sacred and profane," [...] in consequence of these originalities; and lastly, a doubt which has strangely existed with some, as to whether he intended to write a serious or a comic poem, or on any one point was in earnest at all. One writer thinks he cannot have been in earnest, because he opens every canto with some pious invocation; another asserts that the piety itself is a banter; a similar critic is of opinion, that to mix levities with gravities proves the gravities to have been nought, and the levities all in all; a fourth allows him to have been serious in his description of the battle of Roncesvalles, but says he was laughing in all the rest of his poem; while a fifth candidly gives up the question, as one of those puzzles occasioned by the caprices of the human mind, which it is impossible for reasonable people to solve. Even Sismondi, who was well acquainted with the age in which Pulci wrote, and who, if not a profound, is generally an acute and liberal critic, confesses himself to be thus confounded. [...] "Pulci," [...] he says, [...] "commences all his cantos by a sacred invocation; and the interests of religion are constantly intermingled with the adventures of his story, in a manner capricious and little instructive. We know not how to reconcile this monkish spirit with the semi-pagan character of society under Lorenzo di Medici, nor whether we ought to accuse Pulci of gross bigotry or of profane derision." [...] [1] Sismondi did not consider that the lively and impassioned people of the south take what may be called household-liberties with the objects of their worship greater than northerns can easily conceive; that levity of manner, therefore, does not always imply the absence of the gravest belief; that, be this as it may, the belief may be as grave on some points as light on others, perhaps the more so for that reason; and that, although some poems, like some people, are altogether grave, or the reverse, there really is such a thing as tragi-comedy both in the world itself and in the representations of it. A jesting writer may be quite as much in earnest when he professes to be so, as a pleasant companion who feels for his own or for other people's misfortunes, and who is perhaps obliged to affect or resort to his very pleasantry sometimes, because he feels more acutely than the gravest. The sources of tears and smiles lie close to, ay and help to refine one another. If Dante had been capable of more levity, he would have been guilty of less melancholy absurdities. If Rabelais had been able to weep as well as to laugh, and to love as well as to be licentious, he would have had faith and therefore support in something earnest, and not have been obliged to place the consummation of all things in a wine-bottle. People's every-day experiences might explain to them the greatest apparent inconsistencies of Pulci's muse, if habit itself did not blind them to the illustration. Was nobody ever present in a well-ordered family, when a lively conversation having been interrupted by the announcement of dinner, the company, after listening with the greatest seriousness to a grace delivered with equal seriousness, perhaps by a clergyman, resumed it the instant afterwards in all its gaiety, with the first spoonful of soup? Well, the sacred invocations at the beginning of Pulci's cantos were compliances of the like sort with a custom. They were recited and listened to just as gravely at Lorenzo di Medici's table; and yet neither compromised the reciters, nor were at all associated with the enjoyment of the fare that ensued. So with regard to the intermixture of grave and gay throughout the poem. How many campaigning adventures have been written by gallant officers, whose animal spirits saw food for gaiety in half the circumstances that occurred, and who could crack a jest and a helmet perhaps with almost equal vivacity, and yet be as serious as the gravest at a moment's notice, mourn heartily over the deaths of their friends, and shudder with indignation and horror at the outrages committed in a captured city? It is thus that Pulci writes, full no less of feeling than of whim and mirth. And the whole honest round of humanity not only warrants his plan, but in the twofold sense of the word embraces it.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> and the influence of adding fines on in vitro performance of ipratropium bromide (ITB) dry powder inhaler formulations. Coarse lactose (CL) in varying mass ratio with or without addition of micronized lactose (ML) and ITB in different mixing sequences was used to formulate ternary mixtures. A binary mixture composed of CL and ITP served as control. The in vitro deposition of ITB from these formulations was measured using an Andersen cascade impactor (aerosolization at 39 L/min) employing a HandiHaler as the delivery device. It was observed that <b>mixing</b> <b>order</b> has a significant effect (P<. 05) on in vitro deposition of ITB. Formulations with preblending of CL and ITB produced similar deposition profiles as the control, regardless of the added ML. In contrast, formulations without preblending resulted in significantly higher fine particle dose (FPD) as compared with the control. In addition, an increased quantity of ML generally resulted in an increase in drug deposition. The results show that the effect of ML on dispersion of ITB is highly dependent upon the <b>mixing</b> <b>order.</b> The evaluation of atomic force measurement (AFM) to forecast drug detachment and predict the aerodynamic characteristics resulted in similar attraction forces for the different pairs lactose/lactose (42. 66 ± 25. 01 nN) and lactose/ITB (46. 77 ± 17. 04 nN) ...|$|R
