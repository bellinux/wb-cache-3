5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds {{that contribute to the}} odor of the mushroom. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 12th century priory, during and shortly after Malvern's expansion throughout {{the second half of}} the 19th century over twenty Christian churches were built. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> reproductions of 13th and 14th century architecture including Church of St Matthias, Malvern Link (C of E) begun in 1843, which has a full set of ten ringing bells on which the first full peal of Grandsire Triples was rung on 1 June 1901.

5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an antiarrhythmic agent in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the newly discovered chemical compound as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War a {{large number}} of {{concrete}} pillboxes were built as part of the GHQ Line - Blue to defend against an expected German invasion; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> still visible {{along the banks of the}} canal. They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles. After the war the Transport Act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct. The last through passage was made in 1951 by nb Queen.|$|E

5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> known as mycorrhiza {{and form a}} mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|Paris's {{manufacturing}} {{is mostly}} focused in its suburbs, {{and the city}} itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, {{most of which are}} in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E

5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, {{coming out to}} drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> mirror-image duplicates of others, {{and others}} die before {{having to make}} all the choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Duties of {{citizens}} {{were added to}} the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defense. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. However, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> non-justifiable, without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties.|$|E
