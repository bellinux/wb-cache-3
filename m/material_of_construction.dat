50|$|The <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> of {{the bars}} is {{manganese}} steel to reduce wear.

5000|$|Thus, just {{scaling up}} {{the size of}} an object, keeping the same <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> (density), and same acceleration, would {{increase}} the thrust by the same scaling factor.

50|$|Nozzle wear is {{indicated}} {{by an increase in}} nozzle capacity and by a change in the spray pattern, in which the distribution (uniformity of spray pattern) deteriorates and increases drop size.

Because many single fluid nozzles are used to meter flows, worn nozzles result in excessive liquid usage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> is {{selected}} based on the fluid properties of the liquid {{that is to be}} sprayed and the environment surrounding the nozzle.

Several factors must be considered, including erosive wear, chemical attack, and the effects of high temperature.|$|E
