50|$|The Jacquard Loom is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loom</b> {{that uses}} {{pasteboard}} cards with punched holes, each card corresponding to one {{row of the}} design. Multiple rows of holes are punched in the cards and the many cards that compose {{the design of the}} textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740).|$|E
50|$|The Jacquard loom is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loom,</b> {{invented by}} Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1801, which {{simplifies}} {{the process of}} manufacturing textiles with complex patterns such as brocade, damask and matelasse. The loom is controlled by punched cards with punched holes, each row of which corresponds to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose {{the design of the}} textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740) To call it a loom is a misnomer, a Jacquard head could be attached to a power loom or a hand loom, the head controlling which warp thread was raised during shedding. Multiple shuttles could be used to control the colour of the weft during picking.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the school}} was founded to cover {{the needs of the}} Textile Industry of Terrassa. This {{industry}} reached the peak of its development in the 19th Century {{with the arrival of the}} steam engine and the new <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Protection of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1788 (28 Geo. 3 c. 55) was an Act of Parliament {{passed by}} the British Government in 1788 and aimed at {{increasing}} the penalties for the deliberate disruption of the activity of <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> (stocking frames).|$|R
50|$|The major use {{of white}} coir is in rope manufacture. Mats of woven coir fibre {{are made from}} the finer grades of bristle and white fibre using hand or <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms.</b> White coir also is used to make fishing nets due to its strong {{resistance}} to saltwater.|$|R
50|$|In France, Betancourt {{published}} treatises on engineering (e.g. on coal mining), but {{his real}} assignment was to scout new technologies {{for the benefit}} of Spain and to acquire modern machinery for the future Cabinet of Machinery in Madrid, envisioned by Chief minister Floridablanca. In 1788, he travelled to England, visiting James Watt and Matthew Boulton, pioneers in steam engines. Watt was reluctant to reveal the secrets of his trade, but Betancourt inspected Watt's engines working in London mills. Back in Paris, he wrote a treatise on steam engines and designed a steam-powered pump and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loom,</b> also sending a collection of machinery to Madrid. In 1791, he concentrated on naval technologies - harbor dredging and drilling gun barrels (his own dredge design materialized twenty years later, in Kronstadt). Shortly before the fall of French monarchy, Betancourt returned to Madrid with his new finds.|$|E
50|$|Margaret Knight {{was born}} on February 14, 1838 in York, Maine to James Knight and Hannah Teal. After her father {{died when she was}} young, Knight's family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire. She {{received}} a basic education, but left school with her siblings to work at a cotton mill. At the age of 12, Knight witnessed an accident at the mill where a worker was stabbed by a steel-tipped shuttle that shot out of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loom.</b> Within weeks she invented a safety device for the loom that was later adopted by other Manchester mills. The device was never patented and the exact nature of it is unknown, though it may have been either a device to stop the loom when the shuttle thread broke or a guard to physically block a flying shuttle. Health problems precluded Knight from continuing work at the cotton mill and in her teens and early 20s she held several jobs, including home repair, photography and engraving.|$|E
30|$|The most {{prominent}} initiatives found in research are the SMLC and Industry 4.0, with each initiative loosely connected to their geographical origins (i.e. US and EU). The SMLC working group {{is comprised of}} academic institutions, government agencies and industry partners. These diverse perspectives are an important characteristic of the SMLC as it ensures challenges relevant to the wider community are addressed. While technology roadmaps, recommendations and guidelines have been central to the SMLC’s activities to date, they have also {{been involved in the}} development of a technology platform that implements these recommendations. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy developed by the German government to promote smart manufacturing and the benefits that can be derived by the greater economy. The term Industry 4.0 can be considered a naming convention that serves to partition each industrial revolution, with 4.0 referring to an anticipated fourth revolution (i.e. smart manufacturing) that experts anticipate will come to pass in the next 10 – 20  years. Expanding on this naming convention further, previous industrial revolutions can be labelled 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. The first revolution (Industry 1.0) was brought about by the use of water and steam power to enable mechanical production, with the first <b>mechanical</b> <b>loom</b> employed in 1784. The second revolution (Industry 2.0) was brought about by the use of electricity to realise mass production, which in turn promoted the division of labour in production processes. Finally, the third revolution (Industry 3.0) was brought about by advances in electronics and information systems that enabled control networks to automate the production process, with the first programmable logic controller (PLC) introduced in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Josep Bonaplata {{worked at}} the family manufactory until his father retired and the {{business}} was inherited by his older brother, Salvador. In 1828 Josep and his friend Joan Vilaregut then started a cotton textile factory in Sallent, with <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> that were hydro-powered by the Llobregat river. In 1829, {{in an attempt to}} modernise his business, he was given permission by the Spanish government to import an English steam engine.|$|R
5000|$|The woollen {{industry}} was long {{of the greatest}} importance to the town's economy; {{by the end of}} the 18th century, output was reckoned to be worth £50,000 to £100,000 annually. The industry declined in the first half of the 19th century, owing to the introduction of <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms.</b> Another important contributor to the local economy was tanning, which continued into the 1980s in Dolgellau, though on a much reduced scale.|$|R

For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic.|$|R
50|$|Daens {{is upset}} {{when he hears}} about the bad work {{conditions}} in the textile industry. Workmen are abused and exploited by the rich directors only for their own profit. To gain more profit, the companies have just decided to fire all men. They are replaced by women as their wages are much lower. Children need to work day and night, fall asleep and are flattened under the <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms.</b> Industrial accidents happen continuously and the management takes no action.|$|R
2500|$|In modern times, saris are {{increasingly}} woven on <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> {{and made of}} artificial fibres, such as polyester, nylon, or rayon, which do not require starching or ironing. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with floats {{across the back of}} the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The punchra work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer Aaditya Sharma declared, [...] "I can drape a sari in 54 different styles".|$|R
50|$|Naturally colored cotton had {{a smaller}} fiber {{which was not}} {{suitable}} for <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> used today, so this kept it from entering the commercial market. In 1982, Sally Fox a graduate in Integrated Pest Management from University of California with a master's degree started researching on colored cotton and integrated her knowledge and experience in technology and introduced first long fiber of naturally colored cotton. Sally Fox later started her company, Natural Cotton Colors, Inc. and got patents in different shades including: green, Coyote brown, Buffalo brown, and Palo Verde green under FoxFiber.|$|R
2500|$|This {{analysis}} {{was an important}} development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: [...] "When she saw some <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, {{it reminded her of}} how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations." [...] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.|$|R
50|$|On September 30, 1831 Bonaplata {{formed the}} firm Bonaplata, Rull, Vilaregut i Cia with his three brothers, his friend Joan Vilaregut, {{and his new}} partner Joan Rull. The company was {{capitalized}} with 1.600.000 reales. The Bonaplata Factory (also known as El Vapor) was in Carrer Tallers in Barcelona's Raval neighborhood, and it had two activities: in 1832 an iron foundry was installed with a workshop for making <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms,</b> and in November 1833 the mechanical weaving and spinning manufactory opened. This was the first factory in Spain to use a steam engine to power machinery. Its value and social impact was immediately recognised, as it employed roughly 700 people, and it inspired the modernisation of the economy.|$|R
50|$|Japan {{also participated}} to the 1867 World Fair in Paris, having its own pavilion. The fair aroused {{considerable}} interest in Japan, and allowed many visitors {{to come in}} contact with Japanese art and techniques. Many Japanese representatives visited the Fair on this occasion, including a member of the House of the Shogun, his younger brother Tokugawa Akitake. The southern region of Satsuma (a regular opponent to the Bakufu) also had a representation at the World Fair, as the suzerain of the Kingdom of Naha in the Ryu Kyu islands. The Satsuma mission was composed of 20 envoys, among them 14 students, who participated to the fair, and also negotiated the purchase of weapons and <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1245 the {{statutes}} of Biella were already {{referring to the}} woolworkers' and weavers' guilds: hardly surprising {{in view of the}} region's high mountain pastures and copious water supply needed for washing fleece and powering mills. In the 17th and 18th centuries, as elsewhere in Italy, silk was an important industry, and a silk manufacture was built in town in 1695: in 1835, however, the town's textile history came round full circle when the same building was put to use as a wool factory with the introduction of <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms,</b> putting Biella at the forefront of modern improvements in the industry. Since 1999/2000, a progressively worse crisis in the sector forced many local wool mills to close, since they could not compete with the prices of imported fabrics and clothing.|$|R
50|$|On <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> the {{technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop pile and cut pile in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate pile fabrics. With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|R

50|$|Emil Kirdorf {{was born}} at Mettmann, Rhine Province. His father was a wealthy owner of a weaving mill. He had a brother named Adolf who would be his {{business}} partner during his adult life. Kirdorf volunteered a year in 1864 in Hamburg {{to work in an}} export enterprise. A year later, he worked in a textile company in Krefeld. The family's mill went bankrupt, mainly because of the management's refusal to introduce <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms.</b> Kirdorf therefore changed to mining industry in which he worked as an accountant. Following the Franco-Prussian War, he became director of Zeche Holland in 1871. Two years later, the entrepreneur Friedrich Grillo offered him the position of commercial director in the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG (GBAG) company. He became general manager of GBAG in 1893. He steered the company through the Long Depression of the 1870s, and held this position until 1926.|$|R
5000|$|Modern taffeta {{was first}} woven in Italy and France {{and until the}} 1950s in Japan. Warp-printed taffeta or chiné, mainly made in France from the eighteenth century onwards, is {{sometimes}} called [...] "pompadour taffeta" [...] after Madame de Pompadour. Today most raw silk taffeta is produced in India and Pakistan. There, even in the modern period, handlooms were long widely used, but since the 1990s it has been produced on <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> in the Bangalore area. From the 1970s until the 1990s, the Jiangsu province of China produced fine silk taffetas: these were less flexible than those from Indian mills, however, which continue to dominate production. Other countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East also produce silk taffeta, but these products are not yet equal in quality or competitiveness to those from India. The most deluxe taffetas, however, are still woven in France, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom.|$|R

50|$|Shaw married, in 1841, Louisa Hannah, only {{daughter}} of Major Martin Curry of the 67th Foot, {{and they had}} a son, Charles Martin Shaw. On 10 May 1844 he transferred from half-pay into the 73rd Foot in order to sell his commission and retire from the army. However, he continued to take an interest in military affairs, writing to British newspapers and politicians from the Continent, where he resided. His pet subjects included the Minie Rifle, soldiers' welfare, and coastal defence. His articles for the Caledonian Mercury during the invasion scare of 1859 make his points by describing a mythical attack on the port of Leith, somewhat in the style of Chesney's later The Battle of Dorking or Swinton's The Defence of Duffer's Drift. In these he advocated the used of 'rifle batteries' consisting of 12-20 rifle barrels that could be operated by one or two men, using the analogy of <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms</b> that did the work of many weavers. These 'rifle batteries' seem to prefigure the later Nordenfeldt gun.|$|R

50|$|The continual {{wars and}} fiscal crises greatly limited the {{expansion}} of French industry. The Industrial Revolution had only just begun in France. Production during the Directory had fallen below {{what it was in}} 1789. The number of workers in the silk industry in Lyon had dropped from 12,000 before 1787 to 6,500. The cotton textile industry was more successful due to the embargo against British products caused by the war. New factories and new technologies, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>looms,</b> were introduced in Normandy and in Alsace. However, the technologies were still primitive; the steam engine had not yet arrived in French factories. The chemical industry was also advancing rapidly during he Directory; the chemist and entrepreneur Jean Antoine Claude Chaptal built a chemical factory in Montpellier, which he soon moved to Chaillot, a village west of Paris. The most effective promoter of French industry was François de Neufchâteau, who was Minister of the Interior before becoming a Director in 1797. He planned a new canal system, began work on a new road across the Pyrenees, and organized the first national industrial exposition in Paris, which opened with great success in October 1798. Once he became Consul, Bonaparte copied the idea of the industrial exposition. Despite this bright spot, French industry was primitive: without steam power, most factories in France depended upon water power, and the metallurgy industry still melted iron with wood fires, not oil.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century hand weaving with looms was the {{predominant}} {{activity of the}} surrounding villages. The Industrial Age in Erkelenz first began {{with the introduction of}} <b>mechanical</b> weaving <b>looms</b> for making cloth. In 1854 the Rockstoff Factory I.B. Oellers, was established on the present Parkweg; it was a mechanical weaving mill which, at times, employed 120 workers and 20 salesmen. In 1872 the mechanical plush weaving mill of Karl Müller (corner of Kölner Straße and Heinrich Jansen Weg) was founded; it employed 60 hand weavers in Erkelenz and another 400 in the regions of Berg and the Rhön area for the main Erkelenz operation. In 1897 the Halcour Textile Factory appeared on Neußer Straße, which had 67 male and 22 female workers in 1911 in its factory-owned health insurance department.|$|R
