25|$|As an 18-year-old, Dinnissen {{appeared}} for a Young Netherlands {{team at the}} 1983 Centenary Tournament in Utrecht, {{which also}} featured the senior teams of Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Her own senior debut came in August 1985, during a tour of England, while her ODI debut was made at the 1988 World Cup in Australia. With Isabelle Koppe-van Dishoek the first-choice wicket-keeper, Dinnissen was initially used solely as a middle-order batsman. However, in the games against Ireland and England later in the tournament, she did keep wicket (in Koppe-van Dishoek's absence). Against England, she top-scored with 28 runs from a team total of 98/9, <b>making</b> <b>what</b> was to be her highest ODI score. After the World Cup, Dinnissen played only three more ODIs – one in the 1990 European Championship, and two in the 1991 edition. She played only as a batsman at those tournaments, with Karen van Rijn keeping wicket.|$|E
25|$|Having England {{as an ally}} {{meant that}} the {{military}} situation of the Republic was strongly improved, but this very fact induced William to be uncompromising in his position towards France. This policy led to {{a large number of}} very expensive campaigns which were largely paid for with Dutch funds. In 1712 the Republic was financially exhausted; it withdrew from international politics and was forced to let its fleet deteriorate, <b>making</b> <b>what</b> was by then the Kingdom of Great Britain the dominant maritime power of the world. The Dutch economy, already burdened by the high national debt and concomitant high taxation, suffered from the other European states' protectionist policies, which its weakened fleet was no longer able to resist. To make matters worse, the main Dutch trading and banking houses moved much of their activity from Amsterdam to London after 1688. Between 1688 and 1720, world trade dominance shifted from the Republic to Britain.|$|E

Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E

[...] Whitehead also wrote, even without the iconic superhero, it would be a polished and engrossing game featuring compelling story and superb voice acting. PSM3s Andy Kelly wrote, [...] "Rocksteady have struck the perfect balance of giving you the confident power of a superhero, but with enough weaknesses to make the game challenging; a remarkable feat of balancing and design". Wireds Chris Kohler said that the game's strength lies in its tight script and masterful acting, <b>making</b> <b>what</b> could be a generic game captivating. 1UP.com's Thierry Nguyen gave the game an A−, stating that Rocksteady [...] "manages to combine combat, stealth, storytelling, and cartoon voices into the best digital Batman simulator we've seen to date." ...|$|E

The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of industry executives (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator, among others.

Targoff maintains that what distinguishes [...] "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning" [...] from Donne's other [...] "Valedictions" [...] is what Donne leaves for his lover: [...] "Donne does not leave his beloved either a physical or spiritual piece of himself. Instead, he leaves her {{the power of}} his poetic <b>making.</b> <b>What</b> is meant to prevent her [...] "mourning" [...] is not her possession of his name or book or heart or soul. It is the possession of his metaphors, metaphors of their union that seem invulnerable to division". Guibbory uses [...] "A Valediction" [...] to highlight Donne's status as [...] "master of the monosyllable, the small word that holds the line taut" [...] with his use of the word [...] "beat" [...] rather than [...] "spun" [...] in the analogy of beaten gold, while Ian Ousby uses the compass metaphor as an example of Donne's skill at weaving conceits [...] "sometimes extended throughout an entire poem in a virtuoso display of similitude". This view is seconded by Geoffrey Galt Harpham, who refers to it as [...] "the best known sustained conceit".|$|E

Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making {{his way to a}} Coastwatcher post and returning to Port Moresby in a schooner, nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died. On 7April, Lerew was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for [...] "outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain". The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the Chief of the Air Staff to commend Lerew's squadron for the [...] "effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition".|$|E
