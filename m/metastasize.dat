5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} <b>metastasize</b> to the brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of a biopsy is often helpful {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer {{can also}} be a {{secondary}} cancer, the result of metastasis from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body. About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers. Common primary cancers are breast cancer, colon cancer, appendiceal cancer, and stomach cancer (primary gastric cancers that <b>metastasize</b> to the ovary are called Krukenberg tumors). Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells. Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also <b>metastasize</b> to the ovary.|$|E
25|$|Insulinomas* in {{dogs are}} insulin {{secreting}} {{tumors of the}} pancreas. The most common sign is hypoglycemia. They commonly <b>metastasize</b> to the liver.|$|E
40|$|Among {{salivary gland}} neoplasms, <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma (MPA) {{constitutes}} an extremely rare group of tumors. The present paper reports {{a case of}} pleomorphic adenoma (PA) in submandibular gland that, after more than 30 years of initial treatment, recurred and <b>metastasized</b> to ipsilateral neck lymph nodes and parotid gland. In an attempt to elucidate the malignant behavior of <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma, we performed Ki- 67, p 53, p 16, and bcl- 2 immunohistochemistry staining of our case sample. Many immunohistochemistry staining {{studies have been done}} on malignant salivary gland tumors. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge no immunohistochemistry staining of the aforementioned markers has been previously performed on <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma...|$|R
30|$|We {{report the}} {{incident}} breast carcinoma categories by behaviour (in situ {{carcinoma of the}} breast; invasive carcinoma i.e. breast cancer), morphology (ductal, lobular, others), and stage (local, <b>metastasized,</b> unknown). The ductal carcinomas are those with ICD-O- 3 -codes M 8500 - 07, and lobular carcinomas those with an ICD-O 3 -code M 8520. The <b>metastasized</b> breast cancers are those <b>metastasized</b> to regional lymph nodes only (regional metastasis) or further and/or to adjacent tissues (distant metastasis).|$|R
40|$|<b>Metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma {{is a rare}} {{condition}} of metastasis from a histologically be-nign pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands. The bones and lungs {{are the most common}} metastatic locations for <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma, suggesting hematogenous spread of the primary tumor. However, we observed a case of <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic ade-noma presenting with cervical lymph node metastasis, suggesting metastasis through the re-gional lymphatic system, in a 37 -year-old woman who underwent parotidectomy 14 years ear-lier.

25|$|Malignant anaplastic meningioma is an {{especially}} malignant tumor with aggressive behavior. Even if, by general rule, neoplasms {{of the nervous system}} (brain tumors) cannot <b>metastasize</b> into the body because of the blood–brain barrier, anaplastic meningioma can. Although they are inside the cerebral cavity, they are located on the bloodside of the BBB, because meningiomas tend to be connected to blood vessels. Thus, cancerized cells can escape into the bloodstream, which is why meningiomas, when they <b>metastasize,</b> often turn up around the lungs.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of rare {{conditions}} in which fibroids <b>metastasize.</b> They still grow in a benign fashion, but can be dangerous depending on their location.|$|E
25|$|Testicular tumors* are {{the most}} common tumor of the canine male {{reproductive}} tract. Tumor types include Sertoli cell tumor, seminoma, and interstitial cell tumor. None commonly <b>metastasize.</b>|$|E
40|$|A 60 -year-old woman {{presented}} with vague abdominal pain {{for one week}} was referred to pancreatic tail carcinoma accompanied with splenic <b>metastasizes.</b> She came to our hospital for further treatment. Ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a pancreatic tail tumor with splenic <b>metastasizes.</b> There was no history of tuberculosis. Laparotomy was performed because pancreatic tail carcinoma with splenic <b>metastasizes</b> was highly suspected. Indurated mass in the pancreatic tail and sporadic <b>metastasizes</b> in the spleen had been found during the surgery. The pancreatic tail and the spleen were removed and proved to be tuberculosis on histological examination of a frozen section. The patient was given antituberculosis therapy and is now getting well. Tuberculosis {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses. The response to antituberculosis treatment is very favorable...|$|R
40|$|A benign {{pulmonary}} <b>metastasizing</b> leiomyoma is {{a recognized}} clinical entity {{that has been}} infrequently reported in the medical literature. We report two cases of a benign pulmonary <b>metastasizing</b> leiomyoma. A 35 -year-old woman who underwent myomectomy and a cesarean section approximately 6 years earlier visited our hospital for further evaluation of incidentally revealed multiple lung nodules. A diagnostic percutaneuous biopsy was performed. Finally {{she was diagnosed with}} a benign <b>metastasizing</b> leiomyoma. The patient then received LH-RH and has been followed up since. The other 44 -year-old woman presented after an initial radiology evaluation revealed the presence of multiple, small-sized lung nodules. She underwent a right middle lung wedge resection to confirm the diagnosis. Finally she diagnosed with a benign <b>metastasizing</b> leiomyoma. The multiple lung nodules have been followed up closely...|$|R
40|$|So far, {{computed}} tomography (CT) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{have been used in}} the detection of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) metastases. We have used PET-CT postoperatively to detect any further metastases of BCC not visible by other techniques. BCC of the trunk are reportedly larger than those located {{in the head and neck}} region. These tumors also have a higher incidence of <b>metastasizing.</b> Although it has been suggested in the literature that the TNM (Tumor–Nodes-Metastases) system is not being used routinely for <b>metastasizing</b> BCC. There have been 19 reports of <b>metastasizing</b> BCC of the trunk. We present a case of a 78 -year old male patient with large ulcerating <b>metastasizing</b> BCC of the trunk. The literature is reviewed for similar cases and the TNM system is applied...|$|R

25|$|Metastasis is {{the major}} cause of tumor lethality. However, not every tumor cell can <b>metastasize.</b> This {{potential}} depends on factors that determine growth, angiogenesis, invasion and other basic processes.|$|E
25|$|Guinea pigs: Mammary {{tumors in}} guinea pigs occur in males and females. Most are benign, but 30 percent are adenocarcinomas. They {{usually do not}} <b>metastasize,</b> but {{aggressive}} surgery is necessary to prevent recurrence.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma is an {{uncommon}} malignant tumor of the salivary gland demonstrating benign epithelial and modified myoepithelial elements intermingling with tissue of mucoid, myxoid, or chondroid appearance that inexplicably manifests local or distant metastasis. Objective: To determine {{the expression of}} hormonal receptor in the patients with <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma of the major salivary gland. Material and Method: Medical records, clinical and pathologic findings of three patients who were diagnosed as <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma were reviewed. The immunohistochemical stains for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki- 67 were performed. Results: Three cases of <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma, clinically presenting as painless, gradually enlarged cervical lymph nodes were reported. The pathologic examinations of the cervical lymph nodes are morphologically and immunohistologically identical to the sialoadenectomy specimen. Immunohistochemical stains show positive reactivity to progesterone receptor, but negative reactivity to estrogen receptor in both mesenchymal and epithelial components of pleomorphic adenoma. Conclusion: These are the first reported cases of <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma of the major salivary glands associated with expression of progesterone receptor in both specimens of sialoadenectomy and lymp...|$|R

25|$|To fully stage ovarian cancer, lymphadenectomy {{should be}} {{included}} in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen. This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently <b>metastasize</b> to nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypopharynx}} {{includes the}} pyriform sinuses, the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the postcricoid area. Tumors of the hypopharynx frequently have an advanced stage at diagnosis, {{and have the}} most adverse prognoses of pharyngeal tumors. They tend to <b>metastasize</b> early due to the extensive lymphatic network around the larynx.|$|E
25|$|Metastasis in {{ovarian cancer}} {{is very common}} in the abdomen, and occurs via exfoliation, where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule {{and are able to}} move freely {{throughout}} the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and <b>metastasize</b> to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, obturator, and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not <b>metastasize</b> to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.|$|E

25|$|Some tumors, {{especially}} carcinomas may <b>metastasize</b> along anatomical canalicular spaces. These spaces include {{for example}} the bile ducts, the urinary system, the airways and the subarachnoid space. The process {{is similar to that}} of transcoelomic spread. However, often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent (field cancerization).|$|E
25|$|There is {{not enough}} {{definitive}} evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g. rectal melanoma), although these tend to <b>metastasize</b> more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, {{it is impossible to}} know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a pathology report might indicate.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{reaching}} the advanced stages of colorectal cancer, the polyps {{are confined to}} the inner wall and thickness of the intestinal tract and do not <b>metastasize</b> or 'spread'. So provided FAP is detected and controlled either at the pre-cancerous stage or when any cancerous polyps are still internal to the intestinal tract, surgery has a very high success rate of preventing or removing cancer, without recurrence, since the locations giving rise to cancer are physically removed in toto by the surgery.|$|E
40|$|Distant {{metastasis}} of benign pleomorphic adenoma of {{salivary glands}} rarely occurs, and these neoplasms have been termed <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma. We present a rare case of <b>metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma of the submandibular gland with lung and bone metastases obtained MR images and pathological findings. On MRI, the lesions were depicted {{as an area}} of high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images (WI), reflecting myxoid or/and chondroid matrices. <b>Metastasizing</b> pleomorphic adenoma {{should be considered as}} a differential diagnosis when a pulmonary lesion shows high signal intensity on T 2 -WI and the patient has a medical history of salivary pleomorphic adenoma...|$|R

25|$|The table below {{highlights}} some of {{the challenges}} with decision making and prognostication in thyroid cancer. While there is general agreement that stage I or II papillary, follicular or medullary cancer have a good prognosis, {{it is not possible}} when evaluating a small thyroid cancer to determine which ones will grow and <b>metastasize</b> and which will not. As a result, once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been established (most commonly by a fine needle aspiration), it is likely that a total thyroidectomy will be performed.|$|E
25|$|In {{breast cancer}} CD44+CD24−/low cells are {{detectable}} in metastatic pleural effusions. By contrast, an {{increased number of}} CD24+ cells {{have been identified in}} distant metastases in breast cancer patients. It is possible that CD44+CD24−/low cells initially <b>metastasize</b> and in the new site change their phenotype and undergo limited differentiation. The two-phase expression pattern hypothesis proposes two forms of cancer stem cells - stationary (SCS) and mobile (MCS). SCS are embedded in tissue and persist in differentiated areas throughout tumor progression. MCS are located at the tumor-host interface. These cells are apparently derived from SCS through the acquisition of transient EMT (Figure 7).|$|E
25|$|In oncology, class III β-tubulin {{has been}} {{investigated}} as both a prognostic biomarker and an indicator of resistance to taxanes and other compounds. The majority of reports implicate class III β-tubulin as a biomarker of poor outcome. However, there are also data in clear cell carcinoma, melanoma and breast cancer showing favorable prognosis. Class III β-tubulin is integral component of a pro-survival, cascading molecular pathway which renders cancer cells resistant to apoptosis and enhances their ability to invade local tissues and <b>metastasize.</b> Class III β-tubulin performs best as a prognostic biomarker when analyzed {{in the context of}} an integrated signature including upstream regulators and downstream effectors. TUBB3 mutation is associated with microlissencephaly.|$|E

40|$|Immunological and {{biochemical}} {{studies of}} spontaneously <b>metastasizing</b> and nonmetastasizing rat mammary carcinomas and their plasma membranes indicated that: (i) all spontaneously <b>metastasizing</b> tumors {{have little or}} no demonstrable glycocalyx, while all nonmetastasizing tumors have a thick glycocalyx; (ii) there is a direct relationship between the glycocalyx and immunogenicity, and an inverse relationship with the <b>metastasizing</b> capacity of tumor cells, properties which can be quantitated by levels of the plasma membrane marker enzyme 5 '-nucleotidase (EC 3. 1. 3. 5; 5 '-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase) activity; (iii) the absence of glycocalyx from the <b>metastasizing</b> tumor cell surface seems to result from its dissociation from plasma membranes, for solubilized cell surface antigen is readily found in the blood of <b>metastasizing</b> tumor bearing rats, while there was no detectable tumor cell surface antigen in the blood of the nonmetastasizing tumor hosts tested; (iv) both <b>metastasizing</b> and nonmetastasizing mammary tumors appear to have a common soluble cell surface antigen; (v) in addition to this common antigen, there is another membrane-bound antigen in the nonmetastasizing, immunogenic tumor cell surface which presumably is the tumor specific transplantation antigen; and (vi) this antigen is immunobiologically unique, but seems to be immunochemically related to the common soluble antigen.
