40|$|A quantal guiding center theory {{allowing}} {{to systematically}} study {{the separation of}} the different time scale behaviours of a quantum charged spinning particle moving in an external inhomogeneous <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> is presented. A suitable set of operators adapting to the canonical structure of the problem and generalizing the kinematical momenta and guiding center operators of a particle coupled to a homogenous <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> is constructed. The Pauli Hamiltonian rewrites in this way as a power series in the magnetic length l_B= √(ħ c/eB) making the problem amenable to a perturbative analysis.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{to measure the}} current profile in lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) plasmas by using hard X-ray (HXR) energy spectrum measurement along {{the top and bottom}} identical line of sight (ILOS) is proposed. An angle between ILOS and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> line is out of alignment from the perpendicular by the poloidal magnetic field. As the emission cross-section of HXR strongly depends on the angle to the drift direction of energetic electrons, that is the <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> line, this disagreement of the angles makes significant difference between the signals of detectors located on the top and bottom. As the result, the poloidal magnetic field is able to be derived from the difference of the HXR emission along the top and bottom ILOS.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} preliminary work done on {{developing a new}} technique to produce magnetically aligned structure in selected regions of rapidly solidified alloys. Rapid solidification of the Bi- 20 at%Mn alloy resulted in dispersion of the fine BiMn grains in the supersaturated Bi-rich matrix.

The rapidly solidified specimen when further subjected to the semi-solid processing under a <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> of 4 T achieved the alignment of the BiMn grains due to the magnetic anisotropy and consequently exhibited a hysterisis loop in the magnetization curve.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we discuss the {{combined}} effect of convective Heat and mass transfer on hydromagnetic electrically conducting viscous, incompressible fluid through a porous medium in a vertical channel bounded by flat walls. A uniform <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> of strength H 0 is applied transverse to the bounding walls. Assuming the magnetic Reynolds number to be small, we neglect the induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>filed</b> {{in comparison to the}} applied filed. A non-uniform temperature is imposed on the walls and the concentration on these walls is taken to be constant. The viscous dissipation is taken into account in the energy equation. Assuming the slope of the boundary temperature to be small we solve the governing momentum, energy and diffusion equations by a perturbation technique. The velocity, temperature, shear stress and the rate of heat transfer have been analysed for different variations of the governing parameters. The dissipative effects on the flow, heat and mass transfer are clearly seen...|$|E

30|$|The ionospheric {{electric}} field {{effects on the}} electron density variations are shown in Fig.  2. Before the arrival of solar eclipse at 1730 [*]UT (top panel of Fig.  2 c), the {{electric field}} had been enhanced in the eastward direction around the geophysical latitude of −[*] 5 ~ 20 ° N compared with the previous day. This eastward enhanced electric field on the eclipse day relatively uplifted the ionospheric F layer and resulted in the enhancement of electron density around geophysical latitude 10 ° N. At 1830 [*]UT, the enhancement and reduction of eastward electric field perturbations further appeared at low- and mid-latitude regions, respectively, in the northern hemisphere. Since the electric fields at low- and mid-latitude regions are calculated with the assumption of equal potential along the magnetic field line (Richmond et al. 1992), the feature of enhanced and reduced electric field perturbations overall appeared along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>file</b> lines, but had the smaller perturbations in the southern hemisphere (also seen in Fig.  3 c).

Methods: Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin administration. Pulsed <b>filed</b> <b>magnetic</b> field treatment performed at 1, 5 mT intensity on diabetic rats. Aortas were excised out and mRNAs were isolated and reverse transcribed into cDNAs. In order to evaluate mRNA expression levels, real time PCR was employed with primers specific for Kir 6. 1 and Kir 6. 2 mRNA. Results: In our studies, pulsed <b>filed</b> <b>magnetic</b> field treatment repressed Kir 6. 1 but not Kir 6. 2 mRNA expression in diabetic rats. Conclusion: In aorta diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction leads to impairment in contraction-relaxation response and vascular tone, which could be recovered in part by PMF treatment.
