Patients and methods The study comprised 44 consecutive boys undergoing primary or repeat surgery for hypospadias between October 1999 and April 2000. They were arbitrarily divided into two groups; group 1 received a conventional local scrub with soap/water 48 h before surgery and group 2, a conventional local scrub with soap/water {{was followed by a}} local application of 2 % <b>mercurochrome</b> for 48 h before surgery. Both groups were comparable in age, location of the meatus and stage of repair. All patients were exposed to similar conditions during and after surgery.

Results <b>Mercurochrome</b> significantly decreased local infection, especially before surgery, but its effect in decreasing fistula formation, although appreciable, was not statistically significant. Conclusion The local application of <b>mercurochrome</b> after a soap/water scrub for at least 48 h before surgery is a simple, economic and effective means to decrease postoperative wound infection. Future studies are needed, keeping other determinants of fistula formation constant, to evaluate its role in decreasing fistula formation in patients undergoing hypospadias repair...|$|E
40|$|One of us (J. H. B.) {{together}} with G. K. Elphick has recently described (1) {{a method of}} determining the toxicity of samples of <b>mercurochrome</b> by intravenous injection into groups of mice. The toxicity is measured as the average lethal dose, this being defined as the dose which causes the death of 50 per cent of mice within seven days of the injection of the <b>mercurochrome.</b> To de-termine the toxicity of an unknown sample, 30 mice are injected each with the same dose per kilogram body weight; from the number which die a percentage mortality is calculated, and by reference to a characteristic curve the dose which would have killed exactly 50 per cent is calculated. An examination {{of a series of}} commercial samples of <b>mercurochrome</b> revealed a wide variation in toxicity, from 37 mgm. per kilogram to 138 mgm. per kilogram, and it was suggested that manufacturers might suitably make a rule to consider samples of which the average lethal dose was less than 105 mgm. per kilogram unfit for sale. Since the publication of the above paper, one of us (0. D.

40|$|Abstract Background There is a {{need for}} {{improving}} the method for counting oocysts of Plasmodium berghei in the midgut of Anopheles mosquitoes. The two methods currently used, the formalin fixation method and the <b>mercurochrome</b> staining method, have contradicting advantages and disadvantages. In the formalin fixation method, the specimen can be preserved but unstained oocysts were often indistinct from the insect tissue. While in the <b>mercurochrome</b> staining method, stained oocysts can be clearly distinguished from insect tissue but the specimen are not well preserved. These two methods were combined in this study to develop a new improved technique in counting the oocysts, in which the specimen can be both stained and preserved well. This technique was evaluated for its accuracy and suitability in observing the oocyst development. Findings In the improved technique, the parasite-infected midgut was first stained with <b>mercurochrome,</b> and then fixed with formalin. The specimens were finally observed using light microscopy. To evaluate the accuracy in the oocyst counting with the improved technique, mosquitoes were infected with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) -expressing parasite. Then, the midgut oocysts were counted using both the GFP marker and the improved technique. Results were then compared and showed that the improved technique retrieved 78 %- 123 % (arithmetic mean = 97 %) of the oocysts counted using the GFP marker. Furthermore, it was also possible to evaluate the oocyst development with a green filter using the light microscopy. Conclusions The improved technique for oocyst counting will be a useful tool for evaluating midgut oocyst numbers and determining the developmental stage of oocysts in parasite-infected mosquitoes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the experience of}} the first 50 cases of cordocentesis after practicing with cordocentesis model. Material and Method: Cordocentesis model consisted of a water-filled transparent glass box covered with a rubber latex sheet with or without piece of pork skin. A 30 -cm umbilical cord filled with <b>mercurochrome,</b> hung inside the container, was the target for the puncture. As in real practice, the trainee had to try to aspirate the red <b>mercurochrome</b> from the umbilical cord using a spinal needle under ultrasonographic guidance. After practicing with the model for 300 procedures, the trainee was allowed to perform cordocentesis on pregnant women at gestational age of 18 - 22 weeks by herself under expert supervision with time limit of 30 minutes. The procedure not successful in 30 minutes was considered failure. Duration of procedures, placental site, puncture site, and related complications were recorded for subsequent analysis. Results: After practicing with model for 300 procedures, real cordocentesis was performed by the trainee on 50 pregnant women. The success rate in obtaining fetal blood within 30 minutes was 100 %. Most of them (92 %) took less than 10 minutes to complete the procedure. Puncture site bleeding and fetal bradycardia were the most common immediate complications, found in 30 % and 8 % respectively, and spontaneously resolved within few minutes.

40|$|The {{experiments}} were designed (1) {{to investigate the}} effects of various types of injury to the peritoneum on the formation of adhesions, and (2) to study the hitological changes of the intestinal wall when injured artificially with 5 % iodine tincture. The experimental animals used were Wistar adult male rats with a weight range of 90 to 120 grams. A total of 170 rats were used. Experiment 1. The experimental animals were divided into 10 groups, each group consisting of 10 to 20 rats. Group A. The caecal serosa was injured with 2 % iodine tincture. Group B. The caecal seroSa was injured with 5 % iodine tincture. Group C. The caecal serosa was abraded with gauze until subserosal petechies were produced. Additional trauma to this area waS inflicted with 2 % iodine tincture. Group D. The caecal serosa was injured as in group C, but 5 % iodine tincture was used. Group E. The caecal serosa waS injured with 2 % aqueous <b>mercurochrome</b> solution. Group F. The caecal serosa was rubbed with gauze until subserosaI petechies were produced. Additional trauma to this area was inflicted with 2 % aqueous <b>mercurochrome</b> solution. Group G. The caecal wall was rubbed with gauze 100 times, injuring the subserosa. Group R. The anterior wall of the stomach and caecum was traumatized with a toothbrush and 2 ml of aqueous talcum solution were instilled into the peritoneal cavity. Group I. Excisions of the parietal peritoneum were performed with a surgical knife over areas of varying sizes at {{both sides of the}} operation wound. Group J. Adjacent loop of the intestines with normal serosa were connected to one another by No. 2 black silk suture at two or three points. In five cases of this group, contacting surfaces of the intestines were injured with 5 % iodine tincture. The results obtained were as follows : (1) Local administration of 2 % iodine tincture and 2 % aqueous <b>mercurochrome</b> solution would not produce adhesions unless mechanical injury, such as rubbing with gauze was also present. (2) When the serosa was slightly injured with gauze, fibrinous adhesions were separated or torn apart by bowel movements. (3) Local administration of 5 % iodine tincture produced in all members of group B. The adhesions were moderate, not extensive in degree. Additional mechanical trauma aggravated the adhesions caused by bacterial contamination. (4) Intraperitoneal instillation of 10 % aqueous talcum solution produced extensive adhesions. The favorite sites of occurrence of the adhesions were the greater omentum and the small intestine. (5) Excision of the parietal peritoneum over areas of vareous sizes caused no adhesion. (6) Even prolonged contact between the intestinal wall and normal serosa did not result in the formation of adhesions. However, firm adhesions resulted from prolonged contact between injured serosal surfaces regardless of the type of injury. (7) The author would like to emphasize that large peritoneal defects should be left untreated, because attempts at peritonealization result in additional injury to the subserosa and often in more extensive adhesions. Experiment 2. (1) Edema and an infiltration of leucocytes occurred {{in the early stages of}} the inflammation. These histological changes were seen not only in the subserosa, the muscular layer, and the submucosa, but also in the mucosa. Lesions in the mucosa slowly developed into necroses or ulcers. The intensity of the adhesions varied with the severity of the lesions in the mucosa. (2) Twenty-four hours after injury to the peritoneum, P. A. S. positive substances began to appear in the submucosa, disappearing fourth post-operative day. (3) The process of the formation of the adhesions may be outlined as follow: a) After injury to the peritoneal surface, an exudate is formed. b) Thise xudate coagulates to form fibrin, which causes adiacent surfaces to cohere. c) Dunng organization, fibroblasts or fibrocytes migrate into this area. e) Whth the aid of mucopolysacchrides in ground substances, collagen is deposited and grdually a firm adhesion is formed. In some cases, however, this area becomes membraneous or strand-like in form during the completion of the process of adhesions, and is eventually torn apart...|$|E
40|$|Trudinger, P. A. (Division of Plant Industry, Canberra, Australia). Effect of thiol-binding {{reagents}} on the metabolism of thiosulfate and tetrathionate by Thiobacillus neapolitanus. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 617 – 625. 1965. —Iodoacetamide, N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), p-chloromercuribenzoate (CMB), <b>Mercurochrome,</b> and HgCl 2 inhibited the oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate by Thiobacillus neapolitanus; tetrathionate accumulated {{under these}} conditions. High concentrations of the thiol-binding reagents lowered {{the rate of}} oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate; inhibition by CMB was reversed by high concentrations of thiosulfate. Relatively low concentrations of the thiol-binding reagents completely inhibited the oxidation and anaerobic metabolism of tetrathionate. Similar reagents {{had no effect on}} a soluble thiosulfate-oxidizing enzyme. Inhibition by thiol-binding reagents was overcome by washing the bacteria with Na 2 S or thioethanol after their exposure to the inhibitors. Under some conditions, the addition of thiosulfate or tetrathionate to bacterial suspensions before the addition of the thiol-binding reagents prevented the inhibition of thiosulfate and tetrathionate metabolism by these reagents. Thiosulfate catalyzed a rapid chemical breakdown of NEM and reacted with iodoacetamide. A complex between thiosulfate and mercuribenzoate was demonstrated. Three types of thiol group appear {{to be associated with the}} metabolism of thiosulfate and tetrathionate; one of these types may be located at the bacterial cell membrane. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that thiols (or disulfide groups) are binding sites for the substrates...|$|E
