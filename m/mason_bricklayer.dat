5000|$|After {{many years}} of {{designing}} buildings to suit the wants and needs of his public, Sauer constructed a group of buildings for his own amusement on his plot of land in Aspinwall. [...] He began to construct rental properties, acting as his own designer, <b>mason,</b> <b>bricklayer,</b> and carpenter. [...] From 1928 through 1930, he converted his former chicken coop into a three-story apartment house called [...] "Heidelberg". [...] After this eccentric building, he gradually transformed his wooded hillside into an architectural fantasy, and a complex of castlesque buildings and landscape features in Fantastic architectural style took shape and was progressively added to by Sauer {{until his death in}} 1942.|$|E

5000|$|Colonel Gibbes {{began work}} on Wotonga House in 1842 on the five-acre Kirribilli Point site, which he had leased from the wealthy {{merchant}} Robert Campbell, before proceeding to buy it after Campbell's death. He completed the house-building project about a year later. Wotonga was a graceful single-storey house with wide verandahs and elegant French doors. Gibbes designed the house, which he called [...] "Wotonga" [...] (or [...] "Woottonga"), himself. The stone for the house's walls was quarried locally and the hardwood and cedar joinery came from George Coleson's timber-yard in George Street, Sydney. Gibbes engaged James Hume, a well-known builder who dabbled in ecclesiastical architecture, to supervise {{the construction of the}} building and its stables. Gibbes, however, hired his own <b>masons,</b> <b>bricklayers,</b> carpenters, plumbers and ironmongers to work on the project, paying each of them separately as work progressed.|$|R
60|$|These straggling, excited {{groups were}} mainly {{composed}} {{of men with}} green boughs in their hats and the most ludicrous of weapons in their hands. Some, it is true, shouldered fowling pieces, and {{here and there a}} sword was brandished; but more of them were armed with clubs, and most of them trailed the mammoth pikes fashioned out of scythes, as formidable to the eye as they were clumsy to the hand. There were weavers, brewers, carpenters, smiths, <b>masons,</b> <b>bricklayers,</b> cobblers, and representatives of every other of the trades of peace among these improvised men of war. Bridgewater, like Taunton, had yielded so generously of its manhood to the service of the bastard Duke that for any to abstain whose age and strength admitted of his bearing arms was to brand himself a coward or a papist.|$|R

It was established during a great wave of blue-collar union formation in the 1860s. The organization has changed its name several times during its history to reflect its changing membership: in 1884 to <b>Bricklayers</b> and <b>Masons</b> International Union to <b>Bricklayers,</b> <b>Masons,</b> and Plasterers International Union in 1910, and in 1995, its current name - International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC), changing [...] "craftsmen" [...] to [...] "craftsworkers." ...|$|R

The Queensland Government's immigration agent advertised in Great Britain and Germany for railway workers, offering free passage on the Black Ball shipping line to artisans such as excavators, bridge carpenters, <b>masons</b> and <b>bricklayers.</b> During April 1866 a total of 1009 workmen were employed along Section 5.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{architecture}} in Nigeria is {{a legacy of}} the thousands of freed slaves who returned to Nigeria in the 19th century. Trained as carpenters, cabinetmakers, <b>masons</b> and <b>bricklayers</b> in Brazil, the ex-slaves were notably technically skilled artisans and were known for their exuberant and individualistic style on doorways, brightly painted facades and chunky concrete columns which are rooted in the baroque styles popular in Brazil in the 18th century.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the superb}} Kirribilli Point location, Gibbes erected, between 1842 and 1843, a graceful {{single-storey}} house with wide verandahs and elegant French doors. Gibbes designed the house, {{which he called}} [...] "Wotonga" [...] (or [...] "Woottonga"), himself. The stone for the house's walls was quarried locally and the hardwood and cedar joinery came from George Coleson's timber-yard in George Street, Sydney. Gibbes engaged James Hume, a well-known builder who dabbled in ecclesiastical architecture, to supervise {{the construction of the}} building and its stables. Gibbes, however, hired his own <b>masons,</b> <b>bricklayers,</b> carpenters, plumbers and ironmongers to work on the project, paying each of them separately as work progressed. Gibbes used the Custom Department's cutter to commute to and from the building site. Once completed, Gibbes' L-shaped residence featured a plain, yet stylish, double façade to maximise the building's magnificent, sweeping views across Sydney Harbour. These views enabled Gibbes to monitor shipping traffic in and out of Darling Harbour and, more importantly, Circular Quay, where the Sydney Customs House was situated.|$|R

60|$|The despair thus {{arising from}} an {{education}} which suggests no pre-eminent mental activity except that of artistic creation is wholly absent from an education {{which gives the}} knowledge of scientific method. The discovery of scientific method, except in pure mathematics, {{is a thing of}} yesterday; speaking broadly, we may say that it dates from Galileo. Yet already it has transformed the world, and its success proceeds with ever-accelerating velocity. In science men have discovered an activity of the very highest value in which they are no longer, as in art, dependent for progress upon the appearance of continually greater genius, for in science the successors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one man of supreme genius has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can apply it. No transcendent ability is required in order to make useful discoveries in science; the edifice of science needs its <b>masons,</b> <b>bricklayers,</b> and common labourers as well as its foremen, master-builders, and architects. In art nothing worth doing can be done without genius; in science even a very moderate capacity can contribute to a supreme achievement.|$|R

50|$|Masonry is the {{building}} of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by mortar; the term masonry can also refer to the units themselves. The common materials of masonry construction are brick, building stone such as marble, granite, travertine, and limestone, cast stone, concrete block, glass block, and cob. Masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction. However, the materials used, {{the quality of the}} mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can substantially affect the durability of the overall masonry construction. A person who constructs masonry is called a <b>mason</b> or <b>bricklayer.</b>|$|R

Political changes however led to delays for the excavation and foundation works and tenders for the building's main construction did not go out until October 1866. On 17 December 1866, it was announced that builder John Young was awarded the contract for [...] "carpenters, joiners, slaters, plumbers, painters and glaziers.

5000|$|A {{reported}} {{case in the}} Court of Common Pleas in 1850 [...] reported that a five-mile section of the railway was constructed {{at a cost of}} £41,029. The case concerned a <b>mason</b> and <b>bricklayer</b> (Mr. Heyhoe) suing for his fees after the two of the partners (a Mr. Fry and a Mr. Frost) of the firm to whom the railway had subcontracted the job had become bankrupt, the issue being whether a third person (Mr. Burge) was also a partner and thus liable for the partnership debts. The case is still considered an authority in English law on when a person who has not signed a partnership deed can treated as regards outsiders as a partner in the firm by reason of the conduct of the parties.|$|R

Sir Roger, who was a Member of Parliament and became the owner of Arbury Hall on the early death of his brother, was a canal enthusiast. His interest may have stemmed from his involvement with the Bridgewater Canal, where he acted as Counsel for their bill to authorise an extension to the River Mersey. He started constructing canals on his estate in 1764, and by 1795 there were about 5.5 mi of waterways. William Bean from Derbyshire acted as engineer, assisted by the <b>mason</b> and <b>bricklayer</b> from the Arbury estate, John Morris.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the life}} of the mine, Henry Ayers jealously {{preserved}} shareholder profits by ruthlessly controlling wages and expenses. In October 1846 this caused the first strike, of <b>masons</b> and <b>bricklayers,</b> with the company refusing to pay more than 8 shillings per day. With declining copper prices (from £91 per ton in 1845 to £87 in 1848) the company continually sought to reduce wages. In August 1847 the company enticed Thomas Burr to take over as general manager, he having resigned his post as Deputy Surveyor General of South Australia, but by September 1848 the unsatisfied company directors had sacked him. [...] By 1848 the wages reached their lowest level, which precipitated the Burra miners' strike, being the first industrial strike in South Australia and earliest workers' strike of any consequence in Australia. The strike came and went numerous times, with miners not completely returning to work until January 1849.|$|R
