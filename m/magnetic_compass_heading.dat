50|$|As part of Project SOAR, a major airport {{improvement}} project, {{the existing}} runway (which is 50+ years old) is {{nearing the end}} of its useful life and will require major reconstruction to continue its use into the future. Also, the existing runway does not meet the most current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements that were put in place long after the runway was originally constructed. In December 2015, a temporary runway was opened that is west of the existing runway (16/34). The temporary runway 35 Instrument Landing System (ILS) will be operational, and Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI) will be available on both ends of the runway. It {{should be noted that the}} runway <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> has shifted slightly over the years, and runway 16/34 will be renamed to runway 17/35.|$|E
50|$|It is {{referenced}} {{by using}} either the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> or <b>heading</b> indicator, two instruments that most aircraft have as standard. Using standard instrumentation, {{it is in}} reference to the local magnetic north direction. True heading is in relation to the lines of meridian (north-south lines). The units are degrees from north in a clockwise direction. North is 0°, east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°.|$|R
50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{compass rose}} appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes true cardinal directions while the smaller inside ring denotes magnetic cardinal directions. True north {{refers to the}} geographical location of the north pole while magnetic north refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a compass) will point. The angular difference between true and magnetic north is called variation, which varies depending on location. The angular difference between <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> and <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> is called deviation which varies by vessel and its heading.|$|R
40|$|Indoor {{localization}} {{for pedestrian}} {{is the key}} technology for caring the elderly, the visually impaired and the handicapped in health care districts. It also becomes essential for the emergency responders where the GPS signal is not available. This paper presents newly developed pedestrian localization system using the gyro sensors, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and pressure sensors. Instead of using the accelerometer, the pedestrian gait is estimated from the gyro sensor measurements and the travel distance is estimated based on the gait kinematics. Fusing the gyro information and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> information for <b>heading</b> angle estimation is presented with the error covariance analysis. A pressure sensor is used to identify the floor the pedestrian is walking on. A complete ambulatory system is implemented which estimates the pedestrian’s 3 D position and the heading.

50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized <b>compass</b> (or <b>heading</b> indicator) is {{to read the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> can't be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{possible}} heading accuracy of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and the distortions to the earth’s magnetic field present in different environments {{at ground level}} is investigated. A three axial magnetometer is {{used to measure the}} magnetic field and derive the heading. Magnetometer readings are corrected for distortions generated by the measurement equipment and the derived heading is compared to that of an inertial navigation system. The magnetometer is maintained near horizontal at all times meaning that the z-component of the field has very little impact on the heading. The magnetic field is investigated in three different situations: Along a countryside road with no man made distortions present, around buildings in an urban environment and around a typical car. Results from measuring along the countryside road indicate that this environment may be suited for <b>magnetic</b> <b>compassing</b> as the <b>heading</b> error remained within 1 degree. In the urban environment, the level of distortion was high. Heading error could in the measurement here be kept to within 5 degrees when measuring in the middle of roads in between buildings but the error quickly increased when approaching buildings. When larger open areas are present and the distance to buildings was over 10 m, the error reduced to within 2 degrees for some locations. These results suggest that heading in an urban environment may be very unreliable. The distortion caused by the car may influence heading by 1 degree out to a distance of 6 - 7 m depending on its orientation relative to the earth’s field. The cars field appears to be mainly generated by the car itself independently of the earth’s field. Validerat; 20110607 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient algorithm {{for using the}} two-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> in portable devices. The general <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module consists of a three-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and a two-axis inclinometer to calculate tilt-compensated azimuth information. In this paper, the tilt error is compensated using just a two-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and two-axis accelerometer. The third-axis data of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is estimated using coordinate information that includes the extended dip angle and tilt information. The extended dip angle is estimated during the normalization process.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module must be {{calibrated}} accurately before use. Moreover, the calibration process must {{be performed}} {{taking into account}} any magnetic dip if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module has tilt angles. For this, a calibration method for a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is explained. Tilt error of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is compensated using a biaxial accelerometer generally. The accelerometer error causes a tilt angle calculation error that gives rise to an azimuth calculation error. For error property analysis, error equations are derived and simulations are performed. In the simulation results, the accuracy of derived error equations is verified. If a biaxial <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is used instead of a triaxial one, the magnetic dip and z-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> data must be estimated for tilt compensation. Lastly, estimation equations for the magnetic dip and z-axis magnetic compas...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of birds is located only in the right eye. However, here we show that night-migrating garden warblers (Sylvia borin) are able to perform <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation with both eyes open, with only the left eye open and with only the right eye open. We did not observe any clear lateralization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation behaviour in this migratory songbird, and, therefore, it seems that the suggested all-or-none lateralization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation towards the right eye only cannot be generalized to all birds, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation in birds is lateralized is probably not as simple as suggested previously...|$|R
40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of a migratory bird, the European robin (Erithacus rubecula), {{was shown}} to be lateralized in favour of the right eye/left brain hemisphere. However, {{this seems to be}} a {{property}} of the avian <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> that is not present from the beginning, but develops only as the birds grow older. During first migration in autumn, juvenile robins can orient by their <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> with their right as well as with their left eye. In the following spring, however, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is already lateralized, but this lateralization is still flexible: it could be removed by covering the right eye for 6 h. During the following autumn migration, the lateralization becomes more strongly fixed, with a 6 h occlusion of the right eye no longer having an effect. This change from a bilateral to a lateralized <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> appears to be a maturation process, the first such case known so far in birds. Because both eyes mediate identical information about the geomagnetic field, brain asymmetry for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> could increase efficiency by setting the other hemisphere free for other processes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we are {{discussing}} {{the effect of the}} use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> on the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech researchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the ancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys were made by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> we can find the axes of the complexes deviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic declination that existed at the time the structures were built. Following this idea, here we discuss some examples of possible alignments obtained by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> concluding that the Chinese surveyors adopted, during the Ming dynasty, a method based on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses.</b> The architects of the antecedent Yuan Dynasty probably used an astronomical method.

50|$|Compass turns (turns {{using the}} compass {{as the primary}} {{reference}} instrument) are not standard practice in modern aircraft.

A <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is a simple instrument when the compass is not moving {{and is on the}} earth.

40|$|Animals {{can detect}} {{different}} {{parameters of the}} geomagnetic field by two principal independent magnetoreception mechanisms: (1) a light-dependent process detecting the axial course and the inclination angle of the geomagnetic field lines, providing the animals with <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> information (inclination compass), and (2) a magnetite-mediated process, providing magnetic map information (map sense). In vertebrates like birds and newts, light-dependent <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation depends on both wavelength and intensity of light, and experimental evidence suggests that <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> information is perceived by magneto-sensitive photoreceptors, possibly containing cryptochromes, in the retina or the pineal...|$|R

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{circumstances}} when <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> and gyrocompasses are unreliable. The most obvious is in polar regions, where the force exerted on the needle of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is nearly vertical and gyrocompasses become unstable {{due to the}} rotation of the Earth. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> are also susceptible to disruption from magnetic fields other than the Earth's, such as those produced by the hulls of some metal vehicles or craft.

40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of {{migratory birds}} has been {{suggested}} to be light-dependent. Retinal cryptochrome-expressing neurons and a forebrain region, "Cluster N", show high neuronal activity when night-migratory songbirds perform <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. By combining neuronal tracing with behavioral experiments leading to sensory-driven gene expression of the neuronal activity marker ZENK during <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation, we demonstrate a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and Cluster N via the visual thalamus. Thus, the two areas of {{the central nervous system}} being most active during <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation are part of an ascending visual processing stream, the thalamofugal pathway. Furthermore, Cluster N seems to be a specialized part of the visual wulst.

The high cost and government regulations prevent the wider inclusion of high quality IMUs to augment GPS as a commercialized navigation system in many navigation applications. The progress in MEMS technology enables complete inertial units on a chip, composed of multiple integrated MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes. In addition to their compact and portable size, the price of MEMS based is far less than those high quality IMUs as well, however, due to the lightweight and fabrication process, MEMS sensors have large bias instability and noise, which consequently affect the obtained accuracy from MEMS-based IMUs.

In the earlier shoreward orientation experiments, newts tested under full-spectrum and short-wavelength (i. e. 400 and 450 nm) light exhibited shoreward <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. Under long-wavelength (i. e. 550 and 600 nm) light, newts exhibited <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation that was rotated 90 ˚ counterclockwise to the shoreward direction.

The different effects of long-wavelength light on shoreward orientation and homing confirmed earlier evidence that different magnetoreception systems mediate these two forms of orientation behaviour.
