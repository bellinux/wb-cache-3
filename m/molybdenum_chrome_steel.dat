50|$|The 1991 Supersports were {{produced}} with white <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> frames and white wheels. The swingarms used needle bearings instead of bushings {{as in the}} past. Brakes from the Ducati 851 were used on the Supersport vastly improving braking performance. All new bodywork and a pivoting fuel tank were elegantly shaped. The revised Supersports were met with immediate success and became wildly popular. Even though the 1991 Supersport was extremely well developed, Ducati would continue to refine the bike over the years.|$|R

The mounting struts were tubes of <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel,</b> enclosed in alloy fairings for corrosion protection. They placed the engine forward of the wing leading edge and the two blade propeller well forward of the pilot's windscreen.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} the fuselage of the PL.3 was mostly of metal construction. From propeller to aft {{of the wing}} root the fuselage was a tube of constant diameter, set by the wide chord NACA cowling around its 525kW (700hp) licence-built Pratt & Whitney Hornet radial engine, which then tapered to the tail. [...] The underlying structure from nose to tail was a rectangular <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> frame, aluminium covered in front and plywood behind.

40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} study of dissimilar friction welding was conducted using 15 mm diameter solid bar in <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> (SCM 440) to carbon steel (S 45 C) not only to optimize the friction welding conditions, but also to investigate the fatigue performance. The main friction welding parameters were selected to endure good quality welds {{on the basis of}} visual examination, tensile tests, Vickers hardness surveys of the bond of area and HAZ, and microstructure investigations. In this study, the specimens were tested as welded. For fatigue strength, the notched specimens for the optimal conditions were rotary bending fatigue tested. The results were compared with S-N curves for the base metals...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of tests were made on tubes of 1025 and 4130 X steel, in various diameters and wall thicknesses, and after diverse heat treatments. The Rockwell B scale was employed, as being the best suited to the ranges of {{hardness}} encountered. Only satisfactory <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> tubes were found to show a hardness in excess of 90 -B after normalizing. The method therefore provided the desired means of identification of <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel.</b> It is a qualitative test only. The conditions of a satisfactory test are as follows. 1) The tubing must be normalized. 2) It must be clean inside and out {{at the point where}} the test is to be made. 3) The tube must be held in correct alignment with the penetrator and must not move during the test. 4) For thin-walled tubes, the anvil must extend within the tube so as to support the wall...|$|R
50|$|The Wendt Aircraft Co. {{was formed}} in February 1939 to build the W-2 Swift, the {{prototype}} of {{which turned out to}} be their only product. It had a high braced wing, built around two spruce spars. The ribs were made of spruce and birch with steel wire internal bracing. Its leading and trailing edges were metal, with fabric elsewhere. The wing was braced on either side by pairs of V-form, steel struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was a <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> tube structure, fabric covered over plywood formers and spruce stringers. The enclosed cabin, which seated two side-by-side with dual control, was under the wing, with the 90 hp (67 kW) single row radial LeBlond engine mounted immediately ahead of it under a clean NACA cowling in the short nose.|$|R
5000|$|Warren truss {{construction}} {{has also been}} used in airframe construction for aircraft since the 1920s, mostly for smaller aircraft fuselages, using <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> alloy <b>steel</b> tubing, with popular aircraft such as the Piper J-3 Cub. Two of the earliest uses for the Warren truss in aircraft design was for both the 1914-era, Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.I biplane flying boat designed by Claudius Dornier, with four [...] "inverted-pyramid" [...] structures per side for its interplane struts, giving it Warren trusses running in both spanwise and chordwise directions—and by 1916-17, the interplane wing strut layout, as seen in a nose-on view, on the Italian World War I Ansaldo SVA series of fast reconnaissance biplanes, which were among the fastest aircraft of the First World War era. Warren truss construction is still used today for some homebuilt aircraft fuselage designs, that essentially use the same 1920s-era design philosophies in the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} of bolted 6061-T6 aluminium, {{with the two}} seats mounted on a fuselage boom tube that runs from the front rudder pedals to the tail. The landing gear consists of two main wheels on <b>chrome</b> <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> gear legs and axles, and a tail wheel configuration. The flexible steel axles work as shock absorbers during taxiing and landing. The tail wheel is steerable {{by means of the}} rudder pedals. The standard Rotax 582 engine is mounted in pusher configuration behind the wing's trailing edge. The engine's liquid-cooling allows fast descents while towing, without subjecting the engine cylinders to shock-cooling. The wing is supported by a V-strut and jury struts. The wing and tail surfaces are covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. A unique feature is the extended rudder post, which is supported by steel cables from the wings and used as a tow attachment point. The aircraft is equipped with dual controls for pilot training and the rear seat is removable when not needed. The aircraft takes about 200 hours to assemble from the kit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The hot ring {{compression}} test of <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> covered with an oxide scale film {{is carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of the oxide scale film on the hot forging characteristics. For changing the chemical compositions of the oxide scale, the oxide scale film is generated at air or steam atmosphere. The nominal coefficient of shear friction of the <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> covered with the oxide scale film is estimated from the plastic deformation behavior during the {{ring compression}} test. The estimated coefficient of shear friction of the <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> covered with the oxide scale film is found to be lower than that of the <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> without the oxide scale film. Furthermore, the oxide scale generated at steam atmosphere provides lower friction characteristics in comparison with the oxide scale generated at air atmosphere. The mechanism of the reduction of friction with the oxide scale is discussed...|$|R
