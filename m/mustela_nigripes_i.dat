40|$|Abstract: Infectious and noninfectious {{diseases}} {{have had}} major impacts on free-ranging wildlife populations, and are especially important when recovering species at risk. For example, disease has hindered {{recovery of the}} black-footed ferret (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes),</b> bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), wood bison (Bos bison athabascae), and southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis).

When a single disease can extirpate a remnant population, or when managers are forced to use tools such as translocation or captive breeding, which may increase the risk of disease impacts, managers must be proactive about disease risks. We suggest using a multi-tiered process when addressing disease concerns for species at risk: • When planning species recovery, consider disease as a factor that can impact the success of recovery efforts. • Evaluate potentially important infectious and noninfectious diseases. • Be cognizant about the risk of introducing diseases when translocating species or whe...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} {{conservation}} problem {{in which the}} recovery of an endangered species depends on a captive breeding and reintroduction program. The model {{is applied to the}} case of the black-footed ferret (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes),</b> an endangered species in North America reliant on captive breeding for survival. The timing of reintroduction is an important concern in these programs as there is a tradeoff between the duration (and therefore the cost) of the captive breeding program and the period the population spends in recovery and in the wild. In this paper, we develop a stylized bioeconomic model to determine the optimal reintroduction time, in which the objective is to minimize the cost of reintroduction while providing a viably-sized population in the wild. Our control variable is the timing of reintroduction, which departs from a large body of work in bioeconomics that focuses on adjustable controls that directly affect the target population. Generally, we find it is optimal to reintroduce ferrets early in a reintroduction program, although this result is contingent on species interactions and provisioning services.

40|$|A discrete-time reaction-diffusion {{model for}} black-footed ferret release, {{population}} growth, and dispersal {{is combined with}} ferret carrying capacity constraints based on prairie dog population management decisions to form a spatial optimization model.

This research investigates whether black–tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) populations are food limited on their northernmost range extent. We measured background vegetation rates and used food supplementation in a ‘before–after–control–impact’ (BACI) design to test whether increased food positively impacted prairie dog population density and colony expansion. Experimental results did not support food limitation. Overall, density increased from 2008 to 2009 but remained relatively similar between control and treatment plots. Correlations between natural, non-supplemented vegetation biomass and prairie dog density suggest that natural food availability in 2008 may have driven population growth into 2009. Natural food availability was highly variable among years and prairie dog densities may be impacted by food scarcity in some years but not others.

No subspecies of M. nigripes have been recognized. DIAGNOSIS. <b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes</b> is about mink-sized; upper parts are yellowish buff, occasionally whitish, {{especially on the}} face and venter (Fig. 1); feet are black; tail is tipped with black; mastoid process is notably angular (Fig. 2) (Long, 1965). Ferrets (subgenus Putorius) differ from other Mustela (weasels and mink) in being larger than weasels and in having the following combination of characters: ventral and dorsal pelage without sharp boundary (it is present in some species of weasels); light and dark markings present on face (lacking in most weasels and mink); legs darker than body; body yellowish brown or whitish and somewhat obscured by darker guard hairs; and more angular mastoid process. The black-footed ferret differs from the Old World ferrets (M. putorius) in having greater contrast between blackish feet and paler body, and usually shorter black part of tail (distal third or less). Pelage differences between M. eversmanni and M. nigripes are very slight.

In most recovery efforts lethal and nonlethal influences of predators are not sufficiently understood to allow prediction of predation risk, despite its importance. We investigated whether landscape features {{could be used to}} model predation risk from coyotes (Canis latrans) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) on the endangered black-footed ferret (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes).</b> We used location data of reintroduced ferrets from 3 sites in South Dakota to determine whether exposure to landscape features typically associated with predators affected survival of ferrets, and whether ferrets considered predation risk when choosing habitat near perches potentially used by owls or near linear features predicted to be used by coyotes. Exposure to areas near likely owl perches reduced ferret survival, but landscape features potentially associated with coyote movements had no appreciable effect on survival. Ferrets were located within 90 m of perches more than expected in 2 study sites that also had higher ferret mortality due to owl predation. Densities of potential coyote travel routes near ferret locations were no different than expected in all 3 sites. Repatriated ferrets might have selected resources based on factors other than predator avoidance. Considering an easily quantified landscape feature (i. e., owl perches) can enhance success of reintroduction efforts for ferrets. Nonetheless, development of predictive models of predation risk and management strategies to mitigate that risk is not necessarily straightforward for more generalist predators such as coyotes...|$|R
40|$|BETWEEN THE FALL OF 2001 {{and the end}} of 2006, 217 black-footed ferrets (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes)</b> were {{released}} within the Wolf Creek Management Area (WCMA) in northwest Colorado in an effort to reestablish this species within its former range. Following 5 years of releases and monitoring, the minimum pre-breeding (spring) population within the WCMA in 2006 was 9 ferrets and the minimum population at the end of 2006 was 13 ferrets. While survival of released captive-raised ferrets was high for some colonies in the eastern portion of the WCMA, survival throughout {{much of the rest of}} the area was low compared to other ferret reintroduction sites. Three wild-born kits from three separate litters were documented, representing a major step in the recovery effort. However, the observed average litter size of 1. 0 was also lower than other reintroduction sites and is probably insufficient to maintain the population without yearly supplemental releases. Overall minimum ferret population size in the WCMA increased steadily from 2002 to 2006, as did the population of their primary prey, the white-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys leucurus). Observed differences in ferret survival and numbers of wild-born kits produced in different portions of the WCMA appear to be driven primarily by differences in habitat quality (the density of prairie dogs and their burrows). This reintroduction program has contributed valuable information for research and management needs pertinent to ferret recovery range-wide, and work continues toward the establishment of a viable population and recovery of this species in Colorado...|$|R

Results supported seven conclusions: 1) demographic stochasticity has little effect on population persistence except when population size is extremely small; 2) increasing environmental stochasticity decreases population persistence substantially; 3) mean population size is much lower than the carrying capacity for the habitat; 4) extinction is more likely to occur when the number of occupied colonies becomes too low; 5) increase in dispersal mortality decreases population persistence; 6) the Meeteetse-tuned model may not accurately predict population trends on other sites without parameter changes; 7) introduction of small stepping stone colonies increases the frequency of successful colonizations from one large colony to another located some distance away.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Fisheries and wildlife. Once extinct in the wild, the black-footed ferret (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes)</b> is one of the rarest mammals in North America. Reintroductions of ferrets at 13 sites over 10 years have resulted in only 3 self-sustaining populations. Such results draw into question our current knowledge of ferret habitat requirements and how managers select and manage reintroduction sites. In 2005 and 2006, I monitored ferret resource use at one successful (Conata Basin, SD) and one unsuccessful (UL Bend, MT) reintroduction site. Space use by predators is known to be influenced by the spatial distribution of prey, and I found that prairie dog burrow distribution strongly influenced ferret resource selection. In addition, territoriality and home range size of ferrets were correlated with prairie dog distribution. Assessing the suitability of prairie dog colonies as ferret reintroduction sites likely requires spatially explicit, fine-scale measurement of prairie dog distribution. Further, managers should focus on preserving and enhancing large contiguous areas or patches of high prairie dog density as a key requirement for successful establishment and maintenance of ferret populations...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that black-footed ferrets (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes)</b> are an obligate dietary specialist of prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). Indeed, the extirpation of ferrets {{from the wild}} was attributed to the decline of prairie dogs throughout North America. However, {{the degree to which}} ferrets are specialized predators of prairie dogs and their foraging plasticity is unclear. We quantified the diet of free-ranging black footed ferrets in Wyoming, USA using stable isotope analysis. We also explored different age-sex group dietary differences based on sexual size dimorphism. Our results confirmed that prairie dogs were the most important diet item, although ferrets also displayed greater foraging plasticity than previously believed and consumed large quantities of species of smail mammals. The degree to which ferrets specialized on prairie dogs also differed between ferret age-sex groups. Adult male and juvenile ferrets possessed roughly equivalent diets, with prairie dogs constituting nearly 75 % of their assimilated diet. In contrast, adult female ferrets relied less on prairie dogs (63 %), and more heavily on smaller-bodied mice(31 %). These results suggest that intraspecific competition is limited by sexual size dimorphism, with larger males consuming the larger-bodied prairie dogs more than adult females. Prairie dogs were, however, a critical nutritional component for young, and female ferrets appear to have preferentially provided prairie dogs to their offspring, rather than consuming in their own diet. Conservation of prairie dogs colonies, not just as prey items, but also for the prey-rich habitat they provide will be key for saving one of North America's most endangered mammals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Secondary {{toxicity}} in {{mammals and}} birds that consume animals containing residues of anticoagulant rodenticides represents a persistent conflict between conservation, agriculture and environmental contamination. Chlorophacinone residues in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) represent a secondary exposure hazard to predatory and scavenging avian and mammalian {{species in the}} Central Plains of the United States, especially considering efforts to re-establish black-footed ferrets (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes).</b> Rozol® Prairie Dog Bait (chlorophacinone 0. 005 %) is registered to control black-tailed prairie dogs in ten states throughout themidwestern and western United States. RESULTS:We fed Rozol Prairie Dog Bait to captive black-tailed prairie dogs for 2 days and analyzed their livers and whole bodies (without livers) for chlorophacinone residue on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 18 and 27 post-exposure. We found the greatest levels of residues in livers (x = 5. 499 mgkg− 1) and whole bodies (x = 1. 281 mgkg− 1) on day 3. Residues in both tissues declined rapidly over time,with estimated half-lives of approximately 6 days post-exposure. However, a risk assessment of secondary toxicity to non-targetmammals indicated acute risks for mammalian species up to 27 days post-exposure and negligible risks for birds. CONCLUSION: The {{results suggest that the}} greatest risk of secondary toxicity occurs ≤ 14 days post-application of Rozol Prairie Dog Bait and declines thereafter. This corresponds to the timewhen chlorophacinone residues are high, and prairie dogs exhibit signs of intoxication and are perhapsmost susceptible to predation and scavenging. These results confirm that Rozol PrairieDog Bait should not be used in areas where black-footed ferrets or other sensitive species occur...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a partial evaluation of {{black-tailed prairie dog}} (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and complexes in western Oklahoma as possible reintroduction sites for the endangered black-footed ferret (<b>Mustela</b> <b>nigripes).</b> We applied a standardized survey technique to Oklahoma's two largest complexes of black-tailed prairie dogs to estimate carrying capacities for the black-footed ferret. Complexes were delineated from topographic maps and their juxtapositions and areas measured. On four of the colonies, we ran 73 1 -km × 3 -m transects and tallied numbers of active (i. e., fresh feces present) and inactive (i. e., fresh feces absent) burrows. These data permitted calculation of prairie dog populations and estimation {{of the number of}} ferret families that could be supported within each complex. The complex on Oklahoma Land Commission property in northwestern Cimarron County was comprised of six colonies on 594 ha. The estimated 16, 167 prairie dogs within the complex could support about 21 ferret family groups (i. e., 21 breeding females, their young of the year, and 10 - 11 males). The complex on Rita Blanca National Grassland in southwestern Cimarron County consisted of eight colonies on 365. 5 ha. We estimated a prairie dog population of 6, 503 for that complex, with a carrying capacity of about 8. 5 ferret family groups. Sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) struck the largest colony on Oklahoma Land Commission property during fall 1991 and leasees reported seeing no prairie dogs there during the months that followed. The Rita Blanca National Grassland complex experienced a similar outbreak of plague in 1992. As a result, reintroduction of black-footed ferrets cannot be recommended...|$|R
