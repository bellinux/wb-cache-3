5|$|The Bend {{remained}} an agricultural settlement for nearly 80 more years. Even by 1836, {{there were only}} 20 households in the community. At this time, the Westmorland Road became open to year-round travel and a regular <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> service was established between Saint John and Halifax. The Bend became an important transfer and rest station along the route. Over the next decade, lumbering and then shipbuilding would become important industries in the area.|$|E
5|$|Equestrian {{sports are}} among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when {{competitions}} in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types of jumping (high jump, long jump and show-jumping) were held. Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping. Competitors in the modern pentathlon event also have to complete an equestrian show-jumping course, {{but this is not}} part of the equestrian events.|$|E
5|$|The Estação da Mala-Posta do Casal dos Carreiros (<b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> {{station of}} Casal dos Carreiros), {{built in the}} 19th century in the civil parish of A dos Francos, was {{declared}} a property of public interest in 1977. The Pelourinho de Santa Catarina (pillory of Saint Catherine) in the civil parish of Santa Catarina, constructed in the 16th century, was declared a property of public interest in 1933. Capela de São Jacinto (Chapel of Saint Hyacinth), located in Casais de São Jacinto in the civil parish of Coto, was originally built in the 16th century and reconstructed in baroque style in the 18th century. The chapel was declared a property of public interest in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> {{continued}} unchallenged {{until the}} 1830s but {{the development of}} railways spelt the end for the service. The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830. By the early 1840s other rail lines had been constructed and many London-based <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> were starting to be withdrawn from service; the final service from London (to Norwich) was shut down in 1846. Regional <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> continued into the 1850s, but these too were eventually replaced by rail services.|$|R

5|$|The {{route of}} the A1 in London {{originally}} started at Aldersgate Bars, which marked the boundary of the City of London, and followed the Great North Road <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> route through Barnet; the route was re-designated in 1954 to follow the East Finchley and Barnet by-passes built in the 1920s and 1930s, so within London the coaching route is now mainly only followed when passing through the borough of Islington. During the early 1970s plans to widen the A1 along the Archway Road section were abandoned after considerable opposition and four public inquiries during which road protesters disrupted proceedings. The scheme was finally dropped in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mail</b> <b>coach</b> service began {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, adding to the {{existing}} use of fast coaches. The horses required for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold the best of their animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from the trade in carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of the trade. In many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors of a string of coaching inns was that passengers on their coaches also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation. Some inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses.|$|E
25|$|Passenger coaches {{numbered}} 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, <b>mail</b> <b>coach,</b> etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.|$|E
25|$|Between 1719 and 1763, Ralph Allen, {{postmaster}} at Bath, {{signed a}} series of contracts with the post office to develop and expand Britain's postal network. He organised <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> which were provided by both Wilson & Company of London and Williams & Company of Bath. The early Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>Coaches</b> were similar to ordinary family coaches but with Post Office livery.|$|R

25|$|Pickering prospered as {{a market}} town and {{agricultural}} centre. It had watermills and several inns {{and was a}} centre for <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> traffic and trade. At this time the beck was an open sewer and it remained so until {{the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> ran in 1784, {{operating}} between Bristol and London. Delivery staff received uniforms for {{the first}} time in 1793, and the Post Office Investigation Branch was established; it is the world's oldest recognised criminal investigations authority. The first mail train ran in 1830, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Post Office's money order system was introduced in 1838.|$|E
25|$|In 1827 James {{moved to}} Bodmin in Cornwall {{primarily}} {{to improve the}} estates of Anna-Maria Agar of Lanhydrock. He had plans to develop the ports of Devoran and Truro and build a railway from Fowey to Padstow, none of which came to fruition under his management. Following a winter journey by <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> he contracted pneumonia of which he died at Bodmin early in 1837.|$|E
50|$|Apparently the {{strategy}} {{had been to}} take towns and intercept the <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> in the North of England. The Scottish radicals would know that the uprising had begun when the <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> did not arrive, and begin their own. In Huddersfield, the plan had been to take the cavalry and infantry barracks, and shut up the principal civil people in their homes, before declaring an interim government.|$|R
50|$|In 1789 <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> began a {{scheduled}} service from Dublin to Belfast. They met the mail boats coming from Portpatrick in Scotland at Donaghadee, in County Down.|$|R
50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, {{most of the}} <b>mail</b> <b>coaches</b> in Ireland were {{eventually}} out-competed by Charles Bianconi's country-wide network of open carriages, before this system in turn succumbed to the railways.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of pillar boxes, in the UK, it was customary to take outgoing mail to the nearest letter-receiving house or post office. Such houses were usually coaching inns or turnpike houses where the Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>coach</b> would stop {{to pick up and}} set down mails and passengers. People took their letters, in person, to the receiver, or postmaster, purchased a stamp (after 1840) and handed over the letter.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the railway to Pine Creek, the Adelaide River crossing was the overnight stopping point for the Haimes Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>Coach</b> which linked Southport with the goldfields. This was a vital and well utilised transport link, but was a slow and uncomfortable service. Legislation providing for an upgraded transport link was passed in 1883 by the government of John Cox Bray {{in the form of the}} Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Bill.|$|E
25|$|Hay {{also served}} as colonel of the 30th Regiment of Foot, then of the 42nd Regiment of Foot and finally of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards. A strong man, he once drove the <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> from London to Haddington without a halt or a rest. He died, {{following}} injuries sustained during a fire at his home, at Yester House on 10 October 1876 and {{was buried in the}} family burial vault at the Church of St. Cuthbert at Yester in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|During a {{brief period}} back in Tiflis, Stalin and the Outfit planned the ambush of a <b>mail</b> <b>coach,</b> during {{which most of the}} group—although not Stalin—were apprehended by the authorities. Stalin {{returned}} to Saint Petersburg, where he continued editing and writing articles for Pravda. After the October 1912 Duma elections resulted in six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks being elected, Stalin wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions, for which he was criticised by Lenin. In late 1912, he twice crossed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire to visit Lenin in Krakow, eventually bowing to Lenin's opposition to reunification with the Mensheviks.|$|E
25|$|The town {{contained}} several coaching inns, public {{houses and}} ale houses, leading {{to court records}} of some alcohol-induced violence and a certain reputation for excess. Several coaching inns were constructed to accommodate travellers by stagecoach and <b>mail</b> <b>coach.</b> The Angel on Broad Street was one such notable coaching inn, where several passenger and mail coaches departed and arrived {{on a regular basis}} every week, including the Aurora coach which departed for London (taking 27 hours in 1822). The Angel was the last coaching inn in Ludlow to have such coach traffic, following the arrival of the railways in 1852. The Angel ceased trading in the early 1990s. A surviving medieval coaching inn today is the 15th century Bull Hotel on the Bull Ring. Several other pubs and hotels in the town have historic pedigree, including the Rose and Crown where allegedly a pub has existed since 1102.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposal}} for a bridge across the Severn, approximately in the same location as that eventually constructed, was in 1824 by Thomas Telford, who {{had been asked to}} advise on how to improve <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> services between London and Wales. No action was taken, and over the next few decades the railways became the dominant mode of long-distance travel, with the Severn Railway Bridge at Sharpness being opened in 1879 and the main line Severn Tunnel in 1886. However, the growth of road traffic in the early 20th century led to further calls for improvements, and in the early 1920s Chepstow Urban District Council convened a meeting of neighbouring local authorities to consider a Severn crossing to ease congestion and delays on the A48 passing through the town. In 1935 Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire County Councils jointly promoted a Parliamentary Bill to obtain powers to build the bridge over the estuary, with 75% of costs to be met by the Ministry of Transport from the Road Fund. However, the bill was rejected by Parliament after opposition from the Great Western Railway Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{establishment}} {{was also}} used as relay for the <b>mail</b> <b>coaches,</b> that connected the two then Prussian towns of Eupen and Malmedy. The direct connection was partly through Belgian territory, along the current N68 road.|$|R

25|$|Mizil was {{mentioned}} in 1529, {{in an official}} document at Brașov. It was first mentioned as Eșteu in 1585, and as Istau in 1591, after its stream. Around {{the turn of the}} 18th century, Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu owned the village, building houses at the nearby Corbeanca Dealul Dumbăvii vineyard and establishing an annual fair in Mizil that would become renowned. It was during the 18th century that a <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> station for changing horses opened in the village. Merchants began to set up shop, their business augmented by the location between two larger towns; coachmen, wheelwrights, woodcutters and watchmen also found work. In the Ottoman Turkish language of Wallachia's rulers, the station was known as a menzil. The n dropped out through syncope and the i became an e; given that activity and transactions that took place around it, the resulting name came to be used for the village as a whole and to replace its old name. The first church was built in 1790, and Mizil was declared a town in 1830.|$|E
500|$|These {{two events}} were contested {{only at the}} 1900 Summer Games.

These additional events include the hacks and hunter combined event and the <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> event. (As with 24 official medal events from other sports, the IOC does not list the winners of these two events in its results database.) ...|$|E
500|$|A {{church was}} consecrated in October 1808 and {{dedicated}} to St Catherine of Alexandria in the underdeveloped {{eastern side of}} the town, it remained a chapel of ease until 1891 when Milford became a parish, until that time competing with St Peter and St Cewydd in Steynton. [...] By the start of the 19th century, a <b>mail</b> <b>coach</b> was operating between London and Hubberston, and in 1800 the short lived Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank was established by Thomas Phillips, operating from a branch in the town. [...] It collapsed in 1810.|$|E
