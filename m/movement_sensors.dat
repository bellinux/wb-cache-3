500|$|In {{the history}} of video games, the seventh {{generation}} includes consoles released since late [...] by Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The eighth generation began in November 2012. [...] For home consoles, the seventh generation began on November 22, 2005 {{with the release of}} Microsoft's Xbox 360 and continued with the release of Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 3 on November 17, 2006, and Nintendo's Wii on November 19, 2006. Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology. The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at high-definition video (HD) resolutions, the PlayStation 3 offered HD movie playback via a built-in 3D Blu-ray Disc player, and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with <b>movement</b> <b>sensors</b> as well as joysticks. Some of the Wii controllers could be moved about to control in-game actions, which enabled players to simulate real-world actions during gameplay (e.g., in the Wii sports tennis game, the user swings the controller to hit the on-screen image of a tennis ball). Video game consoles had become {{an important part of the}} global IT infrastructure. It is estimated that video game consoles represented 25% of the world's general-purpose computational power in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Movement techniques. The Trail {{covered a}} wide {{diversity}} of rough terrain. Steep mountain slopes had steps gouged into them for climbing. Ravines were bridged with crude bamboo suspension bridges. Ferries shuttled troops across rivers and streams. Large gangs of civilian laborers were drafted {{to keep the}} network functioning. Binh Trams stations at intervals on the Trail, hosted the stream of men, weapons and supplies flowing to the battle zone. Most material movement in bulk was not by gangs of sweating laborers, but modern Soviet-supplied trucks. Vehicles rolled on a [...] "relay" [...] basis, moving mostly at night to avoid American air power, and the trail was plentifully supplied by jungle-like camouflage at all times. [...] Way stations were generally within one day's travel from each other. [...] Trucks arriving at a station were unloaded, and the cargo shifted to new trucks, which carried out the next segment of the journey. [...] Having plenty of both time and manpower, this [...] "relay" [...] method economized on wear and tear upon the valuable trucks, and maximized hiding opportunities from prowling US aircraft. The method also spread out available cargoes over time and space, enabling the entire network to better bear losses from such deadly enemies as the American C-130 Gunship, and such technologies as <b>movement</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A small Braille display with Active Tactile Control (ATC) Braille {{technology}} {{was developed in}} association with the Handy Tech Company. With ATC technology text information can be read without pressing a scrolling button, as the system automatically shifts to the next line when the reading finger is detected {{at the end of the}} last word. This Braille display was connected to two compatible systems. The first is the TANIA (Tactile Acoustical Navigation and Information Assistant) navigation system, based on detailed maps, a <b>movement</b> <b>sensor,</b> and the Global Positioning System (GPS). The second is an object recognition system, which uses 3 D environmental models, a <b>movement</b> <b>sensor</b> and stereo camera. Either system, or both in combination, provide information acoustically or in Braille. Blind and deafblind users report that the use of the portable ATC display technology combined with these systems represents an additional step toward increasing independent orientation and mobility...|$|R
40|$|There are few {{published}} data on {{the ranges}} of available motion at the shoulder and no clinical technique {{for the assessment of}} three dimensional movement. An electromagnetic <b>movement</b> <b>sensor</b> (Isotrak), which makes three dimensional measurements of shoulder movement and measures the ranges of flexion, extension, abduction in the neutral position, abduction preceded by external rotation, and internal rotation achieved by placing the hand as far up the back as possible, was used to study 16 normal subjects. Intraobserver repeatability was good, and a study of five subjects by two observers showed no significant difference between single measurements made by each. The measured ranges were in broad agreement with published data, though they tended to be smaller. This was attributed to either the bulk of the mounting for the <b>movement</b> <b>sensor</b> or to the immobilisation of the elbow and hence the biceps muscle. Women had greater ranges, except for externally rotated abduction...|$|R
