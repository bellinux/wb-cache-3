5|$|Because of {{similarities}} in morphology and lifestyle, the slime <b>molds</b> (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water <b>molds</b> (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly {{classified in the}} kingdom Fungi, in groups like Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The slime <b>molds</b> were studied also as protozoans, leading to a ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime <b>molds</b> lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water <b>molds</b> nor slime <b>molds</b> {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>molding</b> {{process of}} {{aluminum}} foams {{by using a}} rotating <b>mold</b> is proposed {{in order to improve}} the <b>mold</b> filling and forming process for light-weight parts of vehicles. Aluminum powder mixed with a foaming agent is extruded into the <b>mold</b> through the die heated to a temperature higher than the melting point, and the <b>mold</b> is filled with the aluminum foam.

Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into <b>molds,</b> but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate <b>molds</b> for casting.|$|E
5|$|Explorer and {{archaeologist}} Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá {{for three}} days in 1881; {{they were the first}} pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster <b>molds</b> of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these <b>molds</b> were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E
50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression <b>molding,</b> transfer <b>molding,</b> injection <b>molding,</b> extrusion, rotational <b>molding,</b> blow <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam <b>molding.</b> Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes. Compression <b>molding,</b> transfer <b>molding,</b> injection <b>molding,</b> forging, and foam <b>molding</b> has high equipment and tooling cost. Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational <b>molding,</b> blow <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.|$|R
50|$|Transfer <b>molding</b> (BrE moulding) is a {{manufacturing}} process where casting material is {{forced into a}} <b>mold.</b> Transfer <b>molding</b> is different from compression <b>molding</b> in that the <b>mold</b> is enclosed Hayward rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact. Compared to injection <b>molding,</b> transfer <b>molding</b> uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the <b>mold</b> cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin. Furthermore, unlike injection <b>molding</b> the transfer <b>mold</b> casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection <b>molding</b> processes.|$|R

5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the <b>molds</b> to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough <b>molds</b> to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast <b>molds</b> of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. <b>Molds</b> used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} weld-line {{reduction}} {{by using the}} laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> {{and the effect of}} hot air supply on the <b>mold</b> surface just before the injection have been investigated. The depth of the weld-line groove in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is smaller than that in the conventional steel <b>mold.</b> <b>Mold</b> pressure increase in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is faster than that in the steel <b>mold</b> and the peak pressure in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is higher than that in the steel <b>mold.</b> This must be due to the low thermal conductivity of the laser metal sintered <b>mold.</b> As a preheating effect of the <b>mold</b> surface before the injection, hot air has been supplied on the <b>mold</b> surface using an air jet bulb. The reduction of the weld-line groove has been promoted in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> whereas few effects appeared in the steel <b>mold.</b> Surface temperature increase by the hot air supply in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is larger than that in the steel <b>mold.</b> By this higher temperature increase, temperature of the resin on the weld-line area must be higher and the hardness of the resin must be lower in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> so that the resin is deformed well reducing the weld-line groove...|$|R
