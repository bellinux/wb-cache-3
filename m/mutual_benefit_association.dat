25|$|On {{the lower}} end of the social scale in Lisbon were all types of labourers and street merchants, as well as {{fishermen}} and farmers of vegetable gardens. In this era the streets were occupied by tradesmen who had organised artisans' guilds directed by masters of their respective trades. These included: Rua do Ouro (Goldsmiths' Street), Rua da Prata (Silversmiths' Street), Rua dos Fanqueiros (Drapers' Street), Rua dos Sapateiros (Cobblers' Street), Rua dos Retroseiros (Mercers' Street) and Rua dos Correeiros (Saddlers' Street). Such corporations were formed for social protection and to educate apprentices, and were employed to enforce a system of price controls for the benefit of their members. The aristocracy, attracted to Lisbon by the court, established its presence in the city with the building of large palaces, and served in the bureaucratic offices of governmental administration. But the most powerful segment of society in Lisbon, even after the city gained its status as the nation's capital, was the bourgeoisie, the merchant class that was the economic powerhouse of this rising commercial centre, now among the most important in Europe. They were the magnates of commerce who controlled the city and its oligarchic council. It was to serve their needs that business professionals organised in the city: bankers to raise capital and coordinate the financial risks; lawyers to protect the rights of citizens and handle their legal cases; naval architects and marine engineers to build boats, and scientists to design their navigational instruments. With their political influence, they could extract from the monarchy concessions that favored their mercantile interests, and were a great impetus for exploration to find new markets. A <b>mutual</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>association,</b> the Companhia das Naus, was founded in 1380 as a kind of insurance company which required the payment of compulsory quotas from all ship owners in exchange for the sharing of losses after shipwrecks. As an umbrella organisation covering more than five hundred large vessels owned by the magnates of the city, it was the forerunner of Portuguese overseas expansion. With rising profits, the wealthiest merchants acquired titles of nobility, even as the poorer nobles engaged in trade.|$|E

Access to formal risk protection schemes such as insurance may be a more effective means to minimize the poor households' losses but traditional mainstream insurance has bypassed informal workers and poor households.

In 1964, Barasch created the [...] as an educational and charitable organization based on his beliefs focused on a mission of improving the lives of working men and women through education and legal advocacy.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} state of micro-insurance in the country, {{identifies}} the players and their performance, and the challenges facing micro-insurance development. The term “micro” pertains to the capacity of a program to handle the small, sometime irregular cash flows of poor households, who have been excluded in the commercial insurance system {{for a variety of}} reasons. Micro-insurance products, specifically designed with the poor in mind, will help mitigate risks and reduce the vulnerability of poor households. The most prominent forms of micro-insurance are life insurance and health insurance (carried out as part of an overall health care package that links the health insurance to a health facility), which have been designed to be responsive to the need of poor households. The paper reports 17 players in the emerging micro-insurance industry, consisting of 12 cooperatives, three NGOs/MFIs, and two transport associations that are offering “home-made” micro-insurance. These “home-made” microinsurance products continue to be provided despite their actuarial weaknesses and lack of financial capacity of the providers because of very strong demand from their membership for such financial products. Given their advantages over commercial insurance companies, the <b>mutual</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>associations</b> (MBAs) are the usual vehicles of micro-insurance programs. In 2004, 18 MBAs were registered with the Insurance Commission (IC) with accumulated assets of PhP 14. 8 billion. Members’ equity totaled PhP 4. 25 billion.

Secondly, the organizational structure did not match the reward structure, i. e., salaries of supervisors were often lower than those of the professional staff. Finally, the organization operated on the principle that each of its programs should be taken over by other organizations and were successful frequently enough with this policy that no program became imbedded within the organization so no one group could gain hegemony...|$|R

40|$|The leading {{explanatory}} {{model for}} the widespread occurrence of color vision polymorphism in Neotropical primates is the heterozygote superiority hypothesis, which postulates that trichromatic individuals have a fitness advantage over other phenotypes because red-green chromatic discrimination is useful for foraging, social signaling, or predator detection. Alternative explanatory models predict that dichromatic and trichromatic phenotypes are each suited to distinct tasks. To conclusively evaluate these models, one must determine whether proposed visual advantages translate into differential fitness of trichromatic and dichromatic individuals. We tested whether color vision phenotype is {{a significant predictor of}} female fitness in a population of wild capuchins, using long-term (26 years) survival and fertility data. We found no advantage to trichromats over dichromats for three fitness measures (fertility rates, offspring survival and maternal survival). This finding suggests that a selective mechanism other than heterozygote advantage is operating to maintain the color vision polymorphism. We propose that attention be directed to field testing the alternative mechanisms of balancing selection proposed to explain opsin polymorphism: niche-divergence, frequency-dependence and <b>mutual</b> <b>benefit</b> of <b>association.</b> This is the first in-depth, long-term study examining the effects of color vision variation on survival an...|$|R
40|$|Parasites {{are able}} to evolve rapidly and {{overcome}} host defense mechanisms, but the molecular basis of this adaptation is poorly understood. Powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphales, Ascomycota) are obligate biotrophic parasites infecting nearly 10, 000 plant genera. They obtain their nutrients from host plants through specialized feeding structures known as haustoria. We previously identified the AVR(k 1) powdery mildew-specific gene family encoding effectors {{that contribute to the}} successful establishment of haustoria. Here, we report the extensive proliferation of the AVR(k 1) gene family throughout the genome of B. graminis, with sequences diverging in formae speciales adapted to infect different hosts. Also, importantly, we have discovered that the effectors have coevolved with a particular family of LINE- 1 retrotransposons, named TE 1 a. The coevolution of these two entities indicates a <b>mutual</b> <b>benefit</b> to the <b>association,</b> which could ultimately contribute to parasite adaptation and success. We propose that the <b>association</b> would <b>benefit</b> 1) the powdery mildew fungus, by providing a mechanism for amplifying and diversifying effectors and 2) the associated retrotransposons, by providing a basis for their maintenance through selection in the fungal genome...|$|R
