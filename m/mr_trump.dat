500|$|In {{an order}} dated October 24, 2014, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel {{certified}} the class {{proposed by the}} plaintiff and ruled that Cohen had presented enough evidence to allow the lawsuit to proceed. Alan Garten, {{general counsel for the}} Trump Organization, said that Trump University would appeal Curiel's ruling, which he said showed a [...] "manifest disregard for the law". In October 2015, Garten also said that Trump would ask Curiel to recuse himself because of his [...] "animosity toward <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump</b> and his views". However, Trump's lawyers never filed any motion to recuse, and according to legal experts such a motion would lack legal merit and possibly be considered frivolous.|$|E

500|$|Other {{published}} {{sources said}} that the name change occurred in the 17th century. In the 2015 book The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate, an excerpt from which the program used to cite the ancestral name disclosure for the segment, biographer Gwenda Blair wrote that the Trumps' family name was changed during the Thirty Years' War. She cited that one ancestor, named John Philip Trump, lived in the 17th century. Blair also wrote that Frederick Trump's original name was Friedrich Trump, and his father, born in the 19th century, was Johannes Trump. This position was endorsed by The Boston Globe, {{as well as by}} Daniel Victor, the New York Times reporter, who wrote, [...] "Despite mistaken impressions, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump</b> and his recent relatives {{had nothing to do with}} the surname change. Mr. Oliver himself was careful to refer to a 'prescient ancestor'." [...] Kate Connolly of The Guardian, who visited Kallstadt, referred to Frederick as [...] "Friedrich Trump". She {{said that the}} town church's parish register contained multiple versions of the Trump name spanning 500 years, but did not mention the name [...] "Drumpf".|$|E
2500|$|On August 14, 2008, {{real estate}} mogul Donald Trump {{announced}} that he would purchase McMahon's home from Countrywide Financial and lease it to McMahon, so the home would not be foreclosed. McMahon agreed instead to a deal with a private buyer for his hilltop home, said Howard Bragman, McMahon's former spokesman. Bragman declined to name the buyer or the selling price, but he said it is not Trump. [...] "For <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump,</b> this acquisition was not business-related, but, as he has stated, was meant to help out an American icon," [...] said Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump. [...] "If another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump</b> sought for Ed McMahon, then he is clearly pleased." [...] In early September, after the second buyer's offer fell through, Trump renewed his offer to purchase the home.|$|E

It was kept by a tidy old widow known as Mrs. Trump; but those who knew anything of Hamworth affairs were well aware that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Trump</b> had been left without a shilling, and could not have taken that snug little house in Paradise Row and furnished it completely, out of her own means. No. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Trump's</b> lodging-house {{was one of the}} irons which Samuel Dockwrath ever kept heating in the fire, for the behoof of those fourteen children. He had taken a lease of the house in Paradise Row, having made a bargain and advanced a few pounds while it was yet being built; and he then had furnished it and put in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Trump.</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Trump</b> received from him wages and a percentage; but to him were paid over the quota of shillings per week in consideration for which the lodgers were accommodated.

Trump denounced and then sued Zakarian in August 2015 for a sum [...] "in excess of $10 million" [...] for lost rent and other damages. Trump's lawsuit called Zakarian's offense at his remarks [...] "curious {{in light of the fact}} that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump's</b> publicly shared views on immigration have remained consistent for many years, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump's</b> willingness to frankly share his opinions is widely known".|$|R

[...] The Committee was investigating both Trump's ties to Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election and Trump's unfounded allegations that President Obama had Trump Towers under surveillance. Lake's April 3 report of the unmasking specified [...] "Rice's requests to unmask the names of Trump transition officials do not vindicate Trump's own tweets from March 4 in which he accused Obama of illegally tapping Trump Tower."

2500|$|Cruz has {{repeatedly}} {{said that the}} 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran [...] "will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism".

Maybe this is just an effort to push <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump</b> out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now."

For all the outrage voiced by Democrats and Republicans in the past week about the Russian action — with the notable exception of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump,</b> who has dismissed the intelligence findings as politically motivated — it is worth remembering that trying to manipulate elections is a well-honed American art form." ...|$|E

He said he had paid $1.85 million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6 million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. [...] Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8 billion worth of donations last year. Buffett said, [...] "I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited.

To solidify this partnership, we endorse <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump</b> as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him."

2500|$|Most {{political}} analysts notice her strong position {{because of the}} absence of a primary in her party (consolidating her leadership), of the news such as the migrants crisis or the terrorist attacks in France (reinforcing her political positions) and of the very right-wing campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy in the Republican primary (enlarging her themes). In a 2016 interview with the BBC, Le Pen stated that Donald Trump's presidential victory would, in fact, help her in the 2016–2017 presidential race. In her opinion, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Trump</b> has [...] "made possible what had previously been presented as impossible". However, she stated she would not officially launch her campaign before February 2017, waiting for the results of the Republican and Socialist primaries, and preferred to remain silent in the media and usher thematic think tanks dedicated to the elaboration of her program.
