25|$|Combined {{topographical}} and road-maps {{may have}} existed as specialty items in some Roman libraries, {{but they were}} expensive, hard to copy and not in general use. Travelers wishing to plan a journey could consult an itinerarium, which in its most basic form was a simple list of cities and towns along a given road, and the distances between them. It was only a short step from lists to a <b>master</b> <b>list,</b> or a schematic route-planner in which roads and their branches were represented {{more or less in}} parallel, as in the Tabula Peutingeriana. From this <b>master</b> <b>list,</b> parts could be copied and sold on the streets. The most thorough used different symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The Roman government from time to time would produce a master road-itinerary. The first known were commissioned in 44 BC by Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Three Greek geographers, Zenodoxus, Theodotus and Polyclitus, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary; the task required over 25 years and the resulting stone-engraved master itinerary was set up near the Pantheon. Travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies from it.|$|E

25|$|A huge {{advantage}} of the new scheme was that node numbers were now unique only within their network, not globally. This meant the previous 250 node limit was gone, but {{for a variety of}} reasons this was initially limited to about 1,200. This change also devolved the maintenance of the nodelists down to the network hosts, who then sent updated lists back to Node 51 to be collected into the <b>master</b> <b>list.</b> The St. Louis group now had to only maintain their own local network, and do basic work to compile the global list.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2004, an {{inventory}} of classified weapons data revealed that four hard disk drives were missing: [...] two of the drives were subsequently found to have been improperly moved to a different building, but another two remained unaccounted for. [...] In response, director Peter Nanos shut down {{large parts of the}} laboratory and publicly rebuked scientists working there for a lax attitude to security procedures. In the laboratory's August 2004 newsletter he wrote, [...] "This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many people I have to fire to make it stop". Nanos is also quoted as saying, [...] "If I have to restart the laboratory with 10 people, I will". However, a report released in January 2005 found that the drives were in fact an artifact of an inconsistent inventory system: the report concludes that 12 barcodes were issued to a group of disk drives that needed only 10, but the two surplus barcodes nevertheless appeared on a <b>master</b> <b>list.</b> Thus, auditors wrongly concluded that two disks were missing. The report states, [...] "The allegedly missing disks never existed and no compromise of classified material has occurred". This incident is widely reported as contributing to continuing distrust of management at the lab. In May 2005, Nanos stepped down as director.|$|E
