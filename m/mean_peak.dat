25|$|Only {{one study}} {{appears to have}} {{evaluated}} the pharmacokinetics of iprindole. A single oral dose of 60mg iprindole to healthy volunteers {{has been found to}} achieve <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> plasma concentrations of 67.1ng/mL (236nmol/L) after 2 to 4hours. The mean terminal half-life of iprindole was 52.5hours, which is notably much longer than that of other TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine. Following chronic treatment with 90mg/day iprindole for 3weeks, plasma concentrations of the drug ranged between 18 and 77ng/mL (63–271nmol/L). Theoretical steady-state concentrations should be reached by 99% within 15 to 20days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone is well absorbed after oral administration, with <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> {{blood levels}} {{obtained}} at about one hour after ingestion. Absorption is somewhat delayed and enhanced by food. The mean blood elimination half-life is biphasic: the first phase's half-life is 3 to 6hours, {{and the following}} phase's half-life is 5 to 9hours. The drug is extensively metabolized, {{with three or four}} major metabolites having been identified in the human body, particularly mCPP, which may contribute to the side effect profile of trazodone and which probably accounts for trazodone's serotonergic effects. Trazodone levels are about 10-fold those of mCPP with treatment.|$|E

At the respective doses, <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained {{within two days}} of dosing. [...] Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion {{as evidenced by the}} high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose. [...] Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value. The serum protein binding of norfloxacin is between 10 and 15%.” Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.|$|E

40|$|Limited {{data are}} {{available}} about mitotane-nduced hyperlipidemia. We retrospectively analyzed lipid data in 38 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) who received mitotane therapy with emphasis on HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) and clinical predictors of lipid changes. At baseline, the mean levels of HDL-c, LDL-c, and triglycerides were 53. 3 [*]mg/dL, 114. 4 [*]mg/dL, and 149 [*]mg/dL, respectively. HDL-c, LDL-c, and triglyceride concentrations significantly increased with mitotane therapy to a <b>mean</b> HDL <b>peak</b> (HDL-P) of 86. 3 [*]mg/dL (P< 0. 001), a <b>mean</b> LDL <b>peak</b> of 160. 1 [*]mg/dL (P< 0. 001), and a <b>mean</b> triglyceride <b>peak</b> (Tg-P) of 216. 7 [*]mg/dL (P= 0. 042). HDL-P positively correlated with mitotane concentration (r= 0. 52,P< 0. 001), while LDL-P levels and Tg-P did not. Gender, body mass index, cortisol overproduction, baseline levels of HDL-c, and triglyceride did not predict change in HDL-c. Similar changes were noticed in subgroup analysis after excluding patients who were using lipid-lowering agents. In conclusion, in ACC patients, mitotane caused significant increases in HDL-c that may counteract the deleterious atherosclerotic effects of LDL-c and Tg rise.
