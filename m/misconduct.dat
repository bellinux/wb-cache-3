40|$|Psychopathy is {{considered}} one of the best predictors of violence and prison <b>misconducts</b> and is arguably an important clinical construct in the correctional setting. However, we tested whether psychopathy can be used to predict <b>misconducts</b> in prison environments for women as has been done for men. To date, few studies exist that examine and validate this association in female offender samples. The present study included 182 ethnically diverse female offenders. The aim was to prospectively predict violent and nonviolent <b>misconducts</b> over a 9 -month period using official records of prior violent criminal history (e. g., homicide, manslaughter, assault), and self-report measures of psychopathy, impulsivity, and empathy. Using negative binomial regression, we found that past violent criminal history, and callous and antisocial psychopathic traits were predictors of violent <b>misconducts,</b> whereas antisocial psychopathic traits and impulsivity best predicted nonviolent <b>misconducts.</b> Although empathy was negatively associated with psychopathy it was not a significant predictor of violent or nonviolent <b>misconducts.</b> Statistical models, which included impulsivity, were considered the most parsimonious at predicting <b>misconducts.</b> Our findings demonstrate how risk-factors found to be reliable in male offender samples, such as psychopathic traits, impulsivity, and past violent criminal history, generalize to female offenders for predicting nonviolent and violent <b>misconducts.</b> One notable difference is the importance of callous psychopathic traits when predicting chronic violent <b>misconducts</b> by female offenders. In sum, there are more similarities in psychopathy and impulsivity than differences in the prediction of <b>misconducts</b> among men and women...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEnormous {{issues on}} {{research}} integrity {{have been widely}} discussed amongst the academicians and the research institutes all over the world. Likewise, understanding and discussions on different aspects of academic <b>misconducts</b> have increased significantly in the past decade. Yet, cases on research <b>misconducts</b> continue to increase {{in the world of}} academia. Additionally, a noticeable gap in the literature is evident, whereby little research has sought to address research <b>misconducts</b> among researchers in Malaysia and the existence of policies on research <b>misconducts</b> among universities are not well documented or governed. In considering the integrity in research among the researchers, the authors examine {{the extent to which they}} perceive research integrity through research <b>misconducts</b> (i. e. plagiarism, fabrication, falsification, misuse of research fund). The authors further address on the influence of different generations and gender of researchers towards integrity. A cross-sectional survey of 600 questionnaires was used and only 159 returned questionnaires were analyzed. The use of parametric test reveals that majority of respondents agreed research <b>misconducts</b> were not tolerable. The study also confirms that generations and gender differences influence the researchers’ perceptions towards integrity. The study concludes that Malaysia's academic communities require strong and sound guidelines for responsible practice in research and dealing with research <b>misconducts</b> specifically...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades {{publication}} of papers in different fields of agronomic sciences have been increased drastically in Iran. However, there is growing warnings about research <b>misconducts.</b> To get a quantitative insight into the commitment to the research ethics, 1269 papers published during the last 3 decades in the refereed domestic journals were surveyed using human tools. The frequency of different type of <b>misconducts</b> were calculated and compared statistically. The results indicated that overlap in title, the target crop, experimental factors (treatments) and the measured traits was occurred with frequency of 26 % among the surveyed papers which was categorized as unauthorized adoption of ideas. Falsification and fabrication was distinguished based on the coefficient of variation (CV), probability of type I error and discrepancy between the results of ANOVA and regression analysis. This type of <b>misconducts</b> had frequency of 6 %. However, plagiarism had a significantly higher frequency and was detected in up to 12 % of the papers. The frequency of all type of <b>misconducts</b> was significantly higher in the papers where the corresponding authors were students compared to the papers published by scientific staffs of universities/research institutes. Overall research <b>misconducts</b> were distinguished in 16 % of papers and were most frequent in the 1380 decade compared to 60 ’s and 70 ’s. It seems that lack of awareness about the principles of research ethics is the main cause of the prevalence of the observed <b>misconducts.</b> Therefore, development of a national code of ethics is of high priority for the national agricultural research system in the country...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical investigation of severe <b>misconducts</b> in contests {{based on data}} from European football championships. We differentiate between two types of severe <b>misconducts</b> both resulting in a yellow card, namely dissents with the referee and other <b>misconducts,</b> and between sanctioned behaviour of team captains and other players. Confirming the existing literature, we find that sabotage against the opponent is used more frequently by players from teams with lower ability. In addition, we find that dissents with the referee are significantly more likely {{in the case of an}} unfavourable score. We further find that captains, in contrast to other players, seem to use sabotage less impulsively and more strategically, as they do not seem to participate in retaliatory escalation of conflict behaviour. However, compared to other players, captains increase their sabotage in important matches...|$|R

The theory of product liability is closely related to the strict liability but the doctrine of punitive damages has been developed to regulate malicious <b>misconducts.</b> Due to the different basic concepts, the strict liability and malicious <b>misconducts,</b> the theory of product liability might not include the doctrine of punitive damages. In addition to the compatibility issue, functions of the punitive damages are another issue. Although the punitive damages, there is a theoretical necessity of reviewing the relations between the theory of product liability and the U. S. doctrine of punitive damages. The theory of product liability is closely related to the strict liability but the doctrine of punitive damages has been developed to regulate malicious <b>misconducts.</b> Due to the different basic concepts, the strict liability and malicious <b>misconducts,</b> the theory of product liability might not include the doctrine of punitive damages. In addition to the compatibility issue, functions of the punitive damages are another issue. Although the punitive damages are regarded not as a criminal issue, but as torts, the punitive damages function as punishment, deterrence, retribution, and so on. With the issues about compatibility and functions, this thesis suggests two implications for improving the revised South Korean Product Liability Act. The first implication for the revised South Korean Product Liability Act is that implementing the punitive damages of South Korea within the three times of compensatory damages regardless of the degree of malicious <b>misconducts</b> is not fit for regulating various types of malicious <b>misconducts.</b> Therefore, there is a necessity for reforming the three–time’s cap of South Korean punitive damages. The second is that South Korean manufacturers have a responsibility to consider their products’ safety...|$|R
