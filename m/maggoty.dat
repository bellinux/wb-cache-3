5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. She wonders {{what has happened to}} the patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. <b>Maggoty,</b> a magpie.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} the tale was {{composed}} by Potter in 1903, but set aside to develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead. Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale more fully before publication. The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and {{have been described as}} some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr <b>Maggoty</b> on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.|$|E

500|$|Duchess is {{left alone}} before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal {{pie in the}} oven. [...] "Then I must have been eating MOUSE! ... No wonder I feel ill," [...] she muses. Knowing she cannot {{adequately}} explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home. Ribby and Dr. <b>Maggoty</b> arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, {{only to find that}} the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie.

60|$|Occasionally {{she came}} to a spot where {{independent}} worlds of ephemerons were passing their time in mad carousal, some in the air, some on the hot ground and vegetation, some in the tepid and stringy water of a nearly dried pool. All the shallower ponds had decreased to a vaporous mud amid which the <b>maggoty</b> shapes of innumerable obscure creatures could be indistinctly seen, heaving and wallowing with enjoyment. Being a woman not disinclined to philosophize she sometimes sat down under her umbrella to rest and to watch their happiness, for a certain hopefulness as to the result of her visit gave ease to her mind, and between important thoughts left it free to dwell on any infinitesimal matter which caught her eyes.|$|E

He saw in the black, void, glistening eyes of the oriental only the same danger, the same menace that he saw in the landlady. Fair, wise, even benevolent words: always the human good speaking, and always underneath, {{something}} hateful, something detestable and murderous. Wise speech and good intentions--they were invariably <b>maggoty</b> with these secret inclinations to destroy the man in the man. Whenever he heard anyone holding forth: the landlady, this doctor, the spokesman on the pit bank: or when he read the all-righteous newspaper; his soul curdled with revulsion as from something foul. Even the infernal love and good-will of his wife. To hell with good-will! It was more hateful than ill-will. Self-righteous bullying, like poison gas! ...|$|E

50|$|The {{taste of}} Russula xerampelina is mild.

50|$|From Big Lick/Roanoke, after 1748, the Great Wagon Road {{passed through}} the <b>Maggoty</b> Gap (also called Maggodee) to {{the east side of}} the Blue Ridge Mountains. Continuing south through the Piedmont region, it {{passed through the}} present-day North Carolina towns of Winston-Salem, Salisbury, and Charlotte and sites of earlier Indian {{settlements}} on the historic Indian Trading Path. The Great Wagon Road ultimately reached Augusta, Georgia, on the Savannah River, a distance of more than 800 mi from Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|On close {{inspection}} {{it appears}} that nectar-feeding birds such as sunbirds rely on the ants and other insects that they find in flowers, not for a richer supply of protein, but for essential nutrients such as Vitamin B12 that are absent from nectar.

50|$|For {{some years}} after the {{production}} of Hurlothrumbo Johnson remained active in London, but also carried on his profession as dancing-master at Manchester. During {{the last thirty years}} of his life, he lived in retirement at the village of Gawsworth, near Macclesfield, known under the names of <b>Maggoty</b> or Fiddler Johnson. He died in 1773 at a house called the New Hall, and was buried in a small wood in the neighbourhood. The wood is known as Maggotty Wood, and is reputedly haunted by his ghost.|$|E
50|$|A {{portion of}} the Carolina Road roadbed {{can be seen at}} <b>Maggoty</b> Gap, where it crossed the Blue Ridge at Maggodee Gap. Today {{this is part of the}} Cahas Mountain Rural Historic District in Boones Mill, Virginia. The volume of travel along this part of the Carolina road was so great that it {{encouraged}} the construction of two brick homes from the 1820s, the John and Susan Boon House and the Taylor-Price house. The Boon house offered accommodations for travelers, and probably the Taylor Price House was also used as an inn.|$|E
5000|$|... "Maggoty Gap" [...] {{describes}} a natural gateway of the Great Wagon Road (locally known as The Carolina Road) {{that made it}} possible for wagons and livestock traffic to pass through the Blue Ridge Mountains at Roanoke, Virginia near <b>Maggoty</b> Creek (now called Maggodee Creek). It carried enormous amounts of traffic in the late 18th century and much of the 19th century until a railroad was extended over the ridge in 1892. During the years from 1760 to 1776 it was said to be the heaviest traveled road in all of America.|$|E

This route connects Starkey, Virginia and Boone's Mill, Virginia. An alternate route is State Road 613 (Merriman Rd. & Naff Rd.) through the [...] "Simmonds Gap".|$|E

50|$|Quite often, mainly herbivorous creatures will eagerly eat small {{quantities}} of animal food {{when it becomes}} available. Although this is trivial most of the time, omnivorous or herbivorous birds, such as sparrows, often will feed their chicks insects while food is most needed for growth. On close inspection it appears that nectar-feeding birds such as sunbirds rely on the ants and other insects that they find in flowers, not for a richer supply of protein, but for essential nutrients such as cyanocobalamin that are absent from nectar.

5000|$|Morgan Bryan (1671-1763) cut {{the path}} {{for the first}} wagon to cross the gap from Starkey, Virginia to Boone's Mill, Virginia in 1746 (at age 78).

[...] In 1753, the original 15 Moravians used Bryan's road to get a wagon to their Wachovia Tract located at present-day Winston-Salem, but took a wrong turn and missed <b>Maggoty</b> Gap; instead with great difficulty they traveled over nearby Windy Gap and rejoined Bryan's road at present-day Boone's Mill.|$|E
