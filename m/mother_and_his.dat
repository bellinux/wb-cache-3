5|$|In 33 AD, Tiberius gave Caligula {{an honorary}} quaestorship, a {{position}} he held until his rise to emperor. Meanwhile, both Caligula's <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother Drusus died in prison. Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla, in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year. Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro, an important ally. Macro spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Smith's early musical {{influences}} {{were his}} <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father, who played guitar. At {{the age of}} four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because he believed it would only direct Buster {{to a life of}} sin.|$|E
5|$|Wilber Rogan {{was born}} in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After {{the death of his}} <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father's remarriage, he moved with his family to Kansas City, Kansas. He began his {{baseball}} career there in 1911 as a catcher with Fred Palace's Colts, a semipro team composed mostly of teenagers. Also joining the Colts that season was Dick Whitworth, who would, like Rogan, go on to pitch for many years in the Negro leagues.|$|E
50|$|Caligula was {{the last}} emperor adopted into {{the family of the}} Julii Caesares. He was a Claudius by descendance, {{although}} he had Julii Caesares among his ancestors, from both <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father's side.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Ben Tillman, his <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wounded brother James (who died in 1866) {{worked to}} rebuild Chester plantation. They signed the plantation's freedmen as workers. They were {{confronted with the}} {{circumstance}} of several men refusing {{to work for them}} and legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several workers from the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton-planting belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida—after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|Anderssen {{was born}} in Breslau (now called Wrocław), in the Prussian Province of Silesia, in 1818. He lived there {{for most of his}} life, sharing a house with and {{supporting}} his widowed <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> unmarried sister. Anderssen never married. He graduated from the public gymnasium (high school) in Breslau and then attended university, where he studied mathematics and philosophy. After graduating in 1847 at the age of 29, he took a position at the Friedrichs-Gymnasium as an instructor and later as Professor of Mathematics. Anderssen lived a quiet, stable, responsible, respectable middle-class life. His career was teaching mathematics, while his hobby and passion was playing chess.|$|E
5|$|Following such performances, the Jackson {{brothers}} {{would be}} tucked in bed by their oblivious mother and {{reminded of the}} virtues of being a good Jehovah's Witness. Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that {{at such a young}} age, the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{presentation}} of the Swords, Philipp went on home leave. Again he was asked to make a number of propaganda appearances. On 1 May 1942, he spoke before his home school and before the Meissen youth at the Hamburger Hof. He, his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> fiancée were also invited to Meissen Town Hall on 30 April. Among other officials, present were the NSDAP-Kreisleiter (county leader) Helmut Böhme and the mayor of Meissen, Walter Kaule. Philipp was granted the privilege of signing the Meissen Golden Book (Goldenes Buch)—a book signed in German communities and cities by special guests of honor.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in London that Whistler met Joanna Heffernan, the model who would become his lover. By 1865, Whistler had already used her {{as a model for}} other paintings, among these Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2. Heffernan {{supposedly}} had a strong influence over Whistler; his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden refused a dinner invitation in the winter of 186364 due to her dominant presence in the household. In January 1864, Whistler's mother Annalater depicted in the painting Arrangement in Grey and Blackarrived to stay with her son in London. As a result, Heffernan had {{to move out of the}} apartment, and only visited as a model. Still, Heffernan's presence displeased Whistler's <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> relationship with both women became strained.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rekha {{escapes from}} the garage and enters the room where Chandru earlier claimed his mother stays. However, she finds only a {{skeleton}} and is cornered by Chandru, who tries to assault her. Ravi and Raghunath hear Rekha screaming and rush to the room. Raghunath subdues Chandru, who collapses and reveals that the skeleton is his mother's. Raghunath understands Chandru's love for his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> traumatic childhood, which had made him develop a hatred for women with loose morals. Chandru is arrested, while Rekha and Ravi unite.|$|E

5|$|On 20 January 1936, George V died at Sandringham and Edward {{ascended the}} throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal {{protocol}} {{by watching the}} proclamation of his accession from a window of St James's Palace, {{in the company of}} the still-married Wallis. It was becoming apparent to Court and Government circles that the new King-Emperor meant to marry her. The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the Conservative-led British government, as well as distressing his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother, the Duke of York. The British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship.|$|E

5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} peace, established marriage ties with several rulers; his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun. Adud al-Dawla himself had several wives, which included; the daughter of Bisutun; the daughter of Manadhar, an Justanid king; and the daughter of Siyahgil, an Giilite king. From these wives, Adud al-Dawla had several sons; Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah, from the daughter of Manadhar; Abu Kalijar Marzuban, from the daughter of Siyahgil; and Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, from a Turkic concubine. Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> uncle Fuladh ibn Manadhar as the heir of the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because of his more prominent descent, was appointed as heir of the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto with his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister Toyoka {{so that he}} could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched by any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{married his}} second wife, Elizabeth, around 20 June 1353. Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, and Stephen's wife, Elizabeth of Kuyavia. Louis and his new wife were within the prohibited degree of kinship, because Louis's <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife's grandmother were cousins, but they applied for a papal dispensation only about four months after their marriage. Historian Iván Bertényi says that this haste suggests that Elizabeth, who had been living in the court of Louis's mother, was pregnant {{at the time of the}} marriage. If this theory is valid, Louis's and his wife's first child was stillborn. Their next child, Catherine, was born in 1370 and died in 1378. The next daughter, Mary, who would succeed Louis in Hungary, was born in 1371. Louis's youngest daughter, Hedwig, who was born in 1373, became queen regnant of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Recorded {{following}} the death of Corgan's <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> divorce, 1998's Adore represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance. Although Adore received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States {{by the end of the}} year, which led the music industry to consider it a failure. The album nonetheless sold three times as many copies overseas. The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of Adore. At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of tickets sales to a local charity organization. The tour's expenses were entirely funded out of the band's own pockets. All told, the band donated over $2.8million to charity as a result of the tour.|$|E
5|$|Some recent historians paint a more {{favourable}} {{picture of}} the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2012), doubts {{the reliability of the}} ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality {{played a role in the}} fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.|$|E
5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E
