5|$|Modifications to {{the house}} include the {{addition}} of a large pediment-shaped dormer that projects {{from the center of the}} <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> and is lighted by a rectangular double window. Part of the veranda was enclosed and the stairs that lead to a formal garden were removed. Above the center of the veranda is a second-story projection that was described as visually compromising the elegance of the rear facade.|$|E
5|$|The farm {{buildings}} {{date back to}} the 13th century with the Great Barn the most prominent. The barn is the second largest such structure in Middlesex after another in Harmondsworth. The Great Barn is constructed of English oak from the nearby Ruislip Woods. It was built to a design known as an aisled barn, whereby smaller out-shoots run alongside the main supports underneath one <b>main</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the <b>main</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|The stone {{core and}} western brick {{extension}} have separately framed hip roofs clad in painted corrugated iron. A box gutter runs {{between the two}} <b>main</b> <b>roofs.</b> A rendered masonry chimney emerges from both roofs. The chimney on the stone core is larger, having multiple flues.|$|R

2500|$|The {{design is}} a four-cell plan with a three-bay chancel, and five-bay nave. There are {{north and south}} aisles, a south porch, and a west tower. Building {{materials}} include local lias stone and hamstone. The <b>main</b> <b>roofs</b> are composed of Welsh slate with moulded coped gables, battlemented parapets. [...] The aisle and porch roofs are of sheet lead.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the present structure are the nave and the chancel, which are 13th-century. The church shows signs of alterations and additions in subsequent centuries. A transept or chapel {{was added to the}} south side of the chancel in the late 13th or early 14th century. The arch between them was once the archway between the chancel and the nave but was later moved. The bellcote at the west end of the roof was added in the 14th century. The porch on {{the south side of the}} nave was built in about 1500, and was re-roofed in 1725. A doorway in the north wall of the nave was inserted in the late 15th or early 16th century, and now leads into a vestry added in the 19th century. The <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> is largely 17th-century. Some repairs were carried out in the 1840s, with further repairs in 1854 under the supervision of the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} the western (1875) train shed roof should be retained in new development; consequently it was repaired and reinforced between 1982 and 1984, followed by repairs to the <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> completed in 1987. Initial plans included the widening of the stations' exit by two tracks to make eight, with 22 platforms in a layout {{similar to that}} of Waterloo station; the combined Broad Street and Liverpool Street station was to be {{at the level of the}} latter, with relatively low-rise office developments. Poor use of land value caused the development to be reassessed in 1983/4, when it was decided to retain the existing six-road exit throat and 18-platform layout, in combination with resignalling; this resulted in a station confined to the Liverpool Street site, with ground space released for development. In 1985 British Railways signed an agreement with developers Rosehaugh Stanhope and work on the office development, known as Broadgate, began.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the 1988 {{structure}} is a later steel-framed structure with a multi-gabled, corrugated iron roof. There is one long, rectangular gable roof along the length of the structure, at the rear, with four gable roofs at the front, at right-angles to the <b>main</b> <b>roof.</b> These four interconnected structures are staggered in length creating a tiered effect along the front elevation.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the Poblet Monastery fell into disrepair and ruin; some of the <b>main</b> <b>roofs</b> caved in. The tombs of the rulers of the Kingdom of Aragon were desecrated and the remains were transferred and kept for a while in the Cathedral of Tarragona, thanks to the intervention of Rev. Antoni Serret from the neighboring town of L'Espluga.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows are}} paired one-over-one double-hung sash on the west, single two-over-two {{on the side}} {{profiles}} and single one-over-one on the kitchen wing. On the north face of the kitchen is a bay window. The broad overhanging eaves of the porch and <b>main</b> <b>roofs</b> are supported by carved modillions. Original interior features include marble fireplaces and simple wooden door and window surrounds.|$|R
25|$|On {{the east}} facade {{is the main}} entrance, flanked by pointed-arch tripane windows in wooden surrounds. A small {{projecting}} wooden vestibule shelters the main entrance. It has a gabled roof with the same pitch as the <b>main</b> <b>roof.</b> The gently arched exterior entrance is built of an H-shaped bent with beadboard siding on the exterior, chamfered edges {{on the inside and}} intricate quatrefoil sawn tracery in the gable field above. Lancet windows are on either side. Above it is an octagonal oculus.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the church is divided into bays by the exposed {{parabolic}} arches. A scaled-down arch within the arch closest to the sanctuary provides the framework for a lower arched ceiling, lined with plasterboard. The gap between the inner and outer arches is glazed with frosted glass. The lower ceiling stops short of touching the southern sanctuary wall, allowing views of the <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> structure. Throughout the nave, the underside of the parabolic roof is lined with timber, while the tops of the parabolic arches are concealed from view by a high, plasterboard-clad cove.|$|E
25|$|Exterior {{decoration}} is minimal. The double-doored main entrance, on {{the south}} pavilion, is located within a deeply recessed lancet arch with a molded head flanked by piers topped with cusped niches. It is flanked by two metal lantern-style lights. Above it is a parapet in the pavilion's flat roof. Two large buttresss rise from either side, framing the large lancet-arched window in the gable field. A stone cross is at the apex. The <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> and the gables on the bell tower are tiled; the shed roofs are metallic.|$|E
2500|$|The Zen sect {{was very}} successful, and {{therefore}} often imitated. Many of its innovations were therefore widely adopted by other Buddhist schools. Zenshūyō's characteristics are decorative pent roofs (mokoshi) [...] and pronouncedly curved <b>main</b> <b>roofs,</b> cusped windows (katōmado), earthen floors and paneled doors. Wood structures are relatively light, design light and orderly. All buildings are erected on stone podia and have either stone or earthen floors.|$|R
5000|$|The Market Hall, {{housing the}} town's general market, was {{constructed}} in 1975 {{at a cost of}} approximately £300,000. According to a contemporary publication, [...] "the construction of the twin hyperbolic paraboloid <b>main</b> <b>roofs</b> is unique". Situated next to the railway line, close {{to the site of the}} original station, it has been suggested that the Market Hall would make an ideal modern station should the railway be re-opened to passenger services.|$|R

25|$|On {{the roof}} of the tower is a caretaker's flat, {{accessed}} via a narrow concrete stair. It is a modest, timber-framed, three-bedroomed apartment, concealed behind the tower parapet and sheltered under the <b>main</b> <b>roof.</b> It has pale yellow facebrick walls and aluminium-framed windows with original hardware (sliding and double-hung sashes). The front door addresses a generous, north-facing, roofed patio area, paved with square concrete pavers. The layout of the flat is original; however, all ceiling linings have been removed. The kitchen, bathroom, and laundry fitouts are early and it retains early electric monitor boards used by the caretaker to supervise the building.|$|E
25|$|Today the {{institution}} serves approximately 30,000 {{students at the}} high school, bachelor's and graduate levels. In addition to the main campus in the city, there are nine others {{in other parts of}} Guanajuato state. The university hosts a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino, with its famous stairway acting as seating. The best known facility of {{the institution}} was the main building in Guanajuato city, which was built in Neoclassical style in green stone. It houses the Dean's office, administrative offices and a number of the institution's departments. The main building is recognized by its long staircase with 113 steps, which empties onto the Callejon del Estudiante. Under the <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> is a 16th-century chapel which was sponsored by Vasco de Quiroga, for indigenous mine workers called the Templo de los Hospitales (Temple of the Hospitals). It was also the place that received the image of the Virgin of the Rosary, now called the Nuestra Señora de Guanajuato.|$|E
25|$|Joglo roof is {{the most}} {{characteristically}} Javanese roof form and the most complex. Joglo roof {{is associated with the}} residences of nobility, traditionally reserved for Javanese palace (kraton, official residence, government estate, and the house of Javanese aristocrats (ningrat). The <b>main</b> <b>roof</b> is much steeper and the four ridge greatly reduced in length. Joglo roof does not use king posts as does the limasan or kampung roof, rather the four innermost main house columns are sometimes taller than the outer ones. These four innermost house columns support a roof that is the steepest of all type of Javanese roof; almost forming a pyramid, except that it comes to two points rather than a single one. These four innermost main house columns is surmounted by a unique structural element known as tumpang sari. A tumpang sari is basically layered beams structure; the outermost band of beams support the rafters of both the upper and lower roofs, while the heavily-ornate inner band of beams create a vaulted ceiling {{in the form of an}} inverted stepped pyramid. The basic joglo-type houses can also be increased in size by adding extra columns and extending the roof area outwards.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} three-story six-by-three-bay frame structure on a stone foundation sided in clapboard. It has a rear wing, with a similar two-story wing of later construction to the north. Both have gabled roofs with similar treatments as the <b>main</b> <b>roof's</b> asphalt-shingled low hipped roof, topped with a cupola with three narrow round-arched windows and a similar hipped roof. The slope exposes the basement along the entire rear, providing for several entrances.|$|R

Its characteristics are earthen floors, subtly curved pent roofs (mokoshi) [...] and pronouncedly curved <b>main</b> <b>roofs,</b> [...] windows (katōmado) and paneled doors. Examples of this [...] style include the belfry at Tōdai-ji, the Founder's Hall at Eihō-ji and the Shariden at Engaku-ji.
