5000|$|In {{the years}} between 1964 and 1975, China built forty {{research}} ships, including the [...] "Practice" [...] (1965) with a displacement of 3,167 tonnes (3,117 long tons), and the [...] "Xiang Yang Hong 5" [...] (1972) (10,000 tonnes or 9.840 tons), which was China's first multipurpose research ship. After 1976, the situation for Chinese marine researchers improved and in 1984 Liu Zhengang from the national bureau for oceanography reported at a scientific Congress that at first research ships had been created by remodeling fishing boats, freighters or discarded ships of the navy. A typical ship had been the “Jinxing” during that time of 1969. In the 1970s, China had begun to build new ships such as the 10,000 t <b>multipurpose</b> <b>ship</b> [...] "Xiang Yang Hong 10". To cover the needed demands for oil discoveries, several geophysical ships had been built in China and in foreign countries. Since the development had continued, great importance had been attached to keep the ships on a well-equipped and technical level.|$|E

40|$|In {{noise mapping}} of urban areas main sources for {{nuisance}} and sleep disturbance are roads, railways, airports and industrial plants. However, when a noise analysis of port cities is carried out, also harbor activities {{are to be}} considered as significant contributors to the ‘soundscape’. Within the harbor, ships, when berthed at wharfs and possibly busy in loading or unloading operations, represent significant sources of noise. In these conditions, in fact, some of the ship’s plants are running and high airborne noise levels may be radiated. Ships are not traditionally characterized as noise sources and their dimensions and complexity pose a challenge for {{the description of the}} acoustical field in urban areas around the port. The work presents a hybrid experimental–computational approach for the acoustical characterization of ships applied to a test case represented by a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>ship.</b> For the same ship, the propagation field is studied numerically to include an urban area around the port. The same experimental campaign is also used to introduce a new measurement procedure for an effective characterization of the ship source...|$|E
40|$|Airborne noise {{emissions}} from ships {{can be a}} significant source of annoyance. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict ship noise in order to get an effective environmental noise control in planning new ports, or in widening existing harbor, or in locating new mooring positions. To test the reliability of current commercial simulators in predicting the noise field from complex sources such as ships, in the present work the airborne noise propagation from two different vessels was modelled: a <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Ship</b> and a Fishing Research Vessel. The development of the model for both ships was performed in five steps: acquisition of the input data; modelling of the ship in the sound propagation software; definition of the noise sources; model validation; output data generation. Simulated data were then compared with on field measurements. The obtained results rise some questions about the measurement techniques adopted to characterize the source levels and the validation data, the simplifications made on the ship surface and the typologies of sources utilized in the study. Future developments in numerical simulators are needed in order to better describe outdoor noise propagation from ships, taking into account the specific nature and complexity of such source...|$|E

25|$|Ships in Eve Online come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, mobile ships {{good for}} {{disruption}} and harassment) and destroyers (slightly {{larger and more}} offensively oriented than frigates). Medium starships include cruisers (<b>multipurpose</b> <b>ships</b> with many possible roles) and battlecruisers (heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers). Battleships (heavily armed and armoured dedicated combat ships) make up the large size class. Extra-large (or capital-class) starships include carriers (mobile bases that can launch fighters and are adept at repairing other ships), dreadnoughts (dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships).|$|R

The Kidds were designed as more advanced <b>multipurpose</b> <b>ships,</b> in contrast to their predecessors focus on anti-submarine warfare, adding considerably enhanced anti-aircraft capabilities. Originally ordered for the former Imperial Iranian Navy, the contracts were canceled when the 1979 Iranian Revolution began, and the ships were completed for the U.S. Navy. Because they were equipped with heavy-duty air conditioning and other features that made them suitable in hot climates, they tended {{to be used in}} the Middle East, specifically the Persian Gulf itself. In service with the U.S. Navy from the 1980s to the late 1990s, they were decommissioned and sold to Taiwan as the Kee Lung-class.|$|R
40|$|Containerization {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} how general cargo is transported around the world. Since the 50 ’s the container vessel fleet has increasing {{while the number of}} general cargo vessels, which used to dominate general cargo transportation has been decreased and changed towards multipurpose shipping. Project cargo is one of the cargoes which are carried by these multipurpose ships. As the general cargo vessels as such have lost their status as biggest market segment, they have also lost their share of public interest. That can be seen in market reviews which are more concentrating on containers and bulk shipping. This study investigates if AIS data can be used to determine project cargo flows which are transported by project carriers which are a special type of <b>multipurpose</b> <b>ship.</b> Furthermore the study tries to determine the current project cargo flows. Unlike traditional market research, this study uses vessels movement history to track the routes where project carriers operate. The primary data for the study is collected from the AIS data which is expanded with secondary data which is collected from market reviews and analyses together with port statistics. These sources set up triangular data base where the result is correct when all three data are in line. Altogether 120 vessels’ movement history from one year period was extracted from the AIS data and the following results were noticed: main routes, main ports and time ships spend in port. The network for project cargo was found to be very wide and the routes of the network were mostly used only once. The network contained a total of 2653 different routes where the route to and from China to Australia was found to be most used. The biggest port lists followed the same pattern as in the secondary data. Overall the results from AIS data were found to be in line with the secondary data...|$|E
