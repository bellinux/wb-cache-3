25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E

She thought he was honest and full of love for her. But {{as soon as they}} start a family she realizes that {{something}} is missing in their relationship, that he's never really there. It also shows that lives that seem perfect on paper <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> perfect in reality." [...] Actress Audrey Giacomini portrays Jeanne at fifteen.|$|E
500|$|Computer {{simulations}} [...] {{have also}} suggested a more rapid and earlier formation for the scattered disc. Modern theories indicate that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in situ beyond Saturn, as too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets, and Saturn, may have formed closer to Jupiter, but were flung outwards {{during the early}} evolution of the Solar System, perhaps through exchanges of angular momentum with scattered objects. Once the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn shifted to a 2:1 resonance (two Jupiter orbits for each orbit of Saturn), their combined gravitational pull disrupted the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, sending Neptune into the temporary [...] "chaos" [...] of the proto-Kuiper belt. As Neptune traveled outward, it scattered many trans-Neptunian objects into higher and more eccentric orbits. This model states that 90% {{or more of the}} objects in the scattered disc may have been [...] "promoted into these eccentric orbits by Neptune's resonances during the migration epoch... the scattered disc <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> scattered." ...|$|E

500|$|TV Guide {{reviewer}} Maitland McDonagh gave The Decay of Fiction {{nearly full}} marks (3.5 stars out of 4), {{saying that the}} result of the film was [...] "hypnotic". Time Out Londons film reviewer considered the film to be [...] "all very elegant, teasing and occasionally haunting, but it does wear a little thin at times." [...] J. Hoberman wrote in his 2012 book Film After Film: (Or, What Became of 21st Century Cinema?) that O'Neill [...] "spectrally populated the abandoned Ambassador Hotel" [...] with his film. Doug Harvey of LA Weekly called the film [...] "his most accomplished hybrid to date, superimposing intricately choreographed actors going through vague but archetypal film noir routines on top of gorgeous full-color time-lapse footage of the entropy-shredded Ambassador Hotel". Stephen Holden of The New York Times found the film to be an entertaining [...] "luminous Hollywood ghost story", and offered that if more experimental films were as entertaining, [...] "the notion of a thriving avant-garde cinema <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> intimidating to the moviegoing public." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reported}} that the Valentine's Day theme in the episode [...] "was exactly {{what you would expect}} from a series that thrives on uncomfortable romantic situations." [...] He added {{that there was a lot}} to enjoy from [...] "St. Valentine's Day," [...] opining that it was a [...] "very funny episode" [...] and that it had [...] "plenty of get moments and memorable lines to make the weak endings a minor factor." [...] Canning rated the episode an 8.4 out of 10. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the episode was [...] "structurally and tonally", but disliked the way the show featured Jon Hamm, as he believed the show was not giving him enough to do besides being [...] "handsome." [...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo". As with Sepinwall, Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune hoped the show would use Hamm [...] "better" [...] than demonstrated in his first two appearances. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D. Thompson for The Palm Beach Post was complimentary about the episode's theme, and praised 30 Rock for displaying [...] "one of the best" [...] episodes he has ever seen. Jeremy Median of Paste praised the episodes [...] "Generalissimo" [...] and [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show is just too lightning-quick for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regina later {{arrives with}} a locator spell {{to make their}} {{tracking}} of Emma easier. However, after Henry mentioned that Emma drove off, Hook suspects that Emma went to see Gold, so he sneaks off and makes {{a phone call to}} warn Emma about Gold's deception. Meanwhile, David and Mary Margret decide that it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> bad if Emma got rid of her magic and became [...] "normal," [...] which causes Elsa, who overhead their conversation, to sneak out of the room with the locator potion to try to find Emma on her own. Hook isn't the only one to suspect Gold, as Ingrid soon discovers Gold's plot after he visits her. It turns out that he needs Emma's power, which means that in order to do that, he has betrayed Ingrid by preventing her from taking Emma. When Ingrid tries to stop Gold, he uses a spell that he collected from remnants of the urn, creating a force field to prevent Ingrid from warning Emma or interfering in the events to come. As Ingrid sees Emma traveling to the mansion, Ingrid uses her mirror to send an illusion of her to stop Emma. When Emma sees the sudden appearance of Ingrid's figure {{in the middle of the}} road, her car spins out of control and crashes, causing Emma to temporarily lose consciousness.|$|E
