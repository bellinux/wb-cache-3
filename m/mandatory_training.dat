25|$|In {{addition}} to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control, {{while attempting to}} switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined there were other key factors {{that led to the}} accident.

500|$|Also on Patton's {{agenda was}} a reformation of Kentucky's {{juvenile}} justice system. Under Brereton Jones, {{because of its}} system of housing and treating juvenile offenders, Kentucky {{had been one of}} only two states unable to qualify for federal grants. Among the problems cited by the Department of Justice were abuse of juveniles by state employees, and failure to hold juvenile and adult offenders separately from each other. Governor Jones entered into a consent decree to ameliorate the situation, but his term expired before he could meaningfully address the terms of the decree. Patton went beyond the terms of the [...] decree by implementing <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> for state employees who dealt with juvenile offenders, and by setting up a hotline for juveniles to report abuse anonymously. He shifted the responsibility for housing juveniles from local communities to the state, constructing nine new juvenile detention centers. In January 2001, Attorney General Janet Reno proclaimed Kentucky's juvenile justice system a model for the nation.|$|E

In November and December 1941, the battalion received three large drafts of conscripts [...] consisting of several hundred individuals [...] who were attached to the battalion to receive three months of compulsory full-time training as war loomed in the Pacific. Many of the conscripts received at this time were university students and most had no previous military experience, although some had served as volunteers in the Militia prior to their call up. Initially, these personnel were formed into separate training companies, receiving three months of continuous training at Chermside, with the university students completing a shorter period of just 6070 days, to fit in with their semester break. Later, in February 1942, once they had completed their period of <b>mandatory</b> <b>training,</b> the conscripts were either released from service, or moved into the battalion's four rifle companies where they served alongside volunteers on full-time service.|$|E
500|$|In {{a report}} dated 16 September 2010 the coroner ruled Kumaritashvili's death an {{accident}} {{brought on by}} a [...] "convergence of several factors", including the high speed of the track, its technical difficulty, and the athlete's relative unfamiliarity with the track. He wrote that during Kumaritashvili's training runs, it was {{reasonable to assume that}} [...] "Mr.Kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life, and was attempting to go even faster, while simultaneously struggling to learn the intricacies of the track and the dynamics it created". The coroner accepted that luging would always carry an element of risk and that best practices known at the time had been followed {{in the construction of the}} Whistler track. He also called upon the International Luge Federation to require athletes to engage in more <b>mandatory</b> <b>training</b> sessions prior to the Olympic Games and other major competitions. Responding to the report, Kumaritashvili's father said: [...] "I don't accept the statement about Nodar's lack of experience.

2500|$|Though vaginal {{birth is}} {{possible}} for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth.

Typically, a Waffen-SS member reaching the rank of Rottenführer could choose either to embark on the career path of an SS-non-commissioned officer or could apply to join the officer corps of the Waffen-SS. If choosing the latter, he was required to obtain a written recommendation from their commander and undergo a racial and political screening process to determine eligibility for commission as an SS officer. If accepted into the SS officer program, an SS member would be assigned to the SS-Junkerschule and would be appointed to the rank of SS-Junker upon arrival. Situations did exist, however, where SS members would hold their previous enlisted rank while at the SS-Junkerschule and only be appointed to the rank of SS-Junker after a probationary period had passed.
