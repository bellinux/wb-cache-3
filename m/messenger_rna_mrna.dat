5|$|Gene {{expression}} first involves transcription, {{in which}} DNA {{is used as}} a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA),</b> which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.|$|E
5|$|<b>Messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> is RNA {{that has}} a coding region {{that acts as a}} {{template}} for protein synthesis (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the untranslated regions, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> is the RNA {{that carries}} {{information}} from DNA to the ribosome, {{the sites of}} protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes).|$|E
5000|$|... microRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} (~21nt) non-coding RNAs that repress {{translation}} of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{involved in a}} large, diverse set of biological processes. [...] They directly base-pair to target <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs),</b> and can trigger cleavage of the mRNA depending {{on the degree of}} complementarity.|$|R
50|$|Adenylate-uridylate-rich {{elements}} (AU-rich elements; AREs) {{are found}} in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of many <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> that code for proto-oncogenes, nuclear transcription factors, and cytokines. AREs {{are one of the most}} common determinants of RNA stability in mammalian cells.|$|R
40|$|Localization of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> {{enables the}} precise {{regulation}} of protein expression {{in space and}} time. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Lee et al. (2013) report that the RNA-binding protein Whi 3 spatially constrains a cyclin-encoding mRNA in the cytoplasm of multinucleate cells, thus allowing independent cell-cycle control of individual nuclei...|$|R
5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA. The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop {{the growth and}} reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> into proteins in the ribosome. Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, linezolid appears {{to work on the}} first step of {{protein synthesis}}, initiation, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit elongation.|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA).</b> Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E

ALK-containing granules (AGs) move on microtubules. Through their ability to scan the cytoplasm and capture mRNAs, AGs may be potent actors of cell transformation...|$|R
50|$|The cell's ribosomal protein L40 (rpL40), {{a part of}} {{the large}} 60S subunit. rpL40 is used by certain RNA viruses to {{translate}} <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> into proteins while few host mRNAs require rpL40. Hence targeting this protein may provide a means to combat viral infections with minimum side effects to the host.|$|R
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where {{information}} in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA).</b> These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where {{it is used to}} make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the most prevalent and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA),</b> microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible to the toxins.|$|E
50|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> often contain {{regulatory}} sequences {{that can}} cause post-transcriptional RNA silencing. Such 3'-UTRs often contain binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs). By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript.|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} that RNA {{can be readily}} classified into either protein-coding or non-protein-coding categories has pervaded biology for close to 50 years. Until recently, discrimination between these two categories was relatively straightforward: most transcripts were clearly identifiable as protein-coding <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs),</b> and readily distinguished from teh small number of well-characterized non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as transfer, ribosomal, and spliceosomal RNAs...|$|R
5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises the toxin. In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> that encodes the toxin is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin. A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA).</b> Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{progenitor}} cell (MPC) activity is exercise responsive. Post resistance-exercise alterations in myogenic <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> found by us and others may initiate these events. However, these mRNA {{data in the}} absence of microscopic MPC activity data have limited this interpretation. Alternatively, with our acute exercise data as our basis, we propose that these genes may control other hypertrophic processes in postmitotic fibers...|$|R
25|$|Protein coding {{genes are}} {{transcribed}} into <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> that carry {{the information from}} DNA {{to the site of}} protein synthesis. Although mRNAs possess great diversity, they are not the most abundant RNA species made in the cell. The so-called non-coding RNAs account for the large majority of the transcriptional output of a cell. These non-coding RNAs perform a variety of important cellular functions.|$|R
40|$|Exosomes, {{shuttling}} from donor {{cells to}} recipient cells, are cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) with 30 – 100 nm {{in diameter and}} dish- or classic cup-shaped morphology. Exosomes transport bioactive cargo carrying selective proteins, lipids, DNA, <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs),</b> and small and large noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNA embedded in exosomes is termed as exosomal miRNA. Exosomal miRNAs regulate diverse biological processes in recipient cells...|$|R
5|$|Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA),</b> microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E
5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E

50|$|An oncomir (also oncomiR) is a microRNA (miRNA) that is {{associated}} with cancer. MicroRNAs are short RNA molecules about 22 nucleotides in length. Essentially, miRNAs specifically target certain <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>mRNAs)</b> to prevent them from coding for a specific protein. The dysregulation of certain microRNAs (oncomirs) has been associated with specific cancer forming (oncogenic) events. Many different oncomirs have been identified in numerous types of human cancers.|$|R

5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the turn-over of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA)</b> molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>mRNA).</b> Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
