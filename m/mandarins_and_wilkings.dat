40|$|We review Synge's trick {{and present}} {{some of its}} {{applications}} to Riemannian Geometry. We use it to prove Frankel, Weinstein-Synge <b>and</b> <b>Wilking's</b> theorems, which concern manifolds of positive sectional curvature. First, we give the classical proofs of these theorems and then we present a reformulation of Synge's trick {{in terms of a}} lower bound for the index of a special kind of geodesics...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the reported strengths, eco-certification has earned significant criticism when applied to extensive shrimp value chains. Ha et al. (2013) found that although a suitable model for mixed shrimp–mangrove systems, organic certification might not be sustainable when the farmers producing the products do not benefit from the respective value chains. High transaction costs {{for the establishment of}} a certification scheme have been identified as a major challenge when working with smallholders and consequently, eco-certification might marginalize small-holders from participation in export-oriented value chains (Tran et al. 2013; Marschke <b>and</b> <b>Wilkings</b> 2014).|$|R

[...] There are important dissimilarities between Standard <b>Mandarin</b> <b>and</b> Beijing dialect <b>Mandarin</b> even as Beijing Mandarin's phonology is held {{to be the same}} as Standard Mandarin's. 2 Both southern <b>and</b> <b>Mandarin</b> features of syntax were mixed into Standard Mandarin while northern Mandarin is the main basis of Beijing <b>Mandarin</b> <b>and</b> this sets the syntax of Standard <b>Mandarin</b> <b>and</b> Beijing <b>Mandarin</b> apart.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we give a new {{generalization}} of positive sectional curvature called positive weighted sectional curvature. It {{depends on a}} choice of Riemannian metric and a smooth vector field. We give several simple examples of Riemannian metrics which do not have positive sectional curvature but support a vector field that gives them positive weighted curvature. On the other hand, we generalize {{a number of the}} foundational results for compact manifolds with positive sectional curvature to positive weighted curvature. In particular, we prove generalizations of Weinstein's theorem, O'Neill's formula for submersions, Frankel's theorem, <b>and</b> <b>Wilking's</b> connectedness lemma. As applications of these results, we recover weighted versions of topological classification results of Grove-Searle and Wilking for manifolds of high symmetry rank and positive curvature...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the production of five <b>Mandarin</b> <b>and</b> English sibilant fricatives by heritage speakers of Mandarin in comparison to native speakers and late learners. Almost all speakers were found to distinguish the <b>Mandarin</b> retroflex <b>and</b> alveolo-palatal, {{as well as the}} <b>Mandarin</b> alveolo-palatal <b>and</b> English palato-alveolar. However, fewer distinguished the <b>Mandarin</b> retroflex <b>and</b> English palato-alveolar or the <b>Mandarin</b> <b>and</b> English alveolars, with the majority of heritage speakers falling into this group of "distinguishers" in both cases. These results indicate that heritage speakers, in addition to most late learners, do not have much trouble with the <b>Mandarin</b> post-alveolar contrast, <b>and</b> furthermore, that while native speakers and late learners of Mandarin tend to merge similar <b>Mandarin</b> <b>and</b> English sounds, heritage speakers tend to keep them apart. Thus, of the three groups heritage speakers appear to be the best at maintaining contrast between categories both within and across languages...|$|R
