In this study, a global examination of the different constraints in coastal engineering was performed and an optimization problem was defined. The problem has multiple objectives, and the criteria to be minimized are the structure cost and wave height disturbance inside a harbour. As concluded in this survey, the constraints are predefined parameters, <b>mandatory</b> constraints <b>or</b> <b>optional</b> constraints. All of these constraints are categorized into four categories: environmental, fluid mechanical, structural and manoeuvring...|$|R

30|$|With the {{performed}} experiment {{we observed}} which characteristics of each use case template structure {{impact on the}} SPL use cases’ comprehensibility. Subjects who selected the Step Identifier structure as the best structure, for example, reported {{that it has a}} simple description and an objective, clean, organized, and compact structure.

40|$|To {{establish}} {{guidelines for}} the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of BPH. A search of published work was conducted using Medline. In combination with expert opinions recommendations were made on the usefulness of tests for assessment and follow-up: <b>mandatory,</b> recommended, <b>or</b> <b>optional.</b> In addition, indications and outcomes for the different therapeutic options were reviewed. A digital rectal examination is mandatory in the assessment for the diagnosis of BPH. Recommended tests are the International Prostate Symptom Score, creatinine measurement (or renal ultrasound), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume. All other tests are optional. The aim of treatment is to improve patients' quality of life, and {{it depends on the}} severity of the symptoms of BPH. The watchful waiting policy is recommended for patients with mild symptoms, medical treatment for patients with mild-moderate symptoms, and surgery for patients who failed medication or conservative management and who have moderate-severe symptoms, and/or complications of BPH which require surgery. Regarding non-surgical treatments, transurethral microwave thermotherapy is the most attractive option. These treatments should be reserved for patients who prefer to avoid surgery or who no longer respond favourably to medication. Finally, recommendations for follow-up tests and a recommended follow-up time schedule after BPH treatment are provided. Recommendations for assessment, possible therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with BPH are mad...|$|R
40|$|The American {{tradition}} of sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution have provided certain legal protection to government personnel, including leaders of public elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions, {{but the concept}} of governmental immunity {{may be difficult to}} understand as it applies to educators. Generally, governmental immunity has protected educators in four areas: discretionary <b>or</b> judicial function, <b>mandatory</b> function, passive misconduct, and when state interests outweighed individual rights. On the other hand, courts also have held public educators liable in cases that involved: private function (proprietary), ministerial function (<b>mandatory</b> acts), <b>optional</b> <b>or</b> permissible function, creation or maintenance of nuisance resulting in injury or death, active, positive or willful and intentional wrong, judicial waiver, legislative waiver, judicia...|$|R
50|$|A bar {{association}} {{is a professional}} body of lawyers. Some {{bar association}}s {{are responsible for the}} regulation of the legal profession in their jurisdiction; others are professional organizations dedicated to serving their members; in many cases, they are both. In many Commonwealth jurisdictions, the bar association comprises lawyers who are qualified as barristers or advocates in particular, versus solicitors (see bar council). Membership in bar associations may be <b>mandatory</b> <b>or</b> <b>optional</b> for practicing attorneys, depending on jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Many {{countries}} {{have a national}} EMD or DLS program, sometimes with a designated system provider, either <b>mandatory</b> <b>or</b> <b>optional.</b> Others may have a national curriculum or accreditation program, or the program may be designated by local jurisdictions at the state or province level. Not all jurisdictions have any sanctioned EMD or DLS system in place, and not all emergency call centers have EMD or DLS. There is some controversy over using these systems, especially when non-medical staff man the phones.|$|E
50|$|Recounts can be <b>{{mandatory}}</b> <b>or</b> <b>optional.</b> In some jurisdictions, recounts are {{mandatory in}} the event {{the difference between the}} top two candidates is less than a percentage of votes cast or of a fixed number. Mandatory recounts {{are paid for by the}} elections official, or the state. Mandatory recounts can usually be waived by the apparent losing candidate. The winning side will usually encourage the loser to waive the recount in a show of unity and to avoid spending taxpayer money.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{behavioural}} and neuroscience {{studies have}} shown that the systems involved in the control of attention and action are functionally and anatomically linked. We used behavioural and event-related brain potential measures to investigate whether such links are <b>mandatory</b> <b>or</b> merely <b>optional.</b> Cues presented at the start of each trial instructed participants to shift attention to the left or right side and to simultaneously prepare to a finger movement with their left or right hand. In different trials, cues were followed by a central Go signal, requiring execution of the prepared manual response (motor task), or by a peripheral visual stimulus, which required a target–non-target discrimination only when presented on the cued side (attention task). Lateralised ERP components indicative of covert attention shifts were found when attention and action were directed to the same side (same side condition), but not when attention and action were directed to opposite sides (opposite sides condition). Likewise, effects of spatial attention on the processing of peripheral visual stimuli were present only when attention and action were directed to the same side, but not in the opposite sides condition. These results demonstrate that preparing a manual response on one side severely disrupts the attentional selection of visual stimuli on the other side, and suggest that it is not possible to simultaneously direct attention and action to different locations in space. They support the hypothesis that the control of spatial attention and action are implemented by shared brain circuits, and are therefore linked in a mandatory fashio...|$|R

30|$|Besides the {{semantic}} types, input datapoints must be declared as either <b>mandatory,</b> <b>optional,</b> <b>or</b> inactive {{for a given}} operation mode. Mandatory inputs are essential for a proper functioning of the profile and must be bound with an interoperable output datapoint providing the desired information. For example, the input datapoints nv 1 (room luminance level) and nv 2 (occupancy state) in Figure 3 are mandatory for the constant light controller. Optional inputs on the contrary can be bound, but do not have to. They provide additional information, such as nv 3 (manual override from the user) or nv 4 (luminance setpoint adjustment). Inactive inputs must not be bound, {{because they are not}} regarded by the profile in the given operation mode. Output datapoints on the other hand are distinguished in active and inactive. Only active outputs provide values and are possible candidates for datapoint bindings. With that information, an automated function-block-oriented composition of building automation systems is feasible. Automated design algorithms know which operation mode of a functional profile needs to be selected for a desired functionality and which datapoints of neighbored profiles are to be bound for a proper functioning.|$|R

Some of these chips have coprocessors, such as the AppliedMicro Helix that also includes cores from the older 32-bit architecture (ARMv7). Some of the chips are SoCs and can combine both ARM Cortex-A53 and ARM Cortex-A57, such as the Samsung Exynos 7 Octa.|$|E
5000|$|As {{applicants}} to many PhD {{programs are not}} required to have master's degrees, many programs award a Master of Arts or Master of Science degree [...] "en route", [...] "in passing", or [...] "in course" [...] based on the graduate work done in the course of achieving the PhD students who receive such master's degrees are usually required to complete a certain amount of coursework and a master's thesis or field examination. Not all PhD programs require additional work to obtain a master's en route to the PhD (e.g., a master's thesis). Depending on the specific program, masters-in-passing degrees can be either <b>mandatory</b> <b>or</b> <b>optional.</b> Not all PhD students choose to complete the additional requirements necessary for the Master of Arts or the Master of Science if such requirements are not mandated by their programs. Those students will simply obtain the PhD degree {{at the end of their}} graduate study.|$|E

A feature is a distinguishing characteristic that aggregates value to applications (Bayer et al. 1999; Gomaa 2004; Jezequel 2012; Kang et al. 1990; Lee et al. 2002). Domain features are defined in feature models. Features may be <b>mandatory</b> <b>or</b> <b>optional,</b> have variations and require or exclude other features. The feature that represents the purpose of the domain is added to the root and a top-down approach is applied to add the other features.|$|E
