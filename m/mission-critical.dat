The role of shock waves was first analyzed by Holt Ashley.

25|$|This is a {{paradigm}} shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program. Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as classified connectivity, <b>mission-critical</b> service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. Videophones that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent. Desktop PCs and laptops {{as well as other}} network components are being continually upgraded in order to enhance performance and security.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{answering}} this question is to complete an installation analysis. The {{next step is to}} complete a commercial infrastructure analysis. USPACOM relied upon two different DoD organizations for CIP assessments: Balanced Survivability Assessments, or BSAs, and Mission Assurance Assessments. [...] The BSA is a two-week mission-focused assessment at a military installation or designated site. [...] A Mission Assurance Assessment is unique because it uses an area assessment approach to focus on both commercial and military asset vulnerabilities and dependencies. [...] The final step to determine vulnerabilities is to integrate the two analyses and assessments. [...] With its critical assets and their vulnerabilities identified, USPACOM is ready to perform risk management activities to decide {{what can be done to}} protect the <b>mission-critical</b> assets.|$|E

The handguards were also changed and the bipod removed. The SG 551 cannot be used with a bayonet or fire rifle grenades. The SG 551 comes in several specialized variants designed for use with security and special forces. Among those variants are the SG 551-1P police carbine (designed to engage point targets out to 300 m; equipped with a Hensoldt 6x42 BL telescopic sight and detachable cheek riser), the SG 551 SWAT carbine (coated with a corrosion-resistant finish and equipped with an optical sight mount used with {{a wide array of}} sights, and can also accept <b>mission-critical</b> accessories such as a bipod, laser pointer or tactical light) and the SG 551 LB carbine with an extended [...] barrel that enables the use of rifle grenades and a bayonet.|$|E
2500|$|As {{software}} and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words [...] "anomaly" [...] and [...] "discrepancy" [...] can be used, {{as being more}} neutral terms, to avoid the words [...] "error" [...] and [...] "defect" [...] or [...] "bug" [...] where {{there might be an}} implication that all so-called errors, defects or bugs must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an anomaly (or discrepancy) would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or <b>mission-critical</b> in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the [...] "cure would be worse than the disease"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a [...] "zero-defects" [...] mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero defects. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same [...] "bugs" [...] occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system.|$|E
2500|$|The default IEEE 754 {{exception}} handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, in 1996 the maiden {{flight of the}} Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion {{due in part to}} the Ada programming language {{exception handling}} policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow. In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct. According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5. The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that [...] "An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling <b>mission-critical</b> equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment." ...|$|E
