40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>robots</b> and robot {{applications}} {{are a key}} enabling technology to improve the competitiveness of the European manufacturing industry and the overall welfare of society. This study provides novel empirical evidence that the positive stimulation provided by the further development and diffusion of <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> systems is a key enabler for exploiting the competitiveness and growth potentials of the European manufacturing industry. Based on extensive firm-level analyses of data from the European Manufacturing Survey 2009, it is shown {{that the use of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> does not have any – neither negative nor positive – direct effect on firm-level employment. Hence, the often referred to picture of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> as “job killers” in the public discussion cannot be approved on behalf of this study. Instead, companies using <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> obtain significantly higher levels of productivity in their manufacturing processes. Likewise, firms with a higher vertical range of manufacturing, which can also be realised by using <b>industrial</b> <b>robots,</b> also show a better productivity performance. The potential of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> to maintain <b>industrial</b> production in the EU is also reflected in the finding, that companies using <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> in their manufacturing and production are less likely to relocate production outside Europe. The study concludes by identifying key aspects that should be taken into account when designing and implementing ongoing and future EU policies in the field of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots.</b> These mainly concern the barrier of investment costs, especially for small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) and the specific challenges faced by SMEs when trying to exploit the benefits of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> in manufacturing and assembly...|$|R

50|$|Programming errors {{represent}} a serious safety consideration, particularly in large <b>industrial</b> <b>robots.</b> The power {{and size of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> mean {{they are capable of}} inflicting severe injury if programmed incorrectly or used in an unsafe manner. Due to the mass and high-speeds of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots,</b> it is always unsafe for a human to remain in the work area of the robot during automatic operation. The system can begin motion at unexpected times and a human will be unable to react quickly enough in many situations, even if prepared to do so. Thus, even if the software is free of programming errors, great care must be taken to make an <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> safe for human workers or human interaction, such as loading or unloading parts, clearing a part jam, or performing maintenance. The ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999 American National Standard for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Robots</b> and Robot Systems - Safety Requirements (revision of ANSI/RIA R15.06-1992) book from the Robotic Industries Association is the accepted standard on robot safety. This includes guidelines for both the design of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots,</b> and the implementation or integration and use of <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> on the factory floor.

40|$|Involving an <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> {{in a close}} {{physical}} interaction with the worker became quite possible, {{as a result of}} the availability of different collaborative <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> in the market. The physical cooperation between the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> and the worker usually done under the umbrella of the flexible manufacturing paradigm, where both the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> and the worker need to change their tasks fast and efficiently, to cope with the changes in the manufacturing process. This means that a reliable manufacturing control system must stand behind this {{physical interaction}} to achieve the proper communication interaction. A holonic control architecture is an ideal solution for this problem. Therefore, during this research we study the most commonly applied model of the holonic control architecture, then we apply this architecture on our case study, where one worker cooperates with a dual-arm <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> to build and produce any new product.

The usual trend of using an <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> in a typical factory is to isolate it from the workers during the operation, due to the safety regulations.

Therefore, during this research we propose and implement a holonic control system architecture which connects the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> with the worker together in the same work environment in a flexible cooperative scenario.
