5|$|The legions, {{which had}} been a mix of life {{professionals}} and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of the cohort army remained <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in the late Republic, although around the 1st centuryAD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size {{to a total of}} 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of the legions remained <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.1AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.|$|E

A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork.
