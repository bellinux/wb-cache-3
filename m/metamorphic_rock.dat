5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E

40|$|The Sangun <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Maniwa Group {{are well}} {{developed}} in the Tsuboi district, Okayama Prefecture. These <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> consist mainly of psammitic and pelitic sedimentary rocks and lavas and pyroclastics of basic to acidic compositions that recrystallized during the Sangun low-grade regional metamorphism. The <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> in this district underwent to a considerable extent a mineralogical and textural transformation, but still preserve in parts their original, mineralogical and textural features. Unaltered, relict clinopyroxenes and hornblendes are commonly observed in the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> derived from basic lavas and intermediate pyroclastics.

40|$|Large {{blocks of}} <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> with mafic to ultramafic {{compositions}} {{were discovered in}} felsic gneiss at {{the central part of}} northern Howard Hills in Enderby Land. The ultramafic core is separated from the felsic gneiss by a mantle of pyroxene granulite. We can recognize from mineral assemblages and chemical compositions that the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> experienced ultrahigh temperature (UHT) metamorphism. Rubidium-strontium and samarium neodymium analytical data from the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> yield apparent ages of about 2. 65 Ga within analytical error on isochron diagrams. <b>Metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> with mafic to ultramafic compositions are enriched in incompatible elements and have high Sr isotope ratios, resulting in some samples in improbable Nd model ages. This is attributed to enrichment of compatible elements and/or depletion of incompatible elements during metamorphism. We conclude that these <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> experienced partial melting during UHT metamorphism. Pyroxene granulite was produced as a residual material after partial melting of LILE-enriched protoliths with high Sr isotope ratios...|$|R

5|$|The {{different}} parts of Van Cortlandt Park have a varied geology. The Northwest Woods and Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway have a steep terrain dotted with Fordham gneiss, a <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> that {{is very hard to}} weather. The Tibbetts Brook valley is set in Inwood marble, which weathers more easily.

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while all {{construction}} was stayed, Reclamation conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the dam site, even though these delays caused {{the cost of the}} project to rise with every passing year. The studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn Dam site, with many folds of <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> formed by the contact of the foothill rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada. Reclamation predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey projected a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, Reclamation redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch gravity dam, to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.|$|E
40|$|The summer {{party of}} the 29 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 29, 1987 - 1988) {{performed}} a brief geological survey at Mt. Riiser-Larsen in Enderby Land, East Antarctica. The Mt. Riiser-Larsen area is underlain by various kinds of granulite-facies <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Archean Napier Complex with minor mafic dike <b>rocks.</b> <b>Metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> are composed mainly of felsic gneiss with subordinate pyroxene granulite, pelitic gneiss and quartzite. Magnetite-rich rock (metaironstone) and pyroxenite crop out sporadically. <b>Metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> show a well-layered sequence due to the difference of lithologies, indicating {{that most of the}} <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> were derived from sedimentary rocks. By and large, layering of the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> trends E-W to NE-SW, and dips south homoclinally. The felsic gneiss is locally lineated, due to the preferred orientation of elongated quartz and feldspar grains. These lineations dip south gently. Two types of mesoscopic folds, and earlier isoclinal fold and a later open fold, are found. Mafic dikes, which include basalt and dolerite, discordantly intrude the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> throughout the area. All the mafic dikes are weakly metamor-phosed but igneous textures are well preserved, and the dikes are not folded. They were emplaced after the main stage of the granulite-facies Napier metamor-phism and folding. These mafic dikes can be regarded as members of the Amundsen Dikes...|$|R

The latter occupies the outer area, and consists mainly of actinolite. It is noteworthy that these <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> are utterly lacking schistosity.

5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock,</b> which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock,</b> the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

During the regional metamorphism (M 1), the main schistosity is define by preferred orientation of columnar and platy minerals, and quartz pools with lenticular shape was developed. platy minerals, and quartz pools with lenticular shape was developed. The older schistosities are also inferred with the obliquely arrayed mineral inclusions to the main schistosity in the garnet, epidote, and plagioclase porphyroblasts. Epidote porphyroblasts have often shown microboudin of which pull apart spaces filled with quartz, suggesting an extension subparallel to the main schistosity during a post highest metamorphic stage. Quartz grains show polygonal shapes with straight grain boundaries and seem free from the intracrystalline strain, indicating that the Biru <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> have experienced an annealing process in a contact metamorphism probably caused by intrusion of plutonic rocks during Miocene (M 2). Numerous brittle faults occur along WWF in the Biru area.
