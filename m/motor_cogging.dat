40|$|Abstract—For the {{calculation}} of torque in brushless (BL) alternating current motors a local method is proposed, based on the Maxwell stress theory and the filtered contributions due to the harmonics of the magnetic vector potential in the motor air gap. By considering the space fundamental field only, the method can efficiently estimate the average synchronous torque for a variety or motor topologies, including concentrated winding designs. For BL direct current motor analysis a global method is introduced, based on the virtual work principle {{expressed in terms of}} energy components in various motor regions. The method leads to simplifications in the average torque calculation and enables the direct identification of the cogging and ripple components. The mathematical procedures have been validated against experiments and other numerical techniques.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{tooth shape}} {{optimization}} method for cogging torque reduction in Permanent Magnet (PM) motors is developed {{by using the}} Reduced Basis Technique (RBT) coupled by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Design of Experiments (DOE) methods. The primary objective of the method {{is to reduce the}} enormous number of design variables required to define the tooth shape. RBT is a weighted combination of several basis shapes. The aim of the method is to find the best combination using the weights for each tooth shape as the design variables. A multi-level design process is developed to find suitable basis shapes or trial shapes at each level {{that can be used in}} the reduced basis technique. Each level is treated as a separated optimization problem until the required objective – minimum cogging torque – is achieved. The process is started with geometrically simple basis shapes that are defined by their shape co-ordinates. The experimental design of Taguchi method is used to build the approximation model and to perform optimization. This method is demonstrated on the tooth shape optimization of a 8 -poles/ 12 -slots PM motor. Keywords—PM <b>motor,</b> <b>cogging</b> torque, tooth shape optimization...|$|E
40|$|The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) {{needs to}} {{maintain}} precise {{positioning of the}} optical elements to deliver unprecedented image quality. Any vibration from observatory sources must therefore be minimized; model-based analysis leads to maximum allowable forces from any individual source typically of order a Newton or less in the most sensitive frequency band. Careful attention throughout the design process is needed to ensure that these challenging requirements are satisfied. We focus here in particular on cogging forces from the azimuth motor drive. Each motor yields periodic tangential and vertical forces of order 100 's of Newtons, with higher harmonics of the waveform potentially exciting telescope structural resonances. There are 56 drive motors, and appropriate phasing between them can ideally cancel most of the net torque or net vertical force. However, the moment created between non-collocated forces still produces image motion even if the net force cancels, and further, small errors in forcer positioning result in imperfect cancellation. We provide a general methodology for estimating total cogging forces and then present {{an example of the}} expected TMT performance impact from <b>motor</b> <b>cogging</b> placed in context with the larger challenge of demanding vibration requirement...|$|E

This system is under consideration as the driving system for the two main axes of the Thirty Meter Telescope that will be built in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The main objective of this work is the quantification {{of the effects of}} the curvilinear track on the <b>motors</b> <b>cogging</b> force. The {{finite element analysis}} is carried out using planar cross sections, and the results found are used to find an approximate solution for the three-dimensional model. The results show that the presence of the curvilinear-configured track significantly increases the cogging force of a single motor, while the presence of several motors interacts in limiting the increase in the cogging force. Finally, in order to reduce the total cogging force, an optimization in regards to the relative positions of the motors along the tracks is carried out. 9 2011 IEEE.

The relationship between implicit learning and executive functions is still debated due to the overlapping fronto-striatal networks. According to the framework of competitive neurocognitive networks, dis - rupting specific frontal lobe functions, such as executive functions, increases performance on implicit learning tasks. The aim of our {{study was to explore}} the nature of such a relationship by investigating the effect of long-term regular alcohol intake on implicit sequence learning. Since alco - hol dependency impairs executive functions, we expected intact or even better implicit learning in patient group com - pared to the healthy controls based on the competitive rela - tionship between these neurocognitive networks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the long-term effects of alcohol dependency both on implicit learning and on executive functions requiring different but partly over - lapping neurocognitive networks. Here, we show weaker executive functions but intact implicit learning in the alco - hol-dependent group compared to the controls. Moreover, we found negative correlation between these functions in both groups. Our results confirm the competitive rela - tionship between the fronto-striatal networks underlying implicit sequence learning and executive functions and sug - gest that the functional integrity of this relationship is unal - tered in the alcohol-dependent group despite the weaker frontal lobe functions...|$|R

A specific case was the Swiss [...] "Lenco" [...] drive, which possessed a very heavy turntable coupled via an idler wheel to a long, tapered motor drive shaft. This enabled stepless rotation or speed control on the drive. Because of this feature the Lenco became popular in the late 1950s with dancing schools, because the dancing instructor could lead the dancing exercises at different speeds.|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of a space qualified, 7 degrees of freedom, haptic arm exoskeleton a brushless DC motor with high torque production, power density and efficiency was selected. However, the attraction of the rotor magnets to the stator teeth introduces an additive, position dependent, torque disturbance on the <b>motor</b> shaft called <b>cogging</b> torque. In haptic applications this disturbance impacts the realism of the force reflection and limits control fidelity during master-slave teleoperation. This thesis investigates possible solutions within the constraints of the envisioned application. Due to volume, torque production and efficiency requirements the chosen motor is not to be changed. This rules out the use of <b>motor</b> design based <b>cogging</b> minimization techniques. For this reason only control-based methods are considered. Two methods to identify the cogging waveform were developed. This data was used to do feed-forward compensation using a lookup-table approach and a Fourier series approximation. For comparison, a PID feedback compensation and hybrid approach were also tested. Identification of the cogging torque and testing of compensation methods is done using a custom build measurement setup. A reduction of the RMS cogging of 39 % was achieved using the feed-forward approach, while the PID feedback loop resulted in a 46 % reduction. A combination of these two methods in the hybrid approach resulted in a reduction of 75 %. Thesis done as part of a 'double degree' with Systems & Control at 3 mE (DCSC) and Embedded Systems at EWI.

40|$|Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) motor {{has been}} widely used {{in a range of}} {{industrial}} application due to high power density and good flux-weakening capability. In many of the applications, the high strength of permanent magnets causes the undesirable effects of high cogging torque that can aggravate performance of the <b>motor.</b> Large <b>cogging</b> torque is significantly produced by IPM motor due to the similar length and the effectiveness of the magnetic air-gap. Therefore, the reduction of cogging torque becomes an inreasingly vital subject in IPM motor. In this paper, to minimize the effect of cogging torque in IPM motor, four common techniques for cogging torque reduction such as skewing, notching, pole pairing and rotor axial pole pairing has been analyzed in order to compare the cogging torque effect. 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) by JMAG software is carried out for each technique.

The Causal Ordering Graph representation of models reveals the nature of the interactions between currents and fluxes. Also, the torque expression of synchronous motors is presented as a non-bijective relation. In order to establish nonspecific models, an analogy between rotary and linear synchronous motor is presented. Afterwards, the specificities of linear motors are exposed.

More in detail, an IPMSM model (named IPMSM 1), which is derived from a commercial geometry, is analyzed by using a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. Then, four other IPMSM models, which are obtained by modifying the IPMSM 1 rotor structure and by maintaining the same stator configuration, are proposed and analyzed. From the obtained simulation results, the cogging torque components for each structure are determined and compared. From this comparison, a significant cogging torque decrease is occurring for the modified geometries, without affecting {{the values of the}} generated torque. Furthermore, a meaningful relationship between the peak values of the cogging torque and the gradients of the flux density around the neutral area is reported and discussed.

40|$|A spatial {{mismatch}} {{of up to}} 14 mm between optimal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) {{site and}} {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) signal has consistently been reported for the primary motor cortex. The underlying cause might be the effect of magnetic susceptibility around large draining veins in Gradient-Echo blood oxygenation level-dependent (GRE-BOLD) fMRI. We tested whether alternative fMRI sequences such as Spin-Echo (SE-BOLD) or Arterial Spin-Labeling (ASL) assessing cerebral blood flow (ASL-CBF) may localize neural activity closer to optimal TMS positions and primary motor cortex than GRE-BOLD. GRE-BOLD, SE-BOLD, and ASL-CBF signal changes during right thumb abductions were obtained from 15 healthy subjects at 3 Tesla. In 12 subjects, tissue at fMRI maxima was stimulated with neuronavigated TMS to compare motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Euclidean distances between the fMRI center-of-gravity (CoG) and the TMS <b>motor</b> mapping <b>CoG</b> were calculated. Highest SE-BOLD and ASL-CBF signal changes were located in the anterior wall of the central sulcus [Brodmann Area 4 (BA 4) ], whereas highest GRE-BOLD signal changes were significantly closer to the gyral surface. TMS at GRE-BOLD maxima resulted in higher MEPs which might be attributed to significantly higher electric field strengths. TMS-CoGs were significantly anterior to fMRI-CoGs but distances were not statistically different across sequences. Our findings imply that spatial differences between fMRI and TMS are unlikely to be caused by spatial unspecificity of GRE-BOLD fMRI but might be attributed to other factors, e. g., interactions between TMS-induced electric field and neural tissue. Differences between techniques should be kept in mind when using fMRI coordinates as TMS (intervention) targets. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cogging {{force is}} an {{important}} source of disturbances for linear-motor-driven systems. To obtain a higher level of contouring motion control performance for multi-axes mechanical systems subject to significant nonlinear cogging forces, both the coordinated control of multi-axes motions and the effective compensation of cogging forces are necessary. In addition, the effect of unavoidable velocity measurement noises needs to be sufficiently attenuated. This paper presents a discontinuous projection based desired compensation adaptive robust contouring controller to address these control issues all at once. Specifically, the presented approach explicitly takes into account the specific characteristics of cogging forces in the controller designs and employs the task coordinate formulation for coordinated motion controls. Theoretically, the resulting controller achieves a guaranteed transient performance and stead-state contouring accuracy even in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. In addition, the controller also achieves asymptotic output tracking when there are parametric uncertainties only. Comparative experimental results obtained on a high-speed Anorad industrial biaxial precision gantry are presented to verify the excellent contouring performance of the proposed control scheme and the effectiveness of the cogging force compensations.

40|$|Linear motors, as {{direct-drive}} actuators, {{have been}} quickly developed within {{recent years and}} now they are widely applied in the industrial production area, such as automatic soldering, carving and embroidery machines, etc [1]. At present, linear permanent magnetic motors (LPMMs) are the mainstream of market due to their considerable force output performance with high power density and efficiency [2]. However, high cost of the permanent magnets (PMs) restricts the widespread use of LPMMs for certain control applications. On the other hand, the characteristics of the PMs are readily influenced by temperature variations and vibrations. Pure linear switched reluctance motors (LSRMs) intrigue the researchers' interests by their simple structure, high robustness, low cost without PMs, etc. Nevertheless, they have the disadvantages of low force output and efficiency. In order to increase the efficiency and force output of the LSRMs, some machines that are combined with PMs have been investigated in recent years [3, 4]. Most of the PMs are embedded into the main magnetic circuits of the motors, however, this inevitably increases the reluctance of the motors and deteriorates the continuity of flux lines, thus reducing the efficiency of the <b>motors.</b> In addition, <b>cogging</b> force is another defect that deteriorates the accuracy of position control applications based on such linear hybrid motors.

40|$|Abstract—Cogging {{effect is}} a serious {{disadvantage}} of the permanent magnetic synchronous <b>motor</b> (PMSM), and <b>cogging</b> force is a position-dependent periodic disturbance. In our previous work [1], a dual high-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (DHO-PALC) method for state-dependent periodic disturbance was presented, where the long term stability issue was not addressed. Due {{to the impact of}} the high frequency components, when applying the DHO-PALC for a long time, the tracking errors may grow, and the system may become even unstable eventually. This phenomenon also appears in many other practical motion control systems using ILC or RC strategies. In this paper, in order to achieve long term stability, we propose a dual high-order dynamic adaptive learning compensation (DHO-D-PALC) method for cogging effect. In this method, stored information of more than one previous periods are included for both the composite tracking error and the estimate of cogging force. Particularly, since we use a dynamic learning control law to update the current estimate of cogging, the long term stability can be guaranteed. Extensive simulation results are included to demonstration, 1) high-order in composite tracking error offers faster convergence, 2) high-order in cogging estimate better accommodates the case of varying reference signal, 3) dual high-order scheme has the potential of much better performance over the conventional first-order scheme, 4) the introduction of dynamic learning updating scheme helps achieving the long term stability of the adaptive learning controller.

Design and Setting: This was a prospective follow-up study in a neurological rehabilitation department of quaternary research hospital. Patients and Methods: Thirty patients with ABI, mean age 36. 43 years (standard deviation [SD] 12. 6, range 18 – 60), mean duration of illness 77. 87 days (SD 91. 78, range 21 – 300 days) with cognitive, physical, and motor-sensory deficits underwent inpatient rehabilitation for minimum of 14 sessions over a period of 3 weeks. Nineteen patients (63 %) reported in the follow-up of minimum 3 months after discharge. Type of ABI, cognitive status (using Montreal Cognitive assessment scale [MoCA] and cognitive Functional Independence Measure [Cog FIM]®), and functional status (motor FIM®) were noted at admission, discharge, and follow-up and scores were compared. Results: Patients received inpatient rehabilitation addressing cognitive and functional impairments.

40|$|Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have {{increased}} in popularity in recent years. The most common platform, the quadrotor, has surpassed other MAVs like traditional helicopters and ornithopters in popularity mainly due to their simplicity. Yet the quadrotor design is a century old and was intended to carry people. We set out to design a MAV that is designed specifically to be a MAV, i. e. a vehicle not intended to carry humans as a payload. With this constraint lifted the vehicle can continuously rotate, which would dizzy a human, can sustain larger forces, which would damage a human, or {{can take advantage of}} scaling properties, where it may not work at human scale. Furthermore, we aim for simplicity by removing vehicle controllers and reducing the number of actuators, such that the vehicle can be made cost effective, if not disposable. ^ We begin by studying general equations of motion for hovering MAVs. We search for vehicle configurations that exhibit passive stability, allowing the MAV to operate without a controller or actuators to apply control, ideally a single actuator. The analysis suggests two distinct types of passively stabilized MAVs and we create test vehicles for both. With simple hovering achieved, we concentrate on controlled motion with an emphasis on doing so without adding actuators. We find we can attain three degree of freedom control using separation of time scales with our actuator via low frequency for control in the vertical direction and high frequency for control in the horizontal plane. We explore techniques for achieving high frequency actuator control, which also allow the compensation of <b>motor</b> defects, specifically <b>cogging</b> torque. ^ We combine passive stability with the motion control into two vehicles, UNO and Piccolissimo.

40|$|Stepper motors {{are widely}} used on most {{spacecraft}} mechanisms requiring repeatable and reliable performance. The unique detent torque characteristics of these type of motors makes them behave differently when subjected to low duty cycle excitations where the applied driving pulses are only energized {{for a fraction of}} the pulse duration. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in discrete permanent magnet stepper motors used in the space industry. While the inherent high detent properties of discrete permanent magnets provide desirable unpowered holding performance characteristics, it results in unique behavior especially in low duty cycles. Notably, the running torque reduces quickly to the unpowered holding torque when the duty cycle is reduced. The space industry's accepted methodology of calculating the Motorization Ratio (or Torque Margin) is more applicable to systems where the power is continuously applied to the motor coils like brushless DC <b>motors</b> where the <b>cogging</b> torques are low enough not to affect the linear performance of the motors as a function of applied current. This paper summarizes the theoretical and experimental studies performed on a number of space qualified motors under different pulse rates and duty cycles. It is the intention of this paper to introduce a new approach to calculate the Motorization Ratios for discrete permanent magnet steppers under all full and partial duty cycle regimes. The recommended approach defines two distinct relationships to calculate the Motorization Ratio for 100 percent duty cycle and partial duty cycle, when the motor detent (unpowered holding torque) is the main contributor to holding position. These two computations reflect accurately the stepper motor physical behavior {{as a function of the}} command phase (ON versus OFF times of the pulses), pointing out how the torque contributors combine. Important points highlighted under this study are the torque margin computations, in particular for well characterized mechanisms. The rationale at CDR level versus TRR/TRB level will be discussed, aiming at avoiding too much conservatism for units that have extensive test and in flight heritage. A critical topic is related to the magnetic losses and how to sort out such phenomena as a function of the motor type being used. For instance, detent torque is a major contributor that has no reason to evolve during life and is not an uncontrolled torque loss...|$|R
