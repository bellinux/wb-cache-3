40|$|Background: Detection of {{paroxysmal}} {{atrial fibrillation}} (PAF) in acute ischemic stroke patients poses diagnostic challenge. The {{aim of this}} study was to predict the presence of PAF by means of 12 -lead ECG in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Our hypothesis was that P-wave dispersion (P d) might be a useful marker in predicting PAF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: 12 -lead resting ECGs, 24 -hour Holter recordings and echocardiograms of 400 patients were analyzed retrospectively. PAF was detected in 40 patients on 24 -hour Holter monitoring. Forty out of 360 age and gender matched patients without PAF were randomly chosen and assigned as the control group. Demographics, P-wave characteristics and echocardiographic findings of the patients with and without PAF were compared. Results: Maximum P-wave duration (p= 0. 002), P d (p&# 60; 0. 001) and left atrium diameter (p= 0. 04) were significantly higher in patients with PAF when compared to patients without PAF. However, in binary logistic regression analysis P d was the only independent predictor of PAF. The cut-off value of P d for the detection of PAF was 57. 5 milliseconds (<b>msc).</b> <b>Area</b> under the curve was 0. 80 (p&# 60; 0. 001). On a single 12 -lead ECG, a value higher than 57. 5 msc predicted the presence of PAF with a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 73 %. Conclusion: P d on a single 12 -lead ECG obtained within 24 hours of an acute ischemic stroke might help to predict PAF and reduce the risk of recurrent strokes. </p...|$|E

This is vital in order to understand further the role of MSC as a support for innovation planning and implementation of the K-economy. The study only confined to the firms established in the <b>MSC</b> <b>area.</b> It is believed that the firms in this area are all R&D firms which are heavily engage in innovation and knowledge management practices. The findings of the study indicate that the KM practices were applied by the firms were part of the knowledge management practices. There were also various associations between the variables of knowledge management practices and innovation. Nevertheless, most of these associations were positive in nature which indicate that the stronger the relationship, greater the knowledge management practices. In addition, the findings reveal that international firms did not extensively engage in the R&D based on their level of innovation. The study is interesting and has various potential to be further explored. It is suggested that the result could be more comprehensive if the study includes all international firms in the whole country. The construct of innovation intensities and other innovative capabilities also can be extended in order to discover more factors contributing to the effectiveness of the knowledge management practices on the international firms’ innovative behavior in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} between cellular networks and satellite systems {{is a very}} promising issue, since it permits the immediate provision of the radio services offered by the cellular networks to areas lacking in terrestrial facilities. In this paper the viability of a full {{integration between}} the GSM cellular network and a satellite system is dealt with. The L-band land mobile payload has been assumed as a reference; nevertheless the presented results can be extended to other payloads. The basic requirement of full integration is that the insertion of the satellite system does not entail any modification of the already existing GSM network. The integration analysis {{has been carried out}} by examining both the link feasibility and the network architecture. As far as link feasibility is concerned, the analysis is performed by means of an ad hoc simulation tool developed at CSELT (Turin). The simulation results are displayed for GSM speech channels at both full-rate (TCH/FS) and half-rate (TCH/HS). Such results are used in order to compute the satellite link budgets and the satellite system capacity. The characteristics of the satellite propagation channel, of the satellite-compatible mobile station and of the reference payload are explained as well. As far as the network architecture is concerned, the paper identifies the most promising satellite system configuration and the satellite system counterpart of the GSM functional areas (cell, location area, <b>MSC</b> <b>area).</b> Moreover, the problems and the relevant solutions related to the extension of the main GSM procedures (e. g. call set-up, cell selection/reselection, handover) to the integrated network are dealt with.

There were two groups of different survival rates, each consisting of three animals: an 8 weeks group and a 16 weeks group. The MSCs that {{were added to the}} Bio-Oss® were taken from the iliac crest by bone marrow aspiration and processed in the laboratory {{at the same time as}} the sinusaugmentation. The number of stem cells was measured by a colony forming units (cfu) experiment. The augmentation volume was evaluated computertomographically, histologically and histomorphometrically regarding a possible connection between the results and the presence of MSCs. Because of individual differences, there was no obvious connection between the addition of MSCs and the achieved volume. The volumes of both sides were similar compared with the implanted volume of the 8 -weeks group, while there was a diminution in the average volume of the material after 16 weeks it however was not significant. Histologically in all of the animals a tight connection between the particules of Bio-Oss® and the new built bone material has been observed which is a sign of successful osseointegration. None of the animals showed any special cells which would indicate a sign of inflammation in the material. This proves a good biocompatibility of Bio-Oss® and the <b>MSCs.</b> The <b>area</b> of newly formed bone on each side of the head after the different survival times was compared to assess the osteoinductive potential of MSCs in combination with Bio-Oss®.

In addition, the hypothesis that this method could recruit MSCs specifically was evaluated in a porcine model. In vivo investigations indicated that due to the immunoreaction, the CBD-MSC-peptide collagen scaffold enhanced MSC adhesion and infiltration and promoted wound healing. At day 7 after surgery, we found more infiltrating cells and capillaries in the Collagen/CBD-E 7 peptide group compared to the Scaffold group.

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cell}} (MSC) therapy shows {{considerable}} promise {{for the treatment}} of myocardial infarction (MI). However, the inefficient migration and homing of MSCs after systemic infusion have limited their therapeutic applications. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) has proven to be promising to improve the homing of MSCs to the ischemic myocardium, but the concrete mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesize that UTMD promotes MSC homing by upregulating SDF- 1 /CXCR 4, and this study was aimed at exploring this potential mechanism. We analyzed SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 expression after UTMD treatment in vitro and in vivo and counted the number of homing <b>MSCs</b> in MI <b>areas.</b> The in vitro results demonstrated that UTMD not only led to elevated secretion of SDF- 1 but also resulted in an increased proportion of MSCs that expressed surface CXCR 4.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the behavior of adipose-derived MSCs (ad-MSCs) in the context of a cell-derived matrix so as to model the in vivo physiological microenvironment. The fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix (fd-ECM) did not affect ad-MSC morphology, but reduced ad-MSC proliferation. Ad-MSCs cultured on fd-ECM displayed decreased expression of integrins 2 and 1 and subsequently lost their multipotency over time, as shown by the decrease in CD 44, Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT 4), SOX 2, and NANOG gene expression. The fd-ECM induced chondrogenic differentiation in ad-MSCs compared to control ad-MSCs. Loss of function studies, through the use of siRNA and a mutant Notch 1 construct, revealed that ECM-mediated ad-MSCs chondrogenesis requires Notch 1 and -catenin signaling. The fd-ECM also showed anti-senescence effects on ad-MSCs. The fd-ECM is a promising approach for inducing chondrogenesis in ad-MSCs and chondrogenic differentiated ad-MSCs could be used in stem cell therapy procedures.

The study intended {{to fill the}} knowledge gap {{of the interaction between}} policy made at local and government level with their associated implications to livelihood of smallholder farmers. Both primary and secondary data were collected, primary data were collected by using structured questionnaire and focus group discussion while secondary data were collected by using policy, laws and regulations documents. Matrimonial logit modal MNL was used to analyze the policy (as adaptive strategy) effects on smallholder farmer's adaptation and livelihood change. The findings show significantly (p= 0. 05) that, policy and policy instruments affect smallholder farmer‟s adaptation to climate and livelihood change differently. This means that, other policy and policy instruments assist farmers to adapt and improve their livelihood change. This is when the policy as adaptive strategy lead to farmer`s yield size increase and it has good results to the environment example policy instrument from EMA 2004 No 75 use of improved seeds as adaptive strategy enable farmers to increase their yield size and do not have harmful impact on the environment. Other policies do not encourage use of a particular adaptive strategy due to its impacts to the environment and when do not encourage sustainable use of it as adaptive strategy example policy instrument from EMA 2002 No 14 restrict shifting cultivation as adaptive strategy because clearing of trees lead to draught and do not influence sustainable environment management and do not lead to yield size increase. And other policies do not encourage use of particular adaptive strategy while have good impact to smallholder farmers' adaptation and livelihood change like policy of restriction of any human and economic activities within 60 m from water resources. Also this study determined that farmers are facing challenges like low production level, low adaptive capacity and low livelihood level. Study recommended that there should be participation in policy construction to all stakeholders. Also more research on smallholder adaptation, livelihood change and policy interaction, farmers training to increase awareness and farmers exchange programs to have different experiences from different <b>areas.</b> <b>MSc.</b> –Thesis in Agricultural EconomicsNon...|$|R
