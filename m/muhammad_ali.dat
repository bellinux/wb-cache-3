5|$|Monarchs of the <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> dynasty reigned over Egypt from 1805 to 1953. Their rule also {{extended}} to Sudan {{throughout much of}} this period, {{as well as to}} the Levant, and Hejaz during the first half of the 19th century. The <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> dynasty was founded by <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> Pasha, an Albanian commander in the expeditionary force sent by the Ottoman Empire in 1801 to dislodge the French occupation of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The defeat and departure of the French left a power vacuum in Egypt, which had been an Ottoman province since the 16th century, but in which the pre-Ottoman Mamluk military caste maintained considerable power. After a three-year civil war, <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> managed to consolidate his control over Egypt, and declared himself Khedive of the country. The Ottoman Porte refused to acknowledge this title, instead recognizing <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> by the more junior title of Wāli (meaning governor or viceroy) on 18 June 1805, making <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> the successor to Ahmad Khurshid Pasha in that position. In the years following his consolidation of power, <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> extended Egypt's borders south into Sudan, and eastwards into the Arab Mashreq, particularly the Levant. In 1840, his demand for hereditary control of Egypt and Sudan to be passed to his heirs and successors was accepted and confirmed by the Convention of London, but he was compelled to agree that, upon his death, control over his territories in the Mashreq would revert to the Porte.|$|E

Many of the local village headmen in the Jaffa region were executed by Ali for supporting the revolt. Jaffa's urban notables, who also backed the rebels in their earlier attempt to capture Jaffa's fortress, escaped a similar fate by fleeing to the island of Cyprus. A number of major notables from other parts of Palestine were rounded up as well, including the religious leaders Sheikh Abdullah al-Fahum of Nazareth and Sheikh Said al-Sa'di of az-Zeeb. Both were exiled to Egypt. Mas'ud al-Madi, the mutassalim of Jaffa, and his son Isa al-Madi, the mutassalim of Safad, were arrested and executed by beheading for joining the revolt. The Madi family was the most powerful feudal household in the northern coastal region of Palestine {{at the time of their}} leaders' executions.|$|E

5|$|In 1830, {{on the eve}} of <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali's</b> invasion, the Porte {{transferred}} {{control of}} the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (bilad al-Sham). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali's</b> invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali's</b> Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns.|$|R

5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali,</b> {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, <b>Muhammad</b> <b>Ali</b> desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
