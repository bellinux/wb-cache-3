It's the discretion that enables the social workers to make individualized decisions adapted to each clients unique situation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> reflections on discretion and what influences their discretion in the professional role. Six qualitative interviews were conducted with <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> in three communitys i the middle of Sweden. The main result shows that it is primarily four factors that affect the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> discretion in the professional role : External factors such as other organizations change of regulations and cooperation with other organizations. Organizational factors such as routines, rules and guidelines. Professional factors such as the opportunity to use experience and professional knowledge to determine which measure works in different situations. Individual factors like the workers ability for initiative and the clients individual circumstances. <b>Social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> feel that they have a relatively wide discretion in their profession. They believe they have the ability to make individual evaluations of each client, however they also believe that their discretion often is limited by lack of time. Key words: <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers,</b> clients, discretion, assessments. ...|$|R

40|$|After a {{large-scale}} natural disaster, demand for <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> services increases, and {{the mental health}} of local <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> becomes a matter of great concern because of their dual role as support providers and disaster survivors. We examined whether work-related social stressors, including criticism by community people and poor workplace communication, were associated with increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or psychological distress 20 - 22 months after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE; March 11, 2011) in local <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers.</b> Demographic characteristics, disaster-related risk factors (near-death experience, dead/missing family members, loss of housing), and work-related social risk factors (criticism, lack of communication) were obtained 20 - 22 months after the GEJE from 822 local workers. Questionnaires measured PTSD, depression, and psychological stress. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were applied. More local <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> suffered from mental health problems than would be expected. Criticism by community people was significantly associated with probable PTSD and high psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 31 and 2. 55, respectively). Furthermore, lack of workplace communication was associated with probable PTSD, depression, and high psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 97, 4. 27, and 4. 65, respectively). Almost 2 years after the disaster, local relief workers still suffered from mental health problems. Because post-disaster work-related social stressors constitute risk factors for these mental health problems, measures to improve working conditions and prevent and treat mental disorders should be a priority...|$|R

40|$|After {{repeated}} {{criticism of}} the social services about how they manage family care, the National Board of Health and Welfare decided {{to solve the problem}} by importing a model used in England (Integrated children's system).

Our study aims to investigate whether BBIC will contribute to more and more extensive follow-ups of children placed than before, with a focus on the child's best. This has been studied through qualitative interviews with six social workers who work with children investigations. The results indicate that follow-up is becoming more wide when BBIC is used, the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>worker</b> needs to see the child several times to obtain all the information that BBIC documents require. The result also indicates that the social workers use different BBIC documents when they do follow-ups.

40|$|There are a {{significant}} number of family breakdowns in the UK that require the intervention of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> to ensure positive outcomes for the children who are at the centre of disagreement and animosity. Many of the situations will use the law to impose a solution when agreement between the adults is not otherwise forthcoming. There are frequent complaints from some fathers of inequity in <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> practice and the law. These complaints are in part due to the contemporary nature of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> work and concomitant legal practice with families, for example because of uncritical approaches to assessment perpetuated by mandated tools such as the Framework for Assessment of Children in Need and their Families (DH, 2000), the Common Assessment Framework (2005) and the Integrated Children’s System (2005). There are continuing concerns about the quality of assessments and that good practice in this regard is inhibited by managerialist and bureaucratic approaches and also because of imbalance between <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> and their legal representatives. One negative outcome of this, particularly for children in contested contact proceedings, is denied familial and cultural experiences and lost identity. Many nonresident parents are anonymous in practitioner’s minds and records, not helped as many children’s stories are reduced to a ‘cut and paste’ approach to assessment. Such anonymity means that possibilities offered by the non-resident parent’s family, culture and community are denied and unavailable to the child. Practitioners worry about accountability both within and out with the courtroom and practice in an atmosphere of increased public hostility and scrutiny. Utility and professional agency are determined not just by statute but by working practices and culture, by knowledge and skills, and the prevailing social and political priorities of the day and this does not necessarily favour positive outcomes for children and non resident fathers...|$|R
