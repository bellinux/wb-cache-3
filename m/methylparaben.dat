50|$|Nipastat is {{the brand}} name for a mixture of parabens, or parahydroxybenzoates, by Clariant. Parabens are a type of {{compound}} used as a preservative in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food. Nipastat is a white powder at room temperature, but is normally dissolved into a liquid product. Nipastat acts to prevent the growth of mold, bacteria, and yeast. Nipastat {{is a mixture of}} five common parabens: <b>methylparaben</b> (50-60%), butylparaben (12-17%), ethylparaben, (13-18%) propylparaben (6-9%), and isobutylparaben (6-9%). When Nipastat is added to a product the recommended final weight of Nipastat is between 0.05% and 0.3% of the total weight. Nipastat is stable at a range of pHs between 4 and 8.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstream}} {{cosmetic industry}} believes that parabens, like most cosmetic ingredients, are safe {{based on their}} long-term use and safety record and recent scientific studies. Public interest organizations which raise awareness about cosmetic ingredients believe that further research is necessary to determine the safety of parabens, under the precautionary principle. The concerns about endocrine disruptors have led consumers and companies to search for paraben-free alternatives. Grapefruit seed extract is promoted as a natural preservative, but in a study, five out of six commercial products tested were found to contain artificial preservatives such as <b>methylparaben</b> and benzethonium chloride. A common alternative has been phenoxyethanol, but this has its own risks and {{has led to an}} FDA warning on inclusion in nipple creams.|$|E
5000|$|Parabens {{are active}} against a broad {{spectrum}} of microorganisms. However, their antibacterial mode of action is not well understood. They are thought to act by disrupting membrane transport processes [...] or by inhibiting synthesis of DNA and RNA [...] or of some key enzymes, such as ATPases and phosphotransferases, in some bacterial species. Propylparaben is considered more active against most bacteria than <b>methylparaben.</b> The stronger antibacterial action of propylparaben may be due to its greater solubility in the bacterial membrane, which may allow it to reach cytoplasmic targets in greater concentrations. However, since a majority of the studies on the mechanism of action of parabens suggest that their antibacterial action is linked to the membrane, it is possible that its greater lipid solubility disrupts the lipid bilayer, thereby interfering with bacterial membrane transport processes and perhaps causing the leakage of intracellular constituents.|$|E
5000|$|The Natural Skincare Authority and Livestrong {{have criticized}} Aussie {{for its use}} of {{controversial}} chemicals in its manufacturing process. The Natural Skincare Authority has rated Aussie Shampoo a 1.1/10, characterizing the hair care product as [...] "highly toxic" [...] in the shampoo category of the Natural Hair Care Product Review. The Natural Skincare Authority has also stated that “The Aussie Mega Shampoo does not meet any natural ingredient parameter.” Some Aussie products contain sodium lauryl sulphate, an alkaline ingredient that helps penetrate dirt and oil on hair. The manufacturing process of this chemical may leave traces of dioxane, a probable human carcinogen (according to Natural Health Information). Many Aussie products also contain a variety of parabens such as propylparaben and <b>methylparaben.</b> However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published studies showing {{that there is no}} direct link between parabens and breast cancer. Although this remains unproven, it is also believed there is a link between Aussie products and cancer due to the ingredient Cocamidopropyl Betaine, as seen in animal tests.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of <b>methylparaben</b> by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was developed. <b>Methylparaben</b> is often used as preservative, alone or {{in combination with other}} parabens, being added to cosmetic products, pharmaceutical products and foods to avoid microbial contamination. Due to its widespread use and potential risk to human health, assessing human exposure to this compound is of interest. A good determination and quantification of <b>methylparaben</b> was developed with a gradient elution using a mixture of methanol and water (60 : 40, v/v) within 1. 455 min. Under optimized conditions, the linear working range extends over two orders of magnitude with relative standard deviations of intra- and inter-day precision below 2. 3 %, and a detection limit of 0. 02 ng μL- 1 for <b>methylparaben.</b> The proposed method was successfully applied to the assay of <b>methylparaben</b> in cosmetic products with minimal sample preparation...|$|E

40|$|Objective - To {{evaluate}} chondrocyte {{death in}} canine articular cartilage exposed in vitro to bupivacaine {{with and without}} <b>methylparaben</b> and to compare viability for cartilage with intact or mechanically debrided surfaces. Sample Population - Both glenohumeral joints from 10 adult canine cadavers. Procedures - 10 osteochondral cores were harvested {{from each of the}} 20 humeral heads; synovium and 1 core from each joint were examined to verify joint health, and the other 9 cores were exposed to canine chondrocyte culture medium (CCCM), a 0. 5 % solution of bupivacaine, or 0. 5 % solution of bupivacaine with <b>methylparaben</b> for 5, 15, or 30 minutes. Results - For the superficial zone of surface-intact chondrocytes, bupivacaine with <b>methylparaben</b> caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 5 minutes (47. 7 %) than did bupivacaine (23. 6 %) or CCCM (25. 4 %). Bupivacaine (53. 8 %) and bupivacaine with <b>methylparaben</b> (62. 5 %) caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 30 minutes than did CCCM (20. 0 %). For the superficial zone of chondrocytes with debrided surfaces, bupivacaine with <b>methylparaben</b> caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 30 minutes (59 %) than it did at 5 minutes (37. 7 %). Bupivacaine with <b>methylparaben</b> caused a significantly higher percentage of chondrocyte death at 30 minutes (59. 0 %) than did CCCM (28. 9 %). For middle and deep zones of chondrocytes, treatment solution and surface debridement had minimal effects on percentage of chondrocyte death. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Bupivacaine and bupivacaine with <b>methylparaben</b> were cytotoxic to canine articular chondrocytes in vitro. Intra-articular administration of bupivacaine is not recommended for clinical use until additional studies are conducted...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{detect the}} {{presence}} and concentration of <b>methylparaben</b> in cartridges of commercial Brazilian local anesthetics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve commercial brands (4 in glass and 8 in plastic cartridges) of local anesthetic solutions for use in dentistry were purchased from the Brazilian market and analyzed. Different lots of the commercial brands were obtained in different Brazilian cities (Piracicaba, Campinas and São Paulo). Separation was performed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-Vis detector. The mobile phase used was acetonitrile:water (75 : 25 - v/v), pH 4. 5, adjusted with acetic acid at a flow rate of 1. 0 ml. min- 1. RESULTS: When detected in the solutions, the <b>methylparaben</b> concentration ranged from 0. 01 % (m/v) to 0. 16 % (m/v). One glass and all plastic cartridges presented <b>methylparaben.</b> CONCLUSION: 1. <b>Methylparaben</b> concentration varied among solutions from different manufacturers, {{and it was not}} indicated in the drug package inserts; 2. Since the presence of <b>methylparaben</b> in dental anesthetics is not regulated by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) and this substance could cause allergic reactions, it is important to alert dentists about its possible presence...|$|E
40|$|Parabens are the esters of {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid and {{are commonly used}} as preservatives in personal care products, pharmaceutical preparations and cosmetics. Recently parabens {{have been found to}} be estrogenic, bringing into question if exposure to them is adversely affecting human health. Given exposure to multiple xenoestrogens is constant; research has been carried out to determine what effect combinations of xenoestrogens might have on human and environmental health. Parabens are almost always present in combinations in formulae as this increases their antimicrobial activity, so it is important to know what the effect of this is. The main aim of this study was to determine what the effect of combining <b>methylparaben</b> and butylparaben together has on the proliferation of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, which proliferate in the presence of estrogen. This study was carried out by exposing MCF- 7 breast cancer cells to combinations of <b>methylparaben</b> and butylparaben and measuring cell proliferation by counting cells using a cytometer. The results show that butylparaben caused a greater increase in cell proliferation compared to <b>methylparaben.</b> When <b>methylparaben</b> and butylparaben were combined together, the resulting cell proliferation was greater than the cell proliferation produced by either <b>methylparaben</b> or butylparaben alone at a concentration twice the amount of either paraben concentration contained within the mixture. These results were analysed using Analysis of Variance, which determined the combination treatments were statistically different from the single treatments according to Fishers method. This suggests that there is a synergistic effect produced when <b>methylparaben</b> and butylparaben are combined together, however large variation and dose dependent discrepancies means this result is uncertain and further studies need to be carried out...|$|E
