50|$|It {{was heavily}} damaged in the 2004 tsunami which {{impacted}} on over 100,000 of the Maldives 300,000 population. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, {{supported by the}} Irish and American Red Cross Societies, began work on a <b>mains</b> <b>sewage</b> system on August 10, 2006. The International Federation has also funded the building of homes for those who lost theirs during the tsunami. Both schemes are carried out in partnership with commercial contractors and with the support and involvement of the local community.|$|E
50|$|The housing was {{originally}} established as small collection of railway houses near the train line. In the late 1950s early 1960s the area experienced a small boom of housing (400 houses) mostly {{built by the}} then State Housing Commission partly funded by the sale of half the properties to individuals. In the late 1960s the State Housing started to reacquire some of those properties. During the late 1990s the suburb underwent a revamp driven by the State Housing Commission, now called the Department of Housing. This occurred {{in conjunction with the}} infill sewage project which was created to convert Perth homes from septic tanks and leach drains to <b>mains</b> <b>sewage.</b> They bulldozed houses on land where they had adjoining properties. For every three houses removed five to seven were built in their place. The majority of these were sold off to low income and first home buyers.|$|E

40|$|The present work aims {{to obtain}} a {{preliminary}} analysis of the expression of territorial socioenvironmental vulnerability in São Sebastião, Litoral Norte, SP, seeking {{to answer the following}} question: is the population equally exposed to the same risks and hazards? As an a priori response, the Socio-Environmental Vulnerability Index (IVSA) was elaborated, through which is made the overlap of variables that represent the dimensions of vulnerability: (a) socioeconomic variable: State Social Vulnerability Index (IPVS), (b) environmental variables, expressed through the construction of risk zones that consider the proximity to the ocean (risk of mean sea level elevation) and slope (risk of landslides), (c) sanitation variables, whose inaccessibility and the resulting condition of precariousness can be expressed by data from the water <b>mains,</b> <b>sewage</b> disposal and solid waste. The IVSA was superimposed on the urbanized area of the two areas of São Sebastião, obtained through the fusion of multispectral Landsat 7 images (ETM+ 30 m) and a CBERS 2 B panchromatic image (HRC - 2. 5 m) in order to determine which population is exposed to risks. The unit of analysis is the cellular space, which aims to mix information from different sources. The result of the IVSA to areas I and II showed that the population living near the ocean is in a very high exposure to social and environmental vulnerability. The populations of the remaining areas, further from the ocean, have a medium to high vulnerability in area II. Pages: 1012 - 101...|$|E

50|$|The Thames Water Ring Main {{supplies}} much of London with water. Sewage disposal was historically a problem, causing major {{pollution of}} the River Thames and potable water supplies.

Indeed, the problem was so severe that Parliament was suspended on occasion due to the stench from the river. These problems were solved when Sir Joseph Bazalgette completed his system of intercepting <b>mains</b> to divert <b>sewage</b> from the Thames to outfalls east of London, where the tide would sweep the sewage out to sea.|$|R

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{performed}} at the Fox River Fiber recovered paper processing company in DePere, Wisconsin, {{to determine the extent}} to which injection of oxygen and ozone could reduce the high chemical oxygen demand, COD, in the effluent and the effectiveness of the ozone/oxygen stream in suppressing production of hydrogen sulfide gas in downstream sewage lines. Adaptive Ozone Solutions, LLC, supplied the oxygen/ozone generation and injection system. Samples were analyzed both before and after oxygen/ozone injection. Hydrogen sulfide gas was continuously monitored at sewer stations downstream of Fox River Fiber. Results showed that with a very short contact time, effluent COD was reduced by over 15 %. A simple kinetic model predicts that a contact time of fewer than 30 minutes could reduce COD by as much as 60 %. In addition, downstream hydrogen sulfide gas production in the <b>sewage</b> <b>mains</b> was also better controlled, such that costly Bioxide applications could be reduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{manuscript}} {{concerns the}} decrease {{of the structural}} strength of rigid pipes made of homogeneous materials due to bed load erosion, caused by different concentrations of hard solid particles transported by the sanitary sewage, or surface runoff. Such a phenomenon has been observed in combined sanitary systems (CSS), {{as well as in}} force <b>mains</b> de-livering domestic <b>sewage</b> due to the penetration of hard solid particles into the sanitary sewerage system. Field observa-tions have indicated that the low concentrations of solid particles transported with the sewage lead to the formation of a groove at the pipe invert. Experiments carried out in this study have shown that the width of the groove mainly depends on the concentration of the solid particles. Numerical simulations have indicated that bed load erosion resulting from very low concentrations of solid small particles may be more detrimental to the structural strength of the pipe than higher con-centration of such particles...|$|R
5000|$|In most homes, {{sewer gas}} {{may have a}} {{slightly}} unpleasant odor, but does not often pose a significant health hazard. [...] Residential sewer pipes primarily contain the gases found in air (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.). [...] Often, methane is the gas of next highest concentration, but typically remains at nontoxic levels, especially in properly vented systems. However, if sewer gas has a distinct “rotten egg” smell, especially in <b>sewage</b> <b>mains,</b> septic tanks, or other sewage treatment facilities, it {{may be due to}} hydrogen sulfide content, which can be detected by human olfactory senses in concentrations as low as parts per billion. Exposure to low levels of this chemical can irritate the eyes, cause a cough or sore throat, shortness of breath, and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Prolonged low-level exposure may cause fatigue, pneumonia, loss of appetite, headaches, irritability, poor memory, and dizziness. High concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (>150 ppm) can produce olfactory fatigue, whereby the scent becomes undetectable. At higher concentrations (>300 ppm), hydrogen sulfide can cause loss of consciousness and death. Very high concentrations (>1000 ppm) can result in immediate collapse, occurring after a single breath.|$|R
40|$|Developing optimal {{policies}} on management of water resources, investment in relevant infrastructure {{and the protection}} of the environment requires data on the current and likely future demand for water services. In jurisdictions without water metering, information on the factors influencing demand tends to be limited. Microdata from household surveys can provide some relevant information. Domestic water demand is influenced both by the number of households and their characteristics, in particular {{the extent to which they}} employ water-using appliances. This paper focuses on domestic ownership of water-using appliances in the Republic of Ireland, a country where rapid economic and demographic change have put pressure on water and sewerage infrastructure but where there is little domestic metering. Using a large household micro-dataset, we use regression analysis to examine the determinants of the water and <b>sewage</b> <b>mains</b> connection status of Irish homes and to identify the characteristics of households that are associated with having larger or smaller numbers of appliances. Our empirical results suggest that Ireland will have a rising share of mains water and sewerage connections in the future. Household income, house price, dwelling types other than 'detached', younger dwellings, and urban location are all positively associated with having a mains connection. The number of types of water-using appliance in a household is positively associated with income, house price, number of residents, owner-occupation, having children (or, to a lesser extent, multiple people) in the household, having a detached house, being located in a rural area and living in a dwelling built after 1997. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
