40|$|One of {{the most}} popular process {{modeling}} languages is the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). Despite the popularity, BPEL process models have an inherent complexity. This complexity keeps on increasing with age as a result of maintenance routines. Structural properties of BPEL process models such as size and complexity are claimed to influence <b>maintainability</b> <b>factor</b> of the process models. In the past, researchers have applied measurement to quantify the size and complexity of process models and thereafter utilized the measurement results to modify or to enhance the quality of the models. The problem with BPEL process measurement is that very few valid metrics exist that can beused for BPEL process models. Although several validation studies have been carried out, these were based on other language environments other than BPEL. To generalize the results of these studies to BPEL process models might be inaccurate, especially that BPEL has richer semantics than most other business process modeling languages. In addition, many of the existing validation studies did not focus on the external quality characteristic of maintainability, which makes it difficult to assess the value of the validated metrics as maintainability indicators for BPEL process models. To address this problem, this thesis proposes a suite of size and complexity metrics for measuring the structural properties of BPEL process models and then investigates whether these metrics can be useful indicators of the maintainability of BPEL process models. Theoretical validation studies based on Briand’s framework and Weyuker’s properties were conducted to find out whether the metrics were theoretically sound as required. Empirical studies by means of experimentations were also conducted to find out whether the metrics had any correlation with maintainability sub-characteristics of understandability and modifiability. Theoretical validation results indicate that the metrics satisfy the two theoretical frameworks at acceptable levels in their respective categories. Experimental results were also significant for all proposed metrics, which means that these metrics are highly correlated to maintainability subcharacteristics of understandability and modifiability. This shows that the proposed size and complexity metrics can be useful as indicators of the maintainability of BPEL process models...|$|E

40|$|Building {{maintainability}} considerations {{relate to}} the extent to which the building maintenance tasks could be seen as being achievable. The purposes of incorporating good maintainability considerations into building designs are to achieve high building performance, ease day-to-day housekeeping tasks, make the building adaptable for future needs and maintain a stable usage cost throughout the building’s design life. This paper identifies the factors suitable for building maintainability interaction evaluation for a robust building design. The evaluation will be used as a holistic evaluation of variable interaction during operational stage, to reduce future maintenance difficulties and cost. The maintainability interaction evaluation has a multidimensional diagnosis system which consists of controlled and uncontrolled factors. The data collection method in this research includes an expert panel interview using prepared semi-structured interview questions and a questionnaire survey to identify the <b>maintainability</b> <b>factors</b> in fulfilling the maintenance-related needs of the building. This research identifies <b>maintainability</b> <b>factors</b> by applying partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique.

40|$|Petroleum {{pipelines}} are {{the nervous}} system of the oil industry, as this transports crude oil from sources to refineries and petroleum products from refineries to demand points. Therefore, the efficient operation of these pipelines determines {{the effectiveness of the}} entire business. Pipeline route selection plays a major role when designing an effective pipeline system, as the health of the pipeline depends on its terrain. The present practice of route selection for petroleum pipelines is governed by factors such as the shortest distance, constructability, minimal effects on the environment, and approachability. Although this reduces capital expenditure, it often proves to be uneconomical when life cycle costing is considered. This study presents a route selection model with the application of an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multiple attribute decision making technique. AHP considers all the above factors along with the operability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>factors</b> interactively. This system has been demonstrated here through a case study of pipeline route selection, from an Indian perspective.

Considering the {{uncertainty}} of <b>maintainability</b> design <b>factors</b> and the fuzzy preference information in evaluation values, an evaluation and decision-making method of maintainability was proposed. The linguistic assessment values of <b>maintainability</b> design <b>factors</b> were converted to trapezoid fuzzy numbers by fuzzy set theory, and decision weights under fuzzy preference were given based on maximizing deviation method. Then, evaluation model of maintainability design was established, and confidence index of evaluating decision was given.

Intorduction Maintainability is a significant characteristic of product that can make maintenance convenient, fast and economical, and design is the stage at which the maintainability of product is almost determined. In the context of concurrent engineering, designers should take maintainability into account during their work. It is important to evaluate maintainability in the early design phase and make decisions concerning the compatibility of a proposed design with specified maintenance requirements or the choice of better alternatives.

This misunderstanding prevented their adoption despite their many advantages. Objective: In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study on the impact of a measurement program, MQL (“Mise en Qualité du Logiciel”, French for “Quality Software Development”), in an industrial context. Method: We analyzed data collected on 44 industrial systems of different sizes: 22 systems were developed using MQL while the other 22 used ad-hoc approaches to assess and control quality (control group, referred to as “ad-hoc systems”). We studied the impact of MQL on a set of nine variables: six quality <b>factors</b> (<b>maintainability,</b> evolvability, reusability, robustness, testability, and architecture quality), corrective maintenance effort, code complexity, and the presence of comments.

40|$|This {{memorandum}} is {{the first}} deliverable. Its objectives are to define the concept of maintainability, to describe the factors influencing it and to define criteria by which maintainability can be quantitatively evaluated. 2. - Maintainability Maintenance is the activity of modifying a software product after initial delivery. Maintainability is {{the ease with which}} a software product can be modified. Maintainability is a requirement of the CEI and SWCI specifications. Its importance {{stems from the fact that}} MDSF will have to evolve and adapt to a changing environment over the next 30 years. Using sound software engineering principles, the cost of maintenance can be minimized. Following [LS 80], we divide maintenance in three categories: - corrective maintenance: the correction of faults when the system does not behave according to its specification; - adaptive maintenance: the adaptation of the system to changes in the operational environment while keeping the same functionality; - perfective maintenance: the extension of a system's functionality and improvement in the services provided. 3. - <b>Factors</b> <b>Maintainability</b> is a component of a more general concept, software quality, which is described in terms of a hierachy (see figure 1 [EM 87]) of factors, criteria and metrics. A factor is a top-level expression of software status for management reporting. Each factor is described by a set of criteria. Each criterion is measured by a set of metrics. A criterion may describe more than one factor and some criteria may be measured by the same metric.

In the UK, the awareness of the tremendous potential and benefits of applying VM to construction projects has made some clients eager to apply this technique to their projects. There are, however, a number of problems which inhibit the use of this advanced technique in the construction industry. Qualified VM specialists, for instance, are very scarce within the industry, {{it is often difficult to}} find them to undertake proper VM studies. This research therefore aimed at exploring the feasibility of building a Knowledge-Based System (KBS) to facilitate VM implementations in the design stages of a construction project. A demonstration system has been successfully developed to illustrate the facilities which would be available to potential users in a fully developed system. A method of allocating project cost against functions of the project specified by the clients has been developed, which could expedite the processes of clarifying clients' brief and ensuring good value for money by cutting unnecessary costs and enhancing required functions.

40|$|The cost of {{scheduled}} and {{unscheduled maintenance}} {{contributes to a}} significant portion of the whole life cost of high rise building. However, such maintenance is essential to maintain the expected performance of the building throughout its lifespan and the related costs arise from several factors, including the building’s lifelong exposure to environmental factors as well as those due to design, construction and maintenance processes. The future maintenance requirements of buildings depend on the levels of risk associated with these factors as ignoring such risks results in high maintenance costs. As such, the analysis of such risks aimed at reducing future maintenance costs is of paramount importance from an early stage of a building project. This study addresses the above research problem by a framework based on risk analysis to forecast the level of maintainability by (1) deriving and quantifying maintainability risk domain, (2) quantifying maintainability and (3) developing a model. The derived maintainability risk domain consists of ten significant risk factors, extracted from 58 risk-causing variables/ issues. The significance and impact from these ten risk <b>factors</b> on <b>maintainability</b> were evaluated using data collected from thirty high-rise buildings which are of 10 or more storeyed high in Colombo metropolis. Field surveys and interviews were used for the collection of data which captured the existing maintainability issues in these high-rise buildings. The respective building managers, who are considered as substantive experts were interviewed to assess these risks <b>factors.</b> <b>Maintainability</b> was quantified using an indicator, “Maintenance Efficiency Indicator – MEI” which is the ratio between equivalent value of maintenance cost and equivalent value of initial construction cost. Maintenance cost was established using the past maintenance records and present maintenance cost needed to improve the existing performance of the building when it falls below the required level. The required level of the performance is derived using five performance mandates such as stability, tightness requirements, durability, tactile requirements and safety in use. An ensemble neural network architecture that combines small, individually trained networks into a larger network is used to develop the model for this framework. The ensemble architecture allows the individual expert networks to be representative of major components of the building. This facilitated the network to be trained with limited data samples. Furthermore, the structure is also capable of managing unforeseen correlations in input variables. The prototype used in this research uses four expert networks representing four building components; roof, façade, basement and internal areas. The final output of the ensemble network is used as an indicator of Maintenance Efficiency (MEI). Data collected from the sample of 30 high-rise buildings is used to train these neural networks. Low error margins (< 0. 005) and generalization error (< 0. 05) of these neural networks indicate high level of accuracy in their predictions. The accuracy and validity of the proposed framework is tested using two case studies of high-rise buildings which were not used for training of the neural networks. A high-rise hospital building and a high-rise bank building are selected for these case studies. Validity of the proposed framework is tested under different risk scenarios as follows,  Validation 1 : Framework is used to forecast the MEI. These results are compared to the MEI computed based on actual cost data.  Validation 2 : Framework is used to estimate changes required in the Risk inputs for a general improvement of the maintenance efficiency (MEI). These changes are compared with expert’s opinion on achieving the same goals.  Validation 3 : Using the framework, risk input levels corresponding to the best possible maintenance efficiency are determined. These values are compared with the belief elicited from experts. Hence the proposed framework is suitable for forecasting the level of maintainability of high-rise buildings and the MEI established from whole life maintenance cost is an effective measure to quantify maintainability of high-rise buildings. Further, maintenance efficiency can be improved by controlling and managing the maintainability risks described by the ten risk factors identified in this research study.
