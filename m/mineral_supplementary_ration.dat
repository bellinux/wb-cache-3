40|$|Reindeer in the {{southern}} and central regions of reindeer husbandry in Finland feed on arboreal lichens or are given <b>supplementary</b> <b>rations</b> from midwinter whereas in the northern region reindeer use snow-covered forage throughout winter. Rates of mortality and reproduction were examined using data from population crashes of semi-domesticated reindeer that occurred in Northern Finland during 1960 - 1987. The mortality and reproductive rate were density-dependent in {{the southern}} region and the mortality was density-dependent in the central region. The density-dependence was most probably due to food competition in forest cutting areas where reindeer gather to feed on arboreal lichens from felled trees. In the northern region mortality was not density-dependent indicating that where reindeer feed on over-utilized winter range the effects of increased feeding competition are masked by very large changes in the availability of forage...|$|R

40|$|This article {{looks at}} rhetorical devices {{employed}} by certain classes of claimants in applica-tions for rationed commodities in wartime Delhi {{in the last}} decade of colonial rule. In the face of a war-driven colonial frenzy to regulate and constrict all essential and non-essential commodities, rhetoric in application-writing flourished. The covering letters accompanying application forms for rations resembled petitions in their appeals to sovereignty, their affinity to rhetorical parlance, the scope they extended to applicants to exploit colonial structures of bureaucratic authority and their role in shaping the formation of cultural subjectivities. This turn to rhetoric was equally implicit in colonial responses to requests for <b>supplementary</b> <b>rations</b> which were phrased in turgid and caustic prose that drew out the various rationalities of the war and colonial rule while taking cognizance of the encumbrances and cultural imperatives of the everyday. Rhetorical thrusts were not confined to the written requests accompanying the application form. The forms for rationed commodities like motor spirit, electricity, tyres and tubes were themselves peppered with persuasive graphic signs and artifacts that enacted certain relationships between the document and the rule, between intermediate and higher authorities, between applicants and rationed commodities...|$|R

Objectives of cross-sectional surveys in 2004 (n = 533) and 2006 (n = 515) were {{to assess the}} impact of new food rations (flour, oil) and supplements on MN status by trimester of pregnancy in the Maela refugee camp. Hemoglobin, iron status, zinc, retinol, β-carotene and tryptophan decreased, while α-/γ-tocopherol and 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF) increased from first to third trimester. In 2006, mean zinc and α-tocopherol for each trimester was significantly higher than in 2004. The weeks of supplemented thiamine and folic acid were positively correlated with thiamine diphosphate (TDP) and 5 -MTHF, but not for ferrous sulfate as iron deficiency was observed in 38. 5 % of third-trimester women. Frequent consumption of fish paste and owning a garden or animal were associated with significantly higher iron status, retinol, β-carotene, and 5 -MTHF. In conclusion, MFF and supplementary oil were most likely to explain improved zinc and α-tocopherol status, while thiamine and folate supplements ensured high TDP and 5 -MTHF in late pregnancy. MN supplements, MN-rich staple food, small gardens, and programs to improve iron compliance are promising strategies to prevent MN deficiencies during pregnancy in vulnerable populations...|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of supplementation with trace minerals {{is to avoid}} a variety of deficiency diseases. Trace minerals carry out key functions in relation to many metabolic processes, most notably as catalysts for enzymes and hormones, and are essential for optimum health, growth and productivity. For example, <b>supplementary</b> <b>minerals</b> help ensure good growth, bone development, feathering in birds, hoof, skin and hair quality in mammals, enzyme structure and functions, and appetite. Deficiency of trace minerals affect many metabolic processes and so may be manifested by different symptoms, such as poor growth and appetite, reproductive failures, impaired immune responses, and general ill-thrift. From the 1950s to the 1990s most trace mineral supplementation of animal diets was {{in the form of}} inorganic minerals, and these largely eradicated associated deficiency diseases in farm animals.|$|R

The research work presented in this paper deals with the influence of fly ash (FA) and metakaolin (MK) in the inhibition of ASR and DEF in concrete. The influence of other additions like ground granulated blast furnace slag(GGBS), silica fume (SF) and limestone filler (LF) was also investigated in the DEF suppression.

Narrow-band indices proposed {{in this study were}} assessed as indicators of biochemical and structural parameters in Vitis vinifera L., observing their relationships with foliar variables such as N, P, K, Ca, Fe, Mg and chlorophyll a+b concentration (Ca+b). Hyperspectral indices were assessed to study their capability for vegetation condition monitoring as a function of fertilization treatments applied (basically extracts of Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed and chelates), showing associations with field variables. Narrow-band vegetation indices displayed sensitivity to vineyard growth and condition as a function of seaweed fertilization and other <b>supplementary</b> <b>mineral</b> correctors, such as chelates.

40|$|For {{technological}} and nutritional reasons, the dairy industry manufactures different formulations with special mineral compositions {{adapted to the}} needs of the consumer. The formulation consists to mix different chemical constituents such as proteins, lipids, sugars, vitamins and minerals. In these types of formulae, it is necessary to control the addition of minerals because they interact between themselves and also with the protein fraction with possible changes in their physico-chemistry and stability. Recent advances in the understanding of the mineral fraction make possible theoretical calculations of the mineral distribution between aqueous and protein phases in different physico-chemical conditions. These calculations, performed by a specific software named MilkSALTS (Mekmene et al. 2009 and 2010), take into account the : - total concentrations of main cations (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium) and anions (citrate, chloride, inorganic phosphate, organic phosphate, carboxylic groups); - pH value; - ionic strength; - association constants between cations and anions; - chemical nature (especially Ca/P molar ratio) of the calcium phosphate salts; - solubility of calcium phosphate in the aqueous phase considered as supersaturated. With this model, it is possible to calculate the minerals distribution in normal milk and modified milks. The modifications are additions of different <b>supplementary</b> <b>minerals</b> (CaCl 2, NaCl, phosphate and citrate), different pH values (from 6. 7 to 3. 5) and different casein concentrations.

La mayoría de las vacas reiniciaron su actividad ovárica en la segunda semana posparto y más de la mitad presentaron su primera ovulación durante el periodo experimental. Se encontró una relación estadísticamente significativa (p The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish the genetic merit for milk yield influence on energy balance, energy metabolic profiles and the postpartum ovarian resumption. In this research, 10 pure-Holstein Friesian dairy cows, varying in genetic merit values for milk yield and fed on a rotational-grazing system with a <b>supplementary</b> concentrate <b>ration</b> were used. A serial of examinations were performed on 10. 4 (± 2. 5), 21. 6 (± 4. 3), 31. 8 (± 4. 5), 42. 3 (± 4. 2), and 51. 9 (± 3. 9) postpartum days. In every sampling day animals were weighed by tape measure, their body condition score were calculated and the energy balance was estimated for every cow. In addition, blood serum tests were performed to analyze glucose and cholesterol blood concentration and an ultrasonographic assessment was executed to determine ovarian resumption. Nearly all cows had an ovarian resumption on the second week postpartum and more than a half had shown their first postpartum ovulation on the trial period. The genetic merit values for milk yield were not related with production values, therefore, the dependent variables of milk yield did not fluctuated with genetic merit. There was a significant negative relationship (p< 0. 05) between genetic merit for milk production and the nadir extent of net energy balance (NEB). Although, the genetic merit did not have significant influence on the number of days between calving to the nadir-attaining day, because high genetic merit cows as low genetic merit cows increased the intake and milk yield following similar patterns, but with different extents. In the same way, the genetic merit did not have significant relationship with the interval of calving to first ovulation. Furthermore, no one of the energy balance variables or blood metabolites influenced the interval of calving to first ovulation or the amount of follicles classified by size. In spite of these facts, the ovulating-cow group in the trial period had plasmatic cholesterol concentration significantly higher (p= 0. 07) and plasmatic glucose concentration significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than non-ovulating-cow group in the same period. These results suggest that, genetic improvement for milk production could influence the cow energy balance on early postpartum; in spite of these results, the genetic merit for milk production did not affect, by itself, the postpartum ovarian resumption...|$|R
40|$|Thirty steers {{were used}} in two pen {{experiments}} (Expts 1 and 2). and 27 of these in a third (Expt 3), to quantify their responses of hay intake, rumen ammonia nitrogen (RAN) concentrations, and liveweight to inputs of rumen soluble nitrogen (urea) and rumen undegradable protein (formaldehyde-treated casein; F-casein) when added to a basal diet of low quality hays. The hays were made From unimproved native pastures typical of those grazed by cattle in the subtropics of Australia and contained 7. 8 g N/kg dry matter (DM) with coefficient of organic matter digestibility of 0. 503 in Expts 1 and 2, and 5. 2 g N/kg DM with a digestibility range from 0. 385 to 0. 448 in Expt 3. The steers (15 months old) were either Brahman (B), Hereford (H) or the F- 1 Brahman x Hereford (BH) cross. Steers were offered <b>supplementary</b> <b>minerals</b> with the hays in each experiment. In Expt 1 (35 days) urea was sprayed on part of the hay, allowing for daily urea intakes (g/steer) of either 0, 5, 11, 16 or 26. In Expt 2 (42 days), F-casein was offered daily (g/steer) at either 0, 75, 150, 225 or 300 and in Expt 3 (56 days) discrete offerings were made of soluble casein (225 g/day), of urea (18 g/day) + F-casein (225 g/day) or of nil. There were significant linear effects of urea intake upon hay intake and liveweight change of steers. However, B steers had smaller increases in intake and liveweight change than did H steers, and B steers {{did not have a}} linear increase in RAN concentrations with increasing urea intake as did H and SH steers. In Expt 2 there were significant linear effects of F-casein supplements on hay intake and liveweight change of steers and a significant improvement in their feed conversion ratio (i. e. DM intake:liveweight change). The B steers did not differ from H and BH steers in liveweight change but had significantly lower hay intakes and non-significantly smaller increases in RAN with increasing F-casein intake. In Expt 3, hay intake of the steers increased with soluble casein (by 16. 8 %) and with urea + F-casein (24. 5 %). Only steers given urea + F-casein had a high RAN concentration (94 mg/l) and a high liveweight gain. The B steers had a liveweight loss and a lower hay intake than H or BH steers in Expt 3 but a higher RAN concentration. These studies have indicated the importance of the form and quantity of additional N required by cattle of differing breed types to optimize their feed intake and liveweight gain when offered low-N, low-digestible hays...|$|R
40|$|Food-based {{safety net}} {{programs}} support adequate consumption {{and contribute to}} assuring livelihoods. They differ from other safety net programs {{in that they are}} tied to the provision of food, either directly, or through cash-like instruments (food stamps, coupons) that may be used to purchase food. Since food provided through a safety net program may be substituted for a household’s current consumption, freeing up income for other uses, food-based transfers represent a contribution to household real income or purchasing power. Because food is often seen as the domain of women, women in a household are likely to have control over the use of transfers of food, and of cash-like instruments tied to food. The fact that women control food-related transfers is one possible explanation of the fact, widely documented, that transfers in the form of food or tied to food are more likely to increase households’ net food consumption than are equivalent cash transfers. Food-based programs can be designed to be self-targeting to the poor. Because food-linked coupons or stamps are restricted in use, {{they are likely to be}} less desirable than cash. If the use of coupons is restricted to inferior, less-preferred foods, the self-targeting effect will be greater. Direct provision of food may be self-targeting because of the limited choice of commodities; because the foods may be inferior in terms of consumption patterns (though not nutritionally inferior); and because there may be inconvenience associated with receiving bulky commodities. Ordinarily, cash is considered preferable to food, but in crisis situations when food supply is disrupted, food may be preferred. Providing cash or cash-like stamps or coupons in situations where supply is limited and (in the short run) unresponsive to increased demand will only drive up prices. Public provision of food is generally more politically acceptable than cash transfers, because food is a merit good. The commonest types of food-based transfers are supplementary feeding programs, food for work programs, and food stamp programs. Supplementary feeding programs provide a direct transfer of food to target households or individuals. The commonest forms are maternal and child feeding and school feeding. The food may be prepared and eaten on-site (e. g., in child feeding centers or school feeding programs), or given as a “dry ration” to take home. Even if targeted to an individual (child, pregnant or lactating mother), supplementary food is shared among household members. In the case of on-site feeding, the meal eaten on site may be substituted for a home-prepared meal. Supplementary feeding is often provided as an incentive for participation in public services such as primary health care (pre- and post-natal and well-baby care) and education. To achieve nutritional improvement, supplementary food needs to be provided in the context of a more comprehensive program of health care and health and nutrition education. In school feeding programs, food provided on site may contribute to improved learning by alleviating short-term hunger, in addition to its effects as a food supplement and as an incentive to attend school. Food for work programs provide wages in the form of food for public works. Because the provide a source of guaranteed employment, they constitute a true safety net, but only households with able-bodies members can benefit. Effective food for work programs can build infrastructure that contributes to long term food security. Food stamp programs provide stamps or coupons that may be used for the purchase of food, or of particular foods. The stamps may be denominated in value terms or in terms of quantities of specific foods. Food stamps may be used in local stores, so they are more convenient to use than bulk commodities; they are less distorting than direct food distribution; and they can strengthen local retail establishments. Use of stamps requires a reliable system for printing and distributing the stamps, and a good banking system to assure that retailers can redeem the stamps for cash. As with supplementary feeding, food stamps are often provided in conjunction with primary health care or schooling, as an incentive for participation, though there are also stand-alone food stamp programs that function more like cash transfers. Food-based transfers in emergency situations include direct provision of family <b>rations,</b> <b>supplementary</b> feeding of vulnerable groups such as infants, children, and pregnant or lactating women, and therapeutic feeding of acutely malnourished individuals in a hospital-like setting. In many emergency situations, such as refugee or IDP camps, food transfers are the only source of food, and may constitute the only resources a household receives. The purposes of food-based transfer programs vary widely, and include income support, guarantee of a minimum level of consumption, improved participation in socially beneficial programs, and nutritional improvement. Costs also vary widely depending on the size of the transfer, the size of the target group, and the logistical difficulty of distribution. Cost-effectiveness depends on the specific objective(s); cost-effectiveness comparisons are difficult because of the multiple objectives often served by a single program. The multiple types of food-based transfer programs should be viewed as complements to each other, rather than alternatives, because they serve different populations and have distinct gfood, hunger, welfare...|$|R
