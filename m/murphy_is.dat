5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, <b>Murphy</b> <b>is</b> able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E

5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair {{took the}} photographs of her body paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 Swimsuit Issue. No body painting pictures have been chosen as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn <b>Murphy</b> <b>is</b> the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E

25|$|The Buffalo Bills Radio Network is flagshipped at WGR, AM 550 in Buffalo.

50|$|Despite the ruling, <b>Murphy</b> <b>was</b> never {{appointed}} to the Senate. The Prime Minister at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, was a Liberal, and <b>Murphy</b> <b>was</b> a partisan Conservative, so she was passed over in favour of philanthropist Cairine Wilson in 1930. After the Conservatives under R. B. Bennett won the 1930 federal election, <b>Murphy</b> <b>was</b> denied to chance {{to sit in the}} Senate again in 1931, because the vacancy had been caused by the death of a Catholic senator, and <b>Murphy</b> <b>was</b> a Protestant. <b>Murphy</b> would die in 1935 without fulfilling her dream of sitting in Canada's upper chamber.|$|R

500|$|Lauren has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Canning praised Fink's {{performance in the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs", as well as Lauren's dialog. Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting: [...] "for me Lauren represents how Ryan <b>Murphy</b> <b>is</b> {{able to take the}} concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness."

500|$|Murphy's poem [...] "Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle" [...] was {{contained}} within a speech {{he wrote for}} the 20 July 1968 dedication of the [...] Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery.

500|$|Music {{is still}} an {{important}} part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, [...] "The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs". He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own, and still writes songs. Murphy does not plan to start another band: [...] "Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously". <b>Murphy</b> <b>is</b> also a dedicated runner. In 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed men in Britain.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{covers of}} numerous songs sung on-screen by the characters. Musical segments {{take the form}} of performances, as opposed to the characters singing spontaneously, as the intention is for the series to remain reality-based. Murphy has commented that his interest lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing on the format of Chicago. <b>Murphy</b> <b>is</b> responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, as: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important – the balancing of that." ...|$|E
