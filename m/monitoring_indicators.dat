50|$|The Network Control Center Data System (NCCDS) is {{an element}} of NASA's Space Network (SN) ground segment. Collocated with the White Sands Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, the NCCDS is the {{operations}} control facility for the network. It schedules most Space Network elements and supporting elements and provides interfaces for planning, acquisition, control, and status of the Space Network. The NCCDS is the point-of-contact between customers (who have satellites in orbit) and the Space Network for most scheduling and real-time performance. A customer may obtain Space Network support by submitting specific schedule requests to or establishing generic requirements with the NCCDS. The NCCDS translates customers’ requirements into specific TDRS communications and tracking events. Additionally, the NCCDS notifies affected customers of scheduled system outages so that Mission Operation Centers (MOCs) can properly plan mission activities. Upon MOC request, the NCCDS provides operational performance information (such as data presence <b>monitoring</b> <b>indicators</b> and data quality monitoring data) on scheduled services during actual support to determine if conditions exist that will affect data quality.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{cost-effective}} {{river water}} monitoring method is vital when assessing {{the level of}} river health. In {{order to reduce the}} monitoring burden as much as possible under the condition that the quality status of water bodies was evaluated fully and accurately, the necessary <b>monitoring</b> <b>indicators</b> of Liaohe River and Xiangjiang River as well as their mainstreams and tributaries were selected according to exceeding standard rates and pollution contribute rates of indicators in this study. The water quality assessment results for the mainstreams of the above two rivers by using selected indicators were compared with that by using all indicators without selection. Compared with all indicators, the selected indicators are greatly reduced in number. Additionally, the selected indicators for Liaohe River have great difference with that for Xiangjiang River due to the different water pollution characteristics. The two water quality assessment results show the consistency generally which verified that it's a feasible way to select <b>monitoring</b> <b>indicators</b> by exceeding standard rate and pollution contribute rate...|$|E

The authors have chosen to analyse a concrete case at two different scales of detail and along the time. The case-study concerns an area in Évora surroundings that was object, same years ago, of a detailed analysis. This fact make possible to compare the heritage landscape condition between 2002 and 2010 through the application of <b>monitoring</b> <b>indicators.</b> This work is integrated in a research line that since same years ago are being developed by the authors related with heritage landscape management tools. For the realization of the detailed study it was chosen a conventual kitchen garden including the related hydraulic systems. A broader area surrounding this site was also object of analysis supported mainly by the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images, the analysis of maps and land surveying. The main results concern particularly the built heritage values and landscape ecological values. In the first case several degradation situations were detected as consequence mainly of land use pressures and lack of maintenance activity. In the second case the statement of many habitats and corridors were improved as due to a lower human pressure related in part with the extensification or changing of agrarian and forestry systems.

As {{the first step of}} GNSS any anti-interference measures, interference monitoring for GNSS is extremely essential and necessary. Since interference monitoring can be considered as a classification problem, a real-time interference monitoring technique based on Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM) is proposed in this paper. A TWSVM model is established, and TWSVM is solved by the Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (LSTWSVM) algorithm. The interference <b>monitoring</b> <b>indicators</b> are analyzed to extract features from the interfered GNSS signals. The experimental results show that the chosen observations can be used as the interference <b>monitoring</b> <b>indicators.</b> The interference monitoring performance of the proposed method is verified by using GPS L 1 C/A code signal and being compared with that of standard SVM. The experimental results indicate that the TWSVM-based interference monitoring is much faster than the conventional SVM. Furthermore, the training time of TWSVM is on millisecond (ms) level and the monitoring time is on microsecond (μs) level, which make the proposed approach usable in practical interference monitoring applications...|$|E
