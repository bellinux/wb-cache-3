50|$|Frico (in {{original}} friulian language fricò) is {{a typical}} dish of Friuli and similar to another Alpine dish, Rösti, which consists of a wafer of shredded cheese and potatoes, then heated by baking or frying until crisp. The mixture becomes malleable during cooking. To prepare frico you need higher-fat hard cheeses like <b>Montasio</b> or Asiago. Originally when Friuli was a more impoverished country, frico was used to recycle cheese rinds. Frico is often used as garnish for soups or stews.|$|E
50|$|Since medieval times, {{the steep}} rocks of the <b>Montasio</b> massif, {{stretching}} about 20 km in an east-west direction, formed the natural {{border between the}} Imperial Duchy of Carinthia {{in the north and}} the Venetian Domini di Terraferma in the south. In World War I the mountain crest up to the Sella Nevea pass was part of the Italian Front and permanently manned by the Alpini. However, no hostilities happened here as the northern slope of the mountain was too steep for an attack by the Austro-Hungarian Army.|$|E
50|$|The Julian Alps (Julijske Alpe, Alpi Giulie) are a {{mountain}} {{range of the}} Southern Limestone Alps that stretch from northeastern Italy to Slovenia, where they rise to 2,864 m at Mount Triglav, the highest peak in Slovenia and of the former Yugoslavia. They are named after Julius Caesar, who founded the municipium of Cividale del Friuli {{at the foot of}} the mountains. A large part of the Julian Alps is included in Triglav National Park.

50|$|The paths are {{the ones}} used by shepherds and hunters from the valleys, who also worked as the first alpine guides in this area. The fauna of the Julian Alps is very rich as well, a {{heritage}} {{that has to be}} protected and controlled by the hunting and fishing regulation made by dedicated authorities in the best possible way. More than one thousand species of insects live in the valleys and on the slopes, in the woods you can meet foxes, hares, roes and other minor rodents and mammals, nearby specimens of tetraonides like grouses and cocks of the wood. High pastures are the reign of chamoises, ibexes, reintegrated from 1970, white partridges. In between the rocks nest the woodpecker, the raven with the yellow bill, last but not least the eagle, strictly protected. Among the reptiles there are the Vipera ammodytes or horned viper and the Vipera berus, easy to be found over the <b>Montasio</b> plateau, on the southern side of Mount Cimone, towards the Mount Nebria; other reptiles are the black salamander and the alpine triton, with its characteristic red stomach.|$|E
50|$|The mountainous {{northern}} part of the region belongs to the Southern Limestone Alps. From west to east, the region's highest peaks are, in the Carnic Prealps (Dolomiti Friulane) — the Cima dei Preti, 2703 m, Duranno 2652 m, and Cridola 2581 m; in the Carnic Alps — Peralba 2694 m, Monte Bìvera 2474 m and Coglians 2780 m; in the Julian Alps, the Jôf Fuârt 2666 m, the Jôf di <b>Montasio</b> 2754 m, Mangart 2677 m, and Canin 2587 m, which dominates the plain. Rivers flowing southwards from the mountains are numerous. The Friulian mountains surround the course of the Tagliamento river, which, at the latitude of Gemona del Friuli first crosses the hills that occupy the center of the Friuli, then flows into a large flood plain. This plain is commonly divided into the High Friulian plain and the Low Friulian plain (Bassa Friulana), whose boundary is the Napoleonic road that connects the cities of Codroipo and Palmanova. To the south of this road is the risorgive zone, where water resurfaces from underground waterways in spring-fed pools throughout the area. South of the plains lie the lagoons of Marano and Grado, which are nature reserves. Other important rivers include the Torre, Natisone, Stella, Isonzo/Soča, and Ausa.|$|E

However, on Stage 7, Uran was forced to wait for Wiggins after he struggled then crashed on wet descents, and {{dropped out of the}} top ten as a result. After the individual time trial on Stage 8, Uran sat tenth overall, 2 minutes and 49 seconds behind new leader Vincenzo Nibali. On Stage 10, the first mountain stage of the race, Uran launched an attack on the final climb, Altopiano del <b>Montasio,</b> and won the stage by 20 seconds from compatriot Carlos Betancur. Uran also moved up to third overall, 2 minutes and 4 seconds behind Nibali, and 1 second ahead of Wiggins. Wiggins withdrew due to illness after losing further time on Stage 12, leaving Uran as Sky's leader. Uran placed fifth on Stage 14 to maintain third place by a single second to Mauro Santambrogio, but solidified his position on Stage 16 as Santambrogio lost over two minutes. Uran came sixth in the mountain time trial on Stage 18 to reduce the gap to second placed Cadel Evans to just 12 seconds. On the final summit finish on Stage 20, Uran came third behind Nibali and Fabio Duarte to leapfrog Evans into second place.

During 120 days of ripening analyses were performed for microbial counts and BA content; indeed, the potential to produce BAs was screened in lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae isolates. At the end of ripening, the total BA contents of cheeses from batches A, B and C were 166 Æ 3, 207 Æ 3 and 29 Æ 8 mg kg) 1, respectively. Amino acid decarboxylase activity was widespread among isolates. Conclusions: The BA content of <b>Montasio</b> cheese from the three batches was below the threshold proposed as potentially toxic. The highest BA content was found in cheese produced using thermized milk and natural milk culture; therefore, the thermal treatment of milk was not enough by itself to reduce the counts of decarboxylase-positive bacteria in cheese. The use of selected starters guaranteed a low BA content in <b>Montasio</b> cheese.

40|$|<b>Montasio</b> {{cheese is}} a typical Italian semi-hard, semi-cooked cheese {{produced}} in northeastern Italy from unpasteurized (raw or thermised) cow milk. The Protected Designation of Origin label regulations for <b>Montasio</b> cheese require that local milk be used from twice-daily milking. The number of farms milking with automatic milking systems (AMS) has increased rapidly {{in the last few}} years in the <b>Montasio</b> production area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a variation in milking frequency, associated with the adoption of an automatic milking system, on milk quality and on the specific characteristics of <b>Montasio</b> cheese. Fourteen farms were chosen, all located in the <b>Montasio</b> production area, with an average herd size of 60 (Simmental, Holstein-Friesian, and Brown Swiss breeds). In 7 experimental farms, the cows were milked 3 times per day with an AMS, whereas in the other 7 control farms, cows were milked twice daily in conventional milking parlors (CMP). The study showed that the main components, the hygienic quality, and the cheese-making features of milk were not affected by the milking system adopted. In fact, the control and experimental milks did not reveal a statistically significant difference in fat, protein, and lactose contents; in the casein index; or in the HPLC profiles of casein and whey protein fractions. Milk from farms that used an AMS always showed somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts below the legal limits imposed by European Union regulations for raw milk. Finally, bulk milk clotting characteristics (clotting time, curd firmness, and time to curd firmness of 20 mm) did not differ between milk from AMS and milk from CMP. <b>Montasio</b> cheese was made from milk collected from the 2 groups of farms milking either with AMS or with CMP. Three different cheese-making trials were performed during the year at different times. As expected, considering the results of the milk analysis, the moisture, fat, and protein contents of the experimental and control cheeses were comparable. The milking system was not seen to significantly affect the biochemical processes associated with ripening. In fact, all cheeses showed a normal proteolysis trend and a characteristic volatile compound profile during aging.

40|$|<b>Montasio</b> is {{a typical}} {{protected}} designation of origin (PDO) Italian semi-hard and semi-cooked cheese produced in northeast Italy from raw or thermized cow's milk. The PDO label implies that the product has distinctive characteristics that are connected to traditional production methods. The aim of this work was to precisely characterize the volatile fraction of this Italian cheese. The volatile profile can be considered a fingerprint because the flavor of a cheese variety {{is the result of a}} specific balance between the volatile compounds produced during the ripening process. Analysis of the volatile profile of <b>Montasio</b> cheese was performed by solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography. Six cheesemaking trials were performed, each in a different dairy located within the <b>Montasio</b> cheese production area. Cheeses were analyzed at 5 stages of ripening (60, 90, 170, 300, and 365 d). Only 11 compounds were identified and measured: 5 fatty acids, 3 alcohols, 2 ketones, and 1 ester. The limited number of volatile compounds measured in the headspace of the <b>Montasio</b> cheese is probably due to the specific making process of this cheese, which affects evolution of the microflora and the biochemical processes of ripening. The total volatile fraction profile progressively increased from 60 to 170 d, after which time it remained almost steady. The most important contributors were found to be ethanol, short-chain fatty acids (C 2 to C 6), diacetyl, and ethyl hexanoate. Ethanol and short-chain fatty acids increased up to 170 d, diacetyl increased up to 300 d and then declined, and ethyl hexanoate increased until the final stage...|$|E
40|$|<b>Montasio</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} PDO cheeses in North-East Italy. Despite its mountain ori- gin, it is mainly produced in lowlands.

A project is in progress with the aim of assessing the economic and technical frame of a possible production system and studying the range of variability of the product qualitative characteristics. In the first phase of the project, one cheese factory with 20 associated dairy farms and one alpine farm, for a total of 350 Italian Simmental cows, were involved. A survey at farm level provided data useful to support a marketing strategy. A first experimental trial focused on the quality of cheese produced from cows grazing on alpine pasture or kept indoors.
