5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared {{just as soon as}} they came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as the wife of a prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|Developments in technology, such as computers, {{satellite}} communication, and the Internet, {{have contributed}} to many improvements within the industry. These developments have increased the productivity of company operations, saved {{the time and effort}} of drivers, and provided new, more accessible forms of entertainment to <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> often spend long periods of time away from home. In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised emission standards for diesel trucks (reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines) which promises to improve air quality and public health.|$|E
5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice.

5|$|Limited {{demobilisation}} began {{during the}} final years of the war. In order {{to meet the needs of}} the war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge.|$|E
5|$|The Peace Candle {{was first}} erected in 1951, {{and has been}} put up almost every year since then.

5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number {{were lost in the}} fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who,</b> like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E

5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E
5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E

5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt in herself. All three armies eventual convene {{at the base of the}} Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} medal, the {{next-of-kin}} of those <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{lost their lives}} {{as a result of}} enemy action, were presented with a memorial plaque and memorial scroll, both inscribed with the deceased's full name, and a condolence slip signed by King George V. More than a million plaques were produced to commemorate the sacrifice of military and mercantile marine <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> fell between 4 August 1914 and 30 April 1920.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the set is unknown. It was {{discovered}} in a two chamber tomb in the ancient site of Vulci in 1832. The burial featured a two chamber tomb of a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> were most likely married in life.|$|R
