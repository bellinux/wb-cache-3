5|$|On 25 January 2012, it was {{reported}} that an incident occurred when testing The Swarm. Limbs of test dummies were broken off when the ride passed an object that was located too close to the track. The Daily Mail suggested that the incident <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> publicity stunt.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{a staunch}} fatalist, and {{believed}} in reincarnation. He {{believed that he}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> military leader killed in action in Napoleon's army in a previous life, or a Roman legionary.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
50|$|Brough {{possibly}} has Aboriginal ancestry {{through his}} maternal grandmother, whose father <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> indigenous Australian.|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{quickly became}} {{concerned}} about apparent poor maintenance and believed it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{important factor in}} the accident.|$|R
25|$|Porisms <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{outgrowth}} of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact {{meaning of the}} title is controversial.|$|R
5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> way for the newcomers {{to become part of}} Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also {{suggests that}} it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|The board did not {{investigate}} whether any USAF institutional factors, {{such as a}} lack of crew resource management training for the involved aircrews, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> factor. Also, the board did not attempt to determine if Wickson and May had violated any of the existing OPC rules of engagement as defined by the ATO or other written instructions.|$|E
5|$|There's {{got to be}} {{a series}} of {{advantages}} all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.|$|E

50|$|His {{death is}} {{engraved}} as 1779 on his gravestone, but historian A. Van Doren Honeyman believed it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> error and should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> 1778.|$|R
50|$|During the Early Postclassic there <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> ethnic change, {{suggested}} by the influx of Gulf Coast motifs and by the burial at the pyramid of an individual with Maya-style cranial deformation and inlaid teeth.|$|R
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|Born William fitzHerbert in York, William {{was the son}} of Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, {{chancellor}} and {{treasurer of}} King Henry I. Most sources say his mother was Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father. New research, however, suggests that Emma <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. William was born sometime before the 1090s, but the exact date of birth is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Police {{issued a}} {{statement}} declaring that they were searching for two men whom Chambers had observed at Williamson's apartment prior to his death. Corporal Devon Hugh Williams of the Constabulary Communication Network (CCN) informed press that the police suspected that the motive of the attack had been robbery, as evidence pointing {{to the fact that}} Williamson's apartment had been ransacked and a safe removed. However, both friends of Williamson and human rights organisations suggested that – given Williamson's status as an openly gay man – robbery <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> secondary issue, with homophobia being the main motive behind the crime.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{words of}} the poem ("To me it seems that man...") are almost {{identical}} to a fragment of Sappho quoted by Apollonius Dyscolus: [...] "To himself he seems". [...] This <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> alternative opening to Sappho 31.|$|R
50|$|Archaeologists {{speculated that}} she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> Egyptian princess {{married to a}} Persian prince, or a {{daughter}} of Cyrus the Great of Achaemenid dynasty of Persia. However, because mummification <b>had</b> <b>been</b> primarily <b>an</b> Egyptian practice, they had not encountered any mummies in Persia before.|$|R
50|$|Farooqi {{allegedly}} {{was involved}} in the murder of Daniel Pearl, as well as conspiring with Abu Faraj al-Libbi to kill General Pervez Musharraf during the assassination attempts in Rawalpindi on December 14 and December 25, 2003. Farooqi <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> associate of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.|$|R
5|$|The biographies {{cover the}} {{emperors}} from Hadrian to Carinus and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilian {{and all but}} {{the end of the}} reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts, and {{it has been argued that}} biographies of Nerva and Trajan have also been lost at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> direct continuation of Suetonius. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{source of food}} in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, {{it is difficult to see}} how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> priest).|$|E
50|$|From Ocale, de Soto {{traveled}} {{to the town of}} Itara (or Itaraholata) in one day. Potano, chief town of Potano Province, was another day's travel beyond Itara. Itara <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in Ocale Province or in Potano Province, or it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> independent chiefdom serving as a buffer between Ocale and Potano.|$|R
5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested that this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> attempt to modernise the story, {{to make it more}} in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|R
30|$|If I had had {{somebody}} actually advising me when I {{was getting out}} of high school and going to college and I knew engineering as <b>a</b> career, I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> engineer to <b>be</b> honest, because I love engineering as a concept of being aware of your world and being in your world.|$|R
5|$|The size of {{the plaque}} {{suggests}} it would have belonged in a shrine, possibly {{as an object of}} worship; it was probably set into a mud-brick wall. Such a shrine <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> dedicated space in a large private home or other house, but not the main focus of worship in one of the cities' temples, which would have contained representations of gods sculpted in the round. Mesopotamian temples at the time had a rectangular cella often with niches to both sides. According to Thorkild Jacobsen, that shrine could have been located inside a brothel (see below).|$|E
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E
50|$|Although {{for many}} years {{scholars}} believed that Psalm 151 <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> original Greek composition and that “there {{is no evidence that}} Psalm 151 ever existed in Hebrew”, it is now known from the Dead Sea scrolls that this psalm did in fact exist in Hebrew and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> part of the psalter used by the Qumran community.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} vascular plants had stems with {{a central}} core of vascular tissue. This consisted of a cylindrical strand of xylem, surrounded by a region of phloem. Around the vascular tissue there <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> endodermis that regulated {{the flow of water}} {{into and out of the}} vascular system. [...] Such <b>an</b> arrangement <b>is</b> termed <b>a</b> protostele.|$|R
25|$|Gerbert's {{writings}} {{were printed}} in volume 139 of the Patrologia Latina. Darlington notes that Gerbert's preservation of his letters <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> effort of his to compile {{them into a}} textbook for his pupils that would illustrate proper letter writing. His books on mathematics and astronomy were not research-oriented; his texts were primarily educational guides for his students.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain thought it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate {{the surface of the}} sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E
50|$|He {{starts to}} prowl {{the house at}} night to try to meet his American alter ego. Brydon has begun {{to realize that he}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> astute {{businessman}} if he hadn't forsaken moneymaking for a more leisurely life. He discusses this possibility with Alice Staverton, his woman friend who has always lived in New York.|$|R
50|$|He {{explains}} to Masha {{that he was}} so thoroughly lost that he still does not know the name of the village where he was married, or who the bride <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>As</b> the tale ends, Maria Gavrilovna takes the hand of the man she has come to love and identifies herself as the long-lost bride.|$|R
