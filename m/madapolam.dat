25|$|For finishing, a {{covering}} of doped <b>Madapolam</b> (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and several coats of red, followed by silver dope were added, {{followed by the}} final camouflage paint.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with <b>Madapolam</b> fabric and doped {{in a similar manner}} to the fuselage. The wing was {{installed}} into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Madapolam</b> is a {{soft cotton}} fabric {{manufactured}} from fine yarns with a dense pick {{laid out in}} linen weave. <b>Madapolam</b> is used as an embroidery and handkerchief fabric and {{as a base for}} fabric printing. [...] The equal warp and weft mean that the tensile strength and shrinkage is the same in any two directions at right angles and that the fabric absorbs liquids such as ink, paint and aircraft dope equally along its X and Y axes.|$|E
50|$|Dope {{has been}} applied to various {{aircraft}} fabrics, including <b>madapolam,</b> but also more recently on polyester and other fabrics with similar fine weave and absorbent qualities.|$|E
5000|$|Textiles in a linen weave texture, {{even when}} made of cotton, hemp and other non-flax fibers, are also loosely {{referred}} to as [...] "linen". Such fabrics generally also have their own specific names, for example fine cotton yarn in a linen-style weave is called <b>Madapolam.</b>|$|E
50|$|By the World War II era many {{aircraft}} {{designs were}} using metal monocoque structures {{due to their}} higher operating airspeeds, although fabric-covered control surfaces were still used on early mark Spitfires and other types. The Hawker Hurricane had a fabric covered fuselage, and they also had fabric covered wings until 1939. Many transports, bombers and trainers still used fabric, although the flammable nitrate dope was replaced with butyrate dope instead, which burns less readily. The Mosquito {{is an example of}} a fabric-covered (<b>Madapolam)</b> plywood aircraft. The Vickers Wellington used fabric over a geodesic airframe which offered good combat damage resistance.|$|E
50|$|During the joining of the {{two halves}} ("boxing up"), two {{laminated}} wooden clamps would {{be used in the}} after portion of the fuselage to act as support. A covering of doped <b>Madapolam</b> (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and a coat of silver dope was applied, after which the exterior camouflage was applied. The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out (braced during construction) that allowed the fuselage to be lowered onto the wing centre-section. After the wing was secured lower panels were replaced and the bomb bay or armament doors fitted.|$|E
50|$|Glues for the Mosquito wooden {{airframe}} {{were developed}} by Norman de Bruyne at his Duxford-based Aero Research Limited, which invented Araldite; the site is now owned by Hexcel. The Mosquito fuselage was made from two halves of balsawood (Ochroma) from Ecuador, and Canadian Birch, which had a <b>Madapolam</b> fabric over the surface; the wings were made from plywood and spruce. De Havilland built the Comet (the world's first jet airliner, first flying in July 1949 when piloted by John Cunningham, powered by DH jet engines, and designed by R.E. Bishop) at Hatfield, and built the Blue Streak rocket launcher at its Stevenage base; {{by the end of}} WWII the DH Goblin, designed by Frank Halford, was the world's most powerful jet engine. Ball bearings for the Merlin engine came from Hoffman of Chelmsford; its former site is now the Rivermead university campus. The first autoland system demonstrated on an airliner was with a BEA Trident at RAE Bedford in March 1964, with a system developed by Smiths Industries with similar work also done for the RAF at RAF Martlesham Heath; Plessey was a world leader in instrument landing systems (ILS). Rex Pierson from Norfolk, was the main designer for Vickers until the 1950s, designing the Vickers Vimy (which crossed the Atlantic in June 1919) to the Vickers Viscount, both pioneering aircraft. From 1945 to 1992, Rolls-Royce designed and built its helicopter (turboshaft) engines at its Small Engine Division at Leavesden, now a film set, these engines are now built by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca (from 1966). Britain's first satellite constructed in the UK - Ariel 3 (originally titled UK-3) - was built at BAC's Guided Weapon Division in Stevenage in the mid-1960s, later launched in May 1967. The Europa (rocket) was initially mostly British-led by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics at Stevenage and test-fired at Woomera Test Range in Australia, but later the subsequent Ariane (rocket family) would be mostly French-built and launched at Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana; Arianespace is 64% French and 20% German by ownership, and has no British share of ownership. The Rapier (missile) was developed by BAC (guided weapons division) at Stevenage (former English Electric).|$|E
