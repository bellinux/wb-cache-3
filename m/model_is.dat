5|$|A station <b>model</b> <b>is</b> a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station <b>model</b> <b>is</b> primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working <b>model</b> <b>is</b> related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working <b>model</b> <b>is</b> generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> the prey species. In the second case, the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> {{the host of a}} brood parasite.|$|E
30|$|For the two {{scenarios}} outlined above, {{three types}} of experiments are carried out to evaluate the impact of affect on both the acoustic and the linguistic models. In the first experiment, the acoustic <b>models</b> <b>are</b> adapted whereas the linguistic <b>models</b> <b>are</b> kept fixed. In the second experiment, it is the other way round: only the linguistic <b>models</b> <b>are</b> adapted and the acoustic <b>models</b> <b>are</b> kept constant. Finally, both the acoustic and linguistic <b>models</b> <b>are</b> adapted.|$|R
50|$|In the {{remainder}} of 2013, the following <b>models</b> <b>were</b> added: 420i, 420d, 425d, 430d and 435d. In 2014, the 418d <b>model</b> <b>was</b> added. Most <b>models</b> <b>were</b> available with all-wheel drive ("xDrive").|$|R
50|$|Brooklin Models Ltd, since 1974, is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of handmade white metal 1:43 scale miniature <b>models.</b> Selections <b>are</b> normally vintage American cars and trucks. Brooklin <b>Models</b> <b>is</b> located in Bath, England, and all <b>models</b> <b>are</b> currently produced there (Mateo 2007). Unlike high-volume, mass-produced models, all of Brooklin's <b>models</b> <b>are</b> hand-built in small quantities, {{and most of its}} <b>models</b> <b>are</b> made using white metal.|$|R
5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix <b>model</b> <b>is</b> the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix <b>model</b> <b>is</b> described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix <b>model</b> <b>is</b> exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{cutaway model}} of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The <b>model</b> <b>is</b> at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The <b>model</b> <b>is</b> true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (oil on canvas).|$|E
40|$|Climate <b>modeling</b> <b>is</b> {{discussed}} {{with emphasis on}} the control of major parameters in such modeling. Possible feedbacks which operate on long time scales and are therefore not testable directly, are also discussed. Examples of simplified <b>models</b> <b>are</b> presented.

25|$|The {{flexible}} simple point-charge water model (or flexible SPC water <b>model)</b> <b>is</b> a re-parametrization of the three-site SPC water model. The SPC <b>model</b> <b>is</b> rigid, whilst {{the flexible}} SPC <b>model</b> <b>is</b> flexible. In {{the model of}} Toukan and Rahman, the O–H stretching is made anharmonic, and thus the dynamical behavior is well described. This {{is one of the}} most accurate three-center water models without taking into account the polarization. In molecular dynamics simulations it gives the correct density and dielectric permittivity of water.|$|E

25|$|Two common {{methods of}} {{modeling}} are available: device physics-based model, equivalent circuits or macromodels. SPICE simulates IGBTs using a macromodel that combines an ensemble of components like FETs and BJTs in a Darlington configuration. An alternative physics-based <b>model</b> <b>is</b> the Hefner model, introduced by Allen Hefner of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Hefner's <b>model</b> <b>is</b> fairly complex that has shown very good results.
