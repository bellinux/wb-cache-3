40|$|Pavement <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> {{other than}} {{conventional}} paint must be evaluated as environmental standards become more restrictive. The new EPA classification for solvents states that all oil paints are photochemically reactive and, therefore, contribute to smog. This will eventually {{result in the}} elimination of organic solvents from all paints, which may occur in Iowa by 1985. The Special Investigations Section of the Office of Materials field reviewed all urban and rural applications of pavement <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> {{in the spring of}} 1979. The field review consisted of a visual estimation of percent marking missing, percent satisfactory, and percent non-satisfactory; reflective readings by ERMA; and notation of special conditions which may have impacted performance. ERMA was not effective in evaluating the reflective quality of pavement <b>marking</b> <b>materials.</b> No pavement <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> evaluated have been successful enough to date to totally replace conventional painting methods...|$|R

50|$|Graduations can {{be placed}} on an {{instrument}} by etching, scribing or engraving, painting, printing or other means. For durability and accuracy, etched or scribed marks are usually preferable to surface coatings such as paints and inks. Markings can {{be a combination of}} both physical marks such as a scribed line and a paint or other <b>marking</b> <b>material.</b> For example, it is common for black ink or paint to fill the grooves cut in a scribed rule. Inexpensive plastic devices can be molded and painted or molded with two or more colours of plastic used.

40|$|On {{federally funded}} projects, the Federal Highway Administration wants state highway {{maintenance}} engineers {{to justify their}} choice of pavement <b>marking</b> <b>material</b> and show how it is better than alternative materials in the application environment {{in which it is}} being proposed. However, a convenient method of conducting such a comparison is not available. In this study, a model is described which allows comparison of the relative value of alternative pavement marking materials given the existing conditions at the application site such as pavement surface type, remaining pavement service life, traffic volume, line type, and line color. The model compares alternative pavement marking materials in terms of their benefit-cost ratio over the useful life of the material.

40|$|As the new {{millennium}} approaches, signing and <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> continue to evolve. Recent efforts to increase {{the safety of the}} motoring public include the use of improved delineation materials. PERFORMANCE If the current and future state of the art for signing and <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> could be summarized in one word, that word would be performance. Quantifiable material performance requirements are relatively new to this industry, which is more than 70 years old. In the {{new millennium}}, performance of signing and <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> will be measured day and night, and during clear and inclement weather. Improved signing and <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> will be part of some new Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) initiatives; development is already under way in the ITS arena. Sign performance will be measured by its durability and utility (that is, how easily it is viewed by motorists) in real situations. New <b>marking</b> and signing <b>materials</b> to improve roadway delineation are currently under evaluation. Improvements The use of durable <b>marking</b> <b>materials</b> instead of standard paint and beads has increased recently. Because maintenance funds continue to be squeezed, this trend will extend into {{the new millennium}}. One new concept under development is pavement marking management systems, which allow choice of pavement-marking materials on the basis of field performance and optimal use. Some agencies have moved away from in-house striping to contractors whose materials must meet specified performance criteria. Additionally, at least 10 state departments of transportation require a minimum retroreflective performance on markings newly applied by contractors. Some initial attempts have been made at warrantee contracts for pavement markings, which hold the contractor responsible for the long-term retroreflective performance of the installed <b>material.</b> The Pavement <b>Marking</b> Committee of the American Traffic Safety Services Association is developing a generic warrantee application specification to help agencies develop their own requirements. This generic specification should be finalized by the Pavement Marking Committee’s first meeting in the new millennium...|$|R

40|$|Waterborne paints {{are used}} to paint {{pavement}} markings (edgelines and centerlines) to provide guidance for motorists. The painted markings need to be repainted periodically as their retro-reflectivity deteriorates. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) repaints pavement markings at least annually. INDOT engineers would like to determine the feasibility of extending the time intervals of repainting pavement markings on at least some types of roadways. The purpose of this synthesis study is to accomplish the following: (1) to locate and assemble documented information on pavement marking durability; (2) to learn what criteria {{have been used in}} other states in measuring retro-reflectivity and scheduling pavement marking painting; (3) to determine the necessity of conducting full scale study on INDOT pavement markings; (4) to identify the type and cost of equipment required for retro-reflectivity measurements and conditions of operation of the equipment; (5) to organize, evaluate, and document the useful information that is acquired; and (6) to provide recommendations based on the evaluated information. This report presents the findings of the synthesis study on various pavement <b>marking</b> <b>materials.</b> It was found in this study that many state highway agencies have evaluated several types of pavement <b>marking</b> <b>materials.</b> The evaluation results include performance, cost, service life, and retro-reflectivity measuring equipment of <b>marking</b> <b>materials.</b> However, the results could vary from different sates.

40|$|European otter (Lutra lutra) scent marks (spraint and anal sac {{secretion}} material) from captive {{and wild}} animals were analysed using solvent extraction and solid phase micro extraction (SPME). An ageing study (using SPME) mapped spraint chemical composition changes following deposition and how low temperature storage {{and exposure to}} the environment affected these changes. Chemicals with opposite time dependence were found; providing a possible spraint ageing mechanism. Temperature and environmental conditions affected the rates of production and deterioration of these chemicals and therefore the accuracy of spraint age estimations. Identification of the fatty acid content of otter scent <b>marking</b> <b>material</b> from 4 otter species led to both intra-specific (L. lutra) and inter-specific (Canadian river, Lontra canadensis; Asian short claw, Aonyx cinerea; and Giant, Pteronura brasiliensis) comparisons. Low volatility fatty acids (C 10 -C 24. 1) were found in all scent mark types. Intra-specifically, differentiation was seen in spraint fatty acid profiles based on sexual identity. Differentiation was observed between L. lutra scent <b>marking</b> <b>material</b> types (Captive spraint; Wild spraint; Wild anal sac secretion). Inter-specific differences relied on a mixture of ?digital? and ?analogue? coding. SPME and gas chromatography ? mass spectrometry (GCMS) were used to investigate intra- (L. lutra) and inter- specific (L. lutra, A. cinerea, L. canadensis, and badger, Meles meles) differences in the headspace chemicals of otter scent marks. Inter-sanctuary (possibly diet related) differences in spraint odour of L. lutra were seen.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in electrophotography and inkjet printing are imposing greater demands on requirements for paper performance. Paper requirements are generally classed as runnability, printability and usability.

40|$|Pavement marking is a {{delineation}} practice that, until recently, has {{not been}} emphasized as much as other forms of delineation. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is currently {{in the process of}} determining if there should be minimum retroreflectivity criteria for pavement markings. If these criteria become mandatory, road management agencies will be forced to understand the retroreflectivity of edge lines and centerlines and the retention of retroreflectivity with exposure to weather, snowplowing, road salt and sand, and traffic density. The three key characteristics of greatest interest when selecting a <b>marking</b> <b>material</b> are: durability, retroreflectivity, and cost.
