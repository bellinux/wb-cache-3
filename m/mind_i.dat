25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Before Mary Godwin, Clairmont, and Shelley {{had left}} for the Continent, Imlay and Mary had had a major {{argument}} and no chance {{to come to a}} reconciliation. Imlay attempted in her letters to Mary to smooth over the relationship, but her sense of loneliness and isolation in London was palpable. She wrote to Mary of [...] "the dreadful state of <b>mind</b> <b>I</b> generally labour under & which I in vain endeavour to get rid of". Many scholars attribute Imlay's increasing unhappiness to Mrs Godwin's hostility towards her. Kegan, and others, contend that Imlay was subject to the same [...] "extreme depression to which her mother had been subject, and which marked other members of the Wollstonecraft family".

[...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} Hour Glass, [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album."

[...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your <b>mind</b> ... <b>I</b> foolishly didn't know you had one.

[...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E

And {{the fact of the matter}} is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E

I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E
500|$|In the interim, Hoppus and Barker {{continued}} {{playing music}} together in +44. The group {{first began to}} lay down electronic demos in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room shortly after the breakup. +44's debut, When Your Heart Stops Beating, was released the following year but stalled commercially and received mixed reviews. Barker starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers with his then-wife, former Miss USA Shanna Moakler. The couple's later split, reconciliation and subsequent breakup made them tabloid favorites. Meanwhile, DeLonge disappeared from public eye, making no appearances, granting no interviews and remaining silent until September 2005, when he announced his new project, Angels & Airwaves, promising [...] "the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation." [...] He later revealed he was addicted to painkillers at the time, recalling [...] "I was losing my <b>mind,</b> <b>I</b> was on thousands of painkillers, and I almost killed myself," [...] and {{did not realize that}} his promise of revolution sounded highly ambitious. The group released two albums in 2006 and 2007: We Don't Need to Whisper and I-Empire. During the hiatus, Hoppus shifted his attention to producing albums (most notably Commit This to Memory by former tour-mate Motion City Soundtrack) and hosting his podcast, HiMyNameisMark, while Barker launched a shoe line and worked on three other musical projects—the Transplants, +44, and TRV$DJAM, a collaboration with friend Adam Goldstein (DJ AM).|$|E
500|$|I Am... (January 2002) marked several {{milestones}} for Hamasaki.
