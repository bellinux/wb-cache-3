40|$|Using {{information}} on 31 in-depth cases of individual M&A deals, {{we show that}} technological and market-relatedness between M&A partners distinctly affects the inputs, outputs, performance and organisational structure of the R&D process. While the findings {{in the literature on}} the effect of M&A on R&D are quite mixed, we can sharpen results by analysing data {{at the level of the}} R&D process. This comes at the price of a smaller sample and more qualitative data, for which caution in the interpretation is necessary. M&A between partners with ex-ante complementary technologies result in more active R&D performers after the M&A. In sharp contrast, when <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> are technologically substitutive, they significantly decrease their R&D level after the M&A. Moreover, R&D efficiency increases more prominently when <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> are technologically complementary than when they are substitutive. These two findings on the R&D level and the performance support the scope economy effect of M&A, on the one hand, and reject the scale economy effect of M&A, on the other. Next, for cases in which partners were active in the same technological fields before the M&A, the reduction of R&D is more prominent, while the R&D efficiency gain is smaller if <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> were rivals in the product market prior to their merger than if they were non-rival. This suggests that rival firms reap little technology gains from mergers. status: publishe...|$|R

Its stock trades under the UAL symbol.

25|$|The Broadcasting Act of 1990 instigated the 1991 {{franchise}} auction round, {{in which}} companies had {{to bid for}} the regions. Mersey Television, a company producing the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside, bid £35m compared to Granada's £9m but Granada won as Mersey's package {{did not meet the}} 'quality threshold' applied by the Independent Television Commission. This requirement disadvantaged companies with no previous franchise experience. Granada owned popular television series such as Coronation Street, which it threatened to sell to satellite TV if the franchise was lost. The government responded by relaxing the regulatory regime, so that ITV contractors could take over other companies, and Granada bought several companies. Some at the company considered ITV could survive only as a single <b>merged</b> <b>entity</b> to have sufficient resources to produce big-budget programmes, a concern that increased when BSkyB began to take ITV's viewing share, leading to less advertising revenue, the source of ITV's income.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{economic}} concerns {{and the effect}} of migration from rural areas on the number of participants, leading to difficulties fielding teams, has meant that clubs from smaller neighbouring towns are electing to merge rather than disband completely, thus in 2006 two <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> competed for the first time, the Brocklesby Burrumbuttock Football Club and the Rand Walbundrie Football Club.|$|R

30|$|Similarly the {{horizontal}} integrations can {{be motivated by}} a defensive strategy (1 b) which may consists of: (i) preventing being taken-over; (ii) preventing the target from being taken over by others; (iii) avoiding other <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> in the industry from becoming too strong [19].

25|$|Another {{trend that}} began {{during this period}} was the {{phenomenon}} of NRL clubs 'out-sourcing' competing teams, with several NRL clubs choosing not to field sides in this competition and rather field either <b>merged</b> <b>entities</b> (as in the St Marys Penrith Cougars and Balmain Ryde Eastwood Tigers, both formed with NSWRL Jim Beam Cup sides) or form agreements with another club {{to take their place}} in the competition, those players being eligible for NRL selection, such as the agreement between Newtown Jets and Sydney Roosters for the 2006 season.|$|R
