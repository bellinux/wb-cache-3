5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E

25|$|By 1924, Jones was {{in court}} again, this time facing charges of libel, slander, and sedition. In 1925, Charles A. Albert, {{publisher}} of the fledgling Chicago Times, won a $350,000 judgment against Jones. Jones remained a union organizer for the UMW into the 1920s and continued to speak on union affairs almost until she died. She released her own account of her experiences in the labor movement as The Autobiography of Mother Jones (1925). During her later years, Jones lived with her friends Walter and Lillie May Burgess on their farm {{in what is now}} Adelphi, Maryland.

This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point. For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games.

25|$|In 1927, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} that case that {{illegally}} earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected {{the argument that the}} Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income. The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided. Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with income tax evasion, as well as with various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On {{the second day of the}} trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for Capone.|$|E

500|$|The {{barrister}} Clare Montgomery QC of Matrix Chambers {{considered the}} wider {{implications of the}} decision, wondering whether it might lead to claims against other participants in the legal process being allowed. [...] She asked rhetorically if a police officer who owed a duty of care to an individual might now be liable when giving evidence or <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> that was a breach of that duty. [...] "The process of whittling away {{the scope of the}} immunity available to protect the participants in judicial processes appears to be far from over", she said.

500|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of A Minor with a time {{signature}} in common time. Jackson's vocal range spans from G3 to C6. The track has a tempo of 114 beats per minute. [...] "Bad" [...] {{was viewed as a}} rived [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] progression. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented on the track's lyrical content while reviewing Bad, [...] "When Jackson declares that 'the whole world has to answer right now,' he is not boasting but <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare." [...] Sigerson compared the track to material by James Brown, whose [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song. Lyrically, [...] "Bad" [...] pertains to proving to people that you are tough boasting, with Jackson asking [...] "who's bad?" [...] in a repeating lyric in the song's chorus.|$|E
500|$|By late 1637, the {{conclusion}} of the controversy was beginning to take shape. [...] During the court held in early November, Wheelwright was finally sentenced to banishment, the delay caused by the hopes that he would, at some point, recant. [...] On 7 November the trial of Anne Hutchinson began, and Wilson was there with most of the other ministers in the colony, though his role was somewhat restrained. [...] During {{the second day of the}} trial, when things seemed to be going in her favor, Hutchinson insisted on <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> admitting that her knowledge of things had come from a divine inspiration, prophesying her deliverance from the proceedings, and announcing that a curse would befall the colony. [...] This was all that her judges needed to hear, and she was accused of heresy and sentenced to banishment, though she would be held in detention for four months, awaiting a trial by the clergy. [...] While no statements made by Wilson were recorded in either existing transcript of this trial, Wilson did make a speech against Hutchinson at the end of the proceedings, to which Hutchinson responded with anger four months later during her church trial.|$|E

[...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy.

500|$|Like its predecessor, many of {{the songs}} on the album have {{political}} and military undertones.

[...] "Symphony of Destruction", with lyrics written by Dave Mustaine, details a story about a regular citizen as the head of a puppet regime, as the country is run by a phantom government. The song was noted by critics for its great social and philosophical impact. [...] "Architecture of Aggression" [...] explores the nature of global conflict; Mustaine revealed that the song was about former Iraq president Saddam Hussein, who was engaged in the Gulf War at the time. [...] "Foreclosure of a Dream" [...] deals with economic concerns and social inequality. According to music critic Eduardo Rivaldivia, [...] "perhaps no other Megadeth song in history deals as directly and soberly" [...] with these issues. The song sampled then-U.S. President George H.

500|$|The {{cockatoo}} {{would have}} been a rare bird at the time, [...] "and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this". It did not become well-known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of Captain Cook in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatoos had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (Mr & Mrs William Chase) and a separate study, The Parrot. In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the [...] "lungs-glass", but was perhaps <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> about the values of society in the Age of Enlightenment. The white plumage of the cockatoo also shows much more effectively in the darkened room than the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early oil sketch. A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the Trinity found in Early Netherlandish painting, where the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove, to which God the Father (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.|$|E
500|$|This re-appropriation of {{established}} texts, resources, and artistic properties {{to tell a}} story or make a statement {{is an example of a}} semiotic phenomenon known as intertextuality or resemiosis. [...] A more common term for this phenomenon is “parody”, but not all of these intertextual productions are intended for humor or satire, as demonstrated by the Few Good G-Men video. Furthermore, the argument of how well-protected machinima is under the guise of parody or satire is still highly debated; a piece of machinima may be reliant upon a protected property, but may not necessarily be <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> about that property. Therefore, it is more accurate to refer to it simply as resemiosis, because it takes an artistic work and presents it in a new way, form, or medium. This resemiosis can be manifested in a number of ways. The machinima-maker can be considered an author who restructures the story and/or the world that the chosen game engine is built around. In the popular web series Red vs. Blue, most of the storyline takes place within the game engine of [...] and its subsequent sequels. [...] has an extensive storyline already, but Red vs. Blue only ever makes mention of this storyline once in the first episode. [...] Even after over 200 episodes of the show being broadcast onto the Internet since 2003, the only real similarities that can be drawn between Red vs. Blue and the game-world it takes place in are the character models, props, vehicles, and settings. Yet Burnie Burns and the machinima team at Rooster Teeth created an extensive storyline of their own using these game resources.|$|E

Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball.
