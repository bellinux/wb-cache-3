50|$|The Baltimore Mine Tunnel Disaster {{occurred}} on June 5, 1919 {{just inside the}} <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tunnel</b> No. 2. The mine was located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania just {{about a mile from}} the center of the city. Ninety-two miners were killed in the explosion, which was caused by the ignition of black blasting powder, while another 44 were injured. Only 7 miners escaped without injury.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of {{traditional}} construction method {{in the construction}} {{at the mouth of}} underground engineering has characteristics such as slow rate of construction progress and poor defense property, mouth section of underground engineering avoid incision and reinforced technology was proposed. Basic principle and construction progress of avoid incision and reinforced technology was analyzed too. Combining with engineering example, avoid incision and reinforced technology was found to be able to improve the rate of construction progress and combing disguise and defense with weak rock-soil reinforced together well at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Through improving structure resisting force and reducing the probability of discovery on the mouth of defense engineering tunnel, the defense ability of the mouth of cave depot was improved...|$|E
50|$|The rapid, {{high-volume}} discharge {{is highly}} erosive, {{as evidenced by}} the debris found in tunnels and at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnels,</b> which tends to be coarse rocks and boulders. This erosive environment is consistent with creation <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> over 400 m deep and 2.5 km wide, as have been observed in the Antarctic.|$|R

5000|$|Analyses by Piotrowski {{demonstrate}} that the annual production of water from one typical catchment of [...] would normally drain through its associated tunnel valley in less than 48 hours. The debris found in tunnels and at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> tends to be coarse rocks and boulders - this is indicative of high flow velocities and an extremely erosive environment. This erosive environment is consistent with creation <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> over 400 m deep and 2.5 km wide, as have been observed in the Antarctic. Piotrowski’s model predicts a cycle as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} 1.40 km from Arendal Station at 21.2 m above mean sea level, and 316.23 km from Oslo Central Station. [...] It was {{located at the}} western <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Barbu <b>Tunnel.</b>|$|R

50|$|The portal <b>of</b> the Quakake <b>Tunnel</b> is in {{severely}} fractured red shale. Timbering {{is required}} to support the tunnel at this location. Other varieties of rocks are found deeper into the tunnel. Sandstone belonging to the Pottsville Formation is found from 1450 ft above the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tunnel</b> to 1800 ft above the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tunnel.</b> From this area up to 2000 ft from the tunnel's mouth, the tunnel is mostly in conglomerate rock.

Other rock types found deeper than 2000 ft include red shale, gray shale, and sandstone.|$|R

50|$|The tunnel has anti-{{freezing}} gates (Kuldeport) which {{close the}} <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tunnel</b> {{in the winter}} to avoid the freezing of any leaking water. These gates open automatically when cars approach and are permanently open in the summer, when traffic is denser.|$|R
