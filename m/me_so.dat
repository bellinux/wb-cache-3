40|$|A colloid-free, reduced {{pressure}} in vitro normothermic perfusion system {{was developed to}} assess rabbit kidney function following cryobiological manipulation. Rabbit kidneys retained significant levels of function with stable or increasing GFR, sodium reabsorption of 40 to 60 %, and glucose reabsorption of greater than 80 % of the filtered load. Including dextran in the perfusate {{as a source of}} colloid osmotic pressure was deleterious to kidney function. The kidney demonstrated sensitivity to exogenous energy substrate; supplementation of lactate and glucose resulted in better function over butyrate with glucose or glucose alone. The system proved sensitive to ischemia and to stimulation with an antidiuretic preparation. This system was utilized {{to examine the effects of}} treatment of rabbit kidneys with dimethylsulfoxide(Me(, 2) SO). A recirculating constant pressure hypothermic (10 (DEGREES) C) perfusion apparatus was assembled and kidneys were perfused with potassium-rich, sodium-poor solution with elevated glucose and mannitol. The pharmacokinetics of 3 M <b>Me(,</b> 2) <b>SO</b> equilibration was studied through estimation of the inulin and <b>Me(,</b> 2) <b>SO</b> spaces using radiochemical markers. Medullary tissue equilibration was achieved prior to cortical equilibration, which was complete after 35 minutes of exposure to 3 M <b>Me(,</b> 2) <b>SO.</b> <b>Me(,</b> 2) <b>SO</b> perfusion resulted in increased fluid retention by the kidney.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{amiloride}} (an inhibitor of passive Na+ transport in many tissues) on the differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells was investigated. Amiloride completely blocked the dimethyl sulfoxide (<b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO)</b> -induced erythroid differentiation of cells at a concentration (10 microgram/ml) {{that did not}} affect cell proliferation. Amiloride also prevented the decrease in cell volume normally observed afte a 20 -hr exposure to <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO.</b> The ratio of total cell Na+ to total cell water was essentially the same for control cells, Me 2 SO-treated cells, and cells treated with <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> plus amiloride. However, cells treated for 24 hr with <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> had a rate of Ca 2 + uptake that was twice that of untreated cells and a similarly higher Ca 2 + content. Addition of amiloride plus <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> prevented both the increase in Ca 2 + uptake rate {{and the increase in}} Ca 2 + content. Cells grown in the presence of <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> plus amiloride initiated differentiation immediately after removal of amiloride or addition of the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 (1 microgram/ml). Addition of sufficient ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to reduce free extracellular Ca 2 + to submicromolar levels prevented Me 2 SO-induced differentiation while only slightly affecting cell proliferation. These results suggest that an increase in in the Ca 2 + level is an essential step in <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> induction, that amiloride either directly or indirectly inhibits this process, and that <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> has an early effect on cells that is necessary for differentiation and is not mimicked by A 23187...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purified}} Ca 2 +-ATPase of pig red cells {{displays a}} phosphatase activity towards p-nitrophenylphosphate which is inhibited by Ca 2 + {{in the absence}} of solvents, and activated by calmodulin. This activity has been attributed to the E 2 conformation of the enzyme. Here we show that the pNPPase activity {{in the absence of}} Ca 2 + is stimulated 10 – 25 -fold by the presence of the organic solvent dimethylsulfoxide (<b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO).</b> This is an activation that surpasses by severalfold that induced by calmodulin {{in the absence of the}} solvent. At 30 % <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO,</b> activation by calmodulin disappears. In the absence of calmodulin and at pH 7. 2, the Ca 2 + concentration needed for half-maximal inhibition of the pNPPase activity (Ki) increases from 130 μM in the absence of <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> to 860 μM at 30 % <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO.</b> This effect of <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> is enhanced at pH 8. 0 : the Ki for Ca 2 + increases from 2. 7 μM in the absence of the solvent to 2. 0 mM in its presence. However, the K 0. 5 for Ca 2 + activation of the ATPase activity decreases from 8. 3 to 2. 6 μM following addition of the same <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> concentration. This indicates that, even in the presence of <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO,</b> μM Ca 2 + concentrations shift the equilibrium towards E 1 but the decrease in activity that would be expected if pNPP hydrolysis were catalysed exclusively by the E 2 conformation is not observed. The affinity for pNPP as a substrate increases from 2. 6 mM in the absence of <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> to 1. 6 mM in the presence of 20 % <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO.</b> These results suggest that <b>Me</b> 2 <b>SO</b> induces multiple effects in the Ca 2 +-ATPase that: (i) increase the reactivity of E 2 towards substrate; (ii) surpass the activation by calmodulin and, (iii) allow the enzyme to hydrolyze pNPP even when Ca 2 + is bound to the high-affinity sites of the enzyme. The change in reactivity is attributed to an increase on substrate catalysis rather than on pNPP binding...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: One {{major concern}} of {{grafting}} cryopreserved ovarian tissue to restore fertility in cancer patients {{is the possibility}} of reintroducing tumor cells. Cryopreservation of isolated primordial/primary follicles (PFs) may circumvent this problem. The aim of our work was to compare dimethyl sulfoxide (<b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO)</b> and ethylene glycol (EG) as cryoprotectants (CPAs) for slow-freezing of isolated human PFs in alginate. METHODS: Ovarian biopsies from four women were processed for follicle isolation. PFs were embedded in alginate (5 - 15 per group). Follicles were frozen-thawed using 1. 4 M <b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO</b> or 1. 5 M EG as CPAs. Fresh and cryopreserved isolated follicles were in vitro cultured (IVC) for 7 days. At different time periods (after isolation, cryopreservation and IVC), follicles were evaluated with live/dead assay (using fluorescent probes) and diameter measurement. Follicle viability was calculated according to the percentage of dead follicular cells and the presence of a live/dead oocyte. RESULTS: A total of 841 PFs were isolated, embedded in alginate and cryopreserved with <b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO</b> (n= 424) or EG (n= 259), or used as controls (n= 158). After 7 days of IVC, a significant increase in follicle size was observed in the fresh and <b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO</b> groups, but not in the EG group. The percentage of totally viable PFs was not significantly different before or after seven days of culture in fresh (100 % and 82 %) or <b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO</b> (93. 2 % and 85. 1 %) tissue. The EG group showed significantly lower viability before (63. 9 %) and after IVC (66. 2 %) than the fresh and <b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO</b> groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 1. 4 M <b>ME</b> 2 <b>SO</b> yields better preservation of isolated PF viability after thawing and 7 days of IVC than 1. 5 M EG.
