To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America.|$|E
5|$|Oil tankers {{are only}} one source of oil spills. According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery spills. Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills but more than 60% of the volume. Tanker spills are much more rare and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> than spills from non-tank vessels.|$|E
5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc family company and did not allow him to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became {{one of a group of}} young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.|$|E

5|$|The Castilians held Gibraltar {{for over}} twenty years, {{until a new}} deal was struck in 1333 between the Nasrid sultan Muhammad IV of Granada and the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman of Morocco. Moroccan forces crossed the strait to Algeciras and began the third siege of Gibraltar in 1333. This was a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> effort, lasting {{four and a half}} months, and was mounted by a {{combined}} Granadan-Moroccan force. The population of Spanish Christians was reduced to eating their own shoes and belts before the town's governor, Vasco Pérez de Meira, surrendered on 17 June 1333. However, Muhammad IV was assassinated almost immediately after, in a conspiracy organized by enemies of the Marinids in the Granadan court. The Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan retained both Algeciras and Gibraltar in Moroccan hands.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

Their new single, [...] "Of Sacrifice, Loss and Reward", {{was released}} on February 20, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Much</b> <b>more</b> popular then <b>serious</b> {{newspapers}} were the 429 short-lived satirical publications {{poking fun at}} the tsarist regime. They were targets of government censorship, as were the underground left-wing newspapers published by revolutionary parties.|$|R

25|$|A {{series of}} {{injunctions}} against the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System imposed in April 1970 created {{the possibility that}} the oil from these fields would be stranded. Among a variety of potential solutions being offered, Boeing started a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> evaluation of the airlift concept. It was noticed early on that two important factors had not been fully considered earlier.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 the NP249 was {{replaced}} with the New Venture Gear NV249 transfer case. This added a mechanical differential lock to 4WD Low mode, making it <b>much</b> <b>more</b> durable for <b>serious</b> off-road use. The NV249-based Quadra-Trac system {{was replaced}} by the NV247-based Quadra-Trac II system for the 1999 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ).|$|R
50|$|The Games Machine {{launched}} {{in the autumn of}} 1987. It was Newsfield's first multi-format games magazine, intended to be a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> informative, <b>serious</b> rival to the popular Computer and Video Games publication. The first batch of issues attempted to broaden its appeal by featuring articles on non-gaming products, such as remote controlled cars and high-tech gadgets, but it soon narrowed its focus to concentrate exclusively on games. The magazine continued for thirty-four issues before finally folding in 1990, having been consigned to the margins by Future Publishing's more robust ACE publication.|$|R
25|$|In the meantime, {{during summer}} of 1971, Čolić finally met {{face to face}} with Kornelije Kovač who came to see Čolić play in Mostar and invited him to join his Korni grupa as {{replacement}} to their departed singer Dado Topić. Unlike Amabasadori, Korni grupa performed their own material and generally had a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> studious and <b>serious</b> approach to music, so Čolić immediately jumped at the opportunity.|$|R
25|$|The loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the Prose Edda, Freyr had {{to fight}} Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler. But the result at Ragnarök, {{the end of the}} world, will be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious.</b> Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant Surtr and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated. In the Íslendingabók, Freyr's sword is known as Sumarbrandr.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{attacked}} Belfast {{three times}} in 1941. The first air raid was {{on the night of}} 7/8 April. Although some doors and windows were blown out, little damage was done to NCC installations. An attack in greater force on the night of 15/16 April was a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> affair. York Road station was hit, the facade suffering considerable damage. The general stores department and various offices were burned out.|$|E
25|$|Hazlitt's {{sketch of}} Crabbe has drawn <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> {{interest}} by recent critics than the companion sketch on Campbell. Tim Fulford assents to Hazlitt's observation that Crabbe viewed his poor villagers {{from a distance}} ("as an overseer of the poor"; the words are from his lectures on poetry but the idea was brought forward into The Spirit of the Age), rather than showing the reader what they feel about their situation.|$|E
60|$|My {{injuries}} were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> showy than <b>serious,</b> and I {{could have been}} taken to Lady Grove next day, but Beatrice would not permit that, and kept me at Bedley Corner three clear days. In the afternoon of the second day she became extremely solicitous for the proper aeration of the nurse, packed her off for an hour in a brisk rain, and sat by me alone.|$|R
60|$|But Miss Fosbrook thought David {{like the}} oldest {{person in the}} house-- {{infinitely}} older than John, who could do nothing better than he except running and bawling, {{and a good deal}} older than even Hal and Sam.

5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was <b>much</b> {{longer and}} <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> {{for both the}} Romans and Samnites. The {{fortunes}} of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. But the Romans won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|R
25|$|Early {{efforts to}} {{establish}} a federally owned museum featuring African-American history and culture {{can be traced to}} 1915, although the modern push for such an organization did not begin until the 1970s. After years of little success, a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> legislative push began in 1988 that led to authorization of the museum in 2003. A site was selected in 2006. The museum opened September 24, 2016, in a ceremony led by U.S. President Barack Obama.|$|E
25|$|Brown has {{successfully}} dealt with many F-22 emergencies including a fuel leak at 30,000 feet while traveling at nearly {{the speed of}} sound. On another flight, a mechanical problem affected {{one of the two}} jet engines shortly after take off. Aware of a similar situation that resulted in the loss of an F-117, Brown idled the ailing engine rather than shut it down. The second engine began losing power during the landing approach. Brown's unconventional technique to handling the initial problem allowed him to narrowly avoid a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> situation.|$|E
25|$|Every apology is, however, due to {{the reader}} for the hasty and {{imperfect}} execution of the plates. Having <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> work in hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot. I shall be grateful if the reader will in such cases refer the expressions of praise to the Architecture, {{and not to the}} illustrations.|$|E
50|$|Suwałki Region (Suwalszczyzna, Suvalkų kraštas, Suvalkija) {{is a small}} region {{around the}} city of Suwałki (known in Lithuanian as Suvalkai) in northeastern Poland near the border with Lithuania. The {{territory}} was disputed between Poland and Lithuania after World War I. This dispute was {{the main cause of}} the brief Polish-Lithuanian War and the Sejny Uprising. The conflict was later overshadowed by a <b>much</b> larger and <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> Polish-Lithuanian dispute over the Vilnius Region. The Suwałki Region remains a major center of the Lithuanian minority in Poland.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{water supply}} {{planning}} has changed greatly in recent decades, and has generally become a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> technically <b>serious</b> endeavor. (Urban water supply {{has always been}} a politically serious endeavor, with abundant sources of uncertainty (Lund, 1988 a, b).) Yet for all the serious and fine technical work and research on urban water supply engineering and economics, it often seems that such work has not provided a clear unified approach for combining the many technical measures available for water supply system planning and management. This report seeks to provide such a unified analytical approach, addressing the integrated economical use of yield enhancement, water transfer, and demand management measures in a context of risk and uncertainty from many hydrologic and institutional sources...|$|R
5000|$|Mutations was {{produced}} by Nigel Godrich, who was well-known at that point for his previous work with Radiohead. The album contains a number of Moog keyboards, acoustic guitars, and string arrangements. The production style {{was very different from}} that of his previous album Odelay, which was heavily influenced by hip hop music and contained many samples. The lyrical content of Mutations is also <b>much</b> <b>more</b> somber and <b>serious</b> than that on Odelay, apparent in the songs [...] "Nobody's Fault But My Own" [...] and [...] "Dead Melodies".|$|R
25|$|Many {{alternative}} therapies and interventions are available, ranging from elimination diets to chelation therapy. Few {{are supported by}} scientific studies. Treatment approaches lack empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Even {{if they do not}} help, conservative treatments such as changes in diet are expected to be harmless aside from their bother and cost. Dubious invasive treatments are a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> matter: for example, in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old boy with autism.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} three young men in their twenties: Martin Buber of Vienna, student of {{philosophy}} and Zionist; Berthold Feiwel of Berlin – political writer and editor and Chaim Weizmann – formed a caucus emphasizing {{the need for a}} Jewish university with a first objective of education in technology. They produced a document pointing out the difficulties of Jewish youth who sought admission to universities where they lived. The lack of opportunities for technical studies, they wrote, was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> for Jewish students than in other studies. The problem was “eminiently economic and social”. It meant that in Russia, the Jews were practically excluded from technical professions with the result that they were pushed into commercial occupations.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria may {{secondarily}} colonize the socket, {{and lead}} to further dissolution of the clot. Bacterial breakdown and fibrinolysis are widely accepted as a major contributing factors {{to the loss of}} the clot. Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces. This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become necrotic. The necrotic bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by osteoclasts and fragmentary sequestra may form. The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance to this process. When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, this is a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> condition.|$|E
50|$|Markesh is serious, dignified, {{and very}} protective. He {{has a strong}} sense of duty, and is perhaps more than {{anything}} else, secretive. He is so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> careful and <b>serious</b> than Retrab that it seems nearly impossible that she is 5 years older than he is. He is an excellent fighter and alchemist. He likes spicy food, nature, and sleep, hates sweets, crowds, and bright lights. It is revealed in issue six of the manga that Markesh's face looks almost exactly like his father's, except for two distinguishing scars above and below his left eye.|$|R
5000|$|A {{young girl}} who {{previously}} lived with a foster family. She {{was the victim of}} abuse both by the adults and their two other children, living with them until Michiko came to her rescue. She is hesitant to trust the woman, but they share the same tattoo on their stomachs. Unlike Michiko, Hatchin is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> levelheaded and <b>serious,</b> often functioning as the voice of reason of the two. Despite Michiko often putting her in danger due to her destructive habits and her sometimes irrational plans, Hatchin grows to care deeply for her.|$|R
50|$|Notably, {{all of the}} {{characters}} featured have undergone enormous personality changes since their last appearances: Effy has cast her party-hard lifestyle and issues aside, and has become more mature and ambitious. Naomi has lost much of her ambition as a principled young woman {{and is now a}} layabout and stoner. Emily has become more confident. Cassie has overcome her mental issues, but has become solitary, serious, principled and tired, and Cook has become <b>much</b> <b>more</b> subdued, <b>serious</b> and calculated, as a result of having spent years on the run. In addition, the series leaves behind its traditional setting in Bristol, moving to the less familiar cities of London (around Canary Wharf in Fire, and near Finchley Road in Pure) and Manchester (in Rise). Its subject matter moves on from teenage problems to more adult issues, such as insider trading, terminal illness, rough living and the criminal underworld.|$|R
