5|$|In January 1990, Gassée {{resigned}} and his authority over product development was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers {{had long been}} pressing for lower-cost options {{in order to build}} <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>and</b> increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E

We use a longitudinal data set to calculate the effects on aggregate manufacturing productivity growth from improvements within establishments, from reallocation of <b>market</b> <b>shares,</b> <b>and</b> from the turnover of plants. Productivity growth is mainly explained by reallocation of <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> from turnover of plants. Moreover, the foreign contribution to productivity growth is unclear and depends on the choice of productivity measure. A cautious conclusion is that the foreign contribution {{is about the same}} size as the foreign share of manufacturing output.

According to the airline, it is a planned strategy due to the tough aviation environment in India and to focus on maintaining profitability rather than on capturing <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>and</b> increasing the destinations and fleet size. As of February 2016, it remains the fifth largest carrier in the country with an 8% market share. The airline is planning for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2016.

40|$|Most {{previous}} studies {{of the dynamics of}} industry structure, by emphasizing changes in concentration, conceal much of the nature of underlying competitive processes. Here we employ a stochastic firm growth model, estimated on U. K. data of 1979 - 1986 for over 200 leading firms, to derive joint predictions about the stability of <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> the change of concentration. We find that changes in the <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> of surviving firms are the dominant influence on concentration, which is typically fairly stable in spite of considerable market-share turbulence. Advertising {{plays a major role in}} the dynamics of <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, affects both concentration and turbulence. © 1997 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} to merger simulations used in antitrust cases is to calibrate demand from <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> a few additional parameters. When the products {{involved in the}} merger case are differentiated along several dimensions, the resulting diversion ratios may {{be very different from}} those based upon <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> This again may affect the predicted post-merger price effects. This article shows how merger simulation can be improved by using observed diversion ratios. To illustrate the effects of this approach we use diversion ratios from a local grocery market in Norway. In this case diversions from the acquired to the acquiring stores were considerably smaller than suggested by <b>market</b> <b>shares,</b> <b>and</b> the predicted average price increase from the acquisition was 40 % lower using this model rather than a model based upon <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> This analysis also suggests that even a subset of observed diversion ratios may significantly change the prediction from a merger simulation based upon <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> Merger simulation; diversion ratio; asymmetric differentiation; merger policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The multimarket contact {{hypothesis}} {{holds that}} more contacts between firms {{competing in the}} same markets may induce more collusion. This paper tests the hypothesis for the Italian banking market, analysing the behaviour of the largest Italian banks from 1990 to 1996. Market rivalry is gauged by changes in loan <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> interest rates in each Italian province. Different measures of multimarket contacts are built. We estimate the effects of increasing multimarket contacts, concentration indicators, banksÂ’ costs and loan growth on variations in <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> interest rates. No support is found for the multimarket contact hypothesis. Geographical overlap in banking is positively correlated with changes in <b>market</b> <b>shares,</b> confirming the thesis of an overall increase in competition within the Italian banking system. Greater multimarket links also seem to correspond to lower lending rates. banks, antitrust policy, multimarket contacts, panel data...|$|R

50|$|Still, {{some issues}} have risen with this definition, {{specifically}} that dis-aggregate profit data are seldom obtainable.
