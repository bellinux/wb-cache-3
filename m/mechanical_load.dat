SOX 9 and PTHrP genes are known to regulate chondrocyte differentiation and delay maturation, ultimately control the endochondral bone formation. To investigate the effects of repeated <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> on bone, 280 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment. The animals were randomly allocated into experimental and control groups. Repeated <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> was applied through a bite-jumping device in the experimental group. The experimental animals were sacrificed on 10 different time points together with the matched control. Total RNA was extracted from the mandibular condylar cartilage for PTHrP and SOX 9 genes quantification using real-time RT-PCR. Results showed that PTHrP expression was increased and reached a peak level on the seventh day after <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> was given. Repeated <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> triggered a significant increase of PTHrP expression leading to another peak increment. The expression of SOX 9 was highly correlated with the PTHrP expression, and its pattern of expression {{was similar to that}} of PTHrP after repeated <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> In conclusions, repeated <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> on the condyle triggers the expression of PTHrP and SOX 9, which in turn promotes condylar cartilage growth. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} goal of tissue reconstruction, {{scaffolds}} must meet some specific requirements. A high porosity and an adequate pore size are necessary to facilitate cell seeding and diffusion throughout the whole structure of both cells and nutrients. Biodegradability is often an essential factor since scaffolds should preferably be absorbed by the surrounding tissues without {{the necessity of a}} surgical removal. The rate at which degradation occurs has to coincide as much as possible with the rate of tissue formation: this means that while cells are fabricating their own natural matrix structure around themselves, the scaffold is able to provide structural integrity within the body and eventually it will break down leaving the newly formed tissue which will take over the <b>mechanical</b> <b>load.</b> Injectability is also important for clinical uses.|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
40|$|Introduction In biology, various cell {{types are}} {{sensitive}} to changes in <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> On the short term physiological <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> leads to cell response. For instance upon increased load in the heart, muscle cells immediately increase their contractile force. In blood vessels, increased shear stress on endothelial cells leads to cellular deformation and subsequent vasodilation, mediated by chemical signals from the endothelial cells to the underlying smooth muscle cells. On the long term, increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> leads to changes in cellular gene expression, resulting in a more adequate function. Prolonged pathological <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> can also be harmful for living cells, which lose their ability {{to adapt to the}} changed environmental conditions. For instance, prolonged external <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> on skeletal muscle can lead to pressure sores, characterized by necrosis of the tissue [1].

40|$|Membrane lysis is {{a common}} and early defect in muscles {{experiencing}} acute injuries or inflammation. Although increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> of muscles can induce inflammation and membrane lysis, whether <b>mechanical</b> <b>loads</b> applied to muscle can promote the activation and cytolytic capacity of inflammatory cells and thereby increase muscle damage is unknown. We tested whether <b>mechanical</b> <b>loads</b> applied to mouse muscle cells in vitro can increase membrane lysis, and whether neutrophil-mediated lysis of muscle cells is promoted by <b>mechanical</b> <b>loads</b> applied in vitro and in vivo. Cyclic loads applied to muscle cells for 24 h in vitro produced little muscle cell lysis. Similarly, the addition of neutrophils to muscle cell cultures {{in the presence of}} superoxide dismutase (SOD) produced little muscle cell lysis. However, when cyclic <b>mechanical</b> <b>loads</b> were applied to neutrophil–muscle co-cultures in the presence of SOD, there was a synergistic effect on muscle cell lysis, suggesting that <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> activates neutrophil cytotoxicity. However, application of <b>mechanical</b> <b>loads</b> to co-cultures of muscle cells and neutrophils that are null mutants for myeloperoxidase (MPO) showed no mechanical activation of neutrophil cytotoxicity. This indicates that loading promotes neutrophil cytotoxicity via MPO. Activity assays confirmed that <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> of neutrophil–muscle co-cultures significantly increased MPO activity. We further tested whether muscle membrane lysis in vivo was mediated by neutrophils when muscle was subjected to modified loading by using a mouse model of muscle reloading following a period of unloading. We observed that MPO −/− soleus muscles showed a significant 52 % reduction in membrane lysis compared to wild-type mice, although the mutation did not decrease inflammatory cell extravasation. Together, these in vitro and in vivo findings show that <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> activates neutrophil-mediated lysis of muscle cells through an MPO-dependent pathway...|$|R

40|$|For bone tissue engineering, it is {{important}} that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display a bone cell-like response to <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> We have shown earlier that this response includes increased nitric oxide (NO) production and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) gene expression, both of which are intimately involved in mechanical adaptation of bone. COX- 2 gene expression is likely regulated by polyamines, which are organic cations implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation. This has led to the hypothesis that polyamines {{may play a role in}} the response of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) to <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> The aim of this study was to investigate whether genes involved in polyamine metabolism are regulated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> and to study whether polyamines modulate mechanical loading-induced NO production and COX- 2 gene expression in human AT-MSCs. Human AT-MSCs displayed a bone cell-like response to <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> applied by pulsating fluid flow (PFF), as demonstrated by increased NO production and increased gene expression of COX- 2. Furthermore, PFF increased gene expression of spermidine/spermine N (1) -acetyltransferase, which is involved in polyamine catabolism, suggesting that <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> modulates polyamine levels. Finally, the polyamine spermine was shown to inhibit both PFF-induced NO production and COX- 2 gene expression, suggesting that polyamines modulate the response of human AT-MSCs to <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> In conclusion, this is the first study implicating polyamines in the response of human AT-MSCs to <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading,</b> creating opportunities for the use of polyamines in tissue engineering approaches targeting skeletal defects...|$|R

In the implant neck, osteocytes tended to be more spherical with increased dendrite processes around loaded implants, while spindle-shaped osteocytes without increased dendrite processes were observed around unloaded implants in both longitudinal and cross-sectional images. In the bottom area, morphological changes in osteocytes were observed around loaded implants; however, dendrite processes did not differ in longitudinal or cross-sectional images, regardless of <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> These findings indicate that increased osteocyte numbers and developed dendrite processes are associated with anabolic bone responses to <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading.</b> The combination of acid etching and SEM imaging is a useful technique to assess ultrastructural osteocyte morphology around dental implants...|$|R
