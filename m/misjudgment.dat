His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser.

5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running <b>misjudgment</b> that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E

25|$|When attacking, {{there may}} be 3 or 4 slips and 1 or 2 gullies, {{potentially}} using up to six fielders in that region alone. This would typically {{be accompanied by a}} mid off, mid on, and fine leg, making it a 7–2 field. Although there are only two fielders on the leg side, they should get relatively little work as long as the bowlers maintain a line outside off stump. This type of field leaves large gaps in front of the wicket, and is used to entice the batsmen to attack there, with the hope that they make a <b>misjudgment</b> and edge the ball to the catchers waiting behind them.|$|E
25|$|One other {{significance}} of the Clallam disaster may be that when the Princess Sophia went aground in October 1918, in Lynn Canal, her captain, undoubtedly familiar with the Clallam sinking, refused to put the passengers into the boats, even though rescue vessels were at hand, due to the bad sea conditions which it must have seemed to him would make evacuation of the stranded vessel a greater danger than remaining on board. This {{proved to be a}} fatal <b>misjudgment</b> in the Princess Sophia’s case, as the sea and wind came up during the night, washed the Sophia off the rocks, and drowned all aboard.|$|E
25|$|At the 2013 U.S. Open, Mickelson {{entered the}} final round leading by one stroke after rounds of 67-72-70 (−1) over the first three days, but he started {{the final round}} by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys {{to fall out of}} the lead. He regained the lead at the par 4 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a <b>misjudgment</b> at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose. Another bogey {{followed}} at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.|$|E

While credit rating agencies are expected to lend credence to the credit propositions, they have in fact eroded the confidence of investors by awarding undeservedly inflated ratings to junk securities.

25|$|For its spiritual significance, Maya is {{primarily}} connected to intellectual misjudgments. But while errors on objective facts (such as {{the size of}} an object) can be relatively easily corrected, errors in valuation (such as considering rituals as ends in themselves) are much harder to correct, because they are connected to subjective desires. This second kind of <b>misjudgment</b> leads to false beliefs, which are taken as self-evident and are the hardest to eliminate. From {{the point of view of}} the awakening individual, however, Maya disappears completely as consciousness becomes free of its grasp. This awakening from Maya is also termed Mahapralaya, or the final annihilation of the world, since the world is the creation of Maya. This also stands in view of the statement: “The soul in its transcendental state is One, Formless, Eternal and Infinite, yet identifies itself with the phenomenal world of forms, which are many, finite and destructible. This is Maya or the cosmic illusion”.|$|E

He particularly pointed to the absence of Drosera species from almost all arid climate zones, countless rainforests, the American Pacific Coast, Polynesia, the Mediterranean region, and North Africa, as well as the scarcity of species diversity in temperate zones, such as Europe and North America.|$|E
500|$|Henry's crusade never departed, as he {{was forced}} to deal with {{problems}} in Gascony, where the harsh policies of the King's lieutenant, Simon de Montfort, had provoked a violent uprising in 1252, which was supported by King Alfonso X of neighbouring Castile. The English court was split over the problem: Simon and Eleanor argued that the Gascons were to blame for the crisis, while Henry, backed by the Lusignans, blamed Simon's <b>misjudgment.</b> Henry and Eleanor quarrelled over the issue and were not reconciled until the following year. Forced to intervene personally, Henry carried out an effective, if expensive, campaign {{with the help of the}} Lusignans and stabilised the province.

500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "Further Instructions" [...] was [...] "an entertaining hour of television. The episode certainly offers {{its fair share}} of excitement, but as with any typical Lost episode we are presented with more questions than answers". Carabott also called it an improvement over the preceding episode, [...] "The Glass Ballerina." [...] Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine expressed relief in having Locke [...] "back to the way we fondly remember him--as a wide-eyed, knife-wielding, face-smeared madman", but disliked his flashbacks, calling them a [...] "largely under-developed affair". Dignan was also pleased to have Hurley back at the camp and referred to him as [...] "someone [...] will keep the show grounded", but concluded his review by unhappily noting the sudden emergence of Nikki and Paulo as [...] "a colossal <b>misjudgment</b> on the producers' part" [...] and [...] "a dangerous precedent that bears keeping an eye on." ...|$|E

500|$|The British {{government}} lessened their vigil on the shy, silent, grief-stricken Singh, {{which proved}} a <b>misjudgment.</b> She made a secret trip to India with her sister, Bamba, {{to attend the}} 1903 Delhi Durbar, where she was ignored. This impressed on Singh the futility of public and media popularity, and she returned to England determined to change her course. During a 1907 trip to India, she visited Amritsar and Lahore and met relatives. This visit {{was a turning point}} in her life, as she faced the realities of poverty and what her family had lost by surrendering to the British government. In India, Singh hosted a [...] "purdah party" [...] in Shalimar Bagh in Lahore (her grandfather's capital). During the visit, all the while shadowed by British agents, she encountered Indian freedom fighters such as Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Lala Lajpat Rai and expressed sympathy for their cause.

500|$|Typical of Japanese naval {{planning}} during World War II, Yamamoto's {{battle plan}} for taking Midway (named Operation MI) was exceedingly complex. It required the careful and timely coordination of multiple battle groups {{over hundreds of}} miles of open sea. His design was also predicated on optimistic intelligence suggesting that [...] and USS Hornet, forming Task Force 16, were the only carriers available to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, [...] had been sunk and [...] suffered considerable damage such that the Japanese believed she too had been lost. However, following hasty repairs at Pearl Harbor, Yorktown sortied and would go on to {{play a critical role in}} the discovery and eventual destruction of the Japanese fleet carriers at Midway. Finally, much of Yamamoto's planning, coinciding with the general feeling among the Japanese leadership at the time, was based on a gross <b>misjudgment</b> of American morale, which was believed to be debilitated from the string of Japanese victories in the preceding months.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{noted that}} the ending was {{genuinely}} unsettling and dark. Rachel Aroesti, writing for theguardian.com, described the episode as moving [...] "from a twee period piece to {{what has to be}} the most depraved half-hour of television ever to grace the festive schedules". For many critics, the final twist was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's [...] "secret weapon", [...] "very fitting", [...] "suitably macabre", and [...] "fantastically nasty". For Hughes, it [...] "was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved". Two reviews in The Times, however—one unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd—were more critical. The unsigned review advised viewers to switch off before the end, as [...] "the fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion, a bad <b>misjudgment</b> from such a talented writing team". For Rudd, the shocking ending served no purpose; critical of [...] "shocking for the sake of shocking", he argued that the episode's [...] "half-hour of self-satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed". In i, an unsigned review of [...] "The Bill"—the second episode of the third series—suggested that viewers may have been put off the programme by the [...] "rather nasty final couple of minutes" [...] of [...] "The Devil of Christmas".|$|E

40|$|Since Time Immemorial: The Decline of Columbia River Basin Salmon {{studies the}} near {{extinction}} {{of what has}} been historically the world’s largest salmon population. By examining the issue systemically, my paper reveals that the environmental <b>misjudgments</b> that have brought the salmon so near extinction are not isolated, but rather are the product of cultural trends. A study of these <b>misjudgments</b> reveals a culture within the Columbia Basin that has, since the mid- 19 th century, sought expansion for expansion’s sake and valued short-term wealth over long-term sustainability. My paper illustrates how his philosophy has guided and continues to guide Columbia Basin fisheries management to neglect not just environmental and Native American considerations, but pragmatic ones as well...|$|R

30|$|Kahneman [29], {{and other}} {{behavioural}} scientists, questioned the explanatory {{powers of the}} rational agent model, {{because they could not}} make their empirical data fit the rational agent model. As psychologists—or behavioural scientists—they studied how people actually behave, as opposed to how they are assumed to behave according to the rational agent model. Thereby they provided empirical data that supported a new view—namely that people’s judgement errors were not at all non-systematic and thus random, but in fact systematic; people tended to make the same kinds of <b>misjudgments</b> as others did, and <b>misjudgments</b> made today are the same as those made yesterday. Thus, people’s mistakes were more or less universal. Findings like these paved the way for an extension of Bounded Rationality as a concept of understanding human behaviour [24].|$|R
