40|$|In this study, the {{production}} technology of sunflower crop was analyzed, by comparison, in Calarasi county and a company located in Baragan area. The technological system components were analyzed regarding {{the technology of}} sunflower crop, practiced in the farm subject to the case study, namely: crop rotation; tillage; fertilization; seed and sowing; maintenance; harvesting. These components are joined by labor force and equipment used, materials and supplies consumed, way of organization and of course, corresponding costs. Also, the study is elaborated by passing from the national plan, to the county <b>medium</b> <b>plan</b> (Calarasi county) and micro, for the studied company with reference to surfaces, production, financial and economic results. The analysis made at macro and microeconomic level highlighted the importance of compliance with the technology fiche plan and with the crop and soil requirements, in terms of materials used, with particular emphasis on varieties and hybrids recently established on the market, which bring great production increases...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{hardness}} of finding an optimal {{plan in the}} Blocks World (BW). As expected, there is an easy-hard-easy pattern {{in terms of the}} length of the solution: problems with short solutions and problems requiring very long plans are both easy to solve optimally. Our investigations relate this phenomenon to a common underlying cause for both <b>medium</b> <b>plan</b> length and hard optimisation problems. We offer some thoughts as to a qualitative explanation of this. Along the way, we consider and dismiss another approach of associating hardness with a phase transition in the probability of the existence of a solution of given length. That approach we consider to be flawed, and we believe that researchers on phase transition phenomena should beware of the trap it opens. Phase Transitions and Optimality: Sense and Nonsense John Slaney and Sylvie Thi'ebaux September 19, 1997 Abstract We study the hardness of finding an optimal plan in the Blocks World (BW).

Eight animals from the animals sector of Faculdade de Ciencias Agrarias e Veterinarias – Campus of Jaboticabal – UNESP, which is duly certified by IBAMA as an experimental breeding institute, were used. Through a dissection procedure, {{it was found that}} the liver of the paca is located in the cranial portion of the abdomen, immediately after the diaphragm, to which it is connected by the triangular, coronary, and falciform ligaments, having its bigger part located right to the <b>medium</b> <b>plan.</b> The liver of this rodent presents the following lobation: right lateral lobe, right medial lobe, quadrate lobe, left medial lobe, and left lateral lobe, besides the caudate lobe formed by the papillary process of caudate lobe and the caudate process of caudate lobe. Gallbladder is located between the quadrate and right medial lobes. Fragments of this organ were collected, fixed, and histologically prepared, being the samples analyzed through light microscopy. It was microscopically observed that intralobular connective tissue is scarce, basically it consists polyhedral hepatocytes organized into cords interposed between sinusoids and the portal triads are found in the lobe, consisting of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and biliary duct...|$|E
