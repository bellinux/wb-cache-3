500|$|... "Lift Up Your Face" [...] is a {{southern}} rock song with {{a length of}} four minutes and twenty-six seconds. It is set in common time in the key of E minor and has a tempo of 88 beats per minute, with a vocal range spanning from D4-G5. The lyrics to the song portray a hopeful message of salvation and encouragement. Lead vocalist Mac Powell commented that [...] "The country is going through hard times, and there are doubts and insecurity. The message of 'Lift Up Your Face' is [...] message of encouragement – not just to listeners though - to us as well. It's a <b>message</b> <b>we</b> all need to hear".|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] premiered on August 18, 2010, on {{the urban}} radio station V-103 in Atlanta. It was {{selected}} as the album's lead single to showcase Hilson sans featured acts. In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even be as big a record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my <b>message.</b> <b>We</b> felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E
500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say." [...] “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told Science Friday, adding that [...] "in some ways, any <b>message</b> <b>we</b> get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E

[...] Earhart's transmissions seemed to indicate she and Noonan believed they had reached Howland's charted position, which was incorrect by about five nautical miles (10km). The Itasca used her oil-fired boilers to generate smoke {{for a period of time}} but the fliers apparently did not see it. The many scattered clouds in the area around Howland Island have also been cited as a problem: their dark shadows on the ocean surface may have been almost indistinguishable from the island's subdued and very flat profile.|$|E

One poll was part the 2014 poll of issues regarding the NFL, which included one question indicating 71% {{of the general public}} are in favor of keeping the name, with 18% in favor of a change. On their website the team states: [...] "This poll, along with the poll taken among Native Americans by the Annenberg Institute, demonstrates continued, widespread and deep opposition to the Redskins changing our name. The results of this poll are solidly in line with the <b>message</b> <b>we</b> have heard from fans and Native Americans for months – our name represents a tradition, passion and heritage that honors Native Americans. We respect {{the point of view of}} the small number of people who seek a name change, but it is important to recognize very few people agree with the case they are making." [...] The Oneida Indian Nation [...] "believes more Americans would favor changing the team name of the Washington NFL club if they understood the full context of what the Oneidas and others consider a racial slur." [...] Mike Florio points out that since an AP poll taken in April 2013 showed 79% in favor of keeping the name; the 71% result in the new poll is a significant decrease in support in a short time. A 2014 AP-Gfk Poll, however, showed 83% support keeping the name.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} systems {{consisting of}} {{a finite number of}} finite automata which communicate by sending <b>messages.</b> <b>We</b> consider number of messages necessary to recognize a language as a complexity measure of the language. We feel that these considerations give a new insight into computational complexity of problems computed by read-only devices in multiprocessor systems. Our considerations are related to multi-party communication complexity, but we make a realistic assumption that each party has a limited memory. We show a number of hierarchy results for this complexity measure: for each constant k there is a language, which may be recognized with k + 1 messages and cannot be recognized with k − 1 <b>messages.</b> <b>We</b> give an example of a language that requires Θ(log logn) messages and claim that Ω(loglog(n)) messages are necessary, if a language requires more than a constant number of <b>messages.</b> <b>We</b> present a language that requires Θ(n) messages. For a large family of functions f, f (n) = ω(loglogn), f (n) = o(n), we prove that there is a language which requires Θ (f (n)) <b>messages.</b> Finally, <b>we</b> present functions that require ω(n) messages. ...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet."

40|$|Although InfiniBand Architecture is {{relatively}} new in the high performance computing area, it o#ers many features which help us to improve the performance of communication subsystems. One of these features is Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations. In this paper, we propose a new design of MPI over InfiniBand which brings the benefit of RDMA to not only large messages, but also small and control <b>messages.</b> <b>We</b> also achieve better scalability by exploiting application communication pattern and combining send/receive operations with RDMA operations. Our RDMA-based MPI implementation currently delivers a latency of 6. 8 microseconds for small messages and a peak bandwidth of 871 Million Bytes (831 Mega Bytes) per second. Performance evaluation at the MPI level shows that for small messages, our RDMA-based design can reduce the latency by 24 %, increase the bandwidth by over 104 %, and reduce the host overhead by up to 22 %. For large <b>messages,</b> <b>we</b> improve performance by reducing the time for transferring control <b>messages.</b> <b>We</b> have also shown that our new design is beneficial to MPI collective communication and NAS Parallel Benchmarks...|$|R
