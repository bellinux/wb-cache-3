40|$|Abstract. Navigation path {{optimization}} derives {{its cost}} function {{from the total}} cost of travel. These costs can accrue from distance, traffic patterns, preferred order of node sequencing, maximum preferred distance between nodes, and other pragmatic considerations (node-node costs). For a traveling salesman problem (TSP), these costs are usually distances. This paper considers the effects of the initial states in the “genome”—focusing on the use of rule-based and clustering techniques for initial conditions. It also considers the effects of weighting the node-node transition costs on algorithm convergence and final path cost. The best tested combination of initial states and rules for recombination involves weighting each by the distances between nodes. In addition to the mean of the residual error µ, the <b>metric</b> <b>designated</b> algorithmic efficacy (AE) is introduced as a useful comparative metric for navigational optimization algorithms. Four novel and six published TSP problems are investigated: µ is shown to improve in every case, while AE has a wide range of results. ...|$|E

In 1981/82 Ganz-Mávag supplied to OSE 11 B-B diesel-hydraulic DHM7-9 locomotives, designated as class A-251. Finally, in 1983, OSE bought eleven 3-car <b>metric</b> gauge trainsets, <b>designated</b> as Class A-6461.

5000|$|State {{and local}} public bodies {{sometimes}} establish investment, employment or other project commitments, {{which must be}} met and maintained during a test period in exchange for discretionary incentives. Under these arrangements, the recipient must repay all or {{a portion of the}} benefit received, if it fails to meet or maintain the <b>designated</b> <b>metric</b> of performance during the test period. These recapture arrangements are commonly referred to as “clawbacks.” [...] For example, if a recipient fails to create or maintain a minimum level of new positions during a specified test period, it may be required to repay a portion of the benefit based on a prearranged formula.|$|R
40|$|As {{existing}} {{technologies are}} refined and novel microbial inactivation technologies are developed, {{there is a}} growing need for a metric {{that can be used to}} judge equivalent levels of hazard control stringency to ensure food safety of commercially sterile foods. A food safety objective (FSO) is an output-oriented <b>metric</b> that <b>designates</b> the maximum level of a hazard (e. g., the pathogenic microorganism or toxin) tolerated in a food at the end of the food supply chain at the moment of consumption without specifying by which measures the hazard level is controlled. Using a risk-based approach, when the total outcome of controlling initial levels (H 0), reducing levels (SR), and preventing an increase in levels (SI) is less than or equal to the target FSO, the product is considered safe. A cross-disciplinary international consortium of specialists from industry, academia, and government was organized with the objective of developing a document to illustrate the FSO approach for controlling Clostridium botulinum toxin in commercially sterile foods. This article outlines the general principles of an FSO risk management framework for controlling C. botulinum growth and toxin production in commercially sterile foods. Topics include historical approaches t...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on a set}} of {{morphological}} distances computed {{between the}} grayscale images (spatial fields) of similar size specifications, the ratios of selected morphological distances, and the ratios of areas of infima and suprema of grayscale images, a new metric to quantify the degree of similarity between the grayscale images is proposed. We denote the two spatial fields (grayscale images), respectively, with fi and fj, and the infima and suprema of these spatial fields with (fi ∧ fj) and (fi ⋁ fj). The three morphology-based distances include: 1) dilation distance d(fi, fj); 2) erosion distance e(fi, fj); and 3) median-based distance MN(fi, fj). By employing these parameters, which play vital role in construction of parameter-specific interaction matrices, we provide a <b>metric</b> to <b>designate</b> every possible pair of images that can be considered out of a database consisting of a huge number of images. We demonstrate the whole approach on: 1) synthetic spatial fields; 2) a set of 12 similar-sized grayscale images representing cloud-top temperatures of a specific region for 12 different time instants; and 3) four spatial elevation fields to rank possible pairs of images...|$|R
5000|$|Ace, {{when used}} {{in the context of}} {{military}} propaganda, denotes a successful military professional who has accumulated a meaningfully measurable statistic such as aircraft shot down, tonnage sunk, or a number of successful sniper shots. In a manner analogous to sport statistics, some military roles can be measured in terms of a quantifiable metric. Once said metric is established, military personnel (whether within the same force, in different forces, or in different eras) may be quantified versus the <b>designated</b> <b>metric</b> and compared in a tabular fashion. Such metrics may be used as a basis for military merit awards, such as Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross by setting an arbitrary threshold. Likewise, a designation of [...] "ace" [...] ("double ace", [...] "triple ace", etc.) may be applied, such as 5 aircraft shoot downs.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of psychological and neuropsychological evaluation may be degraded when non-informative alteration (NIA) in data, or alteration {{in the manner}} data are represented but not in core meaning, impacts interpretation. If NIA exerts an impact, it may also lead to underutilization of truly useful information. Certain interpretive practices {{that are based on}} configural relationships and are already problematic (e. g., scatter analysis) may be particularly vulnerable to NIA and thereby further compromised. This study examined: (1) judgments regarding inter-test scatter across a neuropsychological battery, (2) whether NIAs impact judgments regarding scatter, and (3) whether truncating the visual presentation of scatter alters misjudgments about the frequency or pathological significance of scatter. Participants (N = 193) were neuropsychologists and graduate students who have received training in neuropsychological assessment. When judging neuropsychological profiles, participants markedly overperceived normal levels of scatter as rare or aberrant. The influence of NIA was mixed. Changing the visual plotting of percentiles from equal- to unequal-sized units did not alter judgments. In contrast, simply changing the <b>designated</b> <b>metric</b> from percentiles to T-scores, while holding visual plotting constant, reduced overperception of scatter, although only partially or insufficiently. An intervention that truncated visual scatter further improved judgmental accuracy (i. e., truncated visual scatter compared to larger visual scatter with mathematically identical information attenuated misjudgments about the normality of scatter). This study provides preliminary evidence for a previously underidentified source of error in the interpretation of psychological test data. Future research should determine whether the iii current findings can be replicated, advance the design of interventions as needed, and assist in developing evidence-based standards for representing graphical displays that diminish the influence of NIAs...|$|R
