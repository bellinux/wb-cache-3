5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the <b>maple</b> <b>leaf</b> as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The <b>maple</b> <b>leaf</b> is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the <b>maple</b> <b>leaf.</b> The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E

The couple {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto {{to be close to}} Smythe's sand and gravel business, which operated a gravel pit north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair.

In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives.

5|$|The {{image of}} the <b>maple</b> <b>leaf</b> used on the flag was {{designed}} by Jacques Saint-Cyr; however, Jack Cook claims that this stylized eleven-point <b>maple</b> <b>leaf</b> was lifted from a copyrighted design owned by a Canadian craft shop in Ottawa. The colours 0/100/100/0 in the CMYK process, PMS 032 (flag red 100%), or PMS 485 (used for screens) in the Pantone colour specifier can be used when reproducing the flag. For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255–0–0 (web hexadecimal #FF0000). In 1984, the National Flag of Canada Manufacturing Standards Act was passed to unify the manufacturing standards for flags used in both indoor and outdoor conditions.|$|E
