500|$|Despite Mary Shelley's {{attempts}} to assist Gatteschi financially, {{he tried to}} blackmail her one year later in 1845using indiscreet letters she had written. After not hearing from Gatteschi for months, she received threatening letters, which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage. He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this. The contents of Mary Shelley's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed, but she must have felt some danger, for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends: [...] " [...] were written with an open heart – & contain details with regard to <b>my</b> <b>past</b> history, which it [...] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light." [...] Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help. After obtaining help from the British government, he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi's correspondence. Implying that Gatteschi was {{a danger to the}} state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the cabinet noir system in order to retrieve the letters. On 11 October, Le National and Le Constitutionnel reported in outrage that Gatteschi's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary. Mary wrote to Claire that [...] "It is an awful power this seizure", but she did not regret using it. After Knox retrieved her letters, he burned them. Shelley spent £250 of her own money to finance the operation. She was embarrassed by the entire incident.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the contest, Vissi could be seen crying in front of cameras while recounting her {{experience}} and thanking the Greek public for all their love and support. She soon re-released Nylon as a dual disc with music videos, and also a remix of [...] "Everything" [...] by Valentino and Siganos. After Eurovision Vissi went on hiatus from the Greek music industry, performing a worldwide tour for the Greek diaspora in 2007 as well as recording English-language material for her planned international album in Los Angeles, California with her then-producer Greg Ladanyi. A court case also further postponed her Greek career. Since the second re-release of Nylon in autumn 2006, Vissi had not released any new material until October 29, 2008, when she released the song [...] "To Parelthon Mou" [...] (<b>my</b> <b>past)</b> as the lead soundtrack single for the Greek movie Bank Bang. On December 9, 2008 she released the album Apagorevmeno (2008) which was certified double platinum in Greece under the new 2009 thresholds, denoting shipments of 24 thousand copies, one of her lowest selling albums and lowest of the 2000s. It was certified triple platinum in her native Cyprus. Her first album in the 2010s, Agapi Einai Esi, performed worse than its predecessor, being certified gold for shipments of six thousand copies and falling off of the charts after two months, while her concert attendances generally did not meet expectations, despite heavy promotion.|$|E

[...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of <b>my</b> <b>past</b> life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
