25|$|The Congress {{concluded}} that the multiple-use concept presented new challenges and new opportunities to foresters everywhere, with great prospects for additional services {{to the welfare of}} mankind. It was not, however, a panacea which could solve all forest management problems. Often one use must be dominant and other proposed uses must not then be detrimental to the major one. Moreover, there can be disadvantages to <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> when it is inefficiently applied. But <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> must be recognized as an important goal of forest policies.|$|E

25|$|After {{negotiating}} for six years, Congress {{adopted a}} National Water Law, No. 9433 (NWL) in January 1997 that incorporates most modern {{water resources management}} principles and instruments. The NWP states that water is a public good and a limited natural resource with an economic value; in situations of scarcity the priority use of water is for human and animal consumption; water resources management should always assure the <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> of waters; the river basin is the territorial unit for water management; and {{management of water resources}} should be decentralized and participatory. In July 2000, Federal Law No. 9984 established the National Water Authority (Autoridade Nacional da Agua - ANA) with the mandate to implement the national water policy and establish criteria for granting of water usage rights and pricing mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Professor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (H.I.V), {{testified that}} the virus in the 393 {{children}} studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection {{was not the only}} possible means of infection, any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he {{was in the process of}} studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France, and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.|$|E

500|$|Extensive timber {{cutting in}} the Sandy River basin {{began in the}} mid-19thcentury in {{response}} to a demand for wood from the Portland metropolitan area. Logging intensified in the lower basin through the 20thcentury as sawmills became established in Sandy, Boring, Brightwood and other settlements in the region, and railroad spurs extended into the forests. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to forbid activities such as camping and livestock grazing in the Bull Run Reserve. Except for activity related to the waterworks, the protected area changed little until the 1950s, when the United States Forest Service began to advocate logging in the Reserve. After the U.S. Congress passed the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Use</b> – Sustained Yield Act of 1960 stressing timber production in the national forests, the Forest Service in the 1960s and 1970s built about [...] of forest roads in the watershed.

[...] It requires the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals. [...] Beginning with its enactment, it required studies of the habits and habitats of free-ranging horses and burros, permitting public land to be set aside for their use. In addition, the act required that these horses and burros be protected as [...] "living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West", The BLM was tasked with identification of the areas where free-roaming horses and burros were found, no there was no specific amount of acreage set aside, and the Act required management plans to [...] "maintain a thriving natural ecological balance among wild horse populations, wildlife, livestock, and vegetation {{and to protect the}} range from the deterioration associated with overpopulation." [...] Although wild horse ranges were principally {{for the protection of the}} horses, the land was required to be maintained for <b>multiple</b> <b>use.</b> The BLM was also permitted to close public land to livestock grazing to protect wild horse and burro habitat.|$|E

When the 1971 Act was passed, the BLM assessed herd areas to determine which places could become HMAs based on whether they had adequate food, water, cover, and space to [...] "sustain healthy and diverse wild horse and burro populations over the long-term". [...] Some herd areas still contain feral horses or burros but for a number of reasons—including size of herd, habitat, and land ownership—they are not currently managed for equines by the BLM. [...] Additional wild, free-roaming horses and burros are found on Wild Horse and Burro Territories in six states under the auspices of the United States Forest Service (USFS) and are also protected by the Act. Some of the USFS territories are managed in cooperation with the BLM. The USFS has about 50 Wild Horse and Burro Territories.
