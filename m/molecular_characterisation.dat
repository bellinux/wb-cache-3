Phytoplankton increased their photosynthetic efficiency in response to iron addition, suggesting proximal iron limitation throughout most of the Ross Sea during summer. Molecular and physiological data further indicate that as nitrate is removed from the surface ocean the phytoplankton community transitions to one displaying an iron-efficient photosynthetic strategy characterised by an increase in the size of photosystem II (PSII) photochemical cross section (?PSII) and a decrease in the chlorophyll-normalised PSII abundance. These results suggest that phytoplankton with the ability to reduce their photosynthetic iron requirements are selected as the growing season progresses, which may drive the well-documented progression from Phaeocystis antarctica- assemblages to diatom-dominated phytoplankton. Such a shift in the assemblage-level photosynthetic strategy potentially mediates further drawdown of nitrate following the development of iron deficient conditions in the Ross Sea...|$|R

We suggest that H. microlobus and H. pseudorobustus are valid species separated from each other morphologically and molecularly. Seven species with distinct molecular characteristics are also distinguished, but are not ascribed morphologically to any specific taxon because of the low number of specimens available.

40|$|The {{development}} of resistances to conventional anticancer drugs compromises {{the efficacy of}} cancer treatments. In the case of DNA-targeting chemotherapeutic agents, cancer cells may display tolerance to the drug-induced DNA lesions and/or enhanced DNA repair. However, the role of DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair in this chemoresistance {{has yet to be}} defined. To provide insights in this challenging area, we analyzed the DNA repair signature of 7 cancer cell lines treated by 5 cytotoxic drugs using a recently developed multiplexed functional DNA repair assay. This comprehensive approach considered the complexity and redundancy of the different DNA repair pathways. Data was analyzed using clustering methods and statistical tests. This DNA repair profiling method defined relevant groups based on similarities between different drugs, thus providing information relating to their dominant mechanism of action at the DNA level. Similarly, similarities between different cell lines presumably identified identical functional DDR despite a high level of genetic heterogeneity between cell lines. Our strategy has shed new light on the contribution of specific repair sub-pathways to drug-induced cytotoxicity. Although further <b>molecular</b> <b>characterisations</b> are needed to fully unravel the mechanisms underlying our findings, our approach proved to be very promising to interrogate the complexity of the DNA repair response. Indeed, it could be used to predict the efficacy of a given drug and the chemosensitivity of individual patients, and thus to choose the right treatment for individualised cancer care...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{identification}} of cyanobacterial isolates has significant socio-economic implications as many bloom-forming species affect the aesthetics {{and safety of}} drinking water, through the production of taste and odour compounds or toxic metabolites. The limitations of morphological identification have promoted the application of molecular tools, and encouraged the adoption of combined (polyphasic) approaches that include both microscopy- and DNA-based analyses. In this context, {{the rapid expansion of}} available sequence data is expected to allow increasingly reliable {{identification of}} cyanobacteria, and ultimately resolve current discrepancies between the two approaches. In the present study morphological and <b>molecular</b> <b>characterisations</b> of cyanobacterial isolates (n= 39), collected from various freshwater sites in Australia, were compared. Sequences were obtained for the small ribosomal subunit RNA gene (16 S rDNA) (n= 36), the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (rpoC 1) (n= 22), and the phycocyanin operon, with its intergenic spacer region (cpcBA-IGS) (n= 19). Phylogenetic analyses identified three cyanobacterial orders: the Chroococcales (n= 8), Oscillatoriales (n= 6), and Nostocales (n= 25). Interestingly, multiple novel genotypes were identified, with 22 % of the strains (17 / 77) having < 95 % similarity to available sequences in GenBank. Morphological and molecular data were in agreement at the species level for only 26 % of the isolates obtained (10 / 39), while agreement at the genus level was obtained for 31 % (12 / 39). Confident identification of the remaining 44 % of the strains (17 / 39) beyond the order level was not possible. The present study demonstrates that, despite the taxonomic revisions, and advances in molecular-, and bioinformatics-tools, the lack of reliable morphological features, culture-induced pleomorphism, and proportion of misidentified or poorly described sequences in GenBank, still represent significant factors, impeding the confident identification of cyanobacteria species...|$|R

We evaluated the interrelationship of phylogenetic inference with epidemiological and laboratory data for HIV- 1 isolates circulating in Pernambuco, Northeast Region-Brazil. A total of 168 HIV- 1 pol sequences were analysed, 64 were obtained from 2002 - 2003, and 104, from 2007 - 2009. Socio-demographic, clinical, and behavioural data were obtained from medical records. Laboratory testing enabled the determination of recent HIV- 1 infections and co-infections with HBV, HCV, HTLV, or syphilis. Surveillance drug-resistance mutation analysis and antiretroviral susceptibility profiling were performed using HIV Drug-Resistance Database. HIV- 1 non-B was associated with female, lower education, lower viral loads, and higher T cell counts mean. Frequencies of co-infection HIV-HBV, HIV-HCV, and HIV-syphilis were 27. 8 % (95 % CI: 19. 8 - 37. 7), 1. 04 % (95 % CI: 0. 05 - 5. 00) and 14. 7 % (95 % CI: 8. 6 - 23. 0), respectively.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{morphological}} and molecular analyses of a Florida topotype and other populations of Hemicriconemoides strictathecatus showed that this sheathoid nematode {{consists of two}} morphotypes, both with an average stylet length of more than 70 μm, but having different tail termini, bluntly pointed or rounded. These findings confirmed the morphological similarity of H. strictathecatus with H. mangiferae, which was considered a junior synonym of this species as previously proposed by Decraemer & Geraert (1992, 1996). Populations of a sheathoid nematode with a stylet length ranging from 62. 5 to 72. 0 μm from Taiwan, China, South Africa and Venezuela and identified in previous studies as H. strictathecatus {{were found to be}} morphologically and molecularly different from this species and are now considered as representatives of H. litchi. Another sheathoid nematode population from Florida, considered to be H. mangiferae by McSorley et al. (1980), was also found to be morphologically and molecularly congruous with H. litchi. During nematological surveys in Florida, a new sheathoid nematode was detected on date palms imported from California into Florida and is described herein as H. phoenicis sp. n. This new species is related morphologically to the H. strictathecatus morphotype with pointed tail terminus. Both have a stylet longer than 70 μm. The new species is phylogenetically related to H. strictathecatus and H. litchi. It differs morphologically from other Hemicriconemoides species by the cuticular ornamentation of the annuli, which are marked by coarse longitudinal ridges, grooves and thick margins.
