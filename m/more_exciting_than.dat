5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish {{near the bottom}} of the final standings, exceeded expectations, with the latter eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> any traditional sporting match he had ever seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which deserved the same level of respect of traditional sports.|$|E

Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: [...] "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> us. No one. And… make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to their support of animal rights, the band has voiced their support for Democratic causes. During the 2004 United States presidential election, the band was part of Punkvoter, a political activist group, and appeared on the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 compilation. The Rock Against Bush project raised over $1 million for then presidential candidate John Kerry. [...] During the 2008 presidential election, the band members endorsed Barack Obama. In a news bulletin in early 2009, the band stated: [...] "Few things are <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> watching Bush finally release America as his eight year hostage." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics who {{agreed that it}} was <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> ButterFly. The production also received praise from critics. Commercially, the album peaked at number 12 on the United States, number 42 in Canada, and number 84 in Australia. It was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 500,000 copies. [...] "My Father's Song" [...] and [...] "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" [...] were released as the album's two singles in August and November 1975, respectively. The former entered the Adult Contemporary charts in the United States and Canada while the latter was a success on two of Billboards dance charts in late 1975.|$|E
500|$|Movielines Stephanie Zacharek complimented the film's {{action and}} wrote that it [...] "defies all the current trends in {{mainstream}} action filmmaking. The driving sequences are shot and edited with a surgeon's clarity and precision. Refn doesn't chop up the action to fool us into thinking it's <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> it is." [...] She also admired Refn's skill in handling the film's violence, and the understated romance between Gosling and Mulligan. Her {{score for the}} film is 9.5/10. Drive was Roger Ebert's seventh best film of 2011. In praising the film, he wrote, [...] "Here is a movie with respect for writing, acting, and craft. It has respect for knowledgeable moviegoers." [...] Like Zacharek, Ebert admired the film's action sequences, which were practically made and did not rely on CGI effects.|$|E
500|$|The strip {{followed}} {{the structure of}} the football season, thus there were several months each year when the Rovers were not playing football, but the strip needed to depict something <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the players going on holiday and then reporting for pre-season training. As a result, the players tended to spend their summers involved in activities such as competing in charity cricket tournaments, but by far the most common summer storyline saw the Rovers go on tour to a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, normally South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. [...] "Melchester played more pre-season games at gunpoint deep in the jungle than they ever did in more mundane settings." [...] The summer would often also see Roy fending off lucrative offers to leave Melchester, as in 1978, when the Sheik of Basran, an oil-rich Middle-Eastern state, offered him £1million to coach the national team.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{sales of}} the game were so low, Enix {{was going to lose}} money, but several Shonen Jump {{articles}} by Horii helped increase its sales substantially. People liked Toriyama's artwork and Sugiyama's music, which the book [...] said [...] "was richer and <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> any game music had ever sounded". The game was extremely popular in Japan and became {{the first in a series}} that in 2016 includes eleven games with several spin-off series and stand-alone titles. More than 2million copies were sold of the Japanese version. The Dragon QuestI&II remake for the SNES yielded 1.2million copies sold in Japan. The 1989 [...] "All Soft Catalog" [...] issue of Famicom Tsūshin (now Famitsu) included Dragon Quest in its list of the best games of all time, receiving the Best RPG and Best Character Design awards, but losing to Dragon Quest III for the overall Grand Prize for best game of all time.|$|E
500|$|Jando Dominique, {{reporting}} for Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts, summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as [...] "always sold out and enthusiastically {{reviewed by the}} press." [...] Renee Valois cited {{the age of the}} performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a St. Paul Pioneer Press review of Oz comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, [...] "Dare I say Circus Juventas is <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the troupe that inspired it?" [...] Writing for Minnesota Monthly, Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's Showdown: [...] "There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros." [...] In Spectacle, Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have [...] "a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin James of the Professional Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{praised the}} event, stating [...] "I would gladly have paid PPV money for this" [...] and [...] "if Raw had {{this kind of}} quality, I would gladly sign up for a three-hour show." [...] He also pointed out that there were no {{commercial}} breaks or dead time, making the event [...] "mighty close in total content to a three-hour Raw". James wrote that the [...] "announcing team was perfect tonight, no bickering, no fake feuds, no 'storytelling' for things outside the ring", especially [...] "in the opening match, where it was clear that they were completely invested in the match". He also wrote that Cesaro-Zayn was [...] "match of the year by a country mile", describing it as [...] "better, more emotionally intense, and <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> anything WWE has put on since their previous encounter". [...] "Some of the sequences in here had 5+ counters strung together" [...] and there was [...] "hard hitting action".|$|E

5000|$|Nick Hogan of TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing [...] "All in all, I very much enjoyed this episode and I'm <b>more</b> <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> ever {{for the last}} few episodes. They're not pulling any punches and I can't wait to see where it leads." ...|$|R
500|$|Some {{analyses}} {{have examined}} the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father {{at the end of the}} story says that [...] "it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults", a message that appears again in The Cat in the Hat. [...] To Matthew Pierlot, [...] "The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth", a Socrates-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> it is. [...] To Patrick Shannon, [...] "Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world". [...] In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of Maurice Sendak and William Steig; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.|$|E
500|$|After the film's initial release, {{critical}} reception {{continues to}} be positive. Film scholar Andy Klein wrote that the film is [...] "almost a distillation of [...] post-1986 work. Even if the plot is full of holes, and the emotional tug isn't quite as strong as in The Killer, the action sequences (nearly the whole movie) are among the greatest ever filmed". Mark Salisbury of Empire Magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "Infinitely <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> a dozen Die Hards, action cinema doesn't come any better than this." [...] Salisbury compared Hard Boiled to Woo's American films, stating that his Hong Kong films are [...] "not as slick as his later films, [...] more inventive and stylised and [...] great early performances from Fat and Leung". Empire placed the film at number 70 in their list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" [...] in 2010. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film the highest rating of four stars, proclaiming it {{to be one of}} Woo's best films. The British film magazine Empire ranked the character of Tequila as 33rd in their [...] "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" [...] poll.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{declared}} that [...] "Cheek to Cheek {{is a record}} where the music and even the songs take a backseat to the personalities". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Camp criticized Bennett and Gaga's vocals in the album, adding that [...] "If not for the session musicians' top-notch work... much of Cheek to Cheek, which drags at an economical 45 minutes, would sound like glorified karaoke." [...] San Francisco Chronicle writer Aidin Vaziri was disappointed with Bennett and Gaga not [...] "highlight each other's wildly distinguishing features", adding that [...] "the background music is far <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the people singing over it". Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times complimented Gaga's vocals in the album but panned her [...] "cheap exploitation: {{of a bunch of}} important songs she brings nothing to; of an 88-year-old legend with whom she has zero chemistry; and, most disappointingly, of our eagerness to follow her down an unlikely creative path." [...] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015, Cheek to Cheek won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.|$|E

500|$|The Orlando Sentinel commended {{the ride}} for [...] "perfect timing and keeping folks guessing", giving the ride ratings of 4 out of 5 for both thrill and theming. Sentinel {{reporter}} Dewayne Bevil, ranks the ride at number 7 in his Top 50 Orlando Theme Park Attractions list. Although {{it was reported}} that the ride would be <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> The Incredible Hulk at the nearby Islands of Adventure theme park, Mike Thomas of the Sentinel concluded that [...] "Hulk clobbers the competition", with Kraken taking the number two spot. In an interview for the Los Angeles Times Jerry Dane of the Florida Coaster Club described the floorless experience like [...] "you are hung out there open and free". Dane also commended the ride's ability to provide different, yet equally good experiences in a variety of seats. In 2012, Kraken was featured on the Travel Channel TV series Insane Coaster Wars, and received first place in the public-voted [...] "Wrong Way Up" [...] category. Theme Park Review's Robb Alvey shared the view the Kraken was better than the competition which included Dollywood's Wild Eagle and Dorney Park's Hydra the Revenge.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] has to learn to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1967 Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, A.A. Thomson {{described}} this series as [...] "a rubber <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> any in history except the Australia v West Indies series in 196061". [...] This description came {{despite the fact}} that Australia had secured the series after four of five matches, leading 20 before the final Test; the first two matches had been drawn due to rain, with the second match at Lord's yielding only 38 overs in three days.|$|E

2500|$|Satirist Max Beerbohm {{published}} a cartoon entitled [...] "William Shakespeare, his method of work", in his 1904 collection The Poet's Corner. Beerbohm depicts Shakespeare receiving the manuscript of Hamlet from Bacon. In Beerbohm's comic essay On Shakespeare's Birthday he declares {{himself to be}} unconvinced by Baconian theory, but wishes it were true because of the mischief it would cause—and because having one hero who was both an intellectual and a creative genius would be <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> two separate ones.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime {{shortly after}} 1475 someone put the courier on the {{standard}} chessboard {{in place of the}} old alfil and gave the queen the combined powers of the courier and the rook. [...] This game was so much <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> medieval chess that it soon drove the older game off the market. [...] Other improvements were tried out. [...] One was an optional double first step for the pawns. [...] This was at first restricted to the king's, queen's, and rooks' pawns, and then gradually extended to the others.|$|E
2500|$|Dziga Vertov {{believed}} {{his concept of}} Kino-Glaz, or [...] "Cine Eye" [...] in English, [...] would help contemporary [...] "man" [...] evolve from a flawed creature into a higher, more precise form. He compared man unfavorably to machines: [...] "In {{the face of the}} machine we are ashamed of man’s inability to control himself, but what are we to do if we find the unerring ways of electricity <b>more</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the disorderly haste of active people [...] " [...] "I am an eye.
