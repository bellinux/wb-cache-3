40|$|Graduation date: 2005 In modern {{telecommunication}} applications, {{the need}} for high-reliability and high data rate is important because of factors such as a higher demand in multimedia capability of mobile devices and the exponentially increasing number of subscribers. Wireless communications in today’s technology have many limitations due to channel imperfections, which result in less than satisfactory speed of transmission and less reliability. Moreover, bandwidth, {{one of the most}} the precious resources of all communication schemes, has been reaching the limit established either by the spectrum governing bodies such as the FCC in the U. S. or by technological shortcomings. This means that increasing the number of users is extremely difficult. Researchers have been inventing and developing many techniques to overcome such limitations. Good examples are real-time channel estimation and compensation, new modulation techniques, efficient coding algorithms and novel multiple-access techniques. This thesis presents a new CDMA modem (<b>modulator-demodulator)</b> which achieves a higher bandwidth efficiency in a multiple user scenario than conventional CDMA-based systems and attains low BER performance through the application of orthogonal-complementary coded CDMA (OCC-CDMA) and non-conventional QAM. The OCC-CDMA itself has the advantages of less multiple access interference (MAI) and capability of transmitting the maximum of 1 bit per spreading chip, which is impossible to achieve with conventional CDMA. By utilizing such unique properties of OCC-CDMA, high information transmission rates with acceptable BER performance can be achieved...|$|E

Only some simple Intelligent transport control has been realized in quite a few cities However, in many large and middle cities, Intelligent transport control is still in a research period. We had been thinking about this research from juniors. We spent one year doing large quantity of social examination, investigating some roads personally and inquiring a lot of material from Internet and library. On the basis of this, we made the road sate model. Several typical states are represented on this model, so it is definitely representative. We chose the comparatively simple and easily operated green wave control. One computer controls six PLC. Long-range control is realized by dialing online the <b>modulator-demodulator.</b> We adopted some basic vague control thought, meanwhile, combined with actual circumstances, and designed a set of practical control algorithm. We mainly used VB 6. 0 and PLC programmed software from OMRON Company. In the end, we completed the control program of both the upper and lower bit machine.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{growth of}} digital communication has an acute {{impact on the}} digital integrated circuit (IC) design industry. Nowadays instead of ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are often employed to implement digital communication systems due to the speed, performance, reliability and flexibility. Digital communication systems such as modulation-demodulation and M-PSK {{require the use of}} carrier synchronization in phase and frequency. This work addresses the FPGA implementation and analysis of a Digital Carrier Synchronizer (DCS), which is a phase-locked loop (PLL), realized using digital circuits. This novel methodology highlights implementation promises towards some of the critical issues associated with the design of its analog counterpart, usually known as PLL. The principle function of this DCS is heavily dependent on the Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) and the Loop Filter (LF). There are various methods to implement NCOs and LFs that are used in the architectural model of DCS. This research work examines the performance of two different NCOs and LFs realization in DCS for modem (<b>modulator-demodulator)</b> application using FPGA based design solutions. The methods presented are Look up Table (LUT) and Xilinx ROM based NCO in one hand, and 1 st order and 2 nd order based LF in the other hand. Each has its own merits and de-merits. A DCS mathematical model has been developed in order to analyze the stability of the design. Furthermore, the performance of this two implementations based on three performance metrics i. e. stability, locking-time and tracking range has been studied. From the analysis, Xilinx ROM based NCO with 2 nd order LF performs better and are more suited for modem's DCS...|$|E
40|$|Low-Resolution Picture Transmission (LRPT) is a {{proposed}} standard for direct broadcast transmission of satellite weather images. This standard {{is a joint}} effort by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As a digital transmission scheme, its purpose is to replace the current analog Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) system {{for use in the}} Meteorological Operational (METOP) satellites. Goddard Space Flight Center has been tasked to build an LRPT Demonstration System (LDS). It's main objective is to develop or demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost receiver utilizing a Personal Computer (PC) as the primary processing component and determine the performance of the protocol in the simulated Radio Frequency (RF) environment. The approach would consist of two phases. In the phase 1, a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) <b>Modulator-Demodulator</b> (MODEM) board that would perform RF demodulation would be purchased allowing the Central Processing Unit (CPU) to perform the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) protocol processing. Also since the weather images are compressed the PC would perform the decompression. Phase 1 was successfully demonstrated on December 1997. Phase 2 consists of developing a high-fidelity receiver, transmitter and environment simulator. Its goal is to find out how the METOP Specification performs in a simulated noise environment in a cost-effective receiver. The approach would be to produce a receiver using as much software as possible to perform front-end processing {{to take advantage of the}} latest high-speed PCs. Thus the COTS MODEM used in Phase 1 is performing RF demodulation along with data acquisition providing data to the receiving software.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} transmitting data from a continuous- amplitude, discrete-time source over a bandlimited waveform channel using a block-structured digital communication system. Our objective is to design the source encoder-decoder pair, the channel encoder-decoder pair and the <b>modulator-demodulator</b> pair so as to minimize a squared-error distortion measure between the source sequence and its replica in the receiver, subject to constraints on the transmitted signal power and bandwidth. We formulate the problem in a general sense and derive necessary conditions for optimality for the design variables, namely, the encoder map, the decoder map and the modulation signal set. We then consider two systems for which the necessary conditions for optimality hold. The receiver of the first system consists of an unquantized soft-decision demodulator followed by a linear estimator-based decoder. We solve the necessary conditions for optimality using an iterative solution technique. We then study the performance of this class of systems as the encoding rate increases, for a fixed bandwidth. Performance comparisons are made against a reference system as well as bounds from information theory. Significant improvements over the reference system are demonstrated and the performance is shown to coincide with an information-theoretic bound in two cases. The receiver of the second system consists of a quantized demodulator followed by an optimum decoder. For a fixed signal set, the optimal encoder and decoder conditions are solved using an iterative solution technique. Performance comparisons are made against the linear estimator-based system, the reference system and bounds from information theory. We then study the quantized demodulator- based system as the encoding rate becomes large, for a fixed bandwidth. We demonstrate that this system converges to a linear analog modulation system in some cases and to a nonlinear analog modulation system in others. Finally, we study {{the performance of the}} two systems to channel mismatch. We demonstrate that both of these systems are more robust to channel mismatch than the reference system...|$|E
