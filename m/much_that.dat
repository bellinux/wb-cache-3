5|$|His {{family moved}} to Surrey, British Columbia, in 1966, then settled in Port Coquitlam, in 1968.

His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E

5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very {{gifted and}} {{she has her own}} {{individuality}} as an artist; but her personal outlook is not so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> of an artist with startling things to say... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant's {{books and}} David Lawson's Paul Morphy The Pride and Sorrow of Chess (New York, 1976) make {{extensive}} use of Edge's book, but note Edge's strong anti-Staunton bias.

5|$|The Games {{have grown}} so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> nearly every nation is now represented.

The Games also constitute {{an opportunity for the}} host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{surveys of the}} ship {{indicate}} that the ship was modified late in her career and have lent support {{to the idea that}} the Mary Rose was altered too much to be properly seaworthy.

5|$|A family {{goes to a}} {{hotel with}} their gran, (which would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> she wants them to {{disappear}} as they then do. She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|According to Diddy, {{the song}} is about loving someone so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> you forget about yourself.

While critics were divided over Diddy's part in the track, most complimented the song's production, Drake's cameo, and Harper and Richard's vocals.|$|E
5|$|After a {{difficult}} start {{to life in}} the First Division, Cardiff secured their first victory in the top division by beating Middlesbrough 3–1. Keenor had been switched to centre-half for the match, a move Fred Stewart had resisted for some time due to his concern of Kennor's lack of height, away from his usual position at right-half and his performance impressed so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he would go on to play the position for the remainder of his career. The 1921–22 season was also Keenor's tenth year at Ninian Park and he was subsequently awarded a testimonial match against Bristol City. In the following five years, Cardiff became an established side in the First Division, missing out on the league title in the 1923–24 season to Huddersfield Town on goal average after drawing the final game of the season when a win would have guaranteed them the championship.|$|E
