The characteristics of milk processing system in the south-central France was the specialization for <b>mature</b> <b>cheese</b> making conducted by the technique of solidifying-additives using series. Although the technique of cream separating series had also been used in the region，all 4 dairy farmers don't currently adopt it because of its lower benefit than cheese making. Hence，butter was currently made not from cream， but from whey that was produced in cheese making. The technique of fermented milk processing series such as yogurt making wasn't also found in the surveyed 4 dairy farmers. It was considered that the main factors which specialize to the <b>mature</b> <b>cheese</b> making in the south-central France are 1) cool and humid climate conditions and resource uses for setting cool and wet conditions which make the <b>cheese</b> <b>maturing</b> possible， 2) the improvement of cheese conservation and cheese taste by maturing， 3) the higher benefit of <b>mature</b> <b>cheese</b> making， 4) tbe lower labor force by tbe centralization of <b>mature</b> <b>cheese</b> making.

40|$|The leading {{biochemical}} process during ripening of cheese in a lamb skin sack is lipolysis. In order {{to evaluate the}} influence of free fatty acids (FFA) liberated during lipolysis, on the cheese in a sack flavour and aroma, the relationship between sensory properties (odour, taste and total sensory score) and FFA content throughout ripening was determined. Additionally, differentiation of cheeses in various ripening stages was performed by analysis of specific profile of cheese volatile compounds using electronic nose. The obtained results demonstrated that the content of certain FFA is responsible for specific flavour and aroma in various ripening stages, which directly influence the consumers’ sensory scores of the cheese. The concentration of fatty acids C 14 : 0, C 14 : 1, C 17 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 23 : 0 (P< 0. 05), as well as C 16 : 0, C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 23 : 0 (P< 0. 01) in 45 days <b>matured</b> <b>cheese</b> resulted in significantly positive correlation with cheese odour. Concentrations of fatty acids C 8 : 0, C 17 : 0, C 18 : 0 C 18 : 1 n- 9 t, C 18 : 1 n- 9 c (P< 0. 05), C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0, C 16 : 1, C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 21 : 0, C 23 : 0 (P< 0. 01), C 12 : 0, and C 22 : 0 (P< 0. 001) correlated significantly with the cheese taste. As {{a consequence of the}} ripening time and the ripening conditions, C 4 : 0, C 6 : 0 and C 8 : 0 fatty acids were accumulated and contributed to the lower sensory scores of the 60 days <b>matured</b> <b>cheese.</b> Long-chain unsaturated FFAs ttC 18 : 2, C 20 : 2 and C 22 : 6 n- 3, also negatively correlated with the sensory properties of cheese in a sack, probably as precursors for synthesis of shorter acids and alcohols. Electronic nose analysis showed very well differentiation of cheeses in various ripening stages and these results are mostly in accordance with the results of consumers’ sensory assessment and physicochemical analyses. Well <b>matured</b> <b>cheese</b> was not well accepted by consumers due to the extensive lipolysis reactions in cheese during ripening. In terms of sensory quality electronic nose could be of a great help to cheesemakers in satisfying consumers requirements for optimal flavour and aroma properties of cheese by estimating ending of ripening time and lipolysis reactions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Knowing {{the levels}} of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in {{different}} foods is of interest due to the association of these bioactive nutrients to health and diseases. There {{is a lack of}} relevant information on their contents in foods. Objective: To develop a food polyamine database from published data by which polyamine intake and food contribution to this intake can be estimated, and to determine {{the levels of}} polyamines in Swedish dairy products. Design: Extensive literature search and laboratory analysis of selected Swedish dairy products. Polyamine contents in foods were collected using an extensive literature search of databases. Polyamines in different types of Swedish dairy products (milk with different fat percentages, yogurt, cheeses, and sour milk) were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector. Results: Fruits and cheese were the highest sources of putrescine, while vegetables and meat products were found to be rich in spermidine and spermine, respectively. The content of polyamines in cheese varied considerably between studies. In analyzed Swedish dairy products, <b>matured</b> <b>cheese</b> had the highest total polyamine contents with values of 52. 3, 1. 2, and 2. 6 mg/kg for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, respectively. Low fat milk had higher putrescine and spermidine, 1. 2 and 1. 0 mg/kg, respectively, than the other types of milk. Conclusions: The database aids other researchers in their quest for information regarding polyamine intake from foods.

Proteolysis is the major – and certainly the most complex of biochemical events that take place during ripening of most cheese varieties; it affects, to important extents, both development of Protein in cheese is broken down from casein to low molecular weight peptides and amino acids by various kinds of proteolytic enzymes. During coagulation, the initial step of casein hydrolysis is performed by chymosin (milk coagulant) and proteinases from starter lactic acid bacteria, starter moulds and other microorgan-isms. The further degradation of high molecular weight peptides produced at the initial step is catalysed to low molecular weight peptides by endopeptidases from lactic acid bacteria.

The unique flavours of the individual cheeses develop during ripening, and are highly dependent on the type of starter and in many cases of secondary inocula added to, or gaining access to the cheese milk or curd (Fox, 1993; Rehman et al., 2000). On the other hand, the physicochemical parameters – pH, water activity and salt concentration – necessary to direct the biochemical reac-tions are set during manufacturing of cheese curd. Deviation from these three parameters, may lead to cheeses with inconsistent tex-ture and/or flavour. Thus, curds for different cheese varieties are include enzymes indigenous to milk (plasmin) and rennet (pepsin and chymosin), or released by starter, non-starter and adjunct star...|$|E
