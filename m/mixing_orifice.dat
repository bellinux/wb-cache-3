40|$|Mixing of gaseous jets in a {{cross-flow}} {{has significant}} applications in engineering, {{one example of}} which is the dilution zone of a gas turbine combustor. Despite years of study, the design of the jet injection in combustors is largely based on practical experience. The emergence of NO(x) regulations for stationary gas turbines and the anticipation of aero-engine regulations requires an improved understanding of jet mixing as new combustor concepts are introduced. For example, the success of the staged combustor to reduce the emission of NO(x) is almost entirely dependent upon the rapid and complete dilution of the rich zone products within the mixing section. It is these mixing challenges to which the present study is directed. A series of experiments was undertaken to delineate the optimal mixer orifice geometry. A cross-flow to core-flow momentum-flux ratio of 40 and a mass flow ratio of 2. 5 were selected as representative of a conventional design. An experimental test matrix was designed around three variables: the number of orifices, the orifice length-to- width ratio, and the orifice angle. A regression analysis was performed on the data to arrive at an interpolating equation that predicted the mixing performance of orifice geometry combinations within the range of the test matrix parameters. Results indicate that the best <b>mixing</b> <b>orifice</b> geometry tested involves eight orifices with a long-to-short side aspect ratio of 3. 5 at a twenty-three degree inclination from the center-line of the mixing section...|$|E
40|$|Isothermal CFD {{analysis}} was performed on axially opposed rows of jets mixing with cross flow in a rectangular duct. Laterally, the jets' centerlines were aligned with {{each other on the}} top and bottom walls. The focus {{of this study was to}} characterize the effects of orifice aspect ratio and jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratio on jet penetration and <b>mixing.</b> <b>Orifice</b> aspect ratios (L/W) of 4 -to- 1, 2 -to- 1, and 1 -to- 1, along with circular holes, were parametrically analyzed. Likewise, jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratios (MR) of 2. 0, 0. 5, and 0. 25 were systematically investigated. The jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratio (J) was maintained at 36 for all cases, and the orifice spacing-to-duct height (S/H) was varied until optimum mixing was attained for each configuration. The numerical results showed that orifice aspect ratio (and likewise orifice blockage) had little effect on jet penetration and mixing. Based on mixing characteristics alone, the 4 -to- 1 slot was comparable to the circular orifice. The 4 -to- 1 slot has a smaller jet wake which may be advantageous for reducing emissions. However, the axial length of a 4 -to- 1 slot may be prohibitively long for practical application, especially for MR of 2. 0. The jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratio had a more significant effect on jet penetration and mixing. For a 4 -to- 1 aspect ratio orifice, the design correlating parameter for optimum mixing (C = (S/H) (sq. root J)) varied from 2. 25 for a mass flow ratio of 2. 0 to 1. 5 for a mass flow ratio of 0. 25...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} and summarizes {{elements of}} the High Speed Research (HSR) Low Emissions Rich burn/Quick mix/Lean burn (RQL) flame tube combustor test program. This test program was performed at NASA Glenn Research Center circa 1992. The overall objective of this test program was to demonstrate and evaluate the capability of the RQL combustor concept for High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) applications {{with the goal of}} achieving NOx emission index levels of 5 g/kg-fuel at representative HSCT supersonic cruise conditions. The specific objectives of the tests reported herein were to investigate component performance of the RQL combustor concept for use in the evolution of ultra-low NOx combustor design tools. Test results indicated that the RQL combustor emissions and performance at simulated supersonic cruise conditions were predominantly sensitive to the quick mixer subcomponent performance and not sensitive to fuel injector performance. Test results also indicated the mixing section configuration employing a single row of circular holes was the lowest NOx mixer tested probably due to the initial fast mixing characteristics of this mixing section. However, other quick <b>mix</b> <b>orifice</b> configurations such as the slanted slot mixer produced substantially lower levels of carbon monoxide emissions most likely due to the enhanced circumferential dispersion of the air addition. Test results also suggested that an optimum momentum-flux ratio exists for a given quick mix configuration. This would cause undesirable jet under- or over-penetration for test conditions with momentum-flux ratios below or above the optimum value. Tests conducted to assess the effect of quick mix flow area indicated that reduction in the quick mix flow area produced lower NOx emissions at reduced residence time, but this had no effect on NOx emissions measured at similar residence time for the configurations tested...|$|R
40|$|Mixing of gaseous jets in a {{crossflow}} {{has significant}} applications in combustion science and engineering, {{one example of}} which is the mixing zone of a rich-burn/quick-mix/lean-burn gas turbine combustor. A major design question is the jet orifice shape and jet orifice number that optimizes the mixing performance. To delineate the optimal orifice features for a given axial distance and momentum-flux ratio, a statistical design of experiments test matrix was established around three variables: the number of orifices, the orifice aspect ratio, and the orifice angle (in circumferential plane). A jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratio of 40 and a mass-flow ratio of 2. 5 were selected as representative of a practical design. To yield an interpolating equation that predicts the <b>mixing</b> performance of <b>orifice</b> geometry combinations within the range of the test matrix parameters, a regression analysis was conducted on the data. The results reveal that 1) mixture uniformity is a nonlinear function of the number of orifices, the orifice aspect ratio, and the orifice angle and that 2) optimum mixing occurs when the mean jet trajectories are in the range of 0. 30 < ζ/R < 0. 5 (where ζ = R-r) at x/R = 1. At the optimum number of orifices, the difference between shallow-angled slots with large aspect ratios and round holes is minimal and either geometry produces optimal mixing performance...|$|R

At the optimum number of orifices, it appears possible to have two local optimums where one corresponds to an aspect ratio of 1. 0 and the other to a high aspect ratio...|$|R
