40|$|With the {{approaching}} sunset on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Tanzania continues with its final national push towards achievement of MDG # 4 and MDG # 5. The Mama Kwanza Socio-economic Health Initiative (MKSHI) {{was introduced in}} the hope of contributing to improving <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> in Arusha <b>and</b> Ngorongoro. The MKSHI project is a holistic, inter-sectoral approach to <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> which aligns with the Government of Tanzania's Vision 2025. At the project onset, a baseline assessment was conducted to launch ongoing benchmarking, monitoring, and evaluation of the project's impacts and implications. The aim of this baseline assessment was twofold. First it was to determine the state of <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> in the two project sites. Second it was to ensure that a baseline of key indicators was established as well as identification of unique indicators relevant to the populations of interest. The baseline study was a mixed methods approach to identify <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> risk factors <b>and</b> indicators in the two target sites. This paper focuses on the qualitative methods and findings. The qualitative component included a series of five community dialogue meetings and thirty-seven individual/dyad interviews with women, providers, and stakeholders. Initially, community meetings were held as open dialogues on <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> issues, opportunities, <b>and</b> preferred futures. Individual/dyad interviews were held with women, providers, and stakeholders who held unique information or experiences. Both community dialogue and interview data was analysed for themes and guiding or critical comments. Three over-arching findings emerged: What took you so long to come? How do we know what you know? and How will it change for our daughters? Participant voices are vital in ensuring the achievement of local and global efforts and preferred futures for <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> services.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.|$|E
25|$|Although disease-specific {{interventions}} are important, further {{strengthening of the}} public-health system will be needed if China is to halve the prevalence of tuberculosis {{and the number of}} deaths caused by the disease. To increase access, a package of essential public-health services for rural inhabitants and urban migrants should be provided with governmental subsidies. This package should include services for at least tuberculosis, immunisation, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health.</b> The government must also address the warped incentives in hospitals that encourage the generation of profits from drugs, tests, and state-of-the-art technologies. This profit generation fuels the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including tuberculosis. Finally, the government should provide operational costs for public-health services and full salaries for health-care workers, especially at and below the county level, where most of the rural population live. The number of staff needed for essential public-health functions should be carefully calculated, and public-health workers must be given fair pay. Without this, the development and maintenance of a motivated and skilled public-health workforce {{to meet the challenges of}} the 21st century will be difficult.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Timely {{reliable}} data on aid {{flows to}} <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> {{are essential for}} assessing the adequacy of current levels of funding, and to promote accountability among donors for attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> <b>health.</b> We provide global estimates of official development assistance (ODA) to <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> in 2003 <b>and</b> 2004, drawing on data reported by high-income donor countries and aid agencies to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation. METHODS: ODA was tracked on a project-by-project basis to 150 developing countries. We applied a standard definition of <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> across donors, <b>and</b> included not only funds specific to these areas, but also integrated health funds and disease-specific funds allocated on a proportional distribution basis, using appropriate factors. FINDINGS: Donor spending on activities related to <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> {{was estimated to be}} US 1990 million dollars in 2004, representing just 2 % of gross aid disbursements to developing countries. The 60 priority low-income countries that account for most <b>child</b> <b>and</b> newborn deaths received 1363 million dollars, or 3. 1 dollars per child. Across recipient countries, there is a positive association between mortality and ODA per head, although at any given rate of mortality for children aged younger than 5 years or maternal mortality, there is significant variation in the amount of ODA per person received by developing countries. INTERPRETATION: The current level of ODA to <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> is inadequate to provide more than {{a small portion of the}} total resources needed to reach the MDGs for <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> <b>health.</b> If commitments are to be honoured, global aid flows will need to increase sharply during the next 5 years. The challenge will be to ensure a sufficient share of these new funds is channelled effectively towards the scaling up of key <b>maternal,</b> newborn, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health</b> interventions in high priority countries...|$|R

Methods: a cross-sectional ecological study with analysis on Sinasc variables from 19 Regional Health Coordinations in Rio Grande do Sul. The variables occurrence frequencies were calculated and analyzed by Spearman correlation. Results: we observed that a higher maternal level of education, {{the presence of a}} partner and the adequate number of prenatal consultations reduced the frequency of vaginal delivery, as for the proportion of cesarean section, it was 62 %. The frequency of low schooling was associated to prematurity (rho = 0. 521, p= 0. 022) and low birth weight (rho = 0. 542, p= 0. 016). The low prenatal coverage correlated positively with the Apgar score ≤ 7 in the 5 th minute (rho = 0. 467; p= 0. 044) and negatively with adequate birth weight (rho = - 0. 500; p= 0. 029).

500|$|Women's {{health has}} been {{described}} as [...] "a patchwork quilt with gaps". Although many of the issues around women's health relate to their reproductive health, including <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>health,</b> genital health and breast health, and endocrine (hormonal) health, including menstruation, birth control and menopause, a broader understanding of women's health to include all aspects of the health of women has been urged, replacing [...] "Women's Health" [...] with [...] "The Health of Women". The WHO considers that an undue emphasis on reproductive health has been a major barrier to ensuring access to good quality health care for all women. Conditions that affect both men and women, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, also manifest differently in women. Women's health issues also include medical situations in which women face problems not directly related to their biology, such as gender-differentiated access to medical treatment and other socioeconomic factors. Women's health is of particular concern due to widespread discrimination against women in the world, leaving them disadvantaged.|$|E
