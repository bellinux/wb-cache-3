An effective implementation will provide <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> <b>moderators</b> with a method for handling so-called "flame" (i. e. aggressive) messages, "spam" (e. g. widely distributed commercial solicitations) messages and other inappropriate submissions to large, high-volume electronic <b>mailing</b> <b>lists.</b> The most effective means of distinguishing between wanted and unwanted messages is by one or more individuals acting as moderator, editing all submissions, rejecting inappropriate ones, and forwarding the rest to the list participants in a timely fashion. Significant growth in email has begun to make this job very difficult to do effectively and th...|$|R

40|$|Electronic <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> are {{ubiquitous}} community-forging {{tools that}} serve the important needs of Internet users, both experienced and novice. The most popular <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> managers generally use textual mail-based interfaces for all list operations, from subscription management to list administration. Unfortunately, anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} most <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> users, and many <b>list</b> administrators and <b>moderators</b> are novice to intermediate computer users; textual interfaces are often difficult for such people to use effectively. This paper describes Mailman, the GNU <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> manager, which offers a dramatic step forward in usability and integration over other <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> management systems. Mailman brings to list management an integrated Web interface for nearly all aspects of <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> interaction, including subscription requests and option settings by members, list configuration and Web page editing by list administrators, and post approvals by <b>list</b> <b>moderators.</b> Mailman offers a mix of robustness, functionality and ease of installation and use that is unsurpassed by other freely available <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> managers. Thus, it offers great benefits to site administrators, list administrators and end users alike. Mailman is primarily implemented in Python, a free, object-oriented scripting language; {{there are a few}} C wrapper programs for security. Mailman’s architecture is based on a centralized list-oriented database that contains configuration options for each list. This allows for several unique and flexible administrative mechanisms. In addition to Web access, traditional email-command based control and interactive manipulation via the Python interpreter are als...|$|R
50|$|A <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> archive is a {{collection}} of past messages from one or more electronic <b>mailing</b> <b>lists.</b> Such archives often include searching and indexing functionality. Many archives are directly associated with the <b>mailing</b> <b>list,</b> but some organizations, such as Gmane, collect archives from multiple <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> hosted at different organizations; thus, one message sent to one popular <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> may end up in many different archives. Gmane had over 9,000 <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> archives as of 16 January 2007. Some popular free software programs for collecting <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> archives are Hypermail, MHonArc, and FUDforum.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Currently, many {{government}} offices and companies use <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> for reaching their clients. Any <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> needs continuous updates that include removing unsubscribed emails, inserting new coming emails, and removing duplications. Duplication can occur when merging two <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> into one master <b>mailing</b> <b>list,</b> where both the merged lists contain the same email {{more than one}} or when any one of the <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> contain the same email many times. Existing algorithms for removing duplications in <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> require time complexity greater than linear. Most of them sort emails in alphabetical order and then remove the duplication in O(n log n). However, we are able to reduce the time complexity to O(n) using hashing. This saves the time and the efforts of the senders...|$|R

30|$|We {{identified}} 285 <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> archived in the GNOME ecosystem. We {{searched for}} <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> used for cross-project communication and release management.

The subscription to the release-team <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> {{is limited to the}} release team members, therefore, it is an internal <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> and no a cross-project communication channel.
