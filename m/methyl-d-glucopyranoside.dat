40|$|Summary. -A {{substance}} {{capable of}} inducing tumour cell aggregation, {{which is supposed}} to be a glycoprotein showing noncytotoxicity, was separated from rat ascites hepatoma cells and partially purified by chromatography. Adhesiveness of rat ascites hepatoma cells induced by this substance was characterized by gradual development of known binding structures during a period of 24 h after contact with the substance; simple apposition and intermediate junctions developed in the early stage, and desmosomes and focal tight junctions in the later stage. It was assumed that the substance might be involved in the development of such binding structures as a triggering mechanism of tumour cell adhesiveness. This is No. 2 of the studies oni turnour cell aggIregatioIn promoting factor. As PREVIOUSLY described (Kudo et al., 1974), a substance capable of promoting tumour cell aggregation has been separated from the surface of rat ascites hepatoma cells and partially purified by chromatography. The substance was noncytotoxic and clearly effective for adhesiveness of rat ascites hepatoma cells as well as SV 40 transformed cells, but not for normal rat liver cells and red blood cells. It was assumed to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 72, 000. The action of this material was clearly more potent than that of concanavalin A (con A). Its effect was not influenced by con A inhibitor such as alpha <b>methyl-D-glucopyranoside,</b> N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucose. As is well known, the mechanisms which control cell adhesiveness have been suggested as being intimately related to the surface properties of the cells, and specific sugar containing macromolecular constituents of the cell surface have been suggested to mediate cell adhesiveuess (Lilien and Moscona, 1967; Lilien, 1968). The mechanisms of tumouir cell adhesiveness appear to be important for explaining malignant invasion. The purpose of the present communication is to describe the light and electron microscopic process of rat ascites hepatoma cell adhesiveness induced by this substance...|$|E
