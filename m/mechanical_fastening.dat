50|$|The use of {{adhesives}} {{offers many}} advantages over binding {{techniques such as}} sewing, <b>mechanical</b> <b>fastening,</b> thermal bonding, etc. These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility. Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing. Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin, or by their starting physical phase.|$|E

40|$|Most {{air duct}} system {{components}} are {{assembled in the}} field and are mechanically fastened by sheet metal screws (for sheet metal-to-sheet metal) or by drawbands (for flex duct-to-sheet metal). Air sealing is separate from this <b>mechanical</b> <b>fastening</b> and is usually achieved using tape or mastic products after <b>mechanical</b> <b>fastening.</b> Field observations have shown that <b>mechanical</b> <b>fastening</b> rarely meets code or manufacturers requirements and that sealing procedures are similarly inconsistent. To address these problems, Proctor Engineering Group (PEG) is developing a system of joining ducts (called PEGIT) that combines the <b>mechanical</b> <b>fastening</b> and sealing into a single self-contained procedure. The PEGIT system uses a shaped flexible seal between specially designed sheet metal duct fittings to both seal and fasten duct sections together. Figure 1 shows the inner duct fitting complete with rubber seal. This seal provides the air seal for the completed fitting and is shaped to allow the inner and outer fittings to slide together, and then to lock the fittings in place. The illustration in Figure 2 shows the approximate cross section of the rubber seal that shows how the seal has a lip that is angled backwards. This angled lip allows the joint to be pushed together by folding flat but then its long axis makes it stiff in the pulling apart direction. This study was undertaken to assist PEG in some of the design aspects of this system and to test the performance of the PEGIT system. This study was carried out in three phases. The initial phase evaluated the performance of a preliminary seal design for the PEGIT system. After the first phase, the seal was redesigned and this new seal was evaluated in the second phase of testing. The third phase performed more detailed testing of the second seal design to optimize the production tolerances of the sheet metal fittings. This report summarizes our findings from the first two phases and provides details about the third phase of testing...|$|E

40|$|Resistance welding is an {{alternative}} process to <b>mechanical</b> <b>fastening</b> and adhesive bonding in joining thermoplastic composites. The resistance welding procedure involves the Joule heating of a heating element located between two adjoining thermoplastics.

This results in a fusion bond between the two components. A fuzzy logic controller is designed and implemented in real-time using the temperature estimate as the feedback signal.
