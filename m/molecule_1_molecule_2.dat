40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{theoretically}} predict the vibrational spectra of select high energy density materials (HEDMs) {{as well as some}} of their byproducts and to determine if using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) could be a viable detection method for these compounds. Studying the vibrational patterns of these compounds will help in identifying them in the environment for remediation purposes. Because the byproducts are smaller and easier to model than the parent compounds, these were studied more in depth through analyzing their Infrared and Raman spectra. Ag 2 was used to model the interactions between the Ag nanoparticles used in SERS spectroscopy and the N atoms of the byproducts to investigate any changes in the spectra of the isolated <b>molecules.</b> Two <b>molecules</b> (<b>1,</b> <b>2,</b> 4, 5 -tetrazine and 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetrazine) displayed significant increases in the Raman activity (on the order of 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 4) when Ag 2 interacted with the N atoms. In most cases, however, adding Ag 2 only slightly enhanced the Raman activities. These results suggest that larger Ag clusters may be required to adequately model the SERS effect for these compounds...|$|R

To envision the binding of cefditoren to PBPs, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of PBP 2 X from S. pneumoniae strain R 6 complexed with cefditoren. There are two PBP <b>2</b> X <b>molecules</b> (designated <b>molecules</b> <b>1</b> and <b>2)</b> per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the orientation of Trp 374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket.

The asymmetric unit contains four crystallographically independent molecules. In the crystal, <b>molecules</b> <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are linked via O&# 8212;H [...] . N hydrogen bonds, forming chains propagating along [010]. Molecules 3 and 4 are linked to these chains via O&# 8212;H [...] . O hydrogen bonds...|$|R
40|$|The {{asymmetric}} unit of {{the crystal}} of the title compound, C 15 H 17 NO 2 S, contains two independent molecules, which are twisted at the S&# 8212;N bonds with C&# 8212;SO 2 &# 8212;NH&# 8212;C torsion angles of 48. 3 &# 8197;(2) (<b>molecule</b> <b>1)</b> and &# 8722; 75. 7 &# 8197;(3) &# 176; (<b>molecule</b> <b>2).</b> The dihedral angles between the benzene rings are 72. 0 &# 8197;(1) (<b>molecule</b> <b>1)</b> and 78. 3 &# 8197;(1) &# 176; (<b>molecule</b> <b>2).</b> The crystal structure features inversion dimers linked by pairs of N&# 8212;H [...] .

40|$|A {{series of}} {{fluorinated}} molecular probes were synthesized that {{are characterized by}} spacer arms of various lengths and polarities. Previous <b>molecules</b> (<b>1,</b> <b>2</b> a, 2 b, 2 c, 3 a, 3 b) were covalently fixed {{on the surface of}} poly(ethlylene terephthalate) (PET) membranes via activated hydroxyl chain endings. X-ray photoelectron microscopic analysis of the grafted samples allowed us to quantify the PET surface reactivity; the results were within 40 - 50 pmol/cm(2) of fixed probes, independent of the length and hydrophilicity of the spacer arms.
