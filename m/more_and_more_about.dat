25|$|As {{complaints}} surfaced criticizing <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the government's policies, the regent Huo Guang, {{who was the}} {{de facto}} ruler of China after Emperor Wu of Han, called a court conference to debate whether the policies of Emperor Wu should be continued. The resulting debate was divided into two groups, the reformists and the modernists. The reformists, largely provincial Confucian scholars, backed privatization {{and a return to}} the laissez-faire policies of old. The modernists, on the other hand, largely represented the interests of the central government and were more in tune with legalist philosophy, as well as being admirers of the previous Qin dynasty, whose harsh and numerous laws had been based on legalist principles.|$|E
500|$|... 2002: In September, sportswriter Peter King {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Favre during spring training. Favre {{told him that he}} missed home and was thinking <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> retirement. When then head-coach Mike Sherman told the players they could have off on Saturday and Sunday, Favre replied [...] "I wish I could be on my lawn mower back home." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinker also {{identifies}} {{himself as}} an atheist. In the 2007 interview with the Point of Inquiry podcast, Pinker states that he would [...] "defend atheism as an empirically supported view." [...] He sees theism and atheism as competing empirical hypotheses, and states that [...] "we're learning <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> what makes us tick, including our moral sense, without needing the assumption of a deity or a soul. It's naturally getting crowded out by the successive naturalistic explanations." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the game}} opens, Naija has lost {{almost all of}} her memories, and is unaware of the world outside of her home as she [...] "lives as a simple creature". The player is told this in {{voice-over}} narrations {{in the form of}} a story told by a future Naija. These narrations serve as the primary source of information about Naija throughout the game, though there are occasional cutscenes. After being confronted by a shadowy figure and being shown a series of flashbacks she does not understand, Naija awakens. Feeling loneliness as the only member of her species, Naija decides to explore the world around her. As the player explores, Naija discovers <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the history of the world, [...] "Aquaria", and about her own past. The player is not forced to go through the plotline in a set sequence. The only limiting factor is physical barriers such as areas that can only be accessed by using a specific form. Combinations of these physical limitations place some plot elements later in the game. The narrative for the majority of the game is centered on Naija's exploration of a series of ruined civilizations that she finds, each with a large monster in them. These civilizations make up the different regions of the game.|$|E
500|$|Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, {{have trouble}} {{accepting}} one another. Initially, Marceline feels {{that her father}} does not care for her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned [...] "Fry Song". Although they admit to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline {{to follow in the}} family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode [...] "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship. Former storyboard artist and current supervising director for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history {{was not part of the}} series' initial plan, but something that [...] "evolved from [...] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|While Riel awaited {{news from}} Ottawa he {{considered}} returning to Montana, but had by February resolved to stay. Without a productive course of action, Riel began {{to engage in}} obsessive prayer, and was experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations. This led to a deterioration in {{his relationship with the}} Catholic hierarchy, as he publicly espoused an increasingly heretical doctrine. On 11 February 1885, a response to the petition was received. The government proposed to take a census of the North-West Territories, and to form a commission to investigate grievances. This angered a faction of the Métis who saw it as a mere delaying tactic; they favoured taking up arms at once. Riel became the leader of this faction, but he lost the support practically all the Anglophones (who included many Métis), the Catholic Church, and the great majority of Indians. [...] He also lost the support of the Métis faction supporting local leader Charles Nolin. But Riel, undoubtedly influenced by his messianic delusions, became increasingly supportive of this course of action. In the church at Saint-Laurent on 15 March, Riel disrupted a sermon to argue for this position, following which he was barred from receiving the sacraments. He took <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> his [...] "divine revelations". But disenchanted with the status quo, and swayed by Riel's charisma and eloquent rhetoric, hundreds of Métis remained loyal to Riel, despite his proclamations that Bishop Ignace Bourget should be accepted as pope, and that [...] "Rome has fallen".|$|E

2500|$|Pauling {{attributes}} {{his interest}} in becoming a chemist to being amazed by experiments conducted by a friend, Lloyd A. Jeffress, who had a small chemistry lab kit. He later wrote: [...] "I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; and I hoped to learn <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> {{this aspect of the}} world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The crime {{had been}} unsolved {{for two years}} when, in October 2003, local media again covered the murder. Erickson {{reportedly}} had several dreams about the crime after seeing an article in a newspaper and, a few days later, mentioned the murder to Ferguson asking him if he thought {{he may have been}} involved. [...] "It was crazy that someone had been murdered a couple blocks away from where we had been partying". said Erickson. Ferguson reassured him that he was not involved in the crime. Over time, Erickson says, he began to think <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the murders and {{about the fact that he}} could not remember that evening.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a capital}} idea, and I began {{immediately}} to work upon it. I managed the story very deftly; {{at least that}} was my opinion. My two principal characters made their appearance in Sicily, and at first were so intermingled with scenery and incidents as not to be very prominent; then they came more to the front, and other characters introduced themselves upon occasion. As these personages appeared and reappeared, I hoped that they would gradually surround themselves with an interest which would steadily increase the desire to know <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> them. Thus, as I went on, I said less and less about Sicily, and <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> my characters, especially the young man and the young woman, the curious blending of whose lives I was endeavoring to depict.|$|E

60|$|And so {{with the}} Jews. They fell from their liberty and chose a king. And yet God made use of those kings of theirs, of David, of Solomon, of Josiah, and Hezekiah, to teach them <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Himself and His law, and to teach all nations, by their example, what a nation should be, and how He deals with one.|$|E

6000|$|The {{grandfather}} {{hated to}} carve, {{and so one}} of the papas did it; and [...] whenever he gave anybody a piece, the grandfather would tell some new [...] story about the turkey, till pretty soon the aunties got to saying, [...] "Now, father, stop!"

60|$|Obs. 2. When the Plate of Air, {{by turning}} the Prisms about their common Axis, became so little {{inclined}} to the incident Rays, {{that some of them}} began to be transmitted, there arose in it many slender Arcs of Colours which at first were shaped almost like the Conchoid, as you see them delineated in the first Figure. And by continuing the Motion of the Prisms, these Arcs increased and bended <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the said transparent spot, till they were compleated into Circles or Rings incompassing it, and afterwards continually grew more and more contracted.|$|E
60|$|There {{he waited}} for three-quarters of an hour, {{constantly}} looking at his watch, and thinking <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> that deed of gift. Surely {{it must be the}} case that the document which he had seen had some reference to this great delay. At last he heard a door open, and a step along a passage, and then another door was opened, and Mr Slow reappeared with Margaret Mackenzie behind him. John Ball's eyes immediately fell on his cousin's face, and he could see that it was very pale. The lawyer's wore that smile which men put on when they wish to cover the disagreeable seriousness of the moment.|$|E

50|$|Hitler, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> worried <b>about</b> an Italian collapse, {{decided to}} send the 1st Fallschirmjäger-Division to Sicily immediately, and then sent the {{headquarters}} of XIV Panzer Corps (under General Hube) and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division, ready for deployment, to Reggio Calabria. On 17 July, Hitler decided to meet with Mussolini and his collaborators, and assess their resolve to continue the war.|$|R
6000|$|This is {{faith in}} God, by which alone we, or any man, can live worthily,--by which these old heroes lived. We read, in the twelfth chapter of Hebrews, {{that it was}} by faith these elders {{obtained}} a good report; and {{the whole history of}} the Old-Testament saints is the history of God speaking to the hearts of one man after another, teaching them each <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Himself, and the history also of these men listening to the voice of God in their hearts, and BELIEVING that voice, and acting faithfully upon it, into whatever strange circumstances or deeds it might lead them. [...] "By faith," [...] we read in this same chapter,--"by faith Noah, being warned of God, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith." ...|$|E
60|$|As I went on, I {{began to}} learn <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> my father. He had made money in Australia, it was said, {{and had come}} to live at Woodbury some {{fourteen}} years earlier, where my mother had died when I was a child of four; and some accounts {{said she was a}} widow of fortune. My father had been interested in chemistry and photography, it seemed, and had lately completed a new invention, the acmegraph, for taking successive photographs at measured intervals of so many seconds by electric light. He was a grave, stern man, the papers said, more feared than loved by his servants and neighbours; but nobody about was known to have a personal grudge against him. On the contrary, he lived at peace with all men. The motive for the murder remained to the end a complete mystery.|$|E
6000|$|Valori, {{who is to}} be of Friedrich's Campaign this Year, came posting off {{directly}} in rear of the glorious news of Fontenoy; found Friedrich at Camenz, rather in spirits than otherwise; and lodged pleasantly with Abbot Tobias and him, till the Campaign should begin. Two things surprise Valori: first, the great strength, impregnable as it were, to which Neisse has been brought since he saw it last,--superlative condition of that Fortress, and of the Army itself, as it gathers daily <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Frankenstein here:--and then secondly, and contrariwise, the strangely neglected posture of mountainous or Upper Silesia, given up to Pandours. Quite submerged, in a manner: Margraf Karl lies quiet among them at Jagerndorf, [...] "eating his magazine;" [...] General Hautcharmoi (Winterfeld's late chief in that Wurben affair), with his small Detachment, still hovers about in those Ratibor parts, [...] "with the Strong Towns to fall-back upon," [...] or has in effect fallen back accordingly; and nothing done to coerce the Pandours at all. While Prince Karl and Weissenfels are daily coming on, in force 100,000, their intention certain; force, say, about 100,000 regular! Very singular to Valori.|$|E
