The names and divisions are classification devices based on theoretical perspectives, analytical <b>methods,</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> {{available at the time}} of analysis and publication. They are subject to change, not only on the basis of new information and discoveries, but also as attitudes and perspectives change within the scientific community. It should not be assumed that an archaeological division or culture unit corresponds to a particular language group or to a socio-political entity such as a tribe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{reduce the}} {{computational}} {{burden of the}} reliability analysis of complex engineering application, approximate method is always used to construct the surrogate model of the implicit limit state function. Since the limit state function is a classifier of the failure domain and safe domain, its approximation can be established by the function regression <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> classification <b>method.</b> In this paper, these two methods are tested to several limit state functions including linear function, highly nonlinear function, high dimensional function, series system and parallel system. Least squares support vector machines are used to construct the surrogate models. A detail comparison of function regression <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> classification <b>method</b> for limit state function approximation is given. The conclusions of this paper can give guidance for the engineers to choose an appropriate approximate method in the engineering applications...|$|R
