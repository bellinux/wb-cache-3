40|$|ABSTRACT. Each spring, small ditches {{perpendicular}} to sugarcane rows (quarter-drains) {{that are responsible}} for transferring runoff from furrows to <b>main</b> <b>ditches</b> have to be re-conditioned to be effective. Bare soil surfaces in quarter-drains and furrows are exposed to intense rainfalls. Raindrop energy from rainfall causes detachment of soil particles and sediment transport from furrows through quarter-drains to <b>main</b> <b>ditches.</b> In time, sediment transported from furrows that accumulates in <b>main</b> <b>ditches</b> diminishes the capacity of these structures, thus requiring frequent and costly sediment cleanup. On average, yearly cost of sediment cleanup from surface ditches is $ 293 /ha. Present practice in managing post-harvest residue is burning. However, burning is a questionable management practice and has a negative effect on the environment and human health due to discharging toxic gases into the atmosphere. An alternative to burning is to leave sugarcane residue on the surface after harvest. This practice could provide multiple benefits such as reducing soil sediment, enhancing soil quality in terms of increasing soil organic carbon, and decreasing cost for cleanup of surface ditches. To evaluate these benefits, an experiment was conducted to study effects of sugarcane post-harvest residue and Polyacrylamide (PAM) applied directly to quarter-drains in spring 2003. Twelve plots (0. 1 ha each) were planted to sugarcane. For the residue treatment, residue was left on site after harvest and swept to furrows. Comparison was made with similar quarter-drains on six plots where residue was removed by burning. Treatments were: (1) residue left on the field; (2) no residue; (3) residue + PAM applied; and (4) no residue + PAM applied. Following each rainfall event, which produced runoff (four events), measurements o...|$|R

While previous studies have attempted to simulate the runoff-response of a resaca, they were greatly limited by the lack of detailed topographic data and information describing the hydraulic structures that connect one resaca pool to the next.

40|$|Intensified {{agricultural}} practises introduced {{after the}} Second World War {{are identified as}} {{a major cause of}} global biodiversity declines. In several European countries agri-environment support schemes have been introduced to counteract the ongoing biodiversity declines. Farmers participating in agri-environment schemes are financially compensated for decreasing the intensity of farming practises leading to smaller yields and lower income. The Finnish agri-environment support scheme is composed of a set of measures, such as widened field margins along <b>main</b> <b>ditches</b> (obligatory measure), management of features increasing landscape diversity, management of semi-natural grasslands, and organic farming (special agreement measures). The magnitude of the benefits for biodiversity depends on landscape context and the properties of individual schemes. In this thesis I studied whether one agri-environment scheme, organic farming, is beneficial for species diversity and abundance of diurnal lepidopterans, bumblebees, carabid beetles and arable weeds. I found that organic farming did not enhance species richness of selected insect taxa, although bumblebee species richness tended to be higher in organic farms. Abundance of lepidopterans and bumblebees was not enhanced by organic farming, but carabid beetle abundance was higher in mixed farms with both cereal crop production and animal husbandry. Both species richness and abundance of arable weeds were higher in organic farms. My second objective was to study how landscape structure shapes farmland butterfly communities. I found that the percentage of habitat specialists and species with poor dispersal abilities in butterfly assemblages decreased with increasing arable field cover, leading to a dramatic decrease in butterfly beta diversity. In field boundaries local species richness of butterflies was linearly related to landscape species richness in geographic regions with high arable field cover, indicating that butterfly species richness in field boundaries is more limited by landscape factors than local habitat factors. In study landscapes containing semi-natural grasslands the relationship decelerated at high landscape species richness, suggesting that local species richness of butterflies in field boundaries is limited by habitat factors (demanding habitat specialists that occurred in semi-natural grasslands were absent in field margins). My results suggest that management options in field margins will affect mainly generalists, and species with good dispersal abilities, in landscapes with high arable field cover. Habitat specialists and species with poor dispersal abilities may benefit of management options if these are applied in the vicinity of source populations. Ei saatavill...|$|R

5000|$|The abbey was {{situated}} on an elevated area of ground, of around 23 acres, {{south of the}} River Lud. The river {{was used by the}} abbey to turn the wheel of the grain mill that had been given to them by Alexander of Lincoln 'to ever more to possess', but was too distant for general water needs, or to supply their fishponds. To solve this, the monks dug a ditch to bring water from the springs of Ashwell and St. Helen's at Louth to the abbey grounds. The ditch reached the abbey from the east and then divided into east and west channels around its edges, effectively forming a moat. The western channel circled around northwards and rejoined the main channel. To the east, the water was sent into two fishponds, one 'of great size', was still full of water, and stocked with fish, in the late 1800s. Now known as 'Monks' Dyke', although substantially altered, the <b>main</b> <b>ditch</b> from the Louth spings still survives today.The earliest abbey buildings, built by the monks after the foundation, were plain and unadorned, as preferred by the Cistercians, in the Transitional Norman style.

40|$|Changes in {{land use}} and {{agricultural}} intensification caused wetlands on the quaternary aquifer of Vitoria-Gasteiz (Basque Country) to disappear some years ago and nitrate concentration in groundwaters increased very quickly. The Basque Government recently declared the East Sector of this aquifer a Vulnerable Zone according to the 91 / 676 /CEE European Directive. Recently, the wetlands have been restored through {{the closure of the}} <b>main</b> drainage <b>ditches,</b> the consequent elevation of the water table and the abondonment of agricultural practices near the wetlands. This is the case of the Zurbano wetland. Restoration has allowed the recovery of its biogeochemical function, which has reduced nitrate concentrations in waters. Nitrate concentrations which exceed 50 mg l – 1 in groundwaters entering into the wetland are less than 10 mg l – 1 at the outlet. Conditions in the wetland are conducive to the loss of nitrates: organic matter rich wetted soils, clay presence allowing a local semiconfined flow and very low hydraulic gradient. Water quality monitoring at several points around the wetland showed the processes involved in nitrate loss, although some aspects still remain unresolved. However, during storm events, the wetland effectively reduces the nitrate concentration entering the Alegria River, the most important river on the quaternary aquifer.

This band of Native Americans negotiated with the government to retain a small reservation at the lake in 1851, but the treaty was never approved by Congress with the band relegated to the Grand Ronde reservation by an 1855 treaty. The lake area was 800 to 1500 acre before it was drained in the mid-1930s by the Wapato Improvement District—created by local landowners—which installed ditches, dikes, and drainage tiles to increase available farmland,primarily for cultivation of onions.
