5|$|After a hiatus, Fox {{returned}} to WWE television, on the September 29 episode of Raw, where she defeated AJ Lee, {{with the help}} of her former rival Paige and subsequently, formed an alliance with her, and went on to pick up another win over AJ on October 20. However, when Fox inadvertently cost Paige a title match at Hell in a Cell, Paige dissolved the alliance by attacking her the following night on Raw. This prompted a traditional four-on-four elimination tag team <b>match,</b> <b>with</b> each captaining a side, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view in November, where Fox's team won the <b>match</b> <b>with</b> a clean sweep. In January 2015, Fox developed a rivalry with Naomi, during which she formed a brief alliance with The Miz and Damien Mizdow, and the trio went on to defeat Naomi and The Usos in a series of mixed tag team matches.

40|$|Objectives: {{to explore}} {{to what extent}} the {{standardized}} Isernhagen Work Systems Functional Capacity Evaluation (IWS FCE) can be <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> observed work demands in workers with chronic low back pain, and, secondly, to explore whether this match can predict sick leave in the year after rehabilitation treatment. Methods: An explorative prognostic cohort study with a one-year follow-up (four, eight and twelve months after baseline) was performed (n = 18). Demographics, back complaints and FCE performance were assessed at baseline. In addition, a workplace assessment (WPA) was performed. Eleven FCE activities were <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> work demands. Sick leave associated with low back pain and physical and psychosocial work demands were assessed during follow-up. Results: Seven activities could be directly <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> WPA data. (Carrying, pushing, pulling, crouching, kneeling, static forward bending, and dynamic bending and rotating.) For some workers, difficulties existed in matching three of the activities (pushing, pulling and crouching). One activity (lifting) could indirectly be <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> WPA data. One activity (walking) could not be <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> WPA data. Two activities (sitting, standing) were excluded from analyses due to practical limitations. No relation was found between FCE performance, work demands, and sick leave during follow-up. Conclusions: Seven FCE activities could be directly <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> work demands. However, not all observed work demands could be <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> IWS FCE activities in the eighteen occupations studied. This quantitative and standardized way of assessing work-related disability is not sufficient to predict work ability and sick leave at the present time...|$|R
