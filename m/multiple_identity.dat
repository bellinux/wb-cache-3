2500|$|Contemporary sociolinguistic {{studies suggest}} that styles are learned, rather than {{assigned}} {{at the time of}} birth. With that said, identities emerge in a time series of social practice, through the combined effects of structure and agency. Because social identities are not static, the speech community model, which was traditionally employed as a sociolinguistic framework in the study of language and gender, is not as reliable as the community of practice model, the new framework emerged from practice theory. Also because social identities are not static, speech styles are actively subject to change, such that one's speech styles have different social meanings across time. Similarly, it is possible for an individual to engage in <b>multiple</b> <b>identity</b> practices simultaneously, and move from one identity to another unconsciously and automatically, and thus the term polyphonous identity. Podesva (2004) is a paper that studies recordings of a gay medical student, whom he called [...] "Heath", as he moved through different situations {{in the course of his}} everyday life. The fact that Heath's pronunciation of the voiceless alveolar stop, /t/, varies when he deals with different groups of people suggest not only some of gay people's speech features, but also the multiplicity of a person's social identity. Furthermore, Podesva also examined the relationship between the California Vowel Shift (CVS) and the gay identity, again by investigating intra-speaker patterns in a single individual, Regan, as opposed to inter-speaker variation, and found that Regan, who is a self-identified gay Asian American, realized CVS differently depending on the context, whether it be a [...] "boys' night out," [...] "dinner with friend," [...] or [...] "meeting with supervisor". This cross-situational patterns are critical in the sense that an individual's speech styles can change not only across time, but also across space, depending on which social identity the individual is attempting to engage in under a given situation. Over-generalizations of social identity, however, overlook this intra-speaker variability.|$|E

The “sense” that employees and managers give to the same “words”, as well as the “sense” that they make for them, mirror the perception they have of the Organizational Identity.

40|$|Social and {{structural}} changes in organizations {{have resulted in}} individuals 2 ̆ 7 enactments of numerous social roles and group affiliations within the workplace. In such complex environments, the psychological experience of managing <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> can present both challenges and opportunities for individuals and organizations. Despite the prevalence of <b>multiple</b> <b>identities,</b> research in organizations has largely focused {{on one or two}} identities. In this dissertation, I present a network model of how <b>multiple</b> intrapersonal <b>identities</b> relate to one another in both conflicting and compatible ways. Furthermore, drawing upon theories of role and cultural identities and knowledge activation, I argue that conflict and compatibility among an individual 2 ̆ 7 s <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> shape access to cognitive and affective processes and hence influence his or her interpersonal problem solving, i. e., {{the extent to which the}} person considers both his/her own and the other party 2 ̆ 7 s goals and interests in a problem situation. Empirically, in Study 1, I operationalized conflict and compatibility among <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> in the form of an intrapersonal identity network. In three subsequent studies I tested the hypotheses that conflict among identities decreases interpersonal problem solving while compatibility among identities increases interpersonal problem solving. The results of Studies 2 and 3 indicate that conflict among one 2 ̆ 7 s <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> decreases problem solving, but there was no support for the hypothesis that compatibility among identities increases problem solving. An additional finding of Study 3 was that compatibility increases yielding and in Study 4, I confirmed this finding. Thus, the results indicate that conflict and compatibility among an individual 2 ̆ 7 s identities differentially influence interpersonal conflict management such that identity conflict decreases problem solving and identity compatibility increases yielding. This research contributes to emerging inquiry on <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> in the workplace by providing a novel theoretical model and an empirical test of the effects of <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> on organizationally relevant outcomes. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{file sharing}} systems have become {{ubiquitous}} and at present the BitTorrent (BT) based P 2 P systems are very popular and successful. It {{has been argued}} that this is mostly due to the Tit-For-Tat (TFT) strategy used in BT [1] that discourages free-ride behavior. However, Hale and Patarin [2] identify the weakness of TFT and hypothesize {{that it is possible to}} use <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> to cheat. To test this hypothesis we modify the official BT source code to allow the creation of multiple processes by one BT client. They use different identities to download the same file cooperatively. We experiment with several piece selection and sharing algorithms and show that BT is fairly robust to the exploitation of <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> except for one case. In most cases, the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> does not provide siginificant speedup consistently. Interestingly, clients with <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> are still punished if they do not maintain a comparable upload rate with other normal clients. We attribute this to the robust way that the Tit-For-Tat policy works. From our experiments we observe that the BT protocol is rather resilient to exploits using <b>multiple</b> <b>identities</b> and it encourages self-regulation among BT clients. Key words: Peer-to-peer networks, BitTorrent, fairness, resource allocation...|$|R

The plaza is situated among/between Imperial Highway, Long Beach Boulevard, State Street and the 105 freeway. The location {{is representative of the}} <b>multiple</b> <b>identity</b> intersections that Latinos (not just in the LA area) live among. Between these borders lies a transnational community that creates a space through which they can transform, reinvent, identify and celebrate with one another. Plaza Mexico does fill an important gap in Latino cultural life in the city. Through the space created within Plaza Mexico, Latinos create and reinvent identities for themselves and through the community represented in the Marketplace. Identity formation is important in this particular setting because “the plaza fulfills a community and cultural function that is somewhat absent from the Los Angeles landscape”. As a result of the increase in rental costs in the area, {{there has not been a}} stable place where Latinos can call their own.
