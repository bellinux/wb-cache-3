5000|$|The {{engine thrust}} acts along the engine centreline. The {{aircraft}} [...] "holds" [...] the engine {{on the outer}} casing of the engine at {{some distance from the}} engine centreline (at the engine mounts). This arrangement causes the engine casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of the engine structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original Pratt & Whitney JT9D engine installation in the Boeing 747 aircraft. The engine <b>mounting</b> <b>arrangement</b> had to be revised with the addition of an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.|$|E
50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel <b>mounting</b> <b>arrangement</b> was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E

A volume comparison of the three configurations was made using a life sciences payload which {{is considered to be}} one of the more voluminous payloads. It was found that crew volume in the 12 -foot baseline configuration appeared marginal for the life sciences payload, especially where crewmen were engaged in activities with competing demands. The 12 -foot configurations of life sciences payloads offered little margin for stowage or equipment growth. Increased demands would necessitate longer module lengths.

40|$|An accelerometer, {{mounted to}} a {{structure}} near an explosion to measure elasto-plastic deformation, can be excited at its resonant frequency by impulsive stresses transmitted within the structure. This results in spurious high peak acceleration levels {{that can be}} much higher than acceleration levels from the explosion itself. The spurious signals also have higher frequencies than the underlying signal from the explosion and can be removed by a low pass filter. This report assesses the performance of four accelerometer and filter assemblies. The assessment involves measurements of the response of a mild steel cylinder to an underwater explosion, in which each assembly is mounted onto the interior surface of the cylinder. Three assemblies utilise a piezoresistive accelerometer in which isolation is provided mechanically. In the fourth assembly, a piezoelectric accelerometer, with a built-in filter, incorporates both mechanical and electronic filtering.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{demonstrate}} that rapid prototyping can be effectively applied for fabricating test models {{to be used in}} aerodynamic experimental investigations. The present work, in particular, concerns a linear cascade of 21 / 2 -D blades, with NACA 65 - 12 (A 10) 10 profile section. Each one of the nine separate (identical) blades of the cascade has been fabricated using a stereolithography rapid prototyping technique.

40|$|A {{lightweight}} High Speed Flexible Coupling (HSFC) is used {{to connect}} the engine gear box (EGB) with an accessory gear box (AGB) for fighter aircrafts. The HSFC transmits the power at high speeds ranging from 10000 to 18000 rpm from the EGB to AGB. The HSFC also accommodates larger angular and axial misalignments resulting from differential thermal expansion of the aircraft engine and <b>mounting</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The HSFC utilizes series of metallic contoured annular thin flexible plates.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the angular {{alignment}} tolerance for Brewsters angle plates is not generally strict. It is often not appreciated that for high index plates however wedge tolerances are small. It is shown that in Brewster angle plates of high refractive index materials, small wedge angles in the fabricated plate can cause internal s-plane reflections to become trapped by total internal reflection. A wedge angle acceptable in terms of its p-plane loss can cause such trapped reflections. In laser systems the resulting multiply reflected beams can move sideways in the plate and eventually hit o-ring seals or other <b>mounting</b> <b>arrangements,</b> causing component damage and leaks in unexpected locations.

40|$|In {{high speed}} cutting, the mean flank {{temperature}} {{is not likely}} to be less than that on the rake face, that is, the cutting temperature, as the undeformed chip thickness is very thin and of the same order of cutting edge radius. To measure the flank mean temperature, it is critically important to mount the artificial thermocouple properly in the workpiece. A new thermocouple <b>mounting</b> <b>arrangement</b> is proposed. The mean flank temperatures in various cutting conditions were measured and the collected chips were examined under SEM to find the burn marks. It was found that below the mean flank temperature of 302 C, there were no burn marks on the chips.

40|$|The {{effect of}} random and {{systematic}} errors {{associated with the}} measurement of normal incidence acoustic impedance in a zero-mean-flow environment was investigated by the transmission line method. The influence of random measurement errors in the reflection coefficients and pressure minima positions was investigated by computing fractional standard deviations of the normalized impedance. Both the standard techniques of random process theory and a simplified technique were used. Over a wavelength range of 68 to 10 cm random measurement errors in the reflection coefficients and pressure minima positions could be described adequately by normal probability distributions with standard deviations of 0. 001 and 0. 0098 cm, respectively. An error propagation technique based on the observed concentration of the probability density functions was found to give essentially the same results but with a computation time of about 1 percent of that required for the standard technique. The results suggest that careful experimental design reduces the effect of random measurement errors to insignificant levels for moderate ranges of test specimen impedance component magnitudes.
