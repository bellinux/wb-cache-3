40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} show us {{that the}} deleterious character of accumulated novel age-specific mutations is reduced and made less variable with increased age. While theories of aging predict that the frequency of deleterious mutations at <b>mutation–selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> will increase with the mutation's age of effect, they do not account for these age-related changes {{in the distribution of}} de novo mutational effects. Furthermore, no model predicts why this dependence of mutational effects upon age exists. Because the nature of mutational distributions plays a critical role in shaping patterns of senescence, we need to develop aging theory that explains and incorporates these effects. Here we propose a model that explains the age dependency of mutational effects by extending Fisher's geometrical model of adaptation to include a temporal dimension. Using a combination of simple analytical arguments and simulations, we show that our model predicts age-specific mutational distributions that are consistent with observations from mutation-accumulation experiments.

40|$|A {{restriction}} enzyme survey of a 110 -kb region including the achaete scute complex (ASC) examined 14 polymorphic molecular markers {{in a sample}} of 56 naturally occurring chromosomes. Large insertions as a class were associated with a reduction in both sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, supporting deleterious <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> models for the maintenance of quantitative genetic variation. Two polymorphic sites were independently associated with variation in bristle number measured in two genetic backgrounds as assessed by a permutation test. A 6 -bp deletion near sc alpha is associated with sternopleural bristle number variation in both sexes and a 3. 4 -kb insertion between sc beta and sc gamma is associated with abdominal bristle number variation in females. Under an additive genetic model, the small deletion polymorphism near sc alpha accounts for 25 % of the total X chromosome genetic variation in sternopleural bristle number, and the 3. 4 kb insertion accounts for 22 % of the total X chromosome variation in female abdominal bristle number.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{solution for the}} mean fitness in mutation-selection balance with arbitrary order of epistatic interaction is derived. The solution {{is based on the}} assumptions of coupling equilibrium and that the interaction effects are multilinear. We find that the effect of m-order epistatic interactions (i. e., interactions among groups of m loci) on the load is dependent on the total genomic mutation rate, U, to the mth power. Thus, higher-order gene interactions are potentially important if U is large and the interaction density among loci is not too low. The solution suggests that synergistic epistasis will decrease the mutation load and that variation in epistatic effects will elevate the load. Both of these results, however, are strictly true only if they refer to epistatic interaction strengths measured in the optimal genotype. If gene interactions are measured at <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> only synergistic interactions among even numbers of genes will reduce the load. Odd-ordered synergistic interactions will then elevate the load. There is no systematic relationship between variation in epistasis and load at equilibrium. We argue that empirical estimates of gene interaction must pay attention to the genetic background in which the effects are measured and that it may be advantageous to refer to average interaction intensities as measured in <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> We derive a simple criterion for the strength of epistasis that is necessary to overcome the twofold disadvantage of sex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{secondary}} structure of folded RNA sequences {{is a good}} model to map phenotype onto genotype, as represented by the RNA sequence. Computational studies {{of the evolution of}} ensembles of RNA molecules towards target {{secondary structure}}s yield valuable clues to the mechanisms behind adaptation of complex populations. The relationship between the space of sequences and structures, the organization of RNA ensembles at <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> the time of adaptation {{as a function of the}} population parameters, the presence of collective effects in quasispecies, or the optimal mutation rates to promote adaptation all are issues that can be explored within this framework. Results We investigate the effect of microscopic mutations on the phenotype of RNA molecules during their in silico evolution and adaptation. We calculate the distribution of the effects of mutations on fitness, the relative fractions of beneficial and deleterious mutations and the corresponding selection coefficients for populations evolving under different mutation rates. Three different situations are explored: the <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (optimized population) in three different fitness landscapes, the dynamics during adaptation towards a goal structure (adapting population), and the behavior under periodic population bottlenecks (perturbed population). Conclusions The ratio between the number of beneficial and deleterious mutations experienced by a population of RNA sequences increases with the value of the mutation rate μ at which evolution proceeds. In contrast, the selective value of mutations remains almost constant, independent of μ, indicating that adaptation occurs through an increase in the amount of beneficial mutations, with little variations in the average effect they have on fitness. Statistical analyses of the distribution of fitness effects reveal that small effects, either beneficial or deleterious, are well described by a Pareto distribution. These results are robust under changes in the fitness landscape, remarkably when, in addition to selecting a target secondary structure, specific subsequences or low-energy folds are required. A population perturbed by bottlenecks behaves similarly to an adapting population, struggling to return to the optimized state. Whether it can survive in the long run or whether it goes extinct depends critically on the length of the time interval between bottlenecks. </p...|$|E
40|$|Is {{senescence}} {{the adaptive}} result of tradeoffs between {{younger and older}} ages or the nonadaptive burden of deleterious mutations that act at older ages? To shed new light on this unresolved question we combine adaptive and nonadaptive processes in a single model. Our model uses Penna’s bit-strings to capture different age-specific mutational patterns. Each pattern represents a genotype and for each genotype we find the life history strategy that maximizes fitness. Genotypes {{compete with each other}} and are subject to selection and to new mutations over generations until equilibrium in genefrequencies is reached. The <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> provides information about mutational load and the differential effects of mutations on a life history trait- the optimal age at maturity. We find that mutations accumulate only at ages with negligible impact on fitness and that mutation accumulation has very little effect on the optimal age at maturity. These results suggest that life histories are largely determined by adaptive processes. The non-adaptive process of mutation accumulation seems to be unimportant at evolutionarily relevant ages...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSelection on {{mitochondrial}} mutations potentially {{occurs at}} different levels: at the mitochondria, cell, and organism levels. Several factors affect {{the strength of}} selection at these different levels; in particular, mitochondrial bottlenecks during germline development and reduced paternal transmission decrease the genetic variance within cells, while they increase the variance between cells and between organisms, thus decreasing the strength of selection within cells and increasing the strength of selection between cells and organisms. However, bottlenecks and paternal transmission also affect the effective mitochondrial population size, thus affecting genetic drift.

40|$|Although {{mutations}} {{drive the}} evolutionary process, the rates {{at which the}} mutations occur are themselves subject to evolutionary forces. Our purpose here is to understand the role of selection and random genetic drift {{in the evolution of}} mutation rates, and we address this question in asexual populations at <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> neglecting selective sweeps. Using a multitype branching process, we calculate the fixation probability of a rare nonmutator in a large asexual population of mutators, and find that a nonmutator is more likely to fix when the deleterious mutation rate of the mutator population is high. Compensatory mutations in the mutator population are found to decrease the fixation probability of a nonmutator when the selection coefficient is large. But, surprisingly, the fixation probability changes nonmonotonically with increasing compensatory mutation rate when the selection is mild. Using these results for the fixation probability and a drift-barrier argument, we find a novel relationship between the mutation rates and the population size. We also discuss the time to fix the nonmutator in an adapted population of asexual mutators, and compare our results with experiments. Comment: Accepted in Ecology and Evolutio...|$|E

Such observations are readily acquired in cyclical parthenogens. Selfing and life-table experiments were performed for two such Daphnia populations. We observed a significant inbreeding depression and an increase of genetic variance for all traits analyzed. DENG and LYNCH's original procedures were extended to estimate genomic mutation rate (U), mean dominance coefficient (h), mean selection coefficient (s), and scaled genomic mutational variance (V(m) /V(e)).

A permutation test, which assesses the significance of the molecular marker with the largest effect on bristle variation in four genetic backgrounds relative to permuted data-sets, found two sites that were independently associated with variation in bristle number. A common site in the second intron of Delta affected only sternopleural bristle number, and another common site in the fifth intron affected only abdominal bristle number in females.

Here, we study the dynamics of the synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide composition of influenza A virus genes. In several genes, the nucleotide frequencies at synonymous positions drift away from the equilibria predicted from the synonymous substitution matrices. We investigate possible reasons for this unexpected behavior by fitting several regression models. Relaxation toward a <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> following a host jump fails to explain the dynamics of the synonymous nucleotide composition, even if we allow for slow temporal changes in the substitution matrix. Instead, we find that deep internal branches of the phylogeny show distinct patterns of nucleotide substitution and that these branches strongly influence the dynamics of nucleotide composition, suggesting that the observed trends are at least in part a result of natural selection acting on synonymous sites. Moreover, we find that the dynamics of the nucleotide composition at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites are highly correlated, providing evidence that even nonsynonymous sites can be influenced by selection pressure for nucleotide composition.

40|$|Population {{bottlenecks}} are stochastic {{events that}} strongly condition {{the structure and}} evolution of natural populations. Their effects are readily observable in highly heterogeneous populations, such as RNA viruses, since bottlenecks cause a fast accumulation of mutations. Considering that most mutations are deleterious, {{it was predicted that}} the frequent application of bottlenecks would yield a population unable to replicate. However, in vitro as well as in vivo systems evolving through bottlenecks present a remarkable resistance to extinction. This observation reveals the robustness of RNA viruses and points to the existence of internal mechanisms which must confer a high degree of adaptability to fast mutating populations. In this contribution, we review experimental observations regarding the survival of RNA viruses, both in laboratory experiments and in natural populations. By means of a simple theoretical model of evolution which incorporates strong reductions of the population size, we explore the relationship between the number of replication rounds that a single founder particle undergoes before the next bottleneck is applied, and the mutation rate in a particular environment. Our numerical results reveal that the mutation rate has evolved in a concerted way with the degree of optimization achieved by the population originated from the founder particle.

40|$|For {{evolving}} {{populations of}} replicators, {{there is much}} evidence {{that the effect of}} mutations on fitness depends on the degree of adaptation to the selective pressures at play. In optimized populations, most mutations have deleterious effects, such that low mutation rates are favoured. In contrast to this, in populations thriving in changing environments a larger fraction of mutations have beneficial effects, providing the diversity necessary to adapt to new conditions. What is more, non-adapted populations occasionally benefit from an increase in the mutation rate. Therefore, there is no optimal universal value of the mutation rate and species attempt to adjust it to their momentary adaptive needs. In this work we have used stationary populations of RNA molecules evolving in silico to investigate the relationship between the degree of adaptation of an optimized population and the value of the mutation rate promoting maximal adaptation in a short time to a new selective pressure. Our results show that this value can significantly differ from the optimal value at <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> being strongly influenced by the structure of the population when the adaptive process begins. In the shortterm, highly optimized populations containing little variability respond better to environmental changes upon an increase of the mutation rate, whereas populations with a lower degree of optimization but higher variability benefit from reducing the mutation rate to adapt rapidly.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} quasispecies usually focus on two {{properties}} of those populations at the <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> namely asymptotic growth rate and population diversity. It has been postulated that, {{as a consequence}} of the high error rate of quasispecies replication, an increase of neutrality facilitates population optimization by reducing the amount of mutations with a deleterious effect on fitness. In this study we analyse how the optimization of equilibrium properties is affected when a quasispecies evolves in an environment perturbed through frequent bottleneck events. By means of a simple model we demonstrate that high neutrality may be detrimental when the population has to overcome repeated reductions in the population size, and that the property to be optimized in this situation is the time required to regenerate the quasispecies, i. e. its adaptability. In the scenario described, neutrality and adaptability cannot be simultaneously optimized. When fitness is equated with long-term survivability, high neutrality is the appropriate strategy in constant environments, while populations evolving in fluctuating environments are fitter when their neutrality is low, such that they can respond faster to perturbations.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Extensive {{focus is}} placed on the {{comparative}} analyses of consensus genotypes in the study of West Nile virus (WNV) emergence. Few studies account for genetic change in the underlying WNV quasispecies population variants. These variants are not discernable in the consensus genome at the time of emergence, and the maintenance of mutationselection equilibria of population variants is greatly underestimated. The emergence of lineage 1 WNV strains has been studied extensively, but recent epidemics caused by lineage 2 WNV strains in Hungary, Austria, Greece and Italy emphasizes the increasing importance of this lineage to public health. In this study we explored the quasispecies dynamics of minority variants that contribute to cell-tropism and host determination, i. e. the ability to infect different cell types or cells from different species from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data of a historic lineage 2 WNV strain. RESULTS : Minority variants contributing to host cell membrane association persist in the viral population without contributing to the genetic change in the consensus genome. Minority variants are shown to maintain a stable <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> under positive selection, particularly in the capsid gene region.

40|$|SummarySpinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is a {{relatively}} common autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder. We have identified de novo rearrangements in 7 (∼ 2 %) index patients from 340 informative SMA families. In each, the rearrangements resulted {{in the absence of}} the telomeric copy of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene (telSMN), in two cases accompanied by the loss of the neuronal apoptosis–inhibitory protein gene. Haplotype analysis revealed unequal recombination in four cases, with loss of markers Ag 1 -CA and C 212, which are near the 5 ′ ends of the SMN genes. In one case, an interchromosomal rearrangement involving both the SMN genes and a regrouping of Ag 1 -CA and C 212 alleles must have occurred, suggesting either interchromosomal gene conversion or double recombination. In two cases, no such rearrangement was observed, but loss of telSMN plus Ag 1 -CA and C 212 alleles in one case suggested intrachromosomal deletion or gene conversion. In six of the seven cases, the de novo rearrangement had occurred during paternal meiosis. Direct detection of de novo SMA mutations by molecular genetic means has allowed us to estimate for the first time the mutation rate for a recessive disorder in humans. The sex-averaged rate of 1. 1 × 10 − 4, arrived at in a proband-based approach, compares well with the rate of 0. 9 × 10 − 4 expected under a <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> for SMA.

40|$|RNA viruses {{replicate}} their genomes with a {{very high}} error rate and constitute highly heterogeneous mutant distributions similar to the molecular quasispecies introduced to explain the evolution of prebiotic replicators. The genetic information included in a quasispecies can only be faithfully transmitted below a critical error rate. When the error threshold is crossed, the population structure disorganizes, and it is substituted by a randomly distributed mutant spectrum. For viral quasispecies, the increase in error rate {{is associated with a}} decrease in specific infectivity that can lead to the extinction of the population. In contrast, a strong resistance to extinction has been observed in populations subjected to bottleneck events despite the increased accumulation of mutations. In the present study, we show that the mutagenic nucleoside analogue 5 -azacytidine (AZC) is a potent mutagen for bacteriophage Qβ. We have evaluated the effect of the increase in the replication error rate in populations of the bacteriophage Qβ evolving either in liquid medium or during development of clonal populations in semisolid agar. Populations evolving in liquid medium in the presence of AZC were extinguished, while during plaque development in the presence of AZC, the virus experienced {{a significant increase in the}} replicative ability. Individual viruses isolated from preextinction populations could withstand high error rates during a number of plaque-to-plaque transfers. The response to mutagenesis is interpreted in the light of features of plaque development versus infections by free-moving virus particles and the distance to a <b>mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The results suggest that clonal bacteriophage populations away from equilibrium derive replicative benefits from increased mutation rates. This is relevant to the application of lethal mutagenesis in vivo, in the case of viruses that encounter changing environments and are transmitted from cell to cell under conditions of limited diffusion that mimic the events taking place during plaque development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Most {{researchers}} now {{agree that}} personality in our species is also infl uenced by genetic processes, and that genetic differences {{contribute to a}} variety of personality profi les and response norms to the various situations life poses. A growing number of molecular, twin and pedigree studies has suggested heritability in personality traits. At present, the variability in personality traits among individuals is well-established (McCrae & Costa, 1987) and has a (30 % to 60 %) heritable component in various population studied (Benjamin et al., 1996; Bergeman et al., 1988; Cloninger et al., 1993; Ebstein et al.; 1996; Plomin et al., 1994; Tellegen et al., 1988). These studies suggest that there are specifi c loci with various alleles infl uencing different (usually opposing) response norms to similar situations (Buss, 1991; Lohelin et al., 1998; Plomin and Nesselroade, 1990; Plomin & Caspi, 1999). In this chapter we will not ignore or dismiss the environmental effect of personality variation, but we will especially focus on the genetic aspect of it, and try to answer the following question: Why are there a multitude of different alleles in different loci that infl uence differently the expression of personality traits? Selection is generally understood to favor the most successful traits and eliminate all others given enough time, thus transmitting the single most successful phenotype to the whole population at the expenses (extinction) of all less successful ones (Fisher, 1930). Yet, personality traits are highly variable in all populations studied. Most researchers agree that personality traits vary not only because they fail to coalesce into a single successful profi le, but also because there is an inherent permanent presence of a variety of alleles infl uencing all personality traits in different ways (Lohelin & Rowe, 1992; Turkheimer, 1998). This state of affairs gives rise to a crucial question: Why have millions of years of evolution not eliminated genetic variation in all personality traits, favoring a unique, most adapted one? Penke and colleagues (2007) examined three possible alternative hypotheses to account for the persistence of a large amount of variation in personality profi les: 1) Neutral selection, 2) <b>Mutation-selection</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and 3) Balanced selection. Accordingly, these authors evaluated the evolutionary dynamics and requirements of all of the hypotheses within a behavioral genetics perspective, and suggested that balanced selection and some of its variants more adequately explained the persistence {{of a large number of}} alleles infl uencing personality traits. At a theoretical level, their arguments are convincing. What is yet missing, however, is an empirical test of competing predictions that arise variously from the three contrasting hypotheses...|$|E
