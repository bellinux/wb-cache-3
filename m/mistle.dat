5|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush is much larger, paler and longer-tailed {{than the}} {{sympatric}} song thrush. In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} <b>mistle</b> thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile <b>mistle</b> thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush is hunted by {{birds of}} prey {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The <b>mistle</b> thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E

5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the <b>mistle</b> thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a <b>mistle</b> thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush {{is quite}} terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea {{has sometimes been}} separated as T. v. tauricus, {{but this is not}} considered to be a valid form. <b>Mistle</b> thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
5|$|External parasites of the <b>mistle</b> thrush {{include the}} hen flea, the moorhen flea, the {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the thrush may be hosting tapeworms, nematodes, and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni da Udine {{painted in}} Raphael's {{workshop}} in the 16th century. His <b>Mistle</b> Thrush and Alpine Chough was a sketch for his Bird with Garland and Fruit, and {{this in turn}} {{was the basis for}} a Raphael fresco in the Apostolic Palace.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the song thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged <b>mistle</b> thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the <b>mistle</b> thrush is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.|$|E
5|$|The most similar European thrush {{species is}} the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird {{has a strong}} white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The <b>mistle</b> thrush (T. viscivorus) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis), {{although}} much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mistle</b> thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush breeds {{in much of}} Europe and {{temperate}} Asia, {{although it}} is absent from the treeless far north, and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, {{it tends to be}} found in the milder uplands and coastal regions. Nominate T. v. viscivorus breeds in Europe and in Asia east to the Ob, beyond which it is replaced by T. v. bonapartei. The southern form T. v. deichleri is resident in North Africa, Corsica and Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus Turdus, characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A {{mitochondrial}} DNA study identified the <b>mistle</b> thrush's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and Chinese thrushes, all three species being early offshoots from the main Turdus radiation, and hence more distantly related to other European thrushes such as the common blackbird.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings can eat {{huge numbers}} of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as <b>mistle</b> thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife abounds in the valley, {{particularly}} the water birds around {{the rivers and}} lakes, with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including ducks, shoveller (Anas clypeata), gadwall (Anas strepera) and great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), {{a wide variety of}} other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as tits (Paridae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) to <b>mistle</b> thrush (Turdidae). Larger birds include woodpeckers (Picidae) and common buzzard (Buteo buteo).|$|E
5|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush has an {{extensive}} distribution in Europe and western Asia, and its European breeding population {{is estimated at}} 9–22.2million birds. When Asian breeders are added, this gives a global total of 12.2–44.4million. The species was formerly more restricted in range, and rarely bred even in northern England in the 1700s. It expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of Europe during the 18th century and {{the first half of}} the 19th century, colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent, such as Ireland (where it first bred in 1807), Scotland and the Netherlands. The range also increased in Denmark, Norway, Hungary and Austria.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The <b>mistle</b> thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush is {{a partial}} migrant: birds {{from the north}} and east of the range {{wintering}} in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds start moving south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the Middle East. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the Strait of Gibraltar and others pass through Cyprus, but there is hardly any migration across the North Sea. Breeding birds in the British Isles and north-west Europe are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups. Vagrant birds have occurred in the Azores, China, Crete, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sikkim and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the <b>mistle</b> thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E
25|$|Other {{raptorial}} birds {{can become}} regular prey, such as all other hawks which are recorded especially in North America at locations such as Oregon (8.8% of prey remains) and Arizona. Owls may be hunted regularly {{across the entire}} range (maximum being 2.9% in Oregon) and, more rarely, so may the falcons. Rock pigeons may be hunted regularly {{in some parts of}} the golden eagle's range (other pigeons and doves have been recorded as prey but are typically rare in the diet). The common feral pigeon was the second most prevalent prey species in Sierra Espuña Regional Park in Spain, making up 18.8% of a sampling of 99 from 5 nests. The species was also prevalent in Slovakia, making up 7.4% of remains at nests there. Non-corvid passerines are usually ignored as prey but large thrushes such as song thrush (Turdus philomelos), <b>mistle</b> thrush (Turdus viscivorus) and common blackbird (Turdus merula), are semi-regularly recorded prey in Europe. This family is most prevalent in Sicily, making up 8.1% of a sampling of 74 from 10 nests there, 7.7% in Central Spain and 7.2% in the French Alps. The smallest-bodied bird family recorded as semi-regular prey are pipits. Meadow pipits (Anthus pratensis) are the most represented species of small birds and are taken mainly in Scotland, making up to 3.5% of prey in the Inner Hebrides. Other bird families rarely recorded as golden eagle prey (making up less than 1% of prey in all studied nests) include starlings (maximum being 4.8% in the French Alps, negligible elsewhere), larks (maximum is 2.3% in the West-Central Highlands of Scotland), emberizid sparrows (up to 1.7% in central Alaska), woodpeckers (up to 1.5% in Alberta), cuckoos, bustards, icterids, shrikes, skuas, and finches.|$|E
500|$|<b>Mistle</b> thrushes feed {{mainly on}} invertebrates, fruit and berries. Animal prey include earthworms, insects and other arthropods, slugs and snails. Snails are {{sometimes}} smashed {{on a stone}} [...] "anvil", a technique also used by the song thrush. The <b>mistle</b> thrush {{has been known to}} kill slowworms and the young of the song thrush, blackbird and dunnock.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name. The bird's liking for mistletoe berries {{is indicated by}} both its English and scientific names. Turdus is the Latin for [...] "thrush", and viscivorus, [...] "mistletoe eater", comes from viscum [...] "mistletoe" [...] and vorare, [...] "to devour".|$|E
500|$|The male <b>mistle</b> thrush has a loud melodious {{song with}} fluted whistles, {{sounding}} like chewee-trewuu... trureetruuruu or similar, repeated {{three to six}} times, and used to advertise his territory, attract a mate and maintain the pair bond. The tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird, but compared to its relatives the <b>mistle</b> thrush's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower. The song is, however, much louder, often audible up to 2km (2,000yd) away. The song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from November to early June. The male is most vocal in the early morning, and its tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather led to the old name [...] "stormcock". The song may be heard in any month, although it is uncommon from July to August while the thrush is moulting. The main call, given by both sexes, is a dry chattering krrrr, louder when it is alarmed or excited. It is often likened {{to the sound of}} a football rattle, a form of musical ratchet. There is also a squeaky tuk contact call.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of {{habitats}} containing trees, including forests, plantations, hedges and town parks. In the south and east of its range, it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present. Breeding occurs at up to [...] in the mountains of North Africa, and occasionally much higher, to [...] In the highlands of Europe, its preferred altitude is from [...] More open habitats, such as agricultural land, moors and grassy hills, are extensively used in winter or on migration.|$|E
500|$|<b>Mistle</b> thrushes {{breed in}} the year {{subsequent}} to their hatching; they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory. Their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes; although the nest territory is only about , around [...] is used for feeding. Territories are normally reoccupied in subsequent years. Territories are larger in woods than in farmland. The male will attack intruders into its breeding area, including birds of prey and corvids, and sometimes cats or humans. Courtship feeding of the female by her partner has sometimes been observed.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush (Turdus viscivorus) is a bird {{common to}} much of Europe, Asia and North Africa. It is a year-round {{resident}} in much of its range, but northern and eastern populations migrate south for the winter, often in small flocks. It is a large thrush with pale grey-brown upperparts, a greyish-white chin and throat, and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white underparts. The sexes are similar in plumage, and its three subspecies show only minimal differences. The male has a loud, far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather, earning the bird the old name of [...] "stormcock".|$|E
500|$|The call {{is mostly}} uttered in flight {{and is a}} harsh [...] "tsak tsak tsuk". The same sound, but softer, is made more conversationally when {{individuals}} gather in trees. When angry or alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of the <b>mistle</b> thrush (Turdus viscivorous). The male has a rather feeble song that he sings in the breeding season. It {{is a mixture of}} a few phrases like those of the common blackbird (Turdus merula) interspersed with whistles, guttural squeaks and call notes. This is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts.|$|E
500|$|The early Renaissance poem [...] "The Harmony of Birds" [...] had the thrusshe (<b>mistle</b> thrush) sing [...] "sanctus, sanctus", and {{distinguished}} {{it from the}} song thrush, the mauys or throstle. The song is also described in Thomas Hardy's [...] "Darkling Thrush" [...] and Edward Thomas's [...] "The Thrush". The loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names, including [...] "screech", [...] "shrite" [...] and [...] "gawthrush". Other names, including [...] "stormcock" [...] referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain. [...] "Holm thrush", [...] "hollin cock" [...] and [...] "holm cock" [...] are based on obsolete names for the holly tree, which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{typically}} commences in mid-March in {{the south}} and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland. The nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk, although hedges, ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used. The nest site may be up to [...] above the ground, although [...] is more typical. The common chaffinch often nests close to a <b>mistle</b> thrush, the vigilance of the finch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help. Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mistle</b> thrush is {{the largest}} thrush native to Europe. The {{nominate}} subspecies measures [...] in length, with a [...] wingspan. It weighs , {{with an average of}} around [...] It has a stocky upright posture when on the ground. It has pale grey-brown upperparts, the chin and throat are greyish-white, and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots. The spotting becomes denser on the lower chest, giving the appearance of a breast-band. The long tail has white tips on the outer feathers, and the underwing coverts are white. The eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower mandible. The legs and feet are yellowish-brown. There are no plumage differences between the sexes. Juveniles are similar to adults, but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts. By their first winter they are very similar to adults, but the underparts are usually more buff-toned.|$|E
