50|$|In 1902, Taylor batted so well on a {{succession}} of difficult pitches that he scored 1,567 runs, including a century for the Gentlemen at Scarborough, and superb innings against Derbyshire and Leicestershire on <b>soft</b> <b>pitches.</b> He was Yorkshire's leading batsman that season, and {{it came as a}} shock when, after brief tours of Australia and New Zealand that winter, Taylor stayed in Japan during 1903. Yorkshire's batting in that summer really showed what Taylor meant to them on <b>soft</b> or treacherous <b>pitches,</b> and, when he returned to England in 1904, he devoted so much time to his engineering business that he could never spare any time for three-day cricket apart from July and August 1906. His lack of practice clearly showed in thirteen matches played in those months: his average was a modest 21.00 and he only twice reached fifty. Yet, there is little doubt Taylor would still have been of value to Yorkshire could he have spared some time for cricket, especially in wet summers.|$|R
40|$|Key words: Coal tar refined soft pitch; Average {{molecular}} structure; {{polarizing microscope}} with heating stage; thermogravimetric analysis Abstract: The thermal behavior of coal tar refined <b>soft</b> <b>pitch</b> (CTRSP) was investigated by using polarizing microscope with heating stage and thermogravimetric analyzer. The phenomena of carbonization regime process of CTRSP were observed {{directly in the}} micro-picture taken online. The {{results showed that the}} carbonization thermal dynamic process of CTRSP is divided into several typical stages. At 30 - 250 ℃, there is small molecular evaporation; at 250 - 390 ℃, there is thermal decomposition and small molecular evaporation; at 390 - 480 ℃, there is the condensation of small molecules and radicals into macromolecules and directional arrangement generating small spheres; at 480 - 520 ℃, there is the coking stage; at 520 - 560 ℃, there is the semicoke’s dehydrogenation and shrinkage. The spherules are formed at about 390 ℃. The growth process of the spherules is divided into several stages: absorption optical isotropic matrix asphalt to grow, two spherule collision fusion and growth, finally (at 480 - 520 ℃) due to gravity is greater than surface tension small spheroid disintegration deformation and became fibrillar semicoke (at 520 - 560 ℃).

He took 21 wickets in four games and showed, despite his very slight build, the ability to get through a lot of bowling and spin the ball prodigiously from leg. In one innings against Middlesex, he bowled 70 five-ball overs (equivalent to 58 six-ball overs). [...] In that season, his county's wicket-keeper, William Brain, {{completed}} the only instance in first-class cricket of a hat-trick of stumpings, taken off Townsend's bowling. The following year, Townsend’s record was modest though Grace gave him a good deal of bowling on <b>soft</b> <b>pitches,</b> and he was seen as not physically strong enough for county cricket by most critics of the day.|$|R

50|$|DLC1 is downregulated in {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma cell lines, which, through the inactivation of Rho-GTPases, results in anchorage-independent growth in a semi-solid <b>medium</b> (<b>soft</b> agar), indicating that these cells are not {{held fast to}} their neighbors and can detach {{and are able to}} metastasize relatively easily. Expression of DLC1 in {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} cells resulted in dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the molecule focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which results in the disassociation of focal adhesion complexes which are required for cell adhesion; therefore, dephosphorylation of FAK ultimately leads to an increase in focal adhesion turnover and cellular adhesion, and inhibition of cell migration.|$|R
25|$|Jealousy {{and hatred}} between Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney, the other ace pitcher on the team, broke out into {{violence}} in the clubhouse. Radbourn was faulted as the initiator of the fight, and was suspended without pay after a poor outing on July 16, having been accused of deliberately losing the game by lobbing <b>soft</b> <b>pitches</b> over the plate. But on July 22, Sweeney had been drinking {{before the start of}} the game and continued drinking in the dugout between innings. Despite being obviously intoxicated, Sweeney managed to make it to the seventh inning with a 6–2 lead: when Bancroft attempted to relieve him with the change pitcher, Sweeney verbally abused him before being ejected and storming out of the park, leaving Providence with only eight players. With only two men to cover the outfield, they lost the game.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{over the}} 1903/1904 winter Walter Mead's career with Essex {{terminated}} temporarily {{as a result}} of a dispute over winter pay. They missed him badly in 1904 and 1905, and by 1906 he had agreed to return to the eleven. Considering the remarkable dryness of the 1906 summer in the Home Counties, he bowled very well, and in 1907 he was almost as difficult as ever on the <b>soft</b> <b>pitches.</b> In 1908, however, Walter Mead declined so badly, taking only 48 County Championship wickets, that it was clear his best days were over. Despite a minor revival in 1910 and 1911, when Mead failed to make the most of continuous soft wickets in 1912 it was clear his career was over, so that he dropped out of the eleven before 1913 ended despite Essex having no spin bowler to replace him.|$|R
50|$|Although Worcestershire were {{entering}} {{a period where}} they were the weakest of the County teams, Root's tireless, accurate and lively bowling only improved. In 1925 he took a record 207 wickets for the county, almost half of Worcestershire's wickets in first class matches. During the late 1920s, Root was effectively the team's only penetrative bowler.In 1926 Root took 7 for 42 against the Australians on a pitch so dead as to be quite unsuited to him. Though he was less effective than previously in county cricket (<b>soft</b> <b>pitches</b> {{may have played a}} part), Root played three Test matches for England against Australia that year. Unusually he was unable to bat in any of the three tests, due to rain interruptions and the depth of the England batting. Root still holds the record for the most Test Matches in a career without ever batting.|$|R
