The Doctor celebrates his victory, but finds Kovarian had been scanning <b>Melody</b> and found traces of Time Lord DNA; the Doctor speculates that <b>Melody</b> had been conceived while Amy and Rory were in transit on the TARDIS. The Doctor provides an old Gallifreyan cot for <b>Melody,</b> claiming it was his own.|$|E
5|$|Bach used {{a rather}} unusual <b>melody</b> by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on the <b>melody</b> by Jacob Regnart. The hymn {{is treated as}} in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between the verses.|$|E
5|$|But Melody's {{love of the}} sea proves {{too strong}} and she visits Morgana, who turns her into a mermaid temporarily. King Triton uses his trident to {{transform}} Ariel back into her own mermaid form to find and rescue <b>Melody.</b> Morgana tricks <b>Melody</b> into {{taking part in a}} plot to steal her grandfather King Triton's trident. Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade <b>Melody</b> to give back the trident. Morgana captures Ariel, tightly wrapping her tentacle around Ariel's mouth and body. She then seals <b>Melody</b> behind a block wall. Tip and Dash rescue <b>Melody</b> and Ariel manages to free themselves. Morgana then uses the trident's magic to force everyone to bow before her.|$|E

5|$|The <b>melody</b> of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the <b>melody</b> {{is similar to the}} patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's <b>melody</b> in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the <b>melody.</b>|$|E
5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to be sung. Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply <b>melody</b> and verse. However, due to the oral tradition of the time, the original <b>melody</b> of the song was not notated and {{over the course of}} time was forgotten.|$|E
5|$|At (1:18), the song's main <b>melody</b> is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main <b>melody,</b> which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Marianne Clausen’s work, the {{tonality}} of the Faroese kvæði <b>melodies</b> {{were treated}} in two important studies, by Hjalmar Thuren in 1908 and by Hakon Grüner-Nielsen in 1945. Thuren classified the kvæði <b>melodies</b> as {{based on the}} pentatonic scale, while Grüner-Nielsen focused on Church modes as the origin. Marianne Clausen concluded that they were both right (or wrong): kvæði <b>melodies,</b> as well as <b>melodies</b> to Danish ballads, have a distinctly pentatonic nature, dominated by thirds, but are also strongly influenced by Church modes, in particular Dorian and Mixolydian, but also Phrygian. Concerning dance <b>melodies,</b> she noted some significant differences between <b>melodies</b> for Danish ballads and kvæði melodies: the <b>melodies</b> for Danish ballads are often more melodic than those for kvæði, they use three four time more frequently, and are often sung at ‘half speed’, as regards the number of text syllables compared {{to the number of}} steps in the dance, when compared to kvæði <b>melodies.</b>|$|R
5|$|The poem {{described}} the heroic past of Lithuania and exhorted its people {{to care for}} the land, care for humanity, and live in honor.

Both the <b>melody</b> and the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September 1898. Upon his death in 1899, Kudirka's tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).|$|E

50|$|As {{with most}} Minnesänger of his era, few of Walther's <b>melodies</b> have survived.

The latter are the only potential <b>melodies</b> to Walther's love songs, the remainder being for religious and political songs.|$|R
