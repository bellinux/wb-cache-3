60|$|Caleb was not {{so eager}} after rabbits as Shepherd Gathergood, but he disliked the fox for another reason. He {{considered}} that the hunted fox was a great danger to sheep when the ewes were heavy with lambs and when the chase brought the animal near if not right into the flock. He had one dreadful memory of a hunted fox trying to lose itself in his flock of heavy-sided ewes and the hounds following it and driving the poor <b>sheep</b> <b>mad</b> with terror. The result was {{that a large number}} of lambs were cast before their time and many others were poor, sickly things; many of the sheep also suffered in health. He had no extra money from the lambs that year. He received but a shilling (half a crown is often paid now) for every lamb above the number of ewes, and as a rule received from three to six pounds a year from this source.|$|R
