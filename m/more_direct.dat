5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E
5|$|Harassment and {{censorship}} {{imposed by}} the French colonial authorities led to the commercial failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa. By the autumn of 1927, the group's priorities turned towards <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> political action, {{in a bid to}} appeal to more radical elements in the north. Membership grew to around 200, distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{around the}} year 1955, US8 was moved to a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> routing between Forest Lake and Chisago City; US8 {{replaced}} MN98 along Legislative Route98. The former routing between Wyoming and Chisago City along Constitutional Route46 was then redesignated MN98 until it was decommissioned in the late 1990s.|$|E

5|$|To {{provide a}} <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> routing {{between the two}} highways, a bypass of Elmira was {{constructed}} along what is now Listowel Road. By the end of 1979, Highway86 was rerouted along this bypass, and the northern section of Highway85 was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|A second, {{far smaller}} storm cell passed along a similar {{route to the}} first {{later in the evening}} of 14 April. This cell was never given the {{classification}} of 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it develop into a supercell like its predecessor. Therefore, the route of the second cell was <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> and predictable than the first, following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, US-40 was realigned along Foothill Drive (then US-40A), the Utah Highway Department {{believing the}} Foothill route was <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> in {{connecting}} with North Temple toward the airport. US-40A was now aligned along {{the entirety of}} 2100 South from US-40/future I-215 {{at the mouth of}} Parley's Canyon west to State Street and beyond with US-50A to US-40 west of Magna. Both mainline and Alternate US-40, along with US-50A, were truncated to east of the city by 1979.|$|E

5|$|De Materia Medica was {{circulated}} as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From {{the sixteenth century}} on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It {{formed the basis for}} herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually such herbals included more and <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.|$|E
5|$|Further {{concepts}} {{for advanced}} 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope, a conceptualized 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space telescope that if realized {{could be a}} <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> successor to HST, {{with the ability to}} observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space telescope. This effort is being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.|$|E
5|$|I-75 takes a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route between Indian River and Mackinaw City. M-27 follows old US27 through Topinabee and Cheboygan.

M-27 runs along the western shore of Mullett Lake and forms {{the main street of}} Topinabee. The highway intersects M-33 near the confluence of the Cheboygan and Black rivers. North of the M-33 junction, M-27 runs parallel to the Cheboygan River on the west river bank into downtown Cheboygan.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, General António Augusto dos Santos was {{relieved}} of command, with General Kaúlza de Arriaga taking over officially in March 1970. Kaúlza de Arriaga favoured a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> method of fighting the insurgents, and the established policy of using African counter-insurgency forces was rejected {{in favour of}} the deployment of regular Portuguese forces accompanied by {{a small number of}} African fighters. Indigenous personnel were still recruited for special operations, such as the Special Groups of Parachutists in 1973, though their role less significant under the new commander. His tactics were partially influenced by a meeting with United States General William Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, the MSHD {{wanted to}} provide a single number for a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> routing of a Detroit–Chicago freeway; the state {{proposed}} rerouting I-94 to replace I-92 in the state, but retained the I-77 designation. On June 27, 1958, AASHO adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan, minus the state's proposed changes. Around the same time, a section of M-146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s CDOT began {{considering}} {{plans for a}} replacement bridge. The major issue was whether a new bridge should be built along the same alignment as the existing bridge, or instead curve westward to make a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> connection with the interstate's Exit 116. After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred. It remained {{to decide whether to}} have a signalized intersection or a roundabout at the intersection of Sixth Street and Laurel Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end on a given point, placing it on a given line, drawing a circle with the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a straightedge on a given line, and extending the line with the straightedge.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route375 (NY375), locally {{known as}} West Hurley Road for its entire length, {{is a short}} highway in the Catskill Park located entirely within Ulster County, New York, in the United States. It {{primarily}} allows for <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> access from nearby Kingston to Woodstock. It runs northsouth from NY28 at West Hurley to near the business district of Woodstock, where it terminates at another state highway, NY212. The route was designated in the 1930 renumbering in New York, replacing a piece of legislative Route5 from 1908 and has remained unchanged since.|$|E
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
