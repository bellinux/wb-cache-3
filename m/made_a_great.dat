5|$|Immunology <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E

Nathaniel Tracy, who had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fortune {{as one of the}} {{earliest}} and most successful privateers under Washington, owned the house from 1781 to 1786. He then went bankrupt and sold the house to Thomas Russell, a wealthy Boston merchant, who in turn occupied it until 1791.|$|E

This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E

5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of money and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely {{played a significant role in}} the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Another long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), the brother of the Elector Palatine, had expressed his support, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> show of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E
5|$|Groth {{was looking}} {{to stay in the}} major league in 1948. He spent spring {{training}} on the Indians' roster, and originally <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impression on the team. However, he was one of seven Indians stricken with dysentery in early April, causing him to miss some time. By the end of spring training, Groth was optioned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, the Indians' AAA-class minor league affiliate. He spent the season with the Orioles, and his pitching performances included a 13–0 victory over the Newark Bears, as well as a 1–0 victory where Groth limited the Bears to three hits. Groth finished the season with Baltimore having amassed 29 pitching appearances, 27 of them starts, a 12–12 record and a 4.48 ERA, while also pitching in two games for the Dallas Eagles. After Baltimore's season ended, he was promoted to the Indians' roster, and pitched in one game for the Indians that season.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1271–1272 {{reinforcements}} arrived from Meissen, led by Count Dietrich II. The army invaded Natangia and besieged an unnamed Natangian castle. While the assault claimed 150 lives of the crusaders, most of Natangian resistance was broken and the region was decimated. Herkus Monte, {{with a small group}} of his followers, was forced to withdraw to the forests of southern Prussia. Within a year he was finally captured and hanged. The last Prussian leader, Glappe of Warmians, was also hanged when his siege campaign on Brandenburg (now Ushakovo) was attacked from the rear. The last tribe standing were the Pogesanians, who made a surprise raid into Elbing and ambushed its garrison. In 1274 the Knights <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> expedition to avenge this raid, capturing the rebel headquarters at Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) and ending the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the cognitive phenotype of the segmental trisomy 16 (Ts 65 Dn) mouse, {{a model of}} Down Syndrome (DS, trisomy 21), we assessed spatial working and reference memory using a 12 -arm radial maze (RAM). Ts 65 Dn mice <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> number of reference memory errors across trials compared to control mice. Both genotypes showed improvement across trials, although improvement was slower in Ts 65 Dn mice. Ts 65 Dn mice also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> number of working memory errors on the RAM, and in contrast to control mice, did not improve across trials, always performing at near-chance levels. These results provide evidence for both spatial working and reference memory deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice, characteristics of cognitive dysfunction. © 1998 Elsevie...|$|R
