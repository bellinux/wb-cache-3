5000|$|Critical receptions {{towards the}} music video were positive. Jillian Mapes of Billboard {{believed}} that the video is [...] "appropriately understated" [...] {{considering the fact that}} the song is all about making an apology. The Improper noticed that the video has [...] "the look and feel of a Hallmark movie and is almost as maudlin," [...] while Amos Barshad of the New York felt that the video was [...] "terrible." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a bummer", writing [...] "It isn't just about a girl with her calendar permanently stuck on the twelfth month of the year. It's not just about feeling like a Lady Antebellum song. It's about getting stuck in a place of romantic regret." [...] In a different perspective, Kyle Anderson of MTV argued that the music video puts Swift in a [...] "pantheon of modern classics" [...] with regards to its [...] "almost haunting visual sense" [...] which makes up for the inadequate narrative. Leah Collins of Dose.ca called the music video as [...] "dreamy and moody". Her points are echoed by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who deemed the video as [...] "kind of lovely", which corresponds with the melancholic yet regretful mood of the song. Joycelyn Vena of MTV noticed that the video is [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "somber", something that is not synonymous with Swift. Yet, The Oxonian Review considers Swift's [...] "listlessness, the bare trees, and snowy indoors" [...] in the music video attuned to the tenor of the song, achieved by [...] "mixing wide shots, <b>medium</b> <b>close</b> <b>ups,</b> and cut-ins of Ms Swift and her ex, matching their gazes across frames, and blurring focus tastefully." ...|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{systems are}} needed for {{audiovisual}} databases to efficiently index, browse, summarize and retrieve, because the amount of stored data is increasing tremendously. Historically film production techniques, have developed, in part, to convey e. g. meaning or atmosphere to the viewer. By studying these techniques, established guidelines for conveying meaning may be incorporated into automated tools for video analysis. In the current paper we present an approach in this area to classify different shot types, such as long shots, <b>medium</b> shots and <b>close</b> <b>ups,</b> which are important elements of video production. Based {{on a set of}} features calculated from the audiovisual content (e. g. presence of camera motion and size of detected faces), a Bayesian classifier distinguishes between six different shot types. The performance of this novel generic field of view classifier in terms of precision and recall is promising. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Dews sourced {{most of his}} cast from The Old Vic, using many of {{the same}} actors who had {{appeared}} in Seale's production, although in different roles (Paul Daneman for example, played Henry VI for Seale, but played Richard III in Age of Kings). Dews also used actors with whom he had worked whilst directing undergraduate plays at Oxford University. He gave the job of directing to his assistant, Michael Hayes. The initial plan was for the series to be the inaugural production in the BBC's newly built BBC Television Centre in London, but when the studios opened, the series wasn't ready, and was instead broadcast from the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. Peter Dews described the set as [...] "a large permanent structure; platforms, steps, corridors, pillars, and gardens, which will house nearly all the plays' action and which will, despite its outward realism, be not very far from Shakespeare's [...] "unworthy scaffold"." [...] The entire production was shot with four cameras running at any given time. For battle scenes, a cyclorama was used as a backdrop, obscured with smoke. Almost the entire series was shot in <b>medium</b> and <b>close</b> <b>ups.</b> All ten episodes were broadcast live, and a 16mm [...] "telerecording" [...] was made by literally filming a television screen.|$|R
50|$|Then, {{there is}} the medium long shot which makes the subject and the setting have equal {{importance}} and has the two about 50/50 in the frame. Then is the medium shot which emphasizes the character and is about a knees to waist up type shot. Then the <b>medium</b> <b>close</b> <b>up</b> is a shot that has the waist to the chest and up. The next closest shot is the close up which has the shoulders and up or maybe a little tighter on the head.|$|E

The cyclic evolution of light symbolises the natural flux between extremes of all political thought. It {{is interesting to}} note ones own inferences with regards the changes of light & colour - it is perhaps the ultimate flag of pragmatism...|$|E

Denias movie is the movie with the best cinematography on 2006, the nomination of Best Children Future Movie in Unesco Asia Pasific Screen Award, at Brisbane, Australia, and then become one of the Oscar nomination 2008. So, researcher take problem abbreviation “How applying of sinematic technique at “Denias, Senandung Di Atas Awan” movie seen from Mise en Scene and cinematography element that used? This research is description research with quality data. This research do not look for or explain, do not test hypothesis or make prediction. The research method is interpretative with data type qualitative. Its gathering technique is obtained by perceiving Denias Senandung di Atas Awan movie, and then the analysis of data use qualitative data analysis technique. From sinematic elements: Mise en Scene and Cinematography what used at Denias Senandung di Atas Awan movie are: 1. Setting what used is natural setting with place which have there’s and assumed same with the true story which named shot location, 2. Wardrobe used is ordinary custom and true custom clothes of Papua and formal clothes wore by teacher in the school. For make up used accent make up and only give pressure at perpetrator coming near with played role. 3. Used lighting low key lighting and color as function, 4. Figure and Movement at Denias movie is artless character, reflective on movement like true life, 5. Continuity which is often used by is time continuity, 6. Close up which is used is <b>medium</b> <b>close</b> <b>up</b> and close up, 7. At usage of angle in this film using high angle and eye angle, 8. The composition in it using many in perspective composition of composition and aerial of perspective linear, 9. This film use continuity editing and of editing compilation, where merger from each, every its his pursuant to plot which is merger compilation continuity editing of story which suffle through with different time become a series of picture. At this research conclude that forming of figure character and forming of setting and make up refer at life reality which in fact based on background and is geographical of area and also culture going into effect. And so do at illumination of this film is created by nature possible daytime goodness and or nighttime and adapted for color of illumination which in fact. At figure and its movement woke up seen from age facet, habit, hobby and or knowledge having an in with psychology in figure is till created by body movement which is natural according to character which is played the part of. In its cinematography arrange at film of Denias, woke up image either from the figure and or visualizing at is geographical of area of Papua can be shown on the basis of laws arrange camera covering camera angle and its which is explorated either from place character, building performance and also from the figure according to his social strata and status. Become at a film, technique laws at element of sinematik very require to be used, as supporter in image and forming of mood and or aerospace of message of film to be narrated. Film telling a story nicely without supported by element of sinematik good can have an in with psychological and visual freshment of audience catch message in film...|$|E
