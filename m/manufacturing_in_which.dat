50|$|Computer-integrated {{manufacturing}} (CIM) {{in engineering}} {{is a method}} of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the entire production process is controlled by computer. Traditionally separated process methods are joined through a computer by CIM. This integration allows the processes to exchange information and to initiate actions. Through this integration, manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone, although the main advantage {{is the ability to}} create automated manufacturing processes. Typically CIM relies on closed-loop control processes based on real-time input from sensors. It is also known as flexible design and manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|The {{group of}} similar parts {{is known as}} part family and the group of {{machineries}} used to process an individual part family is known as machine cell. It is not necessary for each part of a part family to be processed by every machine of corresponding machine cell. This type of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a part family is produced by a machine cell is known as cellular manufacturing. The manufacturing efficiencies are generally increased by employing GT because the required operations may be confined to only a small cell and thus avoiding the need for transportation of in-process parts.|$|E

5000|$|This {{concept is}} closely related to lean <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the goal is to reduce waste as much as possible. In lean manufacturing, the company aims to cut all costs which are not {{directly}} related to the production of a product for the consumer. Agile manufacturing can include this concept, but it also adds an additional dimension, the idea that customer demands need to be met rapidly and effectively. In situations where companies integrate both approaches, they are sometimes said to be using [...] "agile and lean manufacturing".Companies which utilize an agile manufacturing approach tend to have very strong networks with suppliers and related companies, along with numerous cooperative teams which work within the company to deliver products effectively. They can retool facilities quickly, negotiate new agreements with suppliers and other partners in response to changing market forces, and take other steps to meet customer demands. This means that the company can increase production on products with a high consumer demand, as well as redesign products to respond to issues which have emerged on the open market.|$|E

The end of World War II {{had brought a}} steep drop in the need for military vehicles, so Marmon-Herrington looked for another area of vehicle <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it might find new business. Its first [...] "trolley coaches", the more common term for trolley buses at that time, introduced innovative features such as lightweight monocoque bodies and strong, double-girder sidewalls, which made the Marmon-Herrington trolley coach the best-selling trolley coach of the postwar era. [...] Its trolley buses were successful in the fleets of many North American cities, most notably Chicago and San Francisco, which purchased large numbers; Chicago bought 349 in a single order (delivered in 1951-52), a record for the MH company. [...] Marmon-Herrington supplied trolley buses to 16 different cities in the United States, among the buyers being the Cincinnati Street Railway Company, which purchased 214, and the Cleveland Railway, with 125; vehicles were also sold to two cities in Brazil. The principal models were the TC44, TC48, and TC49, with the number denoting the number of seats. A single order of the 40-seat TC40 model was produced for San Francisco, and likewise the TC46 was produced for only one customer, Philadelphia, before MH replaced it with the TC48 model.|$|E
40|$|New {{business}} models harnessing {{the power of}} individuals have already revolutionized service industries and digital content production. In this study, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon {{is taking place in}} manufacturing industries. We start by conceptually defining two distinct forms of firm-individual collaboration in manufacturing industries: (1) social cloud <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> firms outsource manufacturing to individuals, and (2) social platform <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> firms provide manufacturing services to individuals. We then empirically investigate the nature of firm-individual collaboration within these forms, focusing on the role of individuals. We find that the individuals are often makers who view their participation primarily as a hobby and are driven mainly by nonmonetary benefits, that the design process often involves both parties, and that the two forms of collaboration exploit different enabling technologies. Our findings suggest that firms working with individuals can potentiallyreap multiple benefits, including fresh ideas, broader design support, and quick delivery times. This article contributes to an improved understanding of how firms can build potentially disruptive {{business models}} in manufacturing industries by leveraging individuals, thereby adding to the emerging stream of literature on social manufacturing.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{applications}} in robotics and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> nominally rigid objects {{are subject to}} multiple frictional contacts with other objects. In most previous work, rigid body models {{have been used to}} analyze such systems. There are two fundamental problems with such an approach. Firstly, the use of frictional laws, such as Coulomb 2 ̆ 7 s law, introduce inconsistencies and ambiguities when used in conjunction with the principles of rigid body dynamics. Secondly, hypotheses traditionally used to model frictional impacts can lead to solutions which violate principles of energy conservation. In this paper these problems are explained with the help of examples. A new approach to the simulation of mechanical systems with multiple, frictional constraints is proposed which is free of inconsistencies...|$|E
