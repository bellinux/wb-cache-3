5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|Although {{only a small}} affray, it {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> targeted by York, the latter too <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{hypothesized}} that the first hand <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and {{is believed to have}} been his teacher. Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that the handwriting does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{responsible for the}} bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the day of}} the accident, {{there was}} {{uncertainty}} about who boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest—all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, were never recovered. Since several bodies were never found and the bodies of several members of Sikorski's entourage were never positively identified, some conspiracy theorists such as journalist and amateur historian Dariusz Baliszewski postulate that some <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> murdered on the ground while others <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> abducted to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two basic}} forms of data packet, DATA0 and DATA1. A data packet must always be preceded by an address token, and is usually {{followed}} by a handshake token from the receiver back to the transmitter. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by stop-and-wait ARQ. If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not know if the data was received or not; the data <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lost in transit or it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> received but the handshake response was lost.|$|E
5|$|A 1997 {{study found}} lower protein {{polymorphism}} in Antilope {{in comparison with}} Antidorcas, Eudorcas and Gazella. This was attributed to a history of rapid evolution of an autapomorphic phenotype of Antilope.

5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren.

5|$|Alternatively, Dawn Landua-McCormack {{suggested}} that the Southern South Saqqara pyramid {{could have been a}} candidate for Neferhotep's burial site. This pyramid, datable to the middle 13th Dynasty, was provided with two elaborate sarcophagus chambers which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> destined for two wealthy brother kings of the dynasty such as Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{related to the}} fact that the {{periphery}} of the empire was now becoming central to its existence, and the granting of citizenship may have been simply a logical outcome of Rome's continued expansion of citizenship rights.|$|E
