5|$|Corps {{replaced}} divisions as {{the largest}} army units, mobile artillery was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French <b>military</b> <b>doctrine.</b> These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare. Though he consolidated the practice of modern conscription introduced by the Directory, one of the restored monarchy's first acts was to end it.|$|E
5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the <b>military</b> <b>doctrine</b> of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E

5000|$|Almost every {{military}} {{organization has}} its own doctrine, sometimes written, sometimes unwritten. Some <b>military</b> <b>doctrines</b> are transmitted through training programs. More recently, in modern peacekeeping operations, which involve both civilian and military operations, more comprehensive (not just <b>military)</b> <b>doctrines</b> are now emerging such as the 2008 United Nations peacekeeping operations' [...] "Capstone Doctrine" [...] which speaks to integrated civilian and military operations.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss <b>military</b> <b>doctrine</b> changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Bruce married Roberta Linnell Kennedy. The couple {{made their}} home in Bryan, Texas, near Texas A, and Bruce taught {{military}} science and tactics at Allen Academy. They had three children. For {{the next two decades}} Bruce continued to serve in the army. He served with the 33rd Infantry Regiment in Panama, participated in historical work at the U.S. Army War College and served on the general staff of the War Department revising textbooks on <b>military</b> <b>doctrine.</b> He also furthered his own knowledge of military tactics, attending the U.S. Army Infantry School, the U.S. Army Field Artillery School, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, the U.S. Army War College, and the Naval War College.|$|E
5|$|Most {{students}} {{participate in}} the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP). In 2009, the school held eight AMSP seminars. AMSP is intended to educate students in military arts and science, and focuses on operational art and covers a variety of subjects, including military problem solving; military theory and history, <b>military</b> <b>doctrine,</b> operational planning; battle dynamics, operational theory and practice, contemporary military operations, {{and the application of}} national elements of power. Besides classroom studies and operational exercises, students must complete a research monograph and an oral examination. After graduating, officers serve on a division, corps, or Army Service Component Command staff, or in a functional area assignment.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare {{was made clear}} to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for {{the appointment of a}} {{commander in chief of the}} three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different <b>military</b> <b>doctrine.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the {{requirement}} for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, <b>military</b> <b>doctrine</b> assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible class aircraft carriers and their successors, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS Bulwark and Albion. Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War, the {{probability}} of a ground invasion of Switzerland ended, substantially changing Swiss <b>military</b> <b>doctrine</b> and resulting in reduction of both the budget {{and the size of the}} Swiss Armed Forces. In Armed Forces Reform 95, and its supporting program Defense Guidelines 95, the Air Force retained its basic structure and organization, but became a totally independent service, now called the Swiss Air Force, on 1January 1996. For the first time since its inception, subordination of the counter-air role to the ground support mission ended, and defense of domestic airspace was made its highest priority and primary task.|$|E

50|$|Soviet- and Russian-derived <b>military</b> <b>doctrines</b> include squad-level snipers. Snipers have {{increasingly}} been demonstrated as useful by US and UK {{forces in the}} recent Iraq campaign in a fire support role to cover the movement of infantry, especially in urban areas.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, {{the absence of a}} central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of a}} different <b>military</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E
5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US <b>military</b> <b>doctrine</b> from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Staff College, Camberley, Dannatt {{took the}} Higher Command and Staff Course (HCSC), {{after which he}} was {{promoted}} to colonel on 31 December 1991, backdated to 30 June 1991, and tasked with the running of the HCSC, as well as updating the British <b>Military</b> <b>Doctrine</b> {{in the light of the}} end of the Cold War. He also drafted the campaign plan for Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Mike Rose's command of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the Balkans. Dannatt was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1993, backdated to 30 June 1993, and took command of 4th Armoured Brigade, based in Germany. He spent 1994 commanding the brigade and overseeing training and, in 1995, was posted to Bosnia along with his headquarters staff, leaving the rest of the brigade in Germany and taking command of separate units already deployed in Bosnia. He commanded UNPROFOR's Sector South West, composed of troops from multiple nations, while also serving as Commander of British Forces (COMBRITFOR), responsible for overseeing operations of all British troops in Bosnia. After the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led Implementation Force and Dannatt's brigade was incorporated into a multi-national division commanded by Mike Jackson. Dannatt was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his service in the Balkans. Handing over 4th Armoured Brigade to David Richards, Dannatt was appointed Director, Defence Programme Staff at the MoD in 1996 and was responsible for part of the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review, produced by the Labour government that had come to power in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Military orthodoxy {{believes}} that with some exceptions, most battles between established armies {{have historically been}} fought based on an attrition warfare strategy.

25|$|The Soviet {{meaning of}} <b>military</b> <b>doctrine</b> was much {{different}} from U.S. military usage of the term. Soviet Minister of Defence Marshal Grechko defined it in 1975 as 'a system of views {{on the nature of}} war and methods of waging it, and on the preparation of the country and army for war, officially adopted in a given state and its armed forces.' Soviet theorists emphasised both the political and 'military-technical' sides of <b>military</b> <b>doctrine,</b> while from the Soviet point of view, Westerners ignored the political side. According to Harriet F Scott and William Scott, the political side of Soviet <b>military</b> <b>doctrine,</b> best explained the international moves that the Soviet Union undertook during the cold war.|$|E
