40|$|An {{innovative}} approach {{to measure the}} effects of heterogeneous catalysis during re-entry has been proposed {{in the framework of}} the instrumentation planned for the ESA-EXPERT mission. So far measurements of species concentrations during re-entry by a spectrometer has been performed only by the Japanese READ experiment (USERS mission), using a spectrometer located inside the capsule and oriented toward the stagnation point. The goal is to measure the recombination coefficient by measuring gas species close to the surface. The main elements of the diagnostic system are: a light capture device and a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> Dimensions and features of the diagnostic system components have been defined. A sapphire pole, 3 mm high from the surface, is used to look directly at the surface during re-entry, measuring what ’happens’ close to the surface of a SiC/C sample. Sapphire is necessary to stand high temperatures (its melting point is almost 2300 K) and to transmit in the UV (where emission of NO is strong). The <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometer</b> has 24 channels and a spectral resolution of 0. 25 nm/pixel. A <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometer</b> is needed to determine the spectra at a location. The pole will be located at about 500 mm {{from the end of the}} EXPERT nose, protruding from a SiC/C sample. A preliminary test to validate the feasibility of the device has been planned: the CFD results obtained by CIRA for the flow close to the SiC/C sample, in condition of max heat flux, will be fed to a spectra rebuilding software (PARADE); the spectra calculated in this way will be compared with the spectra measured by the light capture device and generated by the 1200 KW VKI induction Plasmatron. By knowing the spectral emissions of species such as O, N and their molecules, including NO, it will be possible to determine the presence and concentration of these species. The species produced by surface recombination are excited; therefore the concentration of recombined molecules will be determined by distinguishing the excited gas species with respect to the non excited. The recombination coefficient will be calculated applying the kinetic model of Bruno et al. for heterogeneous catalysis. The surface heat flux has to be known to perform this calculation, and it will eventually be provided by other EXPERT measurements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- One of {{the basic}} issues in {{remotely}} sensed data processing and their interpretation is the spectral mixture analysis. Remote sensing measurements include mainly spectral data for obtaining information about the studied objects and on this basis describe them. In the real-world scenario the land cover {{is a mixture of}} different matters and in this case the correct discrimination of a single class relies on the theory of spectral mixture analysis. The spectral properties of minerals and rocks depend on many factors such as chemical composition and texture. The goal of the paper is to study spectral mixture reflectance and emissivity from iron-containing minerals and to apply the spectral mixture decomposition technique for mineral identification and to find their proportions in context of further verification and validation. The data consists of laboratory measurements in the visible, near infrared and thermal infrared bands with <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometers</b> and airborne data.

Emission spectra of plasmas of a number of low and high Z target matenals were recorded covering the majority of the vacuum UV spectral region (35 to 200 nm). These experiments were designed mainly to study the nature of the emission (line versus continuum) and it’s dependence on atomic number. The use of two detection configurations allowed for mter comparisons to be made on resolution, efficiency and dynamic range of the two multi-channel detector and spectrometer systems. Experiments were also performed on photoabsorption by helium gas. The spectra thus obtamed were used to help charactense the system’s application to absorption studies around the He principal series limit at - 50 43 nm.

The number concentrations of the particles were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer and counter (SMPS+C) which counted particles from 11. 1 to 1083. 3 nm classified in 44 channels. Particle-bound PAHs were measured with a direct reading, photoelectric aerosol sensor.

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a real-time <b>multi-channel</b> Fourier transform <b>spectrometer</b> with an area sensor to track biological sample motion.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} background continuum emission in inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) is proposed. The method {{assumes that the}} ICP background continuum emission is mainly due to recombinative radiation in the plasma. The emission intensity at an arbitrary wavelength {{is related to the}} temperature and electron number density of the plasma. Furthermore, the ratio of background continuum emission intensity at two arbitrary plasma excitation conditions is a constant for all wavelengths. Therefore, if there is a change in plasma excitation conditions, the new background continuum emission intensity at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the initial background emission intensity and the emission intensity ratio that can be measured accurately at another convenient wavelength. In this paper, rather than the emission intensity ratio, the ratio of the differences in intensities is used to remove the contribution of dark current in the measured intensity, if any. The ratio is termed 'f-factor'. Firstly, the background emission intensities at two reference plasma excitation conditions are measured. The f-factors of these two background emission intensities are assigned values 0 and 1, respectively. When the plasma excitation condition changes, the f-factor relative to the reference conditions at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the new emission intensity. The background emission intensity at other wavelengths can then be determined from their corresponding emission intensities at the reference conditions and the new f-factor. Background emission intensity of the ICP (λ= 200 - 460 nm) is measured using an ICP spectrometer with a segmented-array imaging detector. The ICP forward power was varied from 800 to 1500 W. In agreement of the model, the f-factors at any wavelengths remain constant at all forward power used. The proposed method was compared to off-peak background correction method. Analyte concentrations were selected to give signal-to-background ratio of ∼ 1. The corrected analyte emission intensities using both background correction methods agree, except for Ca 396. 847 nm, which suffers from spectral overlap from a nearby hydrogen emission line.

40|$|Growing {{interest}} {{in the fields of}} core excited atomic, molecular and solid species has resulted in a demand for a compact, low cost laboratory source in the XUV (Extreme Ultra Violet) region of the spectrum. In contrast to the optical spectra of the valence electrons, which can mainly be described by the one-electron picture of the central field approximation, inner shell excitations are characterised by strong many electron effects causing the breakdown of the simple one-electron picture. Photoabsorption experiments provide valuable information on these many-electron correlation effects in atoms, excited atoms and ions. The measurement of photoionization cross sections of free ions pose considerable experimental difficulties, as a suitable absorbing column, of adequate density, must be produced and back lit by a bright, synchronised XUV continuum emitting source. Through the work reported in this thesis, a multi-laser, <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometer</b> facility, for the measurement of photoionization cross sections of free atoms, excited atoms and ions, in the XUV has been developed. The facility is based on the DLP (Dual Laser Plasma) technique, whereby the absorbing column is produced by the ablation of spectroscopically pure targets, in vacuo, by either a flashlamp pumped dye laser (= 1 J in 2. 5 p,s) or by a Q-switched ruby laser (~ 1. 5 J in 30 ns). The synchronised XUV continuum source is generated by tightly focusing the output of a Nd:YAG laser (= 1 J in 15 ns) on a metal of high atomic number. Selection and isolation of the absorbing species of interest is achieved by an appropriate combination of laser type, target irradiation, spatial probing position of absorbing target and temporal separation of laser optical pulses. The continuum XUV radiation passes through the absorbing column and is collected by a toroidal mirror which efficiently couples the light into a 2. 2 m grazing incidence spectrometer. The spectrometer is equipped with an MCP (Micro Channel Plate) self scanning diode array detector. The performance, capabilities and reliability of the facility have been demonstrated through the undertaking of a varied programme of XUV photoemission and photoabsorption experiments. The XUV photoabsorption characteristics of aluminium thin films, helium, argon,and free metal atoms and ions in the transition regions of the Periodic Table have been recorded.

40|$|A novel {{continuous}} small-scale reactor {{based on}} the oscillatory flow technology (Harvey et al 2001) is being developed for application to specialist chemical manufacture and high throughput continuous screening (Harvey et al 2003). This novel reactor is able to perform continuous multiphase reactions, including those involving the suspension of catalyst beads. Extensive potential use in chemistry, biological and pharmaceutical laboratories is envisaged. Optimum operation conditions for applications in the bioengineering field depend on at least four parameters: 1) fluid mixing, 2) residence time characteristics, 3) particle suspension and 4) (oxygen) mass transfer rates. This work particularly concerns {{the establishment of the}} operation conditions in relation to oxygen mass transfer rates, KL. a. Furthermore, KL. a values are correlated with the fluid mixing, axial dispersion coefficients and finally with the fluid mechanics observed experimentally by particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique and numerically simulated using Fluent® software. The screening reactor is composed of a 35 cm length glass jacketed tubes (Figure 1), provided with smooth periodic constrictions (SPCs). The internal diameter of the tube is 4. 4 mm. The diameter in the constricted zone (the baffle internal diameter) is about 1. 6 mm, representing an 87 % reduction in the cross-sectional area. Mixing intensity is controlled by setting up the frequency and the amplitude (centre-to-peak) of the fluid oscillations. Typical oscillation frequencies and amplitudes are from 0 to 20 Hz and from 0 to 4 mm, respectively. A screening arrangement based on some SPC tubes (say 10 to 20) placed at different configurations (serial or parallel) makes this novel reactor suitable for parallel processing and/or for sequential reactions procedures. State-of-the-art fibre-optical technology was used for on-line monitoring of the oxygen concentration inside the screening reactor by using a special fibre optical micro-probe. The working tip of the probe was dip-coated with a ruthenium complex immobilised in a sol-gel matrix. This complex was excited to fluorescence by a blue led (≈ 470 nm output peak) and the level of such fluorescence is inversely related with the concentration of the oxygen through the Stern-Volmer equation (Wang et al., 1999). Continuous fluorescence levels are accurately measured by an UV/VIS/NIR <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> Numerical simulations by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, using Fluent ® software, permitted us to conclude that either near plug flow or stirred tank behaviour can be approached in a single SPC tube, by controlling the fluid oscillation conditions, i. e. the oscillation frequency and/or amplitude. For oscillatory Reynolds numbers (Reo) between 10 and 100, the formation of axisymmetric vortex rings leads to a good radial mixing of the fluid and to low axial dispersions, which suggests that a performance near a plug flow reactor is achieved. For Reo above 100 the high intensity and asymmetry of the vortex rings leads to an increase of the axial dispersion and the fluid behaviour approach that of a stirred tank. All these results were experimentally validated by PIV observations. High radial rates of flow exchange were numerically simulated and experimentally observed during a complete oscillation cycle, coupled {{with a high degree of}} velocity gradients. Thus, enhancements of heat and mass transfer rates are expectable within this novel screening reactor. Further, an increase of bubbles breakage is also expected (leading to a decrease of bubble diameter, i. e. an increase of the specific bubble area, a, and also of the gas hold-up), conducting to a significant improvement of oxygen mass transfer. This will be demonstrated with the present work...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to design, optimise and deploy a practical multi-measurand sensor (MMS) for process monitoring of glass and carbon fibre preforms in an autoclave. The MMS design was based on the optical fibre-based extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) strain sensor. The EFPI sensor consisted of a pair of cleaved optical fibres, with a defined gap that were housed in a precision bore capillary. Interferometric interrogation was used to measure the cavity length hence, permitting the strain to be determined. The basic EFPI sensor design was modified in the following manner to enable multi-measurand monitoring. Firstly, a fibre Bragg grating (FBG) was inscribed on one of the optical fibres that were destined to be housed in the capillary; the end-face of this cleaved optical fibre was sputter coated with Au/Pd to produce a reflective surface. This FBG is in a relatively strain-free condition and only responds to temperature. Secondly, a technique was developed to manufacture optical-quality end-faces of the capillary and this too was sputter coated with Au/Pd. Thirdly, secondary cleaved optical fibres were packed around the lead-in optical fibre of the EFPI sensor with a defined (secondary) cavity thus, permitting transmission/reflection FTNIR spectroscopy. Finally, cleaved secondary optical fibres were also secured to the lead-in fibre and these served as Fresnel reflection sensors. The interrogation of the MMS was carried out using a conventional fibre-coupled <b>multi-channel</b> FTNIR <b>spectrometer.</b> The feasibility of monitoring strain, temperature, cross-linking kinetics and refractive index simultaneously during the processing of glass and carbon fibre preforms was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExoMars is {{a two-part}} mission to Mars jointly led by ESA and Roscosmos. The first phase was {{launched}} in March 2016 and consisted of the Trace Gas Or-biter (TGO) and Schiaparelli lander. The TGO successfully entered orbit around Mars in October 2016 and has since begun a crucial aerobreaking campaign to circularize its orbit with a nominal 400 km altitude and 2 hr period. There are four scientific instruments on TGO: the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS), the Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (NOMAD) spectrometer, the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS), and the Fine-Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND). This presentation will focus on trace gas retrievals for the mid-infrared (MIR) channel of the ACS instrument operating in solar oc-cultation mode. ACS {{is a set of}} three spectrometers that are designed to better characterize the atmosphere of Mars with unprecedented accuracy. It aims to detect and quantify unknown trace gases diagnostic of active geological or biological processes, to map their distribution and attempt to identify sources, and to refine our knowledge of the vertical distribution of major and minor atmospheric gases. It has three channels: near-infrared (NIR), thermal-infrared (TIRVIM) and MIR. The NIR channel is combination of an echelle grating and an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF), and is similar to the Ultraviolet and Infrared Atmospheric Spectrometers for Mars and Venus (SPICAM/V) on Mars Express and Venus Express (Korablev et al., 2006; Bertaux et al., 2007). It has a spectral range of 0. 73 – 1. 6 µm and operates in nadir mode. It is intended to provide mapping support to solar occulta-tion measurements. TIRVIM is a small Fourier transform spectrometer with a spectral range of 2 – 17 µm and resolution of 0. 2 cm − 1. It has heritage from the Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS), operates in both nadir and solar occultation mode, and will be able to measure the physical state of the atmosphere (vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and dust opacity). NOMAD is also a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>spectrometer</b> with complimentary objectives to ACS. It consists of a pair of combination echelle-AOTF spectrometers, much like SPICAM/V and ACS NIR, that operate in both nadir and solar occultation mode. In its original configuration, TGO carried a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) covering a wide spectral range to detect trace gases (Wennberg et al., 2011), supported by the nadir-viewing NOMAD instrument capable of carrying out trace gas mapping studies. The ACS MIR channel aims to reproduce the capabilities of the FTS using a novel concept for atmospheric studies: a cross-dispersion spectrometer combining an echelle grating with a wide blaze angle and secondary, steerable diffraction grating (Korablev et al., 2017). It is capable of finer resolution than its echelle-AOTF counterparts, but is limited in its instantaneous spectral range compared to its FTS predecessor. The ACS MIR block is thermally isolated from TIRVIM and coupled to NIR, but shares a common electronics block. It consists of an entry telescope and collimator, a large echelle grating (107 × 240 mm, 3. 03 grooves per mm), a steerable pair of secondary grating mirrors, and a Sofradir MCT array detector The low-density echelle grating at a high blaze angle (63. 43 °) provides overlapping spectra at high orders. The secondary grating separates the orders and the resulting spectra are recorded by the detector with 640 pixels in the x direction corresponding to wavelength, and 512 pixels in the y direction corresponding to order. Several spectra are recorded for each order on sequential pixel rows. The secondary grating has two reflective gratings mounted side-by-side that can rotated...|$|E
40|$|Transit-spectroscopy of exoplanets {{is one of}} the key {{observational}} {{techniques to}} characterize the extrasolar planet and its atmosphere. The observational challenges of these measurements require dedicated instrumentation and only the space environment allows an undisturbed access to earth-like atmospheric features such as water or carbon-dioxide. Therefore, several exoplanet-specific space missions are currently being studied. One of them is EChO, the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory, which is part of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015 - 2025 program, and which is one of four candidates for the M 3 launch slot in 2024. In this paper we present the results of our assessment study of the EChO spectrometer, the only science instrument onboard this spacecraft. The instrument is a <b>multi-channel</b> all-reflective dispersive <b>spectrometer,</b> covering the wavelength range from 400 nm to 16 microns simultaneously with a moderately low spectral resolution. We illustrate how the key technical challenge of the EChO mission - the high photometric stability - influences the choice of spectrometer concept and drives fundamentally the instrument design. First performance evaluations underline the fitness of the elaborated design solution for the needs of the EChO mission.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of Saturn {{performed by the}} Cassini probe, orbiting the ringed system since July 2004, show that a giant oval structure has formed in the planet's North hemisphere. The structure has been observed in different hyperspectral images retrieved by VIMS-V, on board Cassini, starting from May 2011. VIMS is a <b>multi-channel</b> imaging <b>spectrometer,</b> able to produce 2 D images of the observed target that also contain their spectral information. The instrument consists of an infrared channel (VIMS-IR) ranging from 0. 85 to 5. 1 µm and a visual channel (VIMS-V) operating in the wavelength range 0. 35 - 1. 05 µm; the visual channel has a nominal spectral resolution of 7. 3 nm and a nominal angular resolution of 500 µrad; {{in this study we}} will work on the data collected by this last one. We evaluate the top level of the clouds located over the oval structure observed on January 2012 by VIMS around 35 ° North latitude, by examining the bottom of the 0. 89 -µm methane (CH 4) absorption band by means of the VIMS-V hyperspectral images analysis. Methane is indeed the most absorbing gas in Saturn's atmosphere in the wavelength range covered by VIMS-V. Moreover, the 0. 89 µm absorption band is the strongest in this wavelength range and it allows us to sound {{the highest levels of the}} atmosphere. A radiative transfer model has been developed to simulate the radiance field on the planet. This model uses the discrete ordinate solver for a plane parallel atmosphere and considers different configurations of microphysical, optical and geometrical parameters both for clouds and aerosols. These parameters have been tested to fit to the 0. 89 µm CH 4 absorption band whose depth depends also on the reflection by the highest clouds and/or haze layers. Finally, aerosol parameters must be carefully tuned to obtain the same shape between the synthetic and VIMS-V measured spectra. Vortices have been observed at Saturn since the Voyager missions, but thanks to Cassini we now have the possibility to study their evolution with a better continuity and with high spatial and spectral resolution. The temporal variability for the retrieved cloud-top level is then checked by analyzing two hyperspectral observations imaging the same vortex, recorded on a time lapse of five months. To this extent we'll take advantage of the results obtained in a parallel study (Moriconi et al., 2012) and presented in a second abstract...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{design for a}} <b>multi-channel</b> electrical mobility <b>spectrometer</b> which measures the lognormal size distribution and number concentration of aerosol particles in the size range 5 – 300 nm with a short response time. The spectrometer charges particles in the test sample by unipolar corona discharge, they are then classified into 16 channels by electrical mobility. Charged particles are detected in the channels by individual aerosol electrometers, giving an electrical mobility spectrum for the sample. The main aspect of the spectrometer design is a wedge-shaped classifier with flat electrodes. This allows a flow {{to be drawn from}} the classifier at 16 different levels/channels with minimal disturbance to the remaining flow, hence filter based aerosol electrometers can be used for detection. The varying field within the classifier caused by the wedge shape is advantageous to the classification and optimised through the selection of the wedge angle. Also presented is an alternative technique for inferring the lognormal size distribution of an aerosol from a measured electrical mobility spectrum. This involves using a theoretical model of the instrument to simulate the output mobility spectra for a large number of aerosol samples with lognormal size distributions. The resulting data library can be searched against a measured electrical mobility spectrum to find the corresponding size distribution. The experimental work presented in this paper is a first evaluation of this spectrometer and includes measurement of the classifier transfer functions, basic calibration of the charger, and finally testing the spectrometer's performance on some simple unimodal lognormal aerosol samples...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Includes bibliographies. Photocopy. Microfilm. xi, 175 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmA flux limited {{sample of}} 23 {{optically}} identified galaxies {{has been selected}} from Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) data that have far-infrared luminosities greater than ~ 5 x 10 ^ 10 L⊙, substantially larger than those of normal spiral galaxies. If star formation {{is the cause of}} the large luminosities, then strong hydrogen recombination line emission should be present, although substantial extinction is probable. Accordingly, the sample has been observed for Bra (n = 5 → 4) hydrogen recombination line emission; 15 of the galaxies have had Brγ (n = 7 → 4) line measurements. The observations were made with <b>multi-channel</b> grating <b>spectrometers,</b> allowing high sensitivity, accurate photometric precision, and moderate velocity resolution. Sixteen of the sample galaxies were detected in {{one or both of the}} lines. Photometry through N (10 µm), Q (20 µm), and/or 25 µm broad-band filters has been obtained for 16 of the sample galaxies, while 13 have been measured through a 12. 5 µm narrow-band filter. Further narrow-band filter observations have measured the 9. 7 µm silicate absorption optical depth for 7 galaxies. The photometry, line ratios, and silicate optical depths have been used to correct the observed line strengths for the effects of extinction and spatially-extended emission. For comparison, the bright IRAS source 17138 - 1017 has also been studied. The galaxy is close to the Galactic plane and is identified with an optically uncataloged spiral galaxy at a redshift of 0. 018 and an implied bolometric luminosity of - 2. 5 x 10 ^ 11 L⊙. The source has among the highest 60 um flux densities of any previously uncataloged galaxy. Strong [NII] and Hα, Brγ, and Brα hydrogen recombination lines are observed from the nuclear region with line profiles < 600 km s^- 1 wide. The [NII]/Hα ratio is similar to that found in Galactic HII regions. Strong radio emission at 6 cm and 20 cm is observed that has structure which resembles that observed in B and I CCD images. Photometry of the nucleus from 1. 25 - 25 µm has also been obtained; off-nuclear measurements show that the peak of the infrared emission is coincident with the radio and optical peaks and that the galaxy is extended at 10 µm. Many of the observed properties of the galaxy are due to extinction within the galaxy, which is heaviest around the center and which drops to the Galactic value well outside of the nucleus. Most of the galaxies, including IRAS 17138 - 1017, have line strengths that can be adequately explained by recombination of hydrogen ionized by the continuum radiation from high mass stars. In particular, the ratio of the galaxies' luminosity to the estimated number of ionizing continuum photons is what would be expected from a burst of star formation. The lines are also spectrally unresolved, as expected for a collection of low internal dispersion HII regions taking part in only galactic rotation. Therefore, most of the galaxies in the luminosity range observed appear to derive most of their luminosities from the formation of high mass stars. The high-mass star formation rate is so large that the initial mass function describing the star formation must have comparatively few low-mass stars. Most of the activity occurs with ~ 1 kpc of the nucleus, even in the most luminous examples. Molecular hydrogen emission was not detected from IRAS 17138 - 1017. Combined with results on other galaxies, this implies that extragalactic H 2 emission is probably not associated with star formation. There are several galaxies that have weak lines and very few ionizing continuum photons for their luminosities, however. The best example is IC 4553 (= Arp 220). The Bra emission in IC 4553 is ~ 10 times smaller than expected from a starburst and has a very broad profile, with a FWHM of ~ 1200 km s^- 1 and possibly even broader wings. NGC 6240 and the known Seyfert galaxies Mkn 231 and NGC 7469 also have relatively weak lines and broad profiles, with ~ 900 km s^- 1 and ~ 1000 km s^- 1 FWHM respectively. Several other galaxies have weak lines, but not conclusively broadened profiles (e. g., NGC 4418 and IC 694). These characteristics are contrary to what is expected from a starburst, but are similar to the observed properties of other Seyfert galaxies. Therefore, these objects may have their luminosities generated by an active nucleus similar to those found in Seyfert galaxies. Within the luminosity range observed, if the percentage of Seyfert activity in all infrared-luminous galaxies is the same as in the sample, then the total space density of galaxies with some Seyfert activity may be ~ 50 % larger than hitherto measured. Even the galaxies that show some evidence for the presence of an AGN have an appreciable amount of their luminosities contributed by star formation. In particular, star formation and Seyfert-like nuclear activity contribute roughly equally to the total far-infrared luminosity observed from the sample galaxies...|$|R
