In this paper, Based on {{regression}} analysis of tests, three comprehensive experimental models {{were presented in}} precision turning high-strength spring steel, Vicker’s hardness, residual stresses and surface roughness can be predicted utilizing these models. And the influence of tool geometry on machined surface integrity was analyzed systematically. The analytical results show that Vicker’s hardness and compressive residual stress will increase with the decrease of rake angle, clearance angle, cutting edge angle or <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angle, surface roughness increases with an increase of rake angle or clearance angle and decreases with an increase of cutting edge angle or <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angle...|$|E
40|$|In {{continuous}} cutting operation, {{the use of}} chip breakers {{has become}} virtually important and much effort has been put into {{the development of a}} wide range of breakers to suit a wide cutting condition. Unexpected chipping will occur on the <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> when as insert that has proper chip breaking performance is under optimum cutting condition. Then, the effect of chip breakers on the wear and chipping of inserts have been experimentaly investigated. The progress of crater wear is studied in details with the contour observation of five different chip breakers. The main results obtained are as follow; (1) The chip breaker patterns of tool face affect feed force and thrust force. In the case of the grooved chip breaker, the thrust force is larger than the obstruction type breaker. The chip breaker patterns do not affect the side flow angle if the cutting conditions are the same. (2) The forms of crater wear <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> chipping are significant influenced with the chip breaker patterns. If the projection of chip breakers is properly worn away with the progress of cutting time, the center of crater of the tool face moves away from the major and the minor cutting edges. The chipping of the <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is easy to appear with a decrement in the wear of chip breaker projection...|$|E
40|$|Turn milling {{is still}} a {{relatively}} un common process for precision manufacturing of axially symmetric components. In this process, chip formation is realized by a combined rotation of the workpiece and the cutting tool. Due to its special kinematics, turn milling offers potential for cutting of difficult-to-machine materials, such as particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites. The heterogeneous microstructure of these materials with comparatively soft matrix and hard ceramic particles causes high dynamic loads on the cutting edges. Furthermore, the cutting edges have to withstand the highly abrasive effect of the hard particles. This requires the application of wear-resistant cutting materials, including particularly diamond-based cutting materials. However, their use as tippings imposes design limitations for the cutting tools. In this investigation, cutting tests on an aluminium alloy reinforced with 15 per cent by volume alumina particles were performed using end mills with different <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles in orthogonal and tangential turn milling. After a short cutting time, during tangential turn milling the flat cutting edge geometry resulted in vibrations of the tool and a poor workpiece surface quality. In contrast, orthogonal turn milling produced no vibrations and enabled higher feed velocities when reducing the <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles from 1 ° to 0 °...|$|E

In this investigation industrial produced micro-milling tools with a diameter of D = 0. 2 mm made of cemented carbide were analysed. Micro-milling tools with variable macro geometry were selected and used for the machining of mould steel. The influence of the geometrical deviations on the wear behaviour and the surface roughness of the machined steel were examined.

Axial turning is {{a method}} to cut the {{cylindrical}} work piece along its axis, using the kinetic energy of high-speed rotation annularity tool, the abrasives in tool tip (or toes) as the main cutting edge to remove materials and the abrasives in the inner surface of tool as a <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> to sharpen the processed surface.

40|$|Chip {{control and}} tool wear {{estimation}} {{are two major}} concerns in automated machining systems. Chip control {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined part, the convenience of chip disposal, and possible power reduction; while tool wear estimation is vital to an effective tool change policy and quality control strategy, especially in finish-machining. This thesis first presents a new method for quantifying chip breaking and chip shapes with a fuzzy rating system, and further for predicting the chip breakability for arbitrary combinations of machining conditions through a fuzzy-set mathematical model. A predictive expert system for off-line assessment of machining performance, with chip control as a major criterion and due consideration to surface finish and power consumption, is then developed. A knowledge-based system for designing optimum chip breakers is set up with a criterion of efficient chip breaking at reduced power consumption. The method is based on the analysis of three-dimensional chip flow in oblique machining for a wide range of work materials, cutting conditions, tool geometries, chip breaker styles/sizes and restricted contact lengths. Experimental results of tool wear patterns in finish-machining show that estimation of more than one type of tool wear is required to assure the quality of a finished product. In order to achieve this, a dispersion analysis algorithm, derived from the established multivariate time series models, is used for the overall estimation of tool wear, including major flank wear, crater wear, minor flank wear and groove wear at the <b>minor</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> Finally, neural network techniques are used for modelling the dynamic interrelationship between the chip forming behaviour and different tool wear states. By integrating the developed methods for predicting chip breakability/shapes and for estimating comprehensive tool wear, the initially-predicted chip forming/breaking patterns can be updated with tool wear progression during the machining process through the use of neural network techniques. The results show that the methods developed in this thesis, for predicting chip breaking and shapes, and for evaluating machining performance, including chip control, surface finish and power consumption, m a y be used to form a basis for the off-line assessment of 2 ̆ 2 total machinability 2 ̆ 2 for automated machining systems. The strategy of comprehensive tool wear estimation provides a feasible means for on-line tool wear monitoring to assure product quality, especially under finish-machining conditions. The results also show that by using neural networks, chip forming behaviour with tool wear progression can be evaluated in-process, thus providing a feasible approach for achieving the on-line assessment of machining performance including chip forming patterns, surface finish and overall tool wear progression...|$|E

40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling.

The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively.

Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or basic opening, diameter and length of the cutting part, mill length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The chip load thickness provided by the curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills.
