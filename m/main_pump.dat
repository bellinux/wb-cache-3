5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the <b>main</b> <b>pump</b> can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system <b>main</b> <b>pump</b> and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases. The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.|$|E
500|$|By the 1880s coal {{production}} declined as the various pits either {{ran out of}} coal or were flooded and subsequently closed. [...] In 1896 the <b>main</b> <b>pump</b> at Dunkerton which maintained the canal water level failed. The resultant lowering in level meant that only small loads could be transported.

500|$|The HPOTP {{consists}} of two single-stage centrifugal pumps (a <b>main</b> <b>pump</b> and a preburner pump) mounted on a common shaft and driven by a two-stage, hot-gas turbine. The <b>main</b> <b>pump</b> boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from [...] while operating at approximately 28,120rpm, giving a power output of [...] The HPOTP discharge flow splits into several paths, one of which drives the LPOTP turbine. Another path is to, and through, the main oxidizer valve and enters the main combustion chamber. Another small flow path is tapped off {{and sent to the}} oxidizer heat exchanger. The liquid oxygen flows through an anti-flood valve that prevents it from entering the heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present for the heat exchanger to utilize the heat contained in the gases discharged from the HPOTP turbine, converting the liquid oxygen to gas. The gas is sent to a manifold and then routed to pressurize the liquid oxygen tank. Another path enters the HPOTP second-stage preburner pump to boost the liquid oxygen's pressure from 30 to 51 MPa (4,300 psia to 7,400 psia). It passes through the oxidizer preburner oxidizer valve into the oxidizer preburner, and through the fuel preburner oxidizer valve into the fuel preburner. The HPOTP measures approximately [...] It is attached by flanges to the hot-gas manifold.|$|E
500|$|The canal {{opened in}} 1805 {{and was used}} for {{passenger}} traffic as well as coal. In 1814 the Benedictine monks who came to Downside Abbey {{are said to have}} used the canal for the last stage of their journey. Another cargo carried by the canal was limestone from Combe Down. The peak level of cargo carried was in 1838 at 138,403tons resulting in over £17,000 of tolls being paid. Cargoes of over 100,000tons were common until the 1870s when the decline in output of coal from the various Somerset coalpits, along with competition from the railways, dramatically reduced the canal's profitability. [...] When the <b>main</b> <b>pump</b> at Dunkerton failed it was not replaced and there was not sufficient water for continual operation of the locks. [...] The canal went into liquidation in 1894; it closed in 1898 and was finally abandoned in 1904 when it was sold to the Great Western Railway for £2,000, and used as a branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. The closure caused problems across the Somerset coalfield especially to the pits along the Paulton branch, which had relied on the canal for transportation.|$|E
