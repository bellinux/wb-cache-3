40|$|A large {{disparity}} {{exists in}} access to dental {{services for the}} <b>Medical</b> <b>Assistance</b> population {{when compared with the}} general population. The disparity has been seen in areas across the United States. Based on prior discussions with dental providers and advocates, one of the common barriers to dental services for adult <b>Medical</b> <b>Assistance</b> recipients is the lack of knowledge and information on available dental services. The objective {{of this study is to}} be able to provide non-profit organizations that serve the <b>Medical</b> <b>Assistance</b> population, such as the Consumer Health Coalition, with a detailed assessment of the dental providers that accept <b>Medical</b> <b>Assistance.</b> If a better understanding and knowledge of the dental services available to <b>Medical</b> <b>Assistance</b> recipients is provided to non-profit organizations, that serve the <b>Medical</b> <b>Assistance</b> population in the Southwestern Pennsylvania area, then we can expect better access to dental services.
