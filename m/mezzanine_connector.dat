50|$|The oldest {{portions}} of the Pedway, aside from the interiors of some included buildings, are the corridors between State and Dearborn Streets, linking Chicago Transit Authority's Red Line and Blue Line stations at Washington and Lake Streets and at Jackson Street. These were constructed with the subways; while the completion and outfitting of the Blue Line under Dearborn Street were interrupted by rationing in World War II, the two <b>mezzanine</b> <b>connector</b> tunnels were opened and linked the Red Line under State Street to the sidewalks of Dearborn Street. Construction on the pedway proper began in 1951 and has continued since then, especially after expansion was included in both 1968's Transit Planning Study: Chicago Central Area and the Chicago 21 Plan introduced in 1973.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{material}} characteristics of six epoxies used for corner/edge-bonding are analyzed and compared to board-level mechanical reliability test. An innovative material characterization approach, button shear testing, provided an expedient method of determining adhesive strength between the epoxies and each relevant surface material. The boardlevel test included mechanical shock test. A number of SMT test devices are evaluated, including 1849 CBGA packages, and 190 ball count <b>mezzanine</b> <b>connectors.</b> The failure modes and fracture strengths of {{the material}} characterization tests and board-level tests are cross-referenced for comparison, and assessed for correlation.

40|$|In this paper, {{the button}} shear tests of seven kinds of epoxy used for corner/edge bonding of BGA <b>mezzanine</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{performed}} firstly for determining adhesive strength between the epoxies and each relevant surface material. The effect of corner/edge bonding epoxy {{on the board}} level solder joint reliability of BGA connectors is also investigated including mechanical drop and 4 -point bending tests. In addition, the pre-conditioning effect of thermal aging (1000 hours at 125 °C) and accelerated temperature cycling (ATC, - 40 ∼ 125 °C, 500 cycles) on the reliability of connectors with corner/edge bonding epoxy is discussed.

5000|$|Another {{closely related}} type is the {{stackable}} connector for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets {{on the opposite}} surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable <b>mezzanine</b> bus <b>connectors</b> are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called [...] "shields". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.|$|R
40|$|A Dual Digital Signal Processing VME Board {{is being}} {{developed}} for the CEBAF Beam Current Monitor system at Jefferson Lab. It is a versatile general-purpose digital signal processing board using an open architecture, which allows for adaptation to various applications. The base design uses two independent Texas Instrument (TI) TMS 320 C 6711, which are 900 MFLOPS floating-point digital signal processors (DSP). Applications that require a fixed point DSP can be implemented by replacing the baseline DSP with the pin-for-pin compatible TMS 320 C 6211. Both parallel and serial protocols have been implemented for communicating with off board devices. The initial implementation makes use of TI Multi-channel Serial protocol and VME bus protocol. Other communication protocols can be implemented by reprogramming the FPGA. Each DSP is equipped with FLASH PROM and SDRAM for program and data storage. Additionally, each DSP has 16 bits of digital I/O, two digital analog converters, and two analog to digital converters. Dual 160 pins <b>mezzanine</b> <b>connectors</b> provide expansion capability without design modifications. The mezzanine interface conforms to the TI Expansion Daughter Card Interface standard. The design can be manufactured with a reduced chip set without redesigning the printed circuit board. For example, it can be implemented as a single-channel DSP with no analog I/O. The board supports JTAG 1149 boundary scan to facilitate testing, debugging, and programming. It is fully programmable using software development tools such as TI Code Composer Studio and a JTAG emulator such as Spectrum Digital DS 510 PP{_}PLUS. Using these tools allows one program the flash memory and FPGA through the JTAG ports, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a separate ROM/FPGA programmer. This work supported by U. S.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a functional super Read Out Driver (sROD) demonstrator for the Phase II Upgrade of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) in the LHC experiment. The proposed front-end for the Phase II Upgrade communicates with back-end electronics using a multifiber optical connector with a data rate of 57. 6 Gbps using the GBT protocol. This functional sROD demonstrator aims to help in the understanding of the problems that could arise in the upgrade of back-end electronics. The demonstrator is composed of three different boards that have been developed in the framework of ATLAS activities: the Optical Multiplexer Board (OMB), the Read-Out Driver (ROD) and the Optical Link Card (OLC). The first two boards, OMB and ROD, are part of the current back-end system where OMB receives two optical fibers with redundant data from front-end, performs online CRC for data and send to ROD the data from the error-free fiber; and ROD is the main element of the back-end electronics and it is responsible for data processing. Both boards are a 9 U VME format. Moreover, the last board, OLC, has been developed as an evaluation board for studying high-speed optical links for the R&amp;D of the TileCal Upgrade. It includes two SNAP 12 optical connectors which are able to transmit and receive up to 75 Gbps and an Altera Stratix II GX FPGA as processing device. The scheme of the functional sROD demonstrator includes an OLC plugged in an OMB board where OLC receives data from upgraded front-end via a SNAP 12 connector at 57. 6 Gbps and decodes it using a GBT decoder. OMB reads decoded data from OLC via <b>mezzanine</b> <b>connectors,</b> performs online CRC and sends data to ROD via a SFP connector at 640 Mbps. Once ROD has received data, it performs the Optimal Filtering algorithms. This functional sROD demonstrator will be used to develop a prototype, in ATCA format, of the new ROD for the Phase II...|$|R
40|$|ATLAS LAr {{calorimeter}} {{will perform}} its Phase-I upgrade {{during the long}} shut down (LS 2) in 2018, a new LAr Trigger Digitizer Board (LTDB) will be designed and installed. Several commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multichannel high-speed ADCs have been selected as possible backups of the radiation tolerant ADC ASICs for LTDB. In order to evaluate the radiation tolerance of these back up commercial ADCs, we developed an ADC radiation tolerance characterization system, which includes the ADC boards, data acquisition (DAQ) board, signal generator, external power supplies and a host computer. The ADC board is custom designed for different ADCs, which has ADC driver and clock distribution circuits integrated on board. The Xilinx ZC 706 FPGA development board is used as DAQ board. The data from ADC are routed to the FPGA through the FMC (FPGA <b>Mezzanine</b> Card) <b>connector,</b> de-serialized and monitored by the FPGA, and then transmitted to the host computer through the Gigabit Ethernet. A software program has been developed with Python, and all the commands are sent to the DAQ board through Gigabit Ethernet by this program. Two ADC boards have been designed for the TI ADS 52 J 90 and ADI AD 9249 respectively. TID test of both ADCs have been performed at BNL, and SEE test for ADS 52 J 90 has been performed at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Test results have been analyzed and presented. The test results demonstrate that our test system is very versatile, and working well for the radiation tolerance characterization of commercial multi-channel high-speed ADC for the upgrade of the ATLAS LAr calorimeter. It is applicable to other collider physics experiments where radiation tolerance is required as well...|$|R
40|$|Many of the modules in {{specific}} hardware architectures {{use the same}} or similar communication interfaces and IO connectors. MicroTCA (MTCA. 4) {{is one example of}} such a case. All boards: communicate with the central processing unit (CPU) over PCI Express (PCIe), send data to each other using Multi-Gigabit Transceivers (MGT), use the same backplane resources and have the same Zone 3 IO or FPGA <b>mezzanine</b> card (FMC) <b>connectors.</b> All those interfaces are connected and implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. It makes possible to separate the interface logic from the application logic. This structure allows to reuse already done firmware for one application and to create new application on the same module. Also, already developed code can be reused in new boards as a library. Proper structure allows the code to be reused and makes it easy to create new firmware.

40|$|The LHCb sub-detector {{electronics}} {{are organized}} around the detector in chassis or on individual boards, which requires configuration access to load or read different types of information. The experiment requires a configuration bus, capable to communicate properly on a copper line for a distance of over 100 meters, with a unique master, located {{in the control room}} which is not exposed to radiation, and up to 32 slaves implemented close to the detector electronics boards, working in a radiation sensitive environment. A complete Serial Protocol for Experiment Configuration System (SPECS) system was developed in 2005 based on PCI boards and detector mezzanines. The protocol requires 4 differential copper links over a standard Ethernet CAT 6 cable using BLVDS technology with a transfer rate of 10 Mbit/s in each direction. For PC obsolescence reasons, a new SPECS-MASTER (SPECSPCIE) is developed for the upgrade, based on the XTCA standard (full-size double-width). The SPECSPCIE board can be housed in XTCA chassis or in individual boxes. For this configuration, a COMExpress module provides all the link interfaces: Ethernet, PCIexpress, and JTAG. The board's core is the new ARRIA V GX FPGA family which implemented hard PCIexpress IP and transceivers at 3. 125 Gbps which allow direct connections with the serial links: 1 Gb Ethernet and PCIexpress 4 X GEN 2. The board has been designed as aversatile system, it integrates 16 SPECS-MASTER with individual drivers with discrete pole zero compensation and per-emphasis to allow a transfer length of up to 120 m. It also include a <b>mezzanine</b> HSMC <b>connector</b> for future development. An 8 bits microcontroller manages the XTCA startup sequence and the communication with the chassis controller (MCH) using the IPMB bus, and also the programmable power supervisor by I 2 C bus. A clock generator and jitter cleaner chip is implemented onboard and allows wide clock frequencies (40 Khz to 1. 5 Ghz) with very low jitter performance (. 35 ps RMS). This last one is configured by a SPI bus which is controlled by an on-chip NIOS CPU. To allow complex systems with easy programming an embedded uLinux system is implemented. With this configuration, we manage the Ethernet TCP/IP protocol. CPU communication is performed via PCIexpress or Ethernet link. The FPGA configuration is achieved by serial EEPROM, and reconfiguration by JTAG or by CvP (PCIexpress capability). Software libraries are available to use the SPECS System. One low level library allows users to access the master registers and to prepare and send SPECS frames to communicate with the electronics using the different modes available (I 2 C, JTAG, DMA Bus, Parallel Bus). One high level library interfaces all commonly used functionalities to write or read data directly to the electronics...|$|R
