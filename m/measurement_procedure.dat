5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The <b>measurement</b> <b>procedure</b> is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E
2500|$|The {{type of a}} mass {{spectrometer}} most widely used with MALDI is the TOF (time-of-flight {{mass spectrometer}}), mainly due to its large mass range. The TOF <b>measurement</b> <b>procedure</b> is also ideally suited to the MALDI ionization process since the pulsed laser takes individual 'shots' rather than working in continuous operation. MALDI-TOF instrument or reflectron is equipped with an [...] "ion mirror" [...] that reflects ions using an electric field, thereby doubling the ion flight path and increasing the resolution. Today, commercial reflectron TOF instruments reach a resolving power m/Δm of well above 20,000 FWHM (full-width half-maximum, Δm defined as the peak width at 50% of peak height).|$|E
2500|$|On August 6, 2009, SNG sent {{a letter}} to GGYC, {{containing}} the measurement procedures for the yachts. [...] GGYC did not accept these procedures, in particular because the SNG procedure would include the rudders in the LWLmeasurement and thus result in GGYC's boat BMW Oracle Racing 90 being disqualified. [...] GGYC requested the court to declare that the <b>measurement</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed by SNG was not valid (in particular the rudders should not be included when measuring length on the load waterline). SNG maintained its position. [...] On October30, 2009, the court ruled that the rudders should not be included for the measurement of the Load Water Line Length (GGYC's position). SNG appealed that ruling, but the appeal was denied on December15, 2009.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{functional}} size <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures</b> {{have been}} developed for applying the COSMIC measurement method to particular methods of software production. A subset of these <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures</b> is centered on the measurement of the functional size of the applications from their conceptual models, allowing the generation of indicators in early stages of the development cycle of a software product. This paper presents a survey of these functional size <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in order to provide a guide for practitioners and researchers. Finally, a general analysis focused on the results obtained in the survey is performed to obtain important lessons that must be considered in the development of correct <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Although LORAN {{deliberately}} {{used the}} same display as Gee, the signals were so much longer and more complex than Gee that direct measurement of the two signals was simply not possible. Even the initial signal from the master station was spread out {{in time with the}} initial groundwave signal being sharp (if received), while the skywave receptions could appear anywhere on the display. Accordingly, the LORAN operator instead set the delays so the master signal appeared on one trace and the slave on the second, allowing the complex patterns to be compared. This meant that only one master/slave measurement could be made at once; to produce a [...] "fix", the entire <b>measurement</b> <b>procedure</b> had to be repeated a second time using a different set of stations. Measurement times on the order of three to five minutes were typical, requiring the navigator {{to take into account the}} motion of the vehicle during this time.|$|E

GGYC {{requested that}} the International Jury be convened {{as soon as possible}} to negate or revise the biased provisions before the races. [...] GGYC subsequently {{requested that the}} International Jury also consider certain issues related to the measurement rules. [...] On February 2, 2010, the International Jury rejected GGYC's requests for redress regarding the <b>measurement</b> <b>procedure.</b> [...] The jury held that the maximum amount of moveable ballast had to be on board when the boat was measured and {{that it had to be}} equally distributed laterally, but that no other restrictions would apply. [...] On the same date, the Jury decided that SNG, as organizing authority, did have the right to set the start time; that the Race Officer would have the discretion to determine whether weather conditions on any given day were safe and fair so that racing could take place; and that GGYC's wind detection equipment was allowed. It ordered the Notice of Race to be modified to make it clear that the Deed of Gift took precedence and that the Notice of Race and Sailing Instructions could not override the Racing Rules of Sailing.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{metrological}} traceability of measurement results to property values assigned to measurement standards of higher metrological order {{or to the}} International System of Units (SI) through sequential calibrations, using reference materials and reference <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures,</b> {{plays a key role}} in ensuring that end user <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures</b> perform at an acceptable level in the clinical context.

These goals can only be reached under certain conditions and if requirements laid down in international standards on calibration concepts, reference <b>measurement</b> <b>procedures</b> and reference materials are fulfilled. Calibration hierarchies have to be implemented correctly and parameters contributing to measurement uncertainty and systematic bias need to be controlled and eliminated, respectively, by technically improving methods and reference materials and intermediate calibrators used for effectively achieving equivalence of measurement results and for meeting analytical performance requirements for in vitro diagnostic devices.
