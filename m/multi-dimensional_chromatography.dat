50|$|The {{prevailing}} {{method to}} increase the sensitivity of analytical methods has been <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography.</b> This practice uses other analysis techniques in conjunction with liquid chromatography. For example, mass spectrometry (MS) has very much gained in popularity as an on-line analytical technique following HPLC. It is limited, however, in that MS, like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or electrospray ionization techniques (ESI), is only feasible when using very small quantities of solute and solvent; LC-MS is used with nano or capillary scale techniques, but cannot be used in prep-scale. Another tactic for increasing selectivity in <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography</b> is to use two columns with different selectivity orthogonally; ie… linking an ion exchange column to a C18 endcapped column. In 2007, Karger reported that, through <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography</b> and other techniques, starting with only about 12,000 cells containing 1-4μg of protein, {{he was able to}} identify 1867 unique proteins. Of those, Karger can isolate 4 that may be of interest as cervical cancer markers. Today, liquid chromatographers using multi-dimensional LC can isolate compounds at the femtomole (10−15 mole) and attomole (10−18 mole) levels.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} is {{an analytical}} technique {{which is used}} extensively {{in the fields of}} chemistry and physics. Developments in the field {{over the last two decades}} have permitted the analysis of a wide variety of biological molecules from a range of sources. The term proteomics relates to the study of the protein complement of a cell or organism with particular interest in the identification and quantification of these analytes. A biomarker is a characteristic that can be measured and evaluated to give an indication of normal, biological processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Bodily fluids are a rich source of potential biomarkers as they can be obtained in reasonable quantity and their extraction is generally minimally invasive. The plasma proteome, which contains many thousands of analytes spanning a dynamic range greater than 10 orders of magnitude, reflects the status of the many tissues and organs in the body serving as an ideal medium for potential biomarker discovery. The analytical challenges posed by the plasma proteome are significant. Depletion of the highly abundant proteins is usually a prerequisite of any biomarker study and no technique has the dynamic range to study all of the proteins present. Comprehensive characterisation of the plasma proteome requires significant experimental effort and cost. Use of pooled samples in biomarker studies is widespread and the majority of biomarkers, which have been identified in the discovery phase, have not passed clinical validation. A data independent, label-free quantitative approach has been evaluated for the study of depleted maternal plasma proteomes taken in the first trimester. Plasma was characterised from individual and groups of patients from three obstetric conditions using single and <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Potential biomarkers from each source were identified and evaluated. <b>Multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography</b> was used to simplify the complexity of the analytes introduced to the mass spectrometer and the benefits and limitations of the approach in terms of biomarker discovery have been demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Multi-dimensional chromatographic techniques, such as (comprehensive) {{two-dimensional}} {{liquid chromatography}} and (comprehensive) two-dimensional gas chromatography, are increasingly popular {{for the analysis}} of complex samples, such as protein digests or mineral oils. The reason behind the popularity of these techniques is the superior performance, in terms of peak-production rate (peak capacity per unit time), that multi-dimensional separations offer compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. However, to fully utilize the potential of <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography</b> it is essential that the separation mechanisms used in each dimension be independent of each other. In other words, the two separation mechanisms need to be orthogonal. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature for measuring chromatographic orthogonality. However, these methods have their limitations, such as reliance on the division of the separation space into bins, need for specialist software or requirement of advanced programming skills. In addition, some of the existing methods for measuring orthogonality include regions of the separation space that do not feature peaks.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the routine methods currently utilized for total naphthenic acid analyses. There is a growing need to develop chemical methods that can selectively distinguish compounds found within industrially derived oil sands process affected waters (OSPW) from those derived from the natural weathering of oil sands deposits. Attention is thus given to the characterization of other OSPW components such as oil sands polar organic compounds, PAHs, and heavy metals along with characterization of chemical additives such as polyacrylamide polymers and trace levels of boron species. Environmental samples discussed cover the following matrices: OSPW containments, on-lease interceptor well systems, on- and off-lease groundwater, and river and lake surface waters. There are diverse ranges of methods available for analyses of total naphthenic acids. However, {{there is a need for}} inter-laboratory studies to compare their accuracy and precision for routine analyses. Recent advances in high- and medium-resolution mass spectrometry, concomitant with comprehensive mass spectrometry techniques following <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>chromatography</b> or ion-mobility separations, have allowed for the speciation of monocarboxylic naphthenic acids along with a wide range of other species including humics. The distributions of oil sands polar organic compounds, particularly the sulphur containing species (i. e., OxS and OxS 2) may allow for distinguishing sources of OSPW. The ratios of oxygen- (i. e., Ox) and nitrogen-containing species (i. e., NOx, and N 2 Ox) are useful for differentiating organic components derived from OSPW from natural components found within receiving waters. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy also provides a powerful screening technique capable of quickly detecting the presence of aromatic organic acids contained within oil sands naphthenic acid mixtures. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy provides diagnostic profiles for OSPW and potentially impacted groundwater that can be compared against reference groundwater and surface water samples. Novel applications of X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) are emerging for speciation of sulphur-containing species (both organic and inorganic components) as well as industrially derived boron-containing species.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the potential of <b>multi-dimensional</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> (LC) and to formulate guidelines for the optimal design of spatial separation devices. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to multi-dimensional LC. In Chapter 2 a Pareto-optimization approach is applied to various types of three-dimensional systems. The efficiency is evaluated in terms of achieving the maximum peak capacity in the minimum analysis time. A peak capacity of several {{hundreds of thousands of}} peaks may be achievable within a few hours using an xLC×xLC×tLC system. In Chapter 3 microfluidic chips are considered that feature one first-dimension (1 D) separation channel, 16 second-dimension (2 D) channels, and 256 or 1024 third-dimension (3 D) channels with specified lengths. The performance of column-based tLC×tLC systems for the separation of proteins is expected to be considerably exceeded. In Chapter 4 design aspects of two main types of flow distributors - radially interconnected (RI) and bifurcating (BF) - are discussed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Guidelines are formulated for designing flow distributors and the effects of imperfections or blockages are studied. In Chapter 5 the theoretical approach described in Chapter 4 is validated in practice, using chips fabricated by micromilling. CFD simulations of the distribution of analytes in two-dimensional systems are presented.

Large scale protein sequencing studies are undertaken to discover different molecular protein forms, i.e. “Proteoforms” that can be linked to disease, and treatment processes, both as drug targets as well as biomarkers. <b>Multi-dimensional</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> (MDLC) separation systems within automated platforms are built with on-line as well as off-line liquid phase systems, applied in proteo-genomic studies applying both cation-exchange and anion exchange mechanisms. A recent Cell paper by the ISB-team in Seattle [6], describes the SRM-Atlas, a milestone achievement, which is a compendium of assays that enables quantification of 99.7 % of the 20, 277 annotated human proteins. This includes a selection of splice variants, non-synonymous SNPs, and N-glycosylated proteins, by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). This resource enables the accurate detection and quantification of any known or predicted human protein. We envision that protein quantification by MS-platforms will constitute a paradigm shift in hospital laboratories worldwide; targeted analysis will be made by selected reaction monitoring “SRM” assays. These SRM assays are also easy to multiplex, whereby a number of 10 – 100 protein biomarkers can be analysed in a single assay cycle. There are already instruments in place in hospitals being tested as pilot units in a high throughput fashion for the quantitative analysis of proteins. The ageing population world wide will generate more patients who expect health services to provide fast and accurate diagnostic tools—mass spectrometry based assays can be expected {{to play a major role}} in tomorrows hospital laboratories. But not only for analysis of disease—probably also for analysis of health. There is a trend where measuring subjective well-being and people’s quality of life is fundamental when assessing the progress of societies. These measurements can be expected to include screening in central hospital laboratories, e.g. in the analysis of blood plasma, the most easily accessible human sample.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Three {{instrumental}} and computational {{methods are}} demonstrated in an endeavor to create novel techniques to extract {{information from the}} troves of data generated by <b>multi-dimensional</b> gas <b>chromatography</b> with mass spectrometry. Initially, these methods are considered {{within the context of}} targeted and non-targeted experimental design. The tile-based Fisher Ratio with null distribution analysis is first evaluated and validated within the non-targeted realm. The method is shown to be fast and accurate. Forty-six of the fifty-four benchmarked changing metabolites previously discovered were found by the new methodology while consistently excluding {{all but one of the}} benchmarked nineteen false positive metabolites previously identified. This was achieved in less than 5 % of the time required for the previous method. Later, the three-dimensional gas chromatograph is improved to include mass spectrometric detection. This instrument provides four dimensions (4 D) of chemical selectivity and includes significant improvements to total selectivity (mass spectrometric and chromatographic), peak identification, and operational temperature range relative to previous models of the GC 3 reported. Useful approaches to visualize the 4 D data are presented. The GC 3 - TOFMS instrument experimentally achieved total peak capacity, nc, 3 D, ranging from 5000 to 9600 (x̅= 7000, s = 1700) for 10 representative analytes for 50 min separations with component dimensional peak capacities averaging 406, 3. 6, and 4. 9 for 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D, respectively. Using this instrument and the well understood Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model a new option for targeted analysis is presented. Conceptualizing the GC 3 - TOFMS as a one-dimensional gas chromatograph with GC × GC-TOFMS detection the instrument was allowed to create the PARAFAC target window natively. Each first dimension modulation thus created a full GC × GC-TOFMS chromatogram totally amenable to PARAFAC. A simple mixture of 115 compounds and a diesel sample were interrogated through this methodology. All test analyte targets were successfully identified in both mixtures. In addition, mass spectral matching of the PARAFAC loadings to library spectra yielded results greater than 900 in 40 of 42 test analyte cases. Twenty-nine of these cases produced match values greater than 950...|$|R
40|$|This {{graduate}} {{research work}} addresses current techniques and method developments in gas chromatography. The two major {{themes of the}} work are to enhance the chromatographic performance and reliability of contemporary capillary column chromatography {{with the use of}} planar microfluidic devices, and to garner the power rendered by selective detectors such as micromachined differential ion mobility detection for the improvement of chromatographic aspects related to the portability, selectivity, sensitivity, and throughput of analytical systems. Included in this work are innovative analytical methods developed and successfully implemented to address difficult, unmet, and unarticulated chromatographic needs that have been encountered by the community of practice, particularly in the petrochemical and chemical industries. Over the course of the development of gas chromatography as a technique, many useful analytical approaches were developed {{to take advantage of the}} availability of hundreds of packing materials employed as stationary phases. However, the tools and devices designed for the use in column connectivity for the packed column era are not purposely meant for contemporary capillary column technology. Unfortunately, reliable options are few and far between. Recent advances in metallurgy, metal injection molding, deactivation chemistry, laser etching, and diffusion bonding techniques have resulted in the availability of planar microfluidic devices with features such as built-in fluidic gates, leak-free durability, improved inertness, inoven and non-contact switching. Therefore, planar microfluidics becomes an important area of research in chromatography. In this work, the important tactical and strategic use of the aforementioned devices in capillary gas chromatography was realized with multiple chromatographic system configurations developed. The use of the device(s) for <b>multi-dimensional</b> gas <b>chromatography,</b> for hyphenated techniques, epitomized by a unified 1 D/ 2 D analytical configuration and two-dimensional gas chromatography – mass spectrometry were attained. When properly applied, selective detection can substantially ease the burden of separation traditionally imposed on the analytical column especially when the matrices of the samples are increasingly complex to tackle. Selective detection is an enabler to high-speed gas chromatography which is a key component in the development of portable and hand-held analytical devices. Therefore, research conducted in this field is not only important but critical to the capability of and sustainable development for gas chromatography as a technique. In the current research, the performance, benefit, and impact of using differential ion mobility spectrometry with resistively heated temperature programmable micromachined gas chromatography is investigated and its usefulness highlighted. The synergy of hyphenated techniques with other contemporary selective detectors such as the pulsed sulfur chemiluminescence detector and mass spectrometry detector operating in selected ion monitoring mode are also reaffirmed and illustrated in challenging industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Chronic venous leg ulcers are a {{detrimental}} {{health issue}} plaguing our society, resulting {{in long term}} pain, immobility and decreased {{quality of life for}} a large proportion of sufferers. The frequency of these chronic wounds has led current research to focus on the wound environment to provide important information regarding the prolonged, fluctuated or static healing patterns of these wounds. Disruption to the normal wound healing process results in release of multiple factors in the wound environment that could correlate to wound chronicity. These biochemical factors can often be detected through non-invasively sampling chronic wound fluid (CWF) from the site of injury. Of note, whilst there are numerous studies comparing acute and chronic wound fluids, there have not been any reports in the literature employing a longitudinal study in order to track biochemical changes in wound fluid as patients transition from a non-healing to healed state. Initially the objective {{of this study was to}} identify biochemical changes in CWF associated with wound healing using a proteomic approach. The proteomic approach incorporated a <b>multi-dimensional</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> fractionation technique coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to enable identification of proteins present in lower concentrations in CWF. Not surprisingly, many of the proteins identified in wound fluid were acute phase proteins normally expressed during the inflammatory phase of healing. However, the number of proteins positively identified by MS was quite low. This was attributed to the diverse range in concentration of protein species in CWF making it challenging to detect the diagnostically relevant low molecular weight proteins. In view of this, SELDI-TOF MS was also explored as a means to target low molecular weight proteins in sequential patient CWF samples during the course of healing. Unfortunately, the results generated did not yield any peaks of interest that were altered as wounds transitioned to a healed state. During the course of proteomic assessment of CWF, it became evident that a fraction of non-proteinaceous compounds strongly absorbed at 280 nm. Subsequent analyses confirmed that most of these compounds were in fact part of the purine catabolic pathway, possessing distinctive aromatic rings and which results in high absorbance at 254 nm. The accumulation of these purinogenic compounds in CWF suggests that the wound bed is poorly oxygenated resulting in a switch to anaerobic metabolism and consequently ATP breakdown. In addition, the presence of the terminal purine catabolite, uric acid (UA), indicates that the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) catalyses the reaction of hypoxanthine to xanthine and finally to UA. More importantly, the studies provide evidence for the first time of the exogenous presence of XOR in CWF. XOR is the only enzyme in humans capable of catalysing the production of UA in conjunction with a burst of the highly reactive superoxide radical and other oxidants like H 2 O 2. Excessive release of these free radicals in the wound environment can cause cellular damage disrupting the normal wound healing process. In view of this, a sensitive and specific assay was established for monitoring low concentrations of these catabolites in CWF. This procedure involved combining high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). This application was selective, using specific MRM transitions and HPLC separations for each analyte, making it ideal for the detection and quantitation of purine catabolites in CWF. The results demonstrated that elevated levels of UA were detected in wound fluid obtained from patients with clinically worse ulcers. This suggests that XOR is active in the wound site generating significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, analysis of the amount of purine precursors in wound fluid revealed elevated levels of purine precursors in wound fluid from patients with less severe ulcers. Taken together, the results generated in this thesis suggest that monitoring changes of purine catabolites in CWF is likely to provide valuable information regarding the healing patterns of chronic venous leg ulcers. XOR catalysis of purine precursors not only provides a method for monitoring the onset, prognosis and progress of chronic venous leg ulcers, but also provides a potential therapeutic target by inhibiting XOR, thus blocking UA and ROS production. Targeting a combination of these purinogenic compounds and XOR could lead to the development of novel point of care diagnostic tests. Therefore, further investigation of these processes during wound healing will be worthwhile and may assist in elucidating the pathogenesis of this disease state, which in turn may lead to the development of new diagnostics and therapies that target these processes...|$|R
