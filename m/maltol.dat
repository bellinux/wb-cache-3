50|$|In {{very high}} doses, {{aluminium}} {{is associated with}} altered function of the blood-brain barrier. A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis, digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as antiperspirants and antacids. In those without allergies, aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals, but {{there is evidence of}} some toxicity if it is consumed in amounts greater than 40 mg/day per kg of body mass. The use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general, however excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels. Consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption, and <b>maltol</b> has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues. Aluminium increases estrogen-related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory. The estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as metalloestrogens.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the hepatoprotective effect of <b>maltol,</b> a food-flavoring agent, on alcohol-induced acute oxidative damage in mice. <b>Maltol</b> used in this study was isolated from red ginseng (Panax ginseng C.

For hepatoprotective activity in vivo, pretreatment with <b>maltol</b> (12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg; 15 days) drastically prevented the elevated activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglyceride (TG) in serum and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) in liver tissue (p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, the levels of hepatic antioxidant, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were elevated by <b>maltol</b> pretreatment, compared to the alcohol group (p < 0. 05). Histopathological examination revealed that <b>maltol</b> pretreatment significantly inhibited alcohol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and fatty degeneration. Interestingly, pretreatment of <b>maltol</b> effectively relieved alcohol-induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Maltol</b> appeared to possess promising anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory capacities.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the photomutagenicity of <b>maltol</b> (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one) in bacterial cells. <b>Maltol</b> has a caramel-butterscotch odour {{and is used}} as a food additive to impart flavour to bread and cakes. Unirradiated <b>maltol</b> was not mutagenic up to 5 mg/plate in the Ames test. When <b>maltol</b> was irradiated with either UVA (a black light, 320 – 400 nm, 230 mW/cm 2) for 5 – 30 min or UVC (a germicidal lamp, 610 mW/cm 2) for 3 min in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) prior to the exposure of bacterial cells, it was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, TA 104 and TA 97. Mutagenic activation of <b>maltol</b> by UVA-irradiation was more evident in neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 7. 0 – 9. 0) than in acidic conditions. On the other hand, photomutagenicity was not observed when <b>maltol</b> was irradiated with UVA in 100 mM NaCl solution or water. The mutagenic photoproduct was stable for at least 60 min after UVA-irradiation. However, addition of thiol compounds (cysteine or glutathione) to the UVA-irradiated <b>maltol</b> diminished the mutagenicity. Mutational spectrum analysis revealed that the pre-dominant base-substitutions induced were G:C!T:A transversions and G:C!A:T transitions. An increase of 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation in salmon sperm DNA exposed to <b>maltol</b> and UVA in vitro was detected by HPLC-ECD, but it was too small to explain the photomutagenicity.

40|$|The {{coordination}} chemistry of plutonium remains relatively unexplored. Thus, the fundamental {{coordination chemistry}} of plutonium is being studied using simple multi-dentate ligands {{with the intention}} that the information gleaned from these studies {{may be used in}} the future to develop plutonium-specific sequestering agents. Towards this goal, hard Lewis-base donors are used as model ligands. <b>Maltol,</b> an inexpensive natural product used in the commercial food industry, is an ideal ligand because it is an all-oxygen bidentate donor, has a rigid structure, and is of small enough size to impose little steric strain, allowing the coordination preferences of plutonium to be the deciding geometric factor. Additionally, <b>maltol</b> is the synthetic precursor of 3, 4 -HOPO, a siderophore-inspired bidentate moiety tested by us previously as a possible sequestering agent for plutonium under acidic conditions. As comparisons to the plutonium structure, Ce(IV) complexes of the same and related ligands were examined as well. Cerium(IV) complexes serve as good models for plutonium(IV) structures because Ce(IV) has the same ionic radius as Pu(IV) (0. 94 {angstrom}). Plutonium(IV) <b>maltol</b> crystals were grown out of a methanol/water solution by slow evaporation to afford red crystals that were evaluated at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Cerium(IV) complexes with <b>maltol</b> and bromomaltol were crystallized via slow evaporation of the mother liquor to afford tetragonal, black crystals. All three complexes crystallize in space group I 4 {sub 1 }/a. The Ce(IV) complex is isostructural with the Pu(IV) complex, in which donating oxygens adopt a trigonal dodecahedral geometry around the metal with the <b>maltol</b> rings parallel to the crystallographic S{sub 4 } axis and lying in a non-crystallographic mirror plane of D{sub 2 d} molecular symmetry (Fig 1). The metal-oxygen bonds in both <b>maltol</b> complexes are equal to within 0. 04 {angstrom} for each oxygen type. In contrast to the <b>maltol</b> structures, the cerium(IV) bromomaltol complex arranges the <b>maltol</b> rings in a drastically different manner while maintaining the S{sub 4 } crystallographic symmetry (Fig 2). The coordination geometry around the cerium remains a trigonal dodecahedron, but the chelating ligands span a different set of edges as in the <b>maltol</b> structures; the two-fold related bromomaltol ligands twist away from planarity, breaking the D{sub 2 d} molecular symmetry. It is unlikely that steric interaction with a bromine on the same molecule would have caused the observed rearrangement, as there would be sufficient separation between them to accommodate their bulk in the geometry of the plutonium and cerium <b>maltol</b> complexes. The extended packing in the unit cell of both the plutonium and cerium <b>maltol</b> crystals indicates that pi stacking occurs throughout the lattice via the <b>maltol</b> rings with close contacts between rings of approximately 3. 6 {angstrom}. Introduction of the bromine to this structure would disrupt the packing that would allow these interactions, causing the molecule to adopt the geometry present in the bromomaltol structure. In this unexpected arrangement the complex is still able to maintain some pi stacking with the <b>maltol</b> rings of adjacent molecules with a close contact of approximately 3. 3 {angstrom}. Additionally, the bromine on each ligand is arranged such that its next closest contact is with a bromine 3. 64 {angstrom} away on another molecule. Despite the different ligand geometry, the bromomaltol structure exhibits metal-oxygen bond distances that are within 0. 06 {angstrom} of those in the <b>maltol</b> complexes...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the absorption of ethyl and methyl zinc-maltol with that of zinc sulfate to substitute zinc sulfate with those complexes. Materials and Methods: After five weeks of being fed by zinc deficient food, zinc deficient rats were divided into four groups randomly receiving medicinal solutions of zinc sulfate, zinc ethyl <b>maltol</b> and zinc methyl <b>maltol</b> using feeding tube method for two weeks while the control was received distilled water. Serum zinc concentration and ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) and LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) activity of rats were determined before and after the study.

Methods: Adult patients with quiescent or mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, mild-to-moderate IDA (9. 5 – 12. 0 g/dL and 9. 5 – 13. 0 g/dL in females and males, respectively), and documented failure on previous oral ferrous products received oral ferric <b>maltol</b> capsules (30 mg twice a day) or identical placebo for 12 weeks according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to week 12. Safety and tolerability were assessed. Results: Of 329 patients screened, 128 received randomized therapy (64 ferric maltol-treated and 64 placebo-treated patients) and comprised the intent-to-treat efficacy analysis: 55 ferric <b>maltol</b> patients (86 %) and 53 placebo patients (83 %) completed the trial. Significant improvements in Hb were observed with ferric <b>maltol</b> versus placebo at weeks 4, 8, and 12 : mean (SE) 1. 04 (0. 11) g/dL, 1. 76 (0. 15) g/dL, and 2. 25 (0. 19) g/dL, respectively (P, 0. 0001 at all time-points; analysis of covariance).

However, after {{it was discovered that}} oxidative stress injury to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a leading pathophysiology of glaucoma [2], researchers ’ attention has turned to how to directly rescue the damaged RGCs from fatal oxidative stress. <b>Maltol</b> (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 -pyrone) is a naturally occurring aroma compound which is found in beans [3] and primarily used as a flavor enhancer. It is also a product of the Maillard reaction of Korean red ginseng [4], and it is reported to have a strong free radical scavenging activity [3, 4]. Exogenous <b>maltol</b> administration protects liver cells from lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatic damage and kidney cells from streptozotocin-induced diabetic renal injuries by suppressing thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBA-RS), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [5]. In the nervous system, <b>maltol</b> rescues the hippocampal neurons from kainic acid–induced neurotoxicity by returning the level of glutathione and TBA-RS to that of undamaged animals [6].
