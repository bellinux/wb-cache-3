5000|$|The 50 metre pool at Ponds Forge {{is one of}} ten in the United Kingdom {{built to}} current FINA standards, and hence is home to many {{sporting}} events. The main pool hall is 90 m long by 60 m wide and when the arches for the roof were constructed temporary supports for them were necessary. When these were removed it [...] "settled" [...] 150 mm. It has two <b>movable</b> <b>bulkheads</b> (so the main tank can be split into 2 or 3 individual pools) and the floors at the end quarters can be raised or lowered from surface level down to 2 m depth. In its long course mode with the bulkheads at the extreme ends it has 10 lanes. If used [...] "width ways" [...] up to twenty 25 m lanes are available. A sophisticated ozone water treatment system is employed that results in lower levels of irritants and reduced toxicity compared with traditional methods of treatment. The quality of the pool means that a great many events are held there which creates valuable exposure {{for the city of}} Sheffield and brings in much revenue for the city's hotels etc. The down side is the consequent unavailability for its regular users whilst those events are being held. A number of world records have been set in the pool although only one was long course. The latter was in the heats of the European Championships on the 3 August 1993 when Károly Güttler of Hungary went 1.00.95 to set a new world mark in the 100 m breaststroke. As well as competition-level swimming, the pool is also used for lessons, diving, kayaking and scuba diving. It is also open to the general public for lane swimming.|$|R
2500|$|The C-5C is a {{specially}} modified variant for transporting large cargo. Two C-5s (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified {{to have a}} larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites. The major modifications were {{the removal of the}} rear passenger compartment floor, splitting the rear cargo door in the middle, and installing a new <b>movable</b> aft <b>bulkhead</b> further to the rear. [...] The official C-5 technical manual refers to the version as C-5A(SCM) Space Cargo Modified. Modifications also included adding a second inlet for ground power, which can feed any power-dependent equipment that may form part of the cargo. The two C-5Cs are operated by U.S. Air Force crews for DOD spacecraft programs and NASA, and are stationed at Travis AFB, California. Both 68-0213 and 68-0216 completed the Avionics Modernization Program by January 2007. 68-0213 is being upgraded in RERP to the C-5M (SCM) standard.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{passenger}} seating in the HS 748 is for 40-48 economy class seats (4 abreast), however most passenger HS 748s still in service are operated as quick change combis, with a <b>movable</b> <b>bulkhead</b> dividing the main cabin two, with anywhere from 4 to 40 {{seats in the}} rear section and cargo in the forward section. The 748 is also widely used as a pure freighter with a typical max payload of about 12,000 lbs. Several carriers also use the 748 as a bulk fuel hauler, with either seven or eight fixed tanks in the cabin with a total capacity of about 7500 litres (2000 US Gallons).|$|E

5000|$|DC-8 Jet Trader: Douglas {{approved}} {{development of}} freighter {{versions of the}} DC-8 in May 1961, based on the Series 50. An original plan to fit a fixed bulkhead separating the forward ⅔ of the cabin for freight, leaving the rear cabin for 54 passenger seats was soon replaced by a more practical one to use a <b>movable</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and allow anywhere between 25 and 114 seats with the remainder set aside for cargo. A large cargo door was fitted into the forward fuselage, the cabin floor was reinforced and the rear pressure bulkhead was moved by nearly 7 ft to make more space. Airlines could order a windowless cabin but only United did, ordering 15 in 1964. The DC-8F-54 had a maximum takeoff weight of 315000 lb and the DC-8F-55 325000 lb. Both used 18,000 lb (80.6 kN) JT3D-3B powerplants. 54 aircraft built.|$|E
50|$|The {{main tank}} is 25 yards (22.9m) wide. The {{facility}} {{also has a}} track and two weight rooms. The dive tank {{is part of the}} main pool and has a depth of sixteen feet (4.9m). It consists of a pair of one-metre springboards, a pair of three-metre springboards, and one each of 3, 5, 7.5 and 10 metre platforms. For swimming competitions {{the main part of the}} pool can be adjusted for either long course (50m) or short course (25m) lengths by means of a <b>movable</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The bulkhead can also be set to 15m for competitions, or 30m for water polo. The pool also has a climbing rope (3m)near the diving towers. The PanAm is home to the Manta Swim Club, The Manitoba Marlins and The Manitoba Masters Aquatic Club swim teams, it also hosts the Neptunes and Bushido waterpolo teams.|$|E
50|$|In a move {{to cater}} {{specifically}} to the business traveler, Braniff, Inc., created the Braniff Business Cabin concept that called for a movable partition to be installed in the aircraft to divide up the two sections that would be installed on its aircraft. Business Cabin {{was placed in the}} front portion of the aircraft where all full Coach paying passenger will be seated. Braniff noted that it was not uncommon for a full Coach fare passenger to be seated next to a leisure passenger who might have paid 50 percent less or more for his fare. The leisure traveler was {{able to take advantage of}} 7 day advance fares or stay over a Saturday night which lowered their fare considerably. Braniff's Business Cabin eliminated this disenfranchisement of the full Coach fare paying passenger. Business Cabin service reflected the higher Coach fare that was paid by business travelers. With the movable partition, which was the first use of a <b>movable</b> <b>bulkhead</b> in the airline industry, allowed Braniff to adjust the sections of the aircraft to passenger loads and fare types.|$|E
