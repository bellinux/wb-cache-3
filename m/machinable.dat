5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more <b>machinable</b> than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|Inclusions in steel, {{especially}} oxides, may abrade {{the cutting}} tool. <b>Machinable</b> steel {{should be free}} of these oxides.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more <b>machinable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There is no flash {{produced}} so material {{savings are}} between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily <b>machinable</b> (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. The downside is that this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|E

50|$|Because this {{grade is}} used in {{pressure}} vessels, it is available in thickness variations of a sixteenth of an inch as well as large plate sizes. It is readily welded and is fully <b>machinable.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to beryllium, which is lightweight, the rotors of the gyros {{are made of}} a very dense, strong material, Elkonite. This is a sintered form of tungsten, with about 10 percent copper, to make it <b>machinable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mono-metal very-low-drag bullets are {{normally}} machined from solid bars of highly-machinable metals or alloys using CNC lathes. Common materials include UNS C36000 Free-Cutting Brass, lead-free brass, oxygen-free copper and other highly <b>machinable</b> alloys of copper, nickel, and tellurium.|$|E
50|$|A514 steels {{are used}} where a weldable, <b>machinable,</b> very high {{strength}} steel is required to save weight or meet ultimate strength requirements. It is normally used as a structural steel in building construction, cranes, or other large machines supporting high loads.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{developments}} in CAD/CAM dentistry use special partially sintered ceramic (zirconia), glass-bonded ceramic ("Vitablock") or glass-ceramic ("ips.emax" [...] lithium disilicate) formed into <b>machinable</b> blocks, which are fired again after machining. CAD/CAM restorations created with glass-ceramic CEREC technology appear to last well.|$|E
50|$|Fluorosilicate {{glass-ceramics}} with sheet structure, {{derived from}} mica, are strong and <b>machinable.</b> They find {{a number of}} uses {{and can be used}} in high vacuum and as dielectrics and precision ceramic components. A number of mica and mica-fluoroapatite glass-ceramics were studied as biomaterials.|$|E
50|$|A rabbet (also {{known as}} a rebate in Britain) is a recess or groove cut into {{the edge of a}} piece of <b>machinable</b> material, usually wood. When viewed in cross-section, a rabbet is two-sided and open to the edge or end of the surface into which it is cut.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrous {{materials}} are not readily <b>machinable</b> because the carbon in the diamond tool chemically reacts with the substrate, leading to tool damage and dulling after short cut lengths. Several techniques {{have been investigated}} to prevent this reaction, but few have been successful for long diamond machining processes at mass production scales.|$|E
50|$|In its {{solid state}} PEEK is readily <b>machinable,</b> for example, by (CNC) milling {{machines}} and {{is commonly used}} to produce high-quality plastic parts that are thermostable and both electrically and thermally insulating. Filled grades of PEEK can also be CNC machined, but special {{care must be taken}} to properly manage stresses in the material.|$|E
5000|$|Beryllium copper is a ductile, weldable, and <b>machinable</b> alloy. It is {{resistant}} to non-oxidizing acids (for example, hydrochloric acid, or carbonic acid), to plastic decomposition products, to abrasive wear, and to galling. It can be heat-treated for increased strength, durability, and electrical conductivity. Beryllium copper attains the greatest strength (to [...] ) of any copper-based alloy.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the gas-related issues, the materials have to maintain adequate strength through the entire required temperature range (sometimes reaching cryogenic temperatures), maintain their properties (elasticity, plasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity or lack of it, etc.), be <b>machinable,</b> and if possible not be overly expensive. Yet another concern is the thermal expansion coefficient match of adjacent parts.|$|E
50|$|Powder metal is also {{impregnated}} {{to enhance}} machinability. PM parts are generally difficult to machine and some compositions {{may not be}} <b>machinable</b> without ruining the cutting tool. Porosity sealing improves the life of cutting tools by ten to one-hundred times. Resin impregnation {{is more effective than}} compacting additives and can be selectively applied for near net pressed parts.|$|E
50|$|A dado (US and Canada), housing (UK) or trench (Europe) is a slot or trench {{cut into}} {{the surface of a}} piece of <b>machinable</b> material, usually wood. When viewed in cross-section, a dado has three sides. A dado is cut across, or {{perpendicular}} to, the grain and is thus differentiated from a groove which is cut with, or parallel to, the grain.|$|E
50|$|Martensitic {{stainless}} steels {{are not as}} corrosion-resistant as the other two classes but are extremely strong and tough, as well as highly <b>machinable,</b> and can be hardened by heat treatment. Martensitic stainless steel contains chromium (12-14%), molybdenum (0.2-1%), nickel (less than 2%), and carbon (about 0.1-1%) (giving it more hardness but making the material a bit more brittle). It is quenched and magnetic.|$|E
50|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} {{has several}} different solid allotropes. The δ phase {{is the least}} dense and most easily <b>machinable.</b> It is formed at temperatures of 310-452 °C at ambient pressure (1 atmosphere), and is thermodynamically unstable at lower temperatures. However, plutonium can be stabilized in the δ phase by alloying it {{with a small amount}} of another metal. The preferred alloy is 3.0-3.5 mol.% (0.8-1.0 wt.%) gallium.|$|E
50|$|Nanoindenters {{are mounted}} on holders {{which could be}} the {{standard}} design from a manufacturer of nanoindenting equipment, or custom design. The holder material can be steel, titanium, <b>machinable</b> ceramic, other metals or rigid materials. In most cases the indenter {{is attached to the}} holder using a rigid metal bonding process. The metal forms a molecular bond with both material be it diamond-steel, diamond-ceramic, etc.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more <b>machinable</b> than otherwise.

In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{and other}} {{components}} are manufactured in-house to maximize cost accessibility. The chassis is milled from a solid block of Al 6061 using a three-axis CNC mill, lathe and taps. This provides {{the body of}} EQUiSat and the fastening points for all components. In addition, the block to securely place the six batteries in is milled out of Delrin. Perfecting the manufacturing process was done using <b>machinable</b> wax, to reduce material waste.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more <b>machinable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Collets {{usually are}} made to hold {{cylindrical}} work, but are available to hold square, hexagonal or octagonal workpieces. While most collets are hardened, [...] "emergency" [...] collets are available that can be machined to special sizes or shapes by the user. These collets can be obtained in steel, brass, or nylon. Step collets are available that are <b>machinable</b> to allow holding of short workpieces that are larger than the capacity of normal collets.|$|E
50|$|Aluminum {{has become}} one of the most popular {{alternative}} materials for crafting bodies for guitar manufacturers. Its combination of high strength and low weight are attractive to guitarists around the world. Aircraft grade aluminum (6061) is the composition of choice for guitar manufactures such as Normandy Guitars and Xtreme Guitars. It is highly <b>machinable,</b> weldable, and strong enough to withstand the tension created by the strings on the neck and body while maintaining a relatively low weight.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of computerized dentistry (CAD/CAM technologies) involves the use of <b>machinable</b> ceramics which are sold in a partially sintered, <b>machinable</b> state that is fired again after machining to form a hard ceramic. Some of the materials used are glass-bonded porcelain (Viablock), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (a ceramic crystallizing from a glass by special heat treatment), and phase stabilized zirconia (zirconium dioxide, ZrO2). Previous attempts to utilize high-performance ceramics such as zirconium-oxide were thwarted by the fact that this material could not be processed using the traditional methods used in dentistry. Because of its high strength and comparatively much higher fracture toughness, sintered zirconium-oxide can be used in posterior crowns and bridges, implant abutments, and root dowel pins. Lithium disilicate (used in the latest Chairside Economical Restoration of Esthetic Ceramics CEREC product) also has the fracture resistance needed for use on molars. Some all-ceramic restorations, such as porcelain-fused-to-alumina set the standard for high aesthetics in dentistry because they are strong and their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel. Not as aesthetic as porcelain-fused-to-ceramic, many dentists will not use new machine-made [...] "monolithic" [...] zirconia and lithium disilicate crowns on anterior (front) teeth.|$|E
50|$|Extremely <b>machinable,</b> Macor offers tight-tolerance capabilities, {{allowing}} complicated shape design (optimal performances up to±0.013 mm for dimensions, < 0.5 μm for finished {{surface and}} up to 0.013 μm for polished surface). Macor remains continuously stable at 800 °C, with a maximum peak at 1000 °C under no load, and unlike ductile materials, doesn’t creep or deform.Its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} readily matches most metals and sealing glasses. As an electric insulator, particularly at high temperatures, it is excellent at high voltages and a broad spectrum of frequencies.|$|E
50|$|All mailable {{articles}} (e.g., letters, flats, <b>machinable</b> parcels, irregular parcels, etc.) shipped {{within the}} United States {{must comply with}} an array of standards published in the USPS Domestic Mail Manual (DMM). Before addressing the mailpiece, one must first comply with the various mailability standards relating to attributes of the actual mailpiece such as: minimum/maximum dimensions and weight, acceptable mailing containers, proper mailpiece sealing/closure, utilization of various markings, and restrictions relating to various hazardous (e.g., explosives, flammables, etc.) and restricted (e.g., cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, etc.) materials, as well as others articulated in § 601 of the DMM.|$|E
50|$|The {{graphite}} {{takes on}} {{the shape of a}} three-dimensional flake. In two dimensions, as a polished surface, the graphite flakes appear as fine lines. The graphite has no appreciable strength, so they can be treated as voids. The tips of the flakes act as preexisting notches at which stresses concentrate and it therefore behaves in a brittle manner. The presence of graphite flakes makes the Grey Iron easily <b>machinable</b> as they tend to crack easily across the graphite flakes. Grey iron also has very good damping capacity and hence it is often used as the base for machine tool mountings.|$|E
50|$|Some materials, such as <b>machinable</b> wax, {{can be cut}} at a {{wide variety}} of spindle speeds, while others, such as {{stainless}} steel require much more careful control as the cutting speed is critical, to avoid overheating both the cutter and workpiece. Stainless steel is one material that work hardens very easily, therefore insufficient feed rate or incorrect spindle speed can lead to less than ideal cutting conditions as the work piece will quickly harden and resist the tool's cutting action. The liberal application of cutting fluid can improve these cutting conditions; however, the correct selection of speeds is the critical factor.|$|E
