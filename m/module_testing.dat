40|$|System-on-chips (SOCs) and 3 D stacked ICs {{are often}} tested for {{manufacturing}} defects in a modular fashion, enabling us {{to record the}} <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probability. We use this pass probability to exploit the abort-on-fail feature of automatic test equipment (ATE) and hence reduce the expected test time {{in the context of}} single-site testing. We present a model for calculation of expected test time, for which the abortable test unit can be a <b>module</b> <b>test,</b> a test pattern or a clock cycle. Given an SOC, with test architecture consisting of <b>module</b> <b>test</b> wrappers and test access mechanisms (TAMs), and given <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probabilities, we schedule the tests on each TAM to minimize the expected test time. We describe four scheduling heuristics, one without and three with preemption. Experimental results for the ITCâ€™ 02 SOC Test Benchmarks show 3. 5 % and 20 % reduction of expected test time in SOCs with 0. 89 and 0. 71 SOC test pass probability respectively, without modification of SOC or ATE. Further experiments show how accurate estimates for the <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probability or the distribution of pass probability over test patterns need to be to lead to effective test schedulng...|$|R

50|$|NRT {{is applied}} during each {{software}} release testing phase, {{at the final}} stage during integration testing, right before the execution of system testing, and after the <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> (or unit testing) phase. In the <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> phase, single software modules are evaluated individually, which allows the identification of elementary errors like overflow, underflow, round-off, as well as discrepancies between algorithm model simulation results and the signals coming from the engine management system (EMS). The integration testing phase, performed afterwards, aims to verify whether the tested module is correctly integrated in the overall software system. Finally, functional testing (also called validation testing) is applied to validate the algorithms concerning functional requirements. This stage is usually performed after the calibration phase and characterizes an overall system testing, concluding the new software testing phase, and allowing, therefore, its release.|$|E

50|$|Software {{written in}} {{accordance}} with IEC 61508 {{may need to be}} unit tested, depending up on the SIL level it needs to achieve. The main requirement in Unit Testing is to ensure that the software is fully tested at the function level and that all possible branches and paths are taken through the software. In some higher SIL level applications, the software code coverage requirement is much tougher and an MCDC code coverage criterion is used rather than simple branch coverage. To obtain the MCDC (modified condition decision coverage) coverage information, one will need a Unit Testing tool, sometimes referred to as a Software <b>Module</b> <b>Testing</b> tool.|$|E

This paper explores issues of isolating modules from the men-time environment, improving integration of testing into the development environment, automating resting, and improving test planning and documentation. Metrics were gathered throughout the project that allow a coarse cost-benefit evaluation. Code coverage metrics for statement and branch coverage were also gathered using a commercial code coverage analysis tool.

40|$|Today's {{business}} environment {{has become increasingly}} unexpected and fast changing because of the global competition. This new environment requires the companies to organize their control differently, e. g. by logistic process thinking. Logistic process thinking in software engineering applies the principles of production process to immaterial products. Processes must be optimized, so that every phase adds value to the customer, and the lead times can be cut shorter to meet the new customer requirements. The purpose of this thesis is to examine and optimize the testing processes of software engineering concentrating on <b>module</b> <b>testing,</b> functional testing and their interface. The concept of logistic process thinking is introduced through production process, value added model and process management. Also theory of testing based on literature is presented, concentrating on <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> and functional testing. The testing processes of the Case Company are presented together with the project models {{in which they are}} implemented. The real life practices in <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> and functional testing and their interface are examined through interviews. These practices are analyzed against the processes and the testing theory, through which ideas for optimizing the testing process are introduced. The project world of the Case Company is also introduced together with two example testing projects in different life cycle phases. The examples give a view of how much effort of the project is put in different types of testing...|$|E
