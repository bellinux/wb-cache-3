5|$|Although much of <b>Massachusetts</b> {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of <b>Massachusetts.</b> The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area {{in the east and}} the Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley.

5|$|Although {{significant}} {{opposition to}} abolitionism existed {{early on in}} <b>Massachusetts,</b> resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837, opposition to slavery gradually increased throughout the next few decades.

Anthony in Adams, <b>Massachusetts.</b> The works of such abolitionists contributed to Massachusetts's actions during the Civil War. <b>Massachusetts</b> was {{the first state to}} recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, the 54th <b>Massachusetts</b> Infantry Regiment. In 1852, <b>Massachusetts</b> became the first state to pass compulsory education laws.|$|E
5|$|As late as 1795, the {{population}} of <b>Massachusetts</b> was nearly 95% of English ancestry.

Others arrived later from Quebec as well as places in Europe such as Italy, Portugal, and Poland. In the early 20th century, a number of African Americans migrated to <b>Massachusetts,</b> although in somewhat fewer numbers than many other Northern states.
