5|$|In 1923 {{his first}} book, How Labour Governs, was {{published}} by the London Labour Company. Examining the Australian Labor Party and its wider connection with the Australian labour movement, it reflect Childe's disillusionment with the party, believing that the politicians that it managed to get elected had abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that How Labour Governs was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as a <b>major</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1924 they were elected to power. Childe had planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, {{but it was never}} published.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became a <b>major</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> the international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E

5|$|The three {{principal}} {{cities of}} the Bay Area represent different employment clusters and are dominated by different, but commingled, industries. San Francisco {{is home to the}} region's financial and business industry, tourism, and is host to numerous conventions. The East Bay, centered around Oakland, is home to heavy industry, metalworking, oil, and shipping, while Silicon Valley is a major pole of economic activity around the technology industry. Furthermore, the North Bay is a <b>major</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> the country's agriculture and wine industry. In all, the Bay Area is home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies, second only to the New York metropolitan area, with thirty such companies based throughout the region. In 2014, the greater twelve-county statistical area had a GDP of $758.5 billion, the third-highest among combined statistical areas. The smaller nine-county Bay Area had a GDP of $721 billion, which nonetheless would rank it 6th among U.S. states and 16th among countries.|$|E
5|$|Before Miri was founded, Marudi was the {{administrative}} {{centre of the}} northern region of Sarawak. Miri was founded in 1910 when the first oil well was drilled by Royal Dutch Shell. The discovery of an oil field in Miri has led to rapid development of Miri town. Miri became {{the administrative}} centre of the northern region of Sarawak by 1929. During World War II, the Miri oil fields were destroyed by the Brooke government to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia but to no avail; Miri town was the first landing point of Japanese troops in Borneo. The subsequent Japanese occupation led Miri to become a target of Allied air raids which caused the destruction of oil refinery facilities in Miri. The petroleum industry {{continued to be a}} <b>major</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> the city's economy after the war. Oil exploration has moved offshore since the 1950s, but subsequently new inland oil fields were found in 1989 and 2011. In 1974, the formation of Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas led to co-operation between Petronas and Shell on oil exploration in the Miri region. In 2005, Miri became the 10th city in Malaysia to be granted official city status, the first non-state capital city to be bestowed such status.|$|E

40|$|As an {{effective}} measure {{for the promotion}} of the adjustment of China’s energy structure, distributed energy and its reasonable planning and development will {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>major</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> China’s power market. With the increasing access to distributed energy, its beneficial impact on the <b>major</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the power market will become increasingly obvious. This paper examines the influence of access to distributed energy on the development of the <b>major</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the power market, especially power supply enterprises. On this basis, a model for the calculation of the profits and losses of distributed energy users and power supply enterprises has been established, and the specific impact on the profits of power supply enterprises after access to distributed energy becomes available can be measured. In addition, this paper puts forward related policy suggestions to be implemented after access to distributed energy becomes available based on the results of the aforementioned measurement, in order to guarantee a reasonable profit for the <b>major</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the power market during the process of the development of distributed energy and to promote the healthy and orderly development of distributed energy...|$|R
