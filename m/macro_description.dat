The set of micro states where aggregation is possible forms the aggregation set. The paper considers the local (linear) case. The macro model is chosen such that it gives rise to an aggregation set which is approached by the micro movements as fast as possible. The inferred macro model describes trajectories of the aggregate quantities towards which the "true" trajectories of these quantities, as generated by the micro model, are tending. ...|$|E

This process {{requires the use of}} individual based microdatasets. The package presented in this work facilitates the production of small area population microdata by combining various datasets such as census data and individual based datasets. This package includes a parallel implementation of random selection with optimization to select a group of individual records that match a <b>macro</b> <b>description.</b> This methodological approach has been used in a number of topics ranging from measuring inequalities in educational attainment (Kavroudakis, Ballas, and Birkin 2012) to estimating poverty at small area levels (Tanton, McNamara, Harding, and Morrison 2007). The development of the method over recent years is driving computational complexity to the edge as it uses modern computational approaches for the combination of data. The R package sms presented in this work uses parallel processing approaches for the efficient production of small area population microdata, which can be subsequently used for geographical analysis.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a Markov chain approach {{that allows a}} rigorous analysis of agent based opinion dynamics {{as well as other}} related agent based models (ABM). By viewing the ABM dynamics as a micro description of the process, we show how the corresponding <b>macro</b> <b>description</b> is obtained by a projection construction. Then, well known conditions for lumpability make it possible to establish the cases where the macro model is still Markov. In this case we obtain a complete picture of the dynamics including the transient stage, the most interesting phase in applications. For such a purpose a crucial role is played by the type of probability distribution used to implement the stochastic part of the model which defines the updating rule and governs the dynamics. In addition, we show how restrictions in communication leading to the co-existence of different opinions follow from the emergence of new absorbing states. We describe our analysis in detail with some specific models of opinion dynamics. Generalizations concerning different opinion representations as well as opinion models with other interaction mechanisms are also discussed. We find that our method may be an attractive alternative to mean-field approaches and that this approach provides new perspectives on the modeling of opinion exchange dynamics, and more generally of other ABM.

Using this approach, intralayer design rules such as width and spacing of single layers, and interlayer design rules such as clearance, margin, extension, and overlap of two different layers can be specified in terms of two high-level design rule macros only. The tedious and complicated task of specifying detailed design rules in the technology file is thereby eliminated and placed by a simple macro rule file giving a much better overview of the design rules. Efficient rule compilers {{have been developed to}} expand these <b>macro</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the design rules onto basic checks for Magic and for corner-based design rule checking.

40|$|This {{extensively}} illustrated paper {{sets the}} context for the presentation of {{a new approach to}} the formal classification of type. The approach reassesses the value of previous contributions to the historiography of the field, re-evaluates the basis for type classification and re-conceptualises methods for accurate typeform description. Key developments in classificatory thinking during the twentieth century are identified to outline the difficulties of description within current contexts. An analysis of recent type design practice reveals a set of analytic tools for evaluation of existing description methods and identification of the key requirements for contemporary description. A historical review proposes that the theoretical model for understanding typeform developments in response to market advances in the nineteenth century as proposed by Nicolete Gray (1938, revisited 1976) has wider applicability. Applied to the late twentieth century market situation, this model contributes to the understanding of a fracture in contemporary discourse which prevents recent practice from being related to that of the past. The paper describes my own work in which I developed an approach to practice –based research which uses theoretical insight to inform a rigorous mapping of classificatory ideas from which to derive a new model for description. The significance of the new model lies in the micro and <b>macro</b> <b>description</b> possibilities for types offered and its in-built flexibility, which allows for adaptation in response to changes in the field...|$|E
40|$|The causal {{structure}} of any {{system can be}} analyzed at a multitude of spatial and temporal scales. It has long been thought that while higher scale (<b>macro)</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{may be useful to}} observers, they are at best a compressed description and at worse leave out critical information and causal relationships. However, recent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that the causal {{structure of}} some systems can actually come into focus and be more informative at a macroscale. That is, a macroscale description of a system (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed microscale description of the system (the territory). This has been called “causal emergence. ” While causal emergence may at first seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the phenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon’s discovery of the channel capacity. I argue that systems have a particular causal capacity, and that different descriptions of those systems take advantage of that capacity to various degrees. For some systems, only macroscale descriptions use the full causal capacity. These macroscales can either be coarse-grains, or may leave variables and states out of the model (exogenous, or “black boxed”) in various ways, which can improve the efficacy and informativeness via the same mathematical principles of how error-correcting codes take advantage of an information channel’s capacity. The causal capacity of a system can approach the channel capacity as more and different kinds of macroscales are considered. Ultimately, this provides a general framework for understanding how the causal structure of some systems cannot be fully captured by even the most detailed microscale description...|$|R

The unit of analysis (microstructure) is the propositions in the document where the sentences (i.e. subject and predicates which may be compound) are sequenced and connected into larger episodes and themes (e.g. paragraphs providing the macro-structure).

At {{a high level of}} abstraction, a <b>macro</b> data flow <b>description</b> describes how processing and disk access operations are combined. This high-level description (CAP) is precompiled into compilable and executable C++ source language. Parallel file system components specified by CAP are offered as reusable CAP operations. Low-level parallel file system components can, thanks to the CAP formalism, be combined with processing operations in order to yield efficient pipelined parallel I/O and compute intensive programs. The underlying parallel system is based on commodity components (PentiumPro processors, Fast Ethernet) and runs on top of WindowsNT. The CAP-based parallel program development approach is applied to the development of an I/O and processing intensive tomographic 3 D image visualization application. Configurations range from a single PentiumPro 1 -disk system to a four PentiumPro 27 disk system. We show that performances scale well when increasing the number of processors and disks. With the largest configuration, the system is able to extract in parallel and project into the display space between three and four 512 x 512 images per second.

We describe evolution and interactions between macro financial variables alike to financial fluids by hydrodynamic-like equations. Minimum and maximum risk grades define most secure and most risky agents respectively. That determines borders of macro-finance domain that is filled by economic agents. Perturbations of agent's risk coordinates near risk borders of macro domain cause disturbances of macro financial variables like Investment and Profits. Such disturbances can generate waves that propagate along risk borders. These waves may exponentially amplify perturbations inside of macro domain and impact financial sustainability. We study simple model Investment and Profits and describe linear approximation of steady state distributions of Investment and Profits on macro-finance domain that fulfill dreams of Investors: "more risks-more Profits".

Consequently, more information on these spray characteristics can lead to a more efficient pesticide usage. This study focuses on measuring spray droplet characteristics using a high speed imaging technique developed by Vulgarakis et al. (2015, Trans ASABE, 58 : 27 - 37). In the first part, the macro spray characteristics from different types of hydraulic spray nozzles were measured using a developed backlighted image acquisition system and image processing technique. Tests included five different nozzles (Albuz ATR orange and red, TeeJet XR 110 01, XR 110 04 and Al 110 04) (Vulgarakis et al., 2014, Asp. App. Biol. 122 : 353 - 361). In the second part, micro spray characteristics were determined for the same nozzle pressure combinations. An in-focus droplet criterion was established to decide whether a droplet is in focus and can be measured in an accurate way (Vulgarakis et al., 2016, Sensors, 2 : 218). A calibration system was devised using different sized droplets generated with a piezoelectric droplet generator (Vulgarakis et al., 2015, Crop Prot, 69 : 18 - 27) at different distances from the focal plane. This enabled measurement of the grey level gradient and the in-focus parameter for every droplet size at various positions. From here, a critical in-focus parameter was established for every droplet size and an in-focus droplet criterion was deduced to decide whether a droplet is in focus or not depending on its diameter and in-focus parameter. The in-focus droplet criterion was applied to spray images and droplet characteristics were calculated. The effects of the nozzle type, nozzle size and measuring position on spray droplet size characteristics were studied. All imaging results were compared and related well with existing measuring techniques like the PDPA laser.

40|$|Pore-scale {{modeling}} provides {{opportunities to}} study transport phenomena in fundamental ways because detailed {{information is available}} at the microscopic pore scale. This offers the best hope for bridging the traditional gap that exists between pore scale and <b>macro</b> (lab) scale <b>description</b> of the process. As a result, consistent upscaling relations can be performed, based on physical processes defined at the appropriate scale. In the present study, we have used a Multi-Directional Pore Network (MDPN) for representing a porous medium. One of the main features of our network is that pore throats can be oriented not only in the three principal directions, but in 13 different directions, allowing a maximum coordination number of 26. Using MDPN, flow and transport processes were simulated at the pore scale in detail by explicitly modeling the interfaces and mass exchange at surfaces. The solution of pore network model provides local concentrations and it allows relating concentrations and reaction rates at the macro scale to concentrations and reaction rates at the scale of individual pores, a scale at which reaction processes are well defined. Then, comparing the result of pore-scale simulations with the model representing the macro-scale behavior, we could study the relation between these two scales. We have considered mass transfer of reactive/adsorptive solutes though interfaces, under both saturated and partiality saturated conditions. While under saturated conditions the interfaces are only those of solid-water interfaces, under saturated conditions in addition to solid-water interfaces there will be mass transfer though air-water interfaces as well. Macroscopic quantities were obtained through averaging over the pore network domain. To meet our objectives we focus on both physical heterogeneity and topology (differently sized pores and coordination number distribution) and chemical processes. There are many other novel and unique aspects to this book, through which, we develop more accurate and realistic schemes to study flow and transport processes. For this purpose we have developed an extensive FORTRAN 90 Modular Package which spans though generation of random structure networks, discretizing pore spaces {{on the basis of their}} saturation state, and solving flow and reactive transport under both saturated and unsaturated conditions using several complex algorithms. The governing equations are solved applying a fully implicit numerical scheme; however, efficient substitution methods have been applied which made the algorithm more computationally effective and appropriate for parallel computations. Through coupling MDPN with multi-component reactive simulator, BRNS, we could simulate transport of species which may cause changes in porosity and permeability due to reaction with the solid phase. By averaging over a representative MDPN, we calculated upscaled parameters such as permeability, dispersion coefficient and measure of plume spreading, and upscaled adsorption parameters under saturated conditions. For partially saturated conditions the results were capillary pressured-saturation relation, relative permeability, unsaturated dispersivity-saturation relation, and upscale adsorption parameters. Whenever possible, we compared our results with the results of experimental observations and analytical equations. In this way, we could evaluate the limitations and sufficiency of the available analytical equations and macro scale models for prediction of transport behavior of (reactive) solutes...|$|R

Ninhos em atividade de Cornitermes cumulans (Isoptera, Nasutitermitinae) foram coletados a campo e mantidos em vasos em casa de vegetação por nove meses. As estruturas utilizadas no experimento foram macroestruturas densas e estrutura granular, ambas amostradas no mesmo solo que as colônias. O experimento foi realizado com duas repetições para cada estrutura, sendo cada repetição composta de um vaso com estrutura, ninho e alimento, e um vaso com a mesmo {{material}} e alimentação. As estruturas fabricadas pelos térmitas foram descritas macro e micromorfologicamente e comparadas com amostras coletadas no campo, também se verificou a distribuição das galerias. Os térmitas mantiveram as atividades de forrageamento e construção do ninho até o final do experimento, com algumas restrições. Para os vasos com estruturas densas a atividade desenvolveu-se tanto no vaso onde havia o ninho quanto no vaso com alimentação. Em comparação, para os vasos com estrutura granular as construções foram menos desenvolvidas e localizadas nos volumes associados aos ninhos. Nas estruturas construídas, as partículas de solo eram orientadas, formando uma parede rígida, como observado em feições coletadas no campo. As colônias de C. cumulans exploravam o ambiente de forma aleatória em todas as direções, retrabalhando estruturas densas e reagregando as partículas do solo para construção de galerias. Todas as estruturas densas ofertadas às colônias foram parcialmente ou completamente modificadas, e as concentrações de matéria orgânica das estruturas densas oriundas de horizontes profundos do solo foram incrementadas. Os térmitas retrabalham estruturas deixadas por eles ou outros invertebrados do solo, criando microestrutura e re-agregando o solo.

The Cornitermes cumulans colonies were sampled in the same site and were maintained in controlled conditions during 9 months. Two types of structures were tested: dense macrostructures and a strong granular structure sampled in the same site than the colonies. Two replicates of the conceptual termite-structure model were developed. Two pots, one of them with the colony and food material, the second with the same structured material and food, composed each replicate; a tube associated the two pots. <b>Macro</b> and micromorphological <b>descriptions</b> were done, the distribution and localization of galleries were described and compared with those sampled at field.

In the experimental model with dense macrostructures the activities were important and equivalent in all of the volumes. But, in the experimental model with the strong granular structure the activities were essentially done in the volumes with the mounds. The new structures that were built, soil particles were oriented, and formed rigid walls as they were observed in field samples. C. cumulans colonies explored the volume aleatory in all directions. The new structures showed oriented soil particles, as there were observed in field soil samples, in particular in dense structured galleries walls. Many of the dense structures offered in the pots to the termite activity were completely or partially modified; the dense structure organic matter concentration were increase in the structures sampled in deep soil horizons.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} examine and describe the relationship that exists between three distinct vertices within the triangulation formed by: (1) Contemporary Western strategic management theory; (2) The strategic management practices of experienced Australian businesspersons, and; (3) Classical Chinese military strategy. The preliminary {{aim of the research}} is to describe the relationship that exists within the triangulation, however, the ultimate goal is to consider whether such examination may provide an alternate framework for strategic management thought. The process of comparison required that each of the individual vertices be examined within their own right while also ensuring that a common basis for such comparison between the vertices is built. Such commonality was achieved by considering five central questions at each vertex, the questions were: (1) How do you decide what action to take? (2) What purpose do strategies fulfil? (3) Who are the best people to decide what should be done? (4) When considering what to do, is there a particular base you always come back to? (5) Are there certain traits/attributes, which make a business more competitive? Accordingly, the research proceeded in a circular fashion and provided the following contributions to knowledge, a: (1) Critical review and summary of contemporary Western Strategic Management theory at a <b>macro</b> level; (2) <b>Description</b> of the strategic management practices of experienced Australian businesspersons drawn from both qualitative research (interviews) and quantitative research (survey questionnaires) initiated from the summary of Western theory, and; (3) Critical review and summary of classical Chinese military works of strategy initiated from the summary of Western theory and practices. In addition the research drew the following conclusions: (1) From the identification of each of the vertices within the triangulation a comparative pattern described as evolutionary was noted. It was considered that the classical Chinese theory provided an integrated and consistent approach to strategy that was, despite its origin, applicable to the contemporary business scene. While Western strategic theory was found to be fragmented, inconsistent and in a form not readily applicable to the same business scene. The practices of experienced Australian businesspersons were found to be consistent with Western theory, but also in some respects more developed than Western theory and further along the evolutionary trail toward classical Chinese theory. (2) The more evolved state of classical Chinese theory is attributed {{to the fact that it}} was developed and codified over some 1200 years in extremely harsh conditions that did not forgive mistakes and had survived a further 2000 years of market use, whereas Western theory is a comparative infant at only 40 years of age. In addition, the dominant philosophy that was present at the time of the formation of classic Chinese theory lends itself to the creation of strategic thinking. It can also be said that the traditional dominant modes of Western thinking arising from Judaeo-Christian and even early Greek thinkers do not underwrite a pattern strategic thought that is effective in the contemporary business world. (3) The classical Chinese system is one that has identified the systemic issues that exist in competitive environments. The authors in this field have also developed consistent paradigms over its 1200 year history of practical testing. This system recognises that competition is not a science but an art and as such there are certain skills that must be mastered and natural rules that should be followed. Further, that ultimate victory depends solely upon the ability of the strategists. There is no one method, there is no sustainable advantage, there is no certainty; there is only continual change and human effort. (4) Comparatively, Western thinkers tied to their economic imperatives seek the ability to control and determine the best solution that may be applied repeatedly. Finally, the projection forward of the strategic thought identified through the comparison gave rise to a strategic management model that may be divided into systemic and tactical considerations. The systemic issues revolved around the characteristics that were necessary to build an organisation that would be capable of effective competitiveness and strategic thinking. These systemic issues focused on the worthiness of leaders and the relationship they built with their people. The tactical considerations relate to interaction with competitors and positioning oneself in the change continuum to ensure victory in a dynamically changing environment...|$|R

O presente trabalho foi dividido em trÃs capÃtulos. O primeiro capÃtulo teve como enfoque a realizaÃÃo da descriÃÃo macro e microscÃpica, e definiÃÃo dos estÃgios de maturaÃÃo ovariana e o grau de desenvolvimento dos ovÃcitos da espÃcie. No segundo capÃtulo foram descritas caracterÃsticas da histÃria de vida de C. orientale, tais como estrutura populacional, razÃo sexual, perÃodo reprodutivo, tipo de desova e tamanho da maturidade sexual. No terceiro e Ãltimo capÃtulo, foram analisadas as diferentes tÃticas reprodutivas relacionadas Ã sobrevivÃncia da prole da espÃcie, tais como: presenÃa de cuidado parental, tamanho corporal, fecundidade, tamanho do oÃcito e padrÃo de desova. As coletas de {{material}} biolÃgico ocorreram mensalmente de agosto de 2011 a julho de 2013 no aÃude CaxitorÃ e no rio Curu, ambos os pontos localizados na bacia do rio Curu, regiÃo semiÃrida do Nordeste brasileiro. Os resultados indicaram que as cÃlulas germinativas dos ovÃrios de C. orientale apresentam cinco fases de desenvolvimento e os ovÃrios e testÃculos apresentam quatro estÃgios de maturaÃÃo. A espÃcie apresenta desova mÃltipla devido Ã presenÃa de diferentes fases de desenvolvimento de ovÃcitos em um ovÃrio maduro. GÃnadas maduras foram registradas ao longo de todo o ano, com um pico de atividade reprodutiva durante o perÃodo chuvoso da regiÃo. A razÃo sexual da espÃcie difere de 1 : 1, porÃm essa diferenÃa ocorre apenas nas maiores classes de tamanho, nas quais ocorre a prevalÃncia de machos. Os tamanhos obtidos para maturidade da espÃcie foram pequenos (fÃmeas = 4, 04 cm, machos = 4, 33 cm). A fecundidade baseada no grupo de ovÃcitos mais desenvolvidos variou de 254 a 3389 (mÃdia = 2052 Â 849), aumentando proporcionalmente ao comprimento padrÃo da fÃmea. Os ovÃcitos mais desenvolvidos apresentaram diÃmetro mÃximo de 1, 8 mm. Estas informaÃÃes caracterizam a espÃcie como apresentando fecundidade baixa e tamanhos de ovÃcitos grandes, o que associado com o cuidado biparental e a desova mÃltipla exercidos pela espÃcie indica que ela realiza um alto investimento em capacidade de sobrevivÃncia da prole, em detrimento da quantidade de prole gerada. As tÃticas reprodutivas realizadas por C. orientale na bacia do rio Curu indicam que esta espÃcie Ã pertencente da guilda estratÃgia do equilÃbrio com algumas modificaÃÃes que estÃo associadas Ã adaptaÃÃo a um ambiente de grande variaÃÃo hÃdrica ao longo do ano. This study {{aimed at}} understanding the reproductive tactics of endemic cichlid the semiarid region, Cichlasoma orientale, {{in order to}} better understand the reproductive strategies of this kind to be held in an environment with large hydrological variations of the Brazilian semiarid region. This study was divided into three chapters. The first chapter was to focus on achievement of <b>macro</b> and microscopic <b>description</b> and definition of ovarian maturation stages and the degree of development of the kind of oocytes. In the second chapter were described characteristics of the life history of C. orientale, such as population structure, sex ratio, reproductive period, spawning type and size at sexual maturity. In the third and final chapter, we analyzed the different reproductive tactics related to the survival of offspring of species, such as the presence of parental care, body size, fecundity, oocyte size and pattern of spawning. The biological material samples were collected monthly from August 2011 to July 2013 in dam CaxitorÃ and Curu river, both points located in the basin of the river Curu, semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. The results indicated that the germ cells of C. orientale ovaries present five stages of development and the ovaries and testes have four maturity stages. The species is a multiple spawner due to the presence of different stages of development of oocytes in a mature ovary. Mature gonads were recorded throughout the year, with a peak of reproductive activity during the rainy season in the region. The sex ratio of the species differs from 1 : 1, but this difference occurs only in the largest size classes, in which occurs the prevalence of males. Sizes obtained for species of maturity were small (females = 4. 04 cm, males = 4. 33 cm). The fertility based on the most developed oocytes group ranged 254 - 3389 (average = 2052 Â 849), increasing in proportion to the standard of female length. The most developed oocytes had a maximum diameter of 1. 8 mm. This information characterize the species as having low fertility and sizes of large oocytes, which associated with parental brood care, and the multiple spawning exercised by the species indicates that it conducts high investment in offspring survival skills, rather than the quantity of generated offspring. Reproductive tactics made by C. orientale in the basin of Curu river indicate that this species is owned Guild balance strategy with some modifications that are associated with adaptation to a large water change of environment throughout the year...|$|R
