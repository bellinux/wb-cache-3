40|$|Extract: Liver biopsies {{from two}} {{children}} with <b>Morquio’s</b> <b>disease</b> were studied by electron microscopy. The diagnosis {{was based upon}} typical clinical findings and x-ray examination. Urinary excretion of keratosulfate was abnormally high in both cases. The Kupffer cells contained large relatively electron-lucid inclusions (0. 3 to 4. 3 μ in diameter) bounded by a single membrane and containing a finely arranged protein-like precipitate. These inclusions occasionally appeared as compact bodies (figs. 2 and 3). Membranous 'myelin-like' round bodies were infrequently seen in the vacuoles. Hepatocytes were usually normal, but some contained a few electron-lucid inclusions that resembled those seen in the Kupffer cells, although they were smaller in size (0. 4 to 1. 9 μ) (fig. 5). Peribiliary dense bodies were numerous and rarely contained myelin-like figures (fig. 4). In some atypical groups of cells, discontinuous limiting membranes were observed. These cells also contained electron-lucid vacuoles bounded by single membranes of varying sizes (0. 3 to 4. 0 μ) (fig. 6). The inclusions were {{very similar to those}} previously described in different forms of gargoylism, although the site was different. The rupture of some Kupffer and/or parenchymal cell membranes, secondary to technical manipulations, apparently caused the peculiar aspect of the atypical groups of cells. Speculation: This study supplies new evidence linking <b>Morquio’s</b> <b>disease</b> and gargoylism.

40|$|AbstractGM 1 {{gangliosidosis}} and <b>Morquio</b> B <b>disease</b> {{are distinct}} disorders both clinically and biochemically yet they {{arise from the}} same β-galactosidase enzyme deficiency. On the other hand, galactosialidosis and sialidosis share common clinical and biochemical features, yet they arise from two separate enzyme deficiencies, namely, protective protein/cathepsin A and neuraminidase, respectively. However distinct, in practice these disorders overlap both clinically and biochemically so that easy discrimination between them is sometimes difficult. The principle reason for this {{may be found in}} the fact that these three enzymes form a unique complex in lysosomes that is required for their stability and posttranslational processing.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) {{results from}} a genetic {{deficiency}} of N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulfate (Gal-NAc 6 S) sulfatase. We have identified two different exonic mutations causing GalNAc 6 S sulfatase deficiency in two unrelated Japanese families, in one patient with classical <b>Morquio</b> <b>disease,</b> and in two brothers with a mild form of MPS IVA. The nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA derived from a patient with classical <b>Morquio</b> <b>disease</b> revealed a two-base deletion at nucleotide position 1343 - 1344 (1344 - 1345 or 1345 - 1346) that altered the reading frame (designated 1342 delCA). This mutation, inherited from the proband's consanguineous parents, was revealed by TaqI restriction analysis of a cDNA fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. In the proband with the mild form of the disease, a C to G transversion at nucleotide 667 predicted the substitution of Lys for Asn 204 (N 204 K). Since a new AluI site {{was created by the}} N 204 K mutation, restriction analysis indicated that the affected brothers were homozygous for this mutation, as confirmed by the finding that both their parents had this lesion.

Both epimers were evaluated as inhibitors of the human β-galactosidase: the (5 aR) -stereoisomer (compound 1) {{was found to be}} a very potent inhibitor of the enzyme (IC 50  =  8  nM, 30 × more potent than 4 -epi-isofagomine at pH 7. 3) with a high selectivity for this glycosidase whereas the (5 aS) epimer was a much weaker inhibitor.

No single, major common mutation has been associated with GM 1 gangliosidosis. However, a Trp 273 Leu mutation has been commonly found in the majority of patients with <b>Morquio</b> B <b>disease</b> defined genotypically to date. We now report three new mutations in three Morquio B patients where the Trp 273 Leu mutation is absent. Two of the mutations, C 1502 G (Asn 484 Lys) and A 1548 G (Thr 500 Ala), were found in twins (one male, one female) who display a mild form of <b>Morquio</b> B <b>disease</b> and keratan sulfate in the urine.

We found that fibroblasts taken from patients with an adult form of GM 1 -gangliosidosis and from patients with an infantile form, carrying a missense mutations in the β-galactosidase gene—mutations that caused deficiency in lysosomal β-galactosidase but not in S-Gal—assembled normal elastic fibers. In contrast, fibroblasts from two cases of infantile GM 1 -gangliosidosis that bear nonsense mutations of the β-galactosidase gene, as well as fibroblasts from four patients with Morquio B who had mutations causing deficiency in both forms of β-galactosidase, did not assemble elastic fibers. We also demonstrated that S-Gal–deficient fibroblasts from patients with either GM 1 -gangliosidosis or Morquio B can acquire the S-Gal protein, produced by coculturing of Chinese hamster ovary cells permanently transected with S-Gal cDNA, resulting in improved deposition of elastic fibers.

One patient with GM 1 gangliosidosis had a triple X syndrome. One patient with juvenile GM 1 gangliosidosis was homozygous for a mutation previously identified in Morquio type B. A patient with infantile GM 1 gangliosidosis carried a complex GLB 1 allele harbouring two genetic variants leading to p. R 68 W and p. R 109 W amino acid changes, in trans with the known p. R 148 C mutation. Molecular analysis showed 27 mutations, 9 of which are new: 5 missense, 3 microdeletions and a nonsense mutation. We also identified four new genetic variants with a predicted polymorphic nature that was further investigated by in silico analyses. Three-dimensional structural analysis of GLB 1 homology models including the new missense mutations and the p. R 68 W and p. R 109 W amino acid changes showed that all the amino acid replacements affected the resulting protein structures in different ways, from changes in polarity to folding alterations. Genetic and clinical associations led us to undertake a critical review of the classifications of late-onset GM 1 gangliosidosis and <b>Morquio</b> B <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|Human {{cathepsin}} A (also {{known as}} Protective Protein/Cathepsin A, PPCA; E. C. 3. 4. 16. 5) is a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase. Cathepsin A is {{also involved in}} a complex with two other lysosomal enzymes: lysosomal neuraminidase (NEU 1, E. C. 3. 2. 1. 18) and β-galactosidase (GLB 1, E. C. 3. 2. 1. 23). Deficiency in cathepsin A and NEU 1 result in the lysosomal storage diseases, galactosialidosis and sialidosis respectively. Deficiency in GLB 1 results in GM 1 gangliosidosis and <b>Morquio</b> B <b>diseases.</b> Cathepsin A protease activity is spatially regulated by activation of the inactive precursor form to the mature form in the lysosome. Structural studies on the mature form of cathepsin A were performed to understand the mechanism of activation. We present X-ray crystallographic, mass spectrometric, amino acid sequencing, and enzymatic data to support a cleavage-only model, involving proteolytic processing of the precursor with no conformational change required. Additionally we show that multiple cleavage sites {{on the surface of}} the protein ensure activation of cathepsin A in the lysosome. The structural results presented here point to new avenues for the design of mechanism-based inhibitors of the enzyme. NEU 1 is an exosialidase that cleaves terminal sialic acids from glycoproteins and glycolipids in the lysosome and on the cell surface highlighting its importance in cellular functions such as signal transduction and cancer metastasis pathways. NEU 1 activity is deficient in sialidosis and galactosialidosis, and there are no available treatments for both the diseases. Although the molecular basis for sialidosis and galactosialidosis is not fully understood, complex formation is proposed to be important for the activity and stability of NEU 1. In the current study we show that cathepsin A directly interacts with NEU 1 and this interaction is not required for the catalytic activity of NEU 1, instead facilitates stabilization of NEU 1. The data presented here provide new insight into the NEU 1 -cathepsin A complex. We further present a proof-of-concept study for pharmacological chaperone therapy using inhibitors targeting NEU 1 for the treatment of sialidosis and galactosialidosis...|$|R
