40|$|Abstract — An {{original}} {{approach to}} compute the longitudinal tensile break stress of multiphase composite materials with short fibers reinforcement is presented. The most obvious mechanical model which reflects a multiphase composite material is a pre-impregnated material, known as prepreg. We may include in this class of prepregs, Sheet- and Bulk <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compounds.</b> The model is seen as consisting of three phase compounds: resin, filler and fibers, model that is reduced to two phase compounds: substitute matrix and fibers. The Sheet <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compounds</b> reinforced with discontinuous and almost parallel fibers, subjected to longitudinal tensile loads, presents a specific note by {{the existence of a}} shear mechanism between fibers and matrix.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Traditionally, dough <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> (DMCs) {{have been based on}} unsaturated polyester resins (UPR), fillers and glass fibre reinforcements. Such systems however are inflammable and will emit dense, toxic smoke on combustion. Phenolic resins, on the other hand, have excellent flame retardant properties, but slightly inferior mechanical properties. Phenolic DMCs are based on mineral fillers and glass fibre reinforcements, compounded into a phenolic resol (heat cure) resin. Compounding these systems using a co-rotating twin screw extruder, instead of the traditional method using a Z-blade mixer, results in long fibre DMCs which have better mechanical properties than short fibre DMCs. In this study, a wide range of inorganic materials, their pH being one of the selection factors, have been investigated as potential phenolic DMC fillers. Viscosity measurements were carried out on resin/filler mixtures, while on the cured samples flexural and impact properties were investigated. Producing DMCs using a twin screw compounder, the effects of filler loading, types of glass fibre, glass fibre loading and machine output on flexural and impact properties were investigated.

50|$|DCPD resins are {{transformed}} using high pressure RIM equipment {{as used in}} the polyurethane industry, with some small changes to be considered.

The tools or moulds are closed tools and are being clamped using a hydraulic press.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{of the effect of}} polyester resin structural parameters on the mechanical properties of sheet <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> has been carried out. The investigation involved the synthesis and mechanical testing of a series of unsaturated polyester resins and the incorporation of these resins into sheet <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> (SMC) with their subsequent testing. Two main structural parameters were varied, firstly the degree of unsaturation of the resin (i. e. maleic:phthalic ratio), and secondly the amount of diol excess added to the reaction vessel during the resin synthesis thereby varying the hydroxyl value of the resin. It was found that the properties of the resins, both structural and mechanical, were interdependent. Altering the maleic:phthalic ratio was found to effect the hydroxyl value, notch sensitivity, shrinkage, and modulus of the resin. Low resin hydroxyl values were found to give SMC with low tensile strength and low fracture toughness. Unusually high hydroxyl values enhanced the toughness but the SMC did not show the expected increase in tensile strength. Surprisingly the toughness of SMC appears insensitive to the notch sensitivity of the resins despite the relatively wide range of resins used and their range of notch sensitivities. It was concluded that debonding was the predominant mechanism by which failure occurred in these composites and that the bond strength was enhanced by the use of a matrix resin with a suitably high hydroxyl value. A high hydroxyl value being dependent on the dial excess and the maleic:phthalic ratio of the resin...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Sheet <b>Moulding</b> <b>Compounds</b> (ASMC) and {{unidirectional}} (UD) prepregs {{have been}} co-compression moulded {{to form a}} hybrid composite material. In-mould flow influences the UD fibre architecture in two ways.

When the UD fibres are aligned with the ASMC flow direction, ply migration takes place. In general, the composite stiffness follows a rule of mixtures relationship, with the stiffness proportional to the UD fibre content. A grid analysis method has been developed to quantify distortion in the UD plies. Staging the resin to 50...|$|R
