5|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical <b>mowers,</b> at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the <b>mowers,</b> although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn <b>mowers,</b> high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 Dion, {{after being}} {{discharged}} from the army, was among those selected to help replace Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Johnny <b>Mowers</b> of the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings, who had enlisted in the army to fight in World War II. He played a total of 38 NHL games with the Red Wings between 1943 and 1945, exiting the league {{with a record of}} 23–11–4 and having allowed 119 goals. He recorded a 15–0 shutout against the New York Rangers on January 23, 1944, two days before being {{signed as a free agent}} with Detroit. This remains, as of 2015, the most lopsided shutout in NHL history. He also took part in all five of Detroit's games in the 1944 Stanley Cup playoffs, where the Red Wings were eliminated four games to one in the opening round by the eventual runner-up, the Chicago Black Hawks. Dion spent much of the 1944–45 season, meanwhile, with the Red Wings' AHL affiliate Indianapolis Capitals. In August 1945, after the Red Wings decided to replace <b>Mowers</b> permanently with Harry Lumley, Dion was traded to the St. Louis Flyers of the AHL, and then to the league's Buffalo Bisons just over two months later. He remained with the Bisons through 1951 and won the Harry Hap Holmes Memorial Award in 1950, given annually to goaltenders with the lowest goals-against average in the AHL. He was also selected to the league's Second All-Star Team three times.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands.

Arbroath {{is believed to be the}} source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, three of the Bruins' best forwards decided to join the Royal Canadian Air Force midway through the 1941–42 season. These three forwards made up the Kraut Line, {{one of the best}} lines in the NHL. Despite missing three of their best players, the Bruins managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals the next season. In the finals, they were eliminated by the Red Wings, four games to none. Due to his play in the regular season, Brimsek was again named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. However, it was popular opinion at the time that Brimsek deserved the spot on the First All-Star Team over Johnny <b>Mowers,</b> including Mowers' own coach and general manager, Jack Adams.|$|E

One of thirteen children, Dion got his start as a goaltender with the Junior Verdun Maple Leafs in 1937 and had his first full season as a senior with the team the following year. After several seasons in the Quebec Senior and Professional Hockey Leagues, he was recruited by the Red Wings in 1943 as a potential replacement for Johnny <b>Mowers,</b> who had enlisted to fight in World War II.

5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that the bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over the bypass and the highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} the bypass opened, without connections to the under-construction bypass, in April and May 2009, respectively. The roundabout at the northern end of the bypass opened when the bypass opened to traffic on August 6, 2009. To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat, MDSHA installed tunnels under the bypass for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the bypass rather than remove them with mechanical <b>mowers.</b> Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the bypass opened.|$|E
5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue. The main cause of the decline is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical <b>mowers.</b> Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Drained and fertilised silage fields are less suitable for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area.|$|E

40|$|In a {{remarkable}} number oF his poetical pieces, Andrew Marvell introduces {{a complex and}} mysterious Figure, the <b>Mower.</b> By replacing the simple shepherd-lover with the aggressive and mystiFying <b>Mower,</b> Marvell departs From the pastoral tradition. 1 Instead oF the shepherd­ lover who lives in pleasant idleness, Marvell concentrates on the <b>Mower</b> who must labor under exacting conditions, both physical and emotional. Correspondingly, the <b>Mower</b> seizes the imagination oF the reader with his ambivalent position in relation to Nature: the <b>Mower</b> is both allied with, and alienated From, Nature. 2 On the one hand, the <b>Mower</b> remains very close to Nature, For Nature is responsible For his livelihood. On the other hand, this unusual Figure, by cutting the grass, {{appears to be in}} conFlict with Nature in exercising the power to manipulate the course oF natural occurrences, that is, the growing oF natural things. With his scythe the <b>Mower</b> can destroy what Nature creates and nurtures, and yet, by destroying the overgrown weeds and grasses, he allows Nature to regain order and balance. Thus, the <b>Mower</b> is both Friend and enemy to Nature, and this Fluctuating oF his roles enables Marvell to develop a Far more serious image oF the <b>Mower</b> than is possible through the more limited role oF the traditional shepherd-lover...|$|R
