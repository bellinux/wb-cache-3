Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents.

2500|$|Free-range {{poultry farming}} allows {{chickens}} to roam freely {{for a period}} of the day, although they are usually confined in sheds at night to protect them from predators or kept indoors if the weather is particularly bad. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that a free-range chicken must have day-time access to open-air runs during at least half of its life. Unlike in the United States, this definition also applies to free-range egg laying hens. The European Union regulates marketing standards for egg farming which specifies a <b>minimum</b> <b>condition</b> for free-range eggs that [...] "hens have continuous daytime access to open-air runs, except in the case of temporary restrictions imposed by veterinary authorities". The RSPCA [...] "Welfare standards for laying hens and pullets" [...] indicates that the stocking rate must not exceed 1,000 birds per hectare (10 m2 per hen) of range available and a minimum area of overhead shade/shelter of 8 m2 per 1,000 hens must be provided.|$|E

The Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) satellites are equiped with two Lyman-α line-of-sight Detectors (LADs) each. Since during the past solar <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> the relevant solar control parameters practically did not vary, we are using LAD data between June and September 2008 to create a time averaged hydrogen geocorona model representative for these solar <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this averaged model we assume that the H-geocorona is longitudinally symmetric with respect to the earth-sun line. We find a 3 -dimensional H-density distribution in the range from 3 to 8 earth radii which with some caution can also be extrapolated to larger distances. For lower geocentric distances than 3 earth radii a best fitting r-dependent Chamberlain (1963) -like model is adapted. Main findings are larger than conventionally expected H-densities at heights above 5 RE and a pronounced day-to-night side H-density asymmetry. The H-geocorona presented here should serve as a reference H-atmosphere for the earth during solar <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} develop the control scheme, {{the rest of the}} paper is {{organized}} as follows. Line loss <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> are deduced in Section  2. In Section  3, based on the deduced constrained line loss <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions,</b> system security enhancement with minimum increase of line loss is tackled by solving a much reduced OPF problem. Procedures to solve the OPF problem using PMU measurements are also proposed. The control scheme is designed in Section  4 to integrate the OPF calculation results for enhancing system security with the dynamic controller for line loss minimization. The case study in Section  5 proves the validity of the proposed control strategies, and conclusions are made in Section  6.|$|R
