Commercially available rotors, however, stain {{not only the}} cell membrane, but also bind to tubulin and migrate into the cytoplasm. We synthesized molecules related to 9 -(dicyanovinyl) -julolidine (DCVJ), which featured hydrocarbon chains of different length to increase membrane compatibility. Results: Longer hydrocarbon chains attached to the fluorescent rotor reduce the migration of the dye into the cytoplasm and internal compartments of the cell. The amplitude of the fluorescence response to fluid shear stress, known to decrease <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity,</b> is {{significantly higher than the}} response obtained from DCVJ.

40|$|We derived {{free energy}} {{functional}} of a bilayer lipid membrane {{from the first}} principles of elasticity theory. The model explicitly includes position-dependent mutual slide of monolayers and bending deformation. Our free energy functional of liquid-crystalline membrane allows for incompressibility of the membrane and vanishing of the in-plane shear modulus and obeys reflectional and rotational symmetries of the flat bilayer. Interlayer slide at the mid-plane of the membrane results in local difference of surface densities of the monolayers. The slide amplitude directly enters free energy via the strain tensor. For small bending deformations the ratio between bending modulus and area compression coefficient, Kb/KA, {{is proportional to the}} square of monolayer thickness, h. Using the functional we performed self-consistent calculation of steric potential acting on bilayer between parallel confining walls separated by distance 2 d. We found that temperature-dependent curvature at the minimum of confining potential is enhanced four times for a bilayer with slide as compared with a unit bilayer. We also calculate viscous modes of bilayer membrane between confining walls. Pure bending of the membrane is investigated, which is decoupled from area dilation at small amplitudes. Three sources of viscous dissipation are considered: water and <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosities</b> and interlayer drag. Dispersion has two branches.

Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that have been shown to exhibit viscosity sensitive DLPC liposomes were formed with the molecular rotor FCVJ incorporated into the membrane. A cuvette with liposomes was excited at 460 nm under fluorescent spectroscopy and intensity values were recorded. The procedure was repeated for a 2 % cyclohexane/sucrose solution. Peak emissions were compared and the cyclohexane fluidized the membrane resulting in a statistically significant reduction in intensity. To achieve a converse effect, a 20 % (v/v) Cholesterol/DLPC mixture was used to produce liposomes in the presence of sucrose solution. Intensity values were compared to those of the control group for the cyclohexane experiments. The intensity values for the cholesterol group were higher than control. The liposomes used in this experiment are a suitable model for the mammalian cell membrane in both size and physical similarities.

We treated the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton as two distinct components and developed a unique whole-cell model of the RBC, using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The model is validated by comparing the predicted results with measurements from four different and independent experiments. First, we simulated the micropipette aspiration and quantified the cytoskeletal deformation. Second, we studied the membrane fluctuations of healthy RBCs and RBCs parasitized to different intraerythrocytic stages by the malaria-inducing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Third, we subjected the RBC to shear flow and investigated the dependence of its tank-treading frequency on shear rate. Finally, we simulated the bilayer–cytoskeletal detachment in channel flow to quantify the strength of such interactions when the corresponding bonds break. Taken together, these experiments and corresponding systematic DPD simulations probe the governing constitutive response of the cytoskeleton, elastic stiffness, viscous friction, and strength of bilayer–cytoskeletal interactions as well as <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosities.</b> Hence, the DPD simulations and comparisons with available independent experiments serve as validation of the unique two-component model and lead to useful insights into the biomechanical {{interactions between the}} lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton of the RBC.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of {{a portion of}} erythrocyte during aspirational entry into a micropipette has been analyzed {{on the basis of}} a constant area {{deformation of}} an infinite plane membrane into a cylindrical tube. Consideration of the equilibrium of the membrane at the tip of the pipette has generated the relation between the aspirated length and the dimensionless time during deformational entry as well as during relaxation after the removal of aspiration pressure. Experimental studies on deformation and relaxation of normal human erythrocytes were performed with the use of micropipettes and a video dimension analyzer which allowed the continuous recording of the time-courses. The deformation consisted of an initial rapid phase with a <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity</b> (range 0. 6 x 10 (- 4) to 4 x 10 (- 4) dyn. s/cm) varying inversely with the degree of deformation and a later slow phase with a high <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity</b> (mean 2. 06 x 10 (- 2) dyn. s/cm) which was not correlated with the degree of deformation.

For the transport of tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr) /toluene mixtures through the PAN/PDMS membrane the phenomena are more complex. The system is non-ideal and no osmotic phenomena are observed.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of intracellular hemoglobin concentration on red cell viscoelasticity and to better understand changes related to in vivo aging, membrane shear elastic moduli (mu) and time constants for cell shape recovery (tc) were measured for age-fractionated human erythrocytes and derived ghosts. Time constants were also measured for osmotically shrunk cell fractions. Young and old cells had equal mu, but tc was longer for older cells. When young cells were shrunk to equal the volume (and hence hemoglobin concentration and internal viscosity) of old cells, tc increased only slightly. Thus <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity</b> (eta = mu. tc) increases during aging, regardless of increased internal viscosity. However, further shrinkage of young cells, or slight shrinkage of old cells, caused {{a sharp increase in}} tc. Because this increased tc is not explainable by elevated internal viscosity, eta increased, possibly due to a concentration-dependent hemoglobin-membrane interaction. Ghosts had a greater mu than intact cells, with proportionally faster tc; their <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity</b> was therefore similar to intact cells. However, the ratio of old/young <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity</b> was less for ghosts than for intact cells, indicating that differences between young and old cell eta may be partly explained by altered hemoglobin-membrane interaction during aging.

The most common methods to measure changes in <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity</b> are fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence anisotropy. Recent interest {{in a group of}} viscosity sensitive fluorophores, termed molecular rotors, {{led to the development of}} the highly membrane-compatible (2 -carboxy- 2 -cyanovinyl) -julolidine farnesyl ester (FCVJ). The purpose of this study is to examine the fluorescent behavior of FCVJ in model membranes exposed to various agents of known influence on <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity,</b> such as alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), cyclohexane, cholesterol, and nimesulide. The influence of key agents (propanol and cholesterol) was also examined using FRAP, and backcalculated viscosity change from FCVJ and FRAP was correlated. A decrease of FCVJ emission was found with alcohol treatment (with a strong dependency on the chain length and concentration), DMSO, and cyclohexane, whereas cholesterol and nimesulide led to increased FCVJ emission. With the exception of nimesulide, FCVJ intensity changes were consistent with expected changes in <b>membrane</b> <b>viscosity.</b> A comparison of viscosity changes computed from FRAP and FCVJ led to a very good correlation between the two experimental methods.

40|$|Abstract only availableMembrane tethers play a {{critical}} role in cell adhesion and cell motility. This can be observed in the arrest of neutrophils on the endothelial wall of blood vessels during inflammatory response. Tethers are employed to slow down neutrophils when they are attracted to the periphery of the vessels due to chemotactic gradients set up by cytokines. As a result of slowing down, the neutrophil has time to form specific bonds with endothelial cells and start extravasating from the circulatory system into the surrounding tissue. Metastasizing cancer cells use a similar mechanism. A wide array of factors affects the mechanical characteristics of tethers. A major contribution is provided by the interaction between the cytoskeleton and the membrane. Interbilayer slip and the interaction between the membrane and the glycocalix are additional determinants of tether properties. Previous studies have shown a strong dependence of force needed to extract and pull a tether on the interaction between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. It has also been shown that disrupting the integrity of the cytoskeleton significantly reduces the tether force. The focus of this study was to further elucidate the contribution of the cytoskeleton-lipid bilayer interaction to the tether force, in particular how it affects cell <b>membrane</b> surface <b>viscosity.</b> Atomic Force Microscopy based force spectroscopy was used to determine the tether force and surface <b>viscosity</b> of the <b>membrane</b> prior and after the actin microfilament system had been depolyermerized by latrunculin-A.
