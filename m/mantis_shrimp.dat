5|$|Within the Malacostraca, no fossils {{are known}} for krill, while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain {{important}} groups that are now extinct as well as extant members (Hoplocarida: <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> are extant, while Aeschronectida are extinct; Phyllopoda: Canadaspidida are extinct, while Leptostraca are extant). Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp.</b> In the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish. The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Malacostraca is {{the largest}} of the six classes of crustaceans, {{containing}} about 40,000 living species, divided among 16 orders. Its members, the malacostracans, display a great diversity of body forms and include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, woodlice, amphipods, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> and many other, less familiar animals. They are abundant in all marine environments and have colonised freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are segmented animals, united by a common body plan comprising 20 body segments (rarely 21), and divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E

5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp,</b> skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50â€“60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

50|$|O. scyllarus {{is one of}} the larger, more {{colourful}} <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps</b> commonly seen, {{ranging in}} size from 3 to 18 cm. They are primarily green in colour, with orange legs and leopard-like spots on the anterior carapace.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mantis</b> <b>shrimps</b> make up over 15 {{percent of}} their diet. Crabs {{are the most common}} item on their diet, and fishes like Bluehead Wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum; Boga, Inermia vittata; {{goatfishes}} and small morays are included.3 Preferably, shrimps and octopuses.|$|R
25|$|In Hawaii, some <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{have grown}} unusually {{large in the}} very dirty water of the Grand Ala Wai Canal in Waikiki. The usual dangers {{associated}} with consuming seafood caught in contaminated waters still applies to <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp.</b>|$|E
25|$|The eyes of <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> may {{enable them}} to {{recognise}} different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as barracuda, which have shimmering scales. Alternatively, {{the manner in which}} <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp,</b> which are stomatopod crustaceans, {{including}} Lysiosquillina glabriuscula, have yellow fluorescent markings along their antennal scales and carapace (shell) that males present during threat displays to predators and other males. The display involves raising {{the head and}} thorax, spreading the striking appendages and other maxillipeds, and extending the prominent, oval antennal scales laterally, which makes the animal appear larger and accentuates its yellow fluorescent markings. Furthermore, as depth increases, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> fluorescence accounts for a greater part of the visible light available. During mating rituals, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.|$|E
50|$|Squilla empusa {{is mainly}} nocturnal and feeds on fish, shrimps, crabs, krill, worms, {{molluscs}} and other <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps.</b> The raptorial claws are unfolded with great rapidity to spear, slash and immobilise the prey, which is brought {{back inside the}} burrow when caught.|$|R
40|$|Mushroom {{bodies are}} the iconic {{learning}} and memory centers of insects. No previously described crustacean possesses a mushroom body {{as defined by}} strict morphological criteria although crustacean centers called hemiellipsoid bodies, which serve functions in sensory integration, have been viewed as evolutionarily convergent with mushroom bodies. Here, using key identifiers to characterize neural arrangements, we demonstrate insect-like mushroom bodies in stomatopod crustaceans (<b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps).</b> More than any other crustacean taxon, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps</b> display sophisticated behaviors relating to predation, spatial memory, and visual recognition {{comparable to those of}} insects. However, neuroanatomy-based cladistics suggesting close phylogenetic proximity of insects and stomatopod crustaceans conflicts with genomic evidence showing hexapods closely related to simple crustaceans called remipedes. We discuss whether corresponding anatomical phenotypes described here reflect the cerebral morphology of a common ancestor of Pancrustacea or an extraordinary example of convergent evolution...|$|R
50|$|Inertial {{cavitation}} is {{the process}} where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps</b> and pistol shrimps, {{as well as in}} the vascular tissues of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in control valves, pumps, propellers and impellers.|$|R

2500|$|Called [...] "sea locusts" [...] {{by ancient}} Assyrians, [...] "prawn killers" [...] in Australia and now {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "thumb splitters"â€“ because of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiouslyâ€“ <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps</b> sport powerful claws that are used to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismembering. In captivity, some larger species can break through aquarium glass.|$|R
25|$|During mating rituals, <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{actively}} fluoresce, and {{the wavelength}} of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments. Females are only fertile during certain {{phases of the}} tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> information {{about the size of}} the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, the <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{is known}} as tatampal, hipong-dapa, or alupihang-dagat, and is cooked and eaten like any other shrimp.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the nervous}} shark {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, crabs, and <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps)</b> and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark is also known to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite {{of the nervous}} shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|R

25|$|The live {{rock with}} <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> burrows are {{actually}} considered useful by {{some in the}} marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It {{is not uncommon for}} a piece of live rock to convey a live <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimp</b> are a foot long, {{and have}} bulging eyes, a {{flattened}} tail and formidable claws equipped with clubs or sharp spikes, {{which it can}} use to knock out its opponents.|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as <b>mantis</b> <b>shrimps,</b> are carnivores.|$|R
50|$|In the West Indies, Bothus lunatus largely {{feeds on}} fishes, {{which make up}} 85.7% of its diet by volume, and {{particularly}} on herrings in the genus Jenkinsia and the bigeye scad (Selar crumenophthalmus).
