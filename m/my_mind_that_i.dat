5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|For 60 days, my {{body was}} used as a {{thoroughfare}} for all the hoodlums, militia men and soldiers in the district... Those men completely destroyed me; they caused me so much pain. They raped me in front of my six children... Three years ago, I discovered I had HIV/AIDS. There is no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was infected during these rapes.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the series that Duchovny wrote by himself. He had {{previously}} co-developed the stories for the second season episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "Anasazi" [...] - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes [...] "Avatar" [...] and [...] "Talitha Cumi". As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the confidence in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could write a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." [...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E
60|$|Then I fainted, and as I did so it {{flashed through}} <b>my</b> darkening <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was passing {{down into the}} last {{oblivion}} of death.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no result as yet--except, of course, the calmer {{state of}} <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have {{committed}} our case into our Father's hands." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took her}} hand and held it. The thought flashed into <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{released}} <b>that</b> hand the last tie between Sylvia and myself would be broken.|$|R
2500|$|I {{was under}} no {{illusion}} {{that it was}} going to be [...] a financial catastrophe—to say the least—this year. That was not even remotely in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to walk in there and make any money this year.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, Roh {{reconciled}} with Kim when he endorsed his candidacy in the 1997 Presidential election. At the meeting, Kim Dae-jung welcomed Roh {{and his party}} saying [...] "Today is a very pleasant day. That pleasure is not only because we now work together, but also because I could relieve a burden in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been carrying (since we separated)." [...] Roh returned to office in 1998, when Lee Myung-bak resigned his seat because of a violation of election law, winning {{a seat in the}} ensuing by-election.|$|E
2500|$|Referring to {{widespread}} doubt that Labor {{could win the}} 2007 election under a leader who had already lost two elections, Beazley said: [...] "There's no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can lead a winning team in the next election. The road to the prime ministership of this nation is a long and hard road. It's not an easy one. And there are many twists and turns on that road. I'm in my 25th year {{as a member of}} the Federal Parliament and I know this: public opinion is volatile and it can change." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> till <b>I</b> was of age I {{would go}} on studying, {{and at the same}} time see {{something}} of the world and of society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{a servant}} of the Gods, noble Antony. That which the Gods put in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> must <b>I</b> say; nor can I read their meaning," [...] I {{answered}} humbly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, Mr. Gerard, not ill. A little low in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that's</b> all. <b>I</b> don't {{mean to be}} rude, sir--pray be kinder to me than ever! pray let me be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|A fear crossed <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had shown}} myself too suddenly. I {{advanced}} {{a few steps}} towards her. I said gently, [...] "Rachel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could only}} gasp. For one brief moment the thought rushed through <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would {{denounce}} {{him to the}} police for [...] . for [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "He has blessed mine errand," [...] {{said his}} daughter, rising from her knees, [...] "and it is borne in upon <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall prosper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{had always}} thought it to mean Mary, sir,' I answered, growing {{somewhat}} red, convinced as I was in <b>my</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{on the threshold of}} a decisive explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I took an oath, mademoiselle," [...] she said, smiling, [...] "and I {{wanted to}} stamp it on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might keep it faithfully. And I will! Adieu, mademoiselle!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{proposed}} to take Macomber's {{place at the}} window, {{and if it was}} possible to see Darius inside, there was no question in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could contrive to attract his attention.|$|R
60|$|I {{strove to}} put such {{thoughts}} from <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might leave it {{free to do}} the work to which I had now vowed myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have made}} up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not your wife! I belong to him--I sacramentally joined myself to him for life. Nothing can alter it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Hearing {{this and}} not knowing what was meant, it came into <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was to be turned adrift in a boat and there left to starve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Ozma, [...] "I {{suppose you}} know what is in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am seeking a way to prevent any one in the future from {{discovering}} the Land of Oz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Fentolin," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have been}} a good many years making up <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> Now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have done so, I do not think that any one will keep Esther from me." ...|$|R
60|$|I stood gazing {{after him}} until he {{disappeared}} through the doorway, and then started off for home, revolving in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had heard, and more particularly this last outburst of the occult philosopher.|$|R
60|$|Exactly who Nicholas Weaver was I did not know, {{though it}} ran in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had heard this name {{mentioned}} {{by my father}} during the trial.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} at all. But I will never say any such word to her,--unless I make up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can afford to marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Robert {{turned away}} with a whistle. [...] "'Fore God!" [...] said he, [...] "it is in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> carry some hard men with me to Brittany." ...|$|E
60|$|That, then, is the {{substance}} of what I would fain say convincingly, if it might be, to my girl friends; at all events with certainty in <b>my</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was thus far a safe guide to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am set in <b>my</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> get learning. I see not how, but my [...] will is strong, {{and mother}} hopes for {{to make a}} scholar of me. So, [...] please God, we shall do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Kemp, {{prompted}} by a nudge in the ribs, assented. [...] "It's wonderful how they took it all in about me," [...] he said; [...] "but I feel certain in <b>my</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to chuck some money about." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} to say him nay, when it came into <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had nothing to do, and that perhaps I might learn {{something}} from this gossip.|$|E
6000|$|Grace seated herself, {{and then}} began her speech very quickly. [...] "Miss Prettyman," [...] she said, [...] "I have made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will go home, if you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is all true,' said Caldigate; 'and I {{have made}} up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will be angry with no one who will begin to believe me {{innocent}} from this day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I may {{not make}} up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> way. <b>I</b> don't know it myself. Perhaps it's all a dream, and soon I shall wake up, and Oh Dear {{will come in and}} tell me how soundly and long I have slept." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{never entered}} <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> anyone <b>I</b> knew could ever {{by any chance}} meet an author, or even hear one lecture--although {{it was said that}} they did {{sometimes}} come west on altruistic educational journeys and that they sometimes reached our county town.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} worse than childish to {{complain}} when no good could come from uttering peevish words, and I strove to put from <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> desired, by speaking of Archie, idly wondering where he might be.|$|R
