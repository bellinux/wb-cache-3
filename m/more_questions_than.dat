5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the report caused a sensation in Ireland, {{as shown by the}} political and media reaction. It is generally agreed that the report raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered and that it opened up new avenues of inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. Of that, gentlemen, {{there can}} be no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> <b>than</b> there is about Vesuvius {{standing}} up {{at the head of the}} Bay, smoking like a brick-kiln. That was Captain Rule's sole a'r'n'd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--not very; oh yes, I'm well--" [...] She {{had begun}} {{to move forward with}} the last question, and he found himself walking with her.

30|$|Questions {{asked by}} the adults are {{sometimes}} WH- Questions, in some cases ‘how’ and ‘why’ Questions, but often closed Questions that predict a one-word answer. Even for the trained teachers in our data set, 71 % of Questions are closed (Thwaite & McKay 2013). In the focus lessons, Mrs Edgar asks <b>more</b> closed <b>Questions</b> <b>than</b> Sara; {{many of these are}} dk 1 s (already discussed above). In comparison to the other adults, the teachers ask <b>more</b> <b>Questions</b> and their <b>Questions</b> are <b>more</b> varied. The teachers also ask <b>more</b> ‘why’ <b>Questions</b> <b>than</b> the other adults, such as, “What’s holding this wall up? I wonder why there's sand in it, falling down.” and, “What's holding that door on? I wonder why the door won't fall off the building.” (both from Sara).|$|R
25|$|Human Rights Watch {{likewise}} {{called for}} an independent international inquiry, saying that the IDF's report did not explain the attack, that it in effect raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered, and that contradicted eyewitness accounts of the timing, which denied legitimate military targets were around the building.|$|E
25|$|Nickell {{contends that}} the pirate theory raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answers. He contends that a journey into Kentucky was a {{dangerous}} undertaking, and that Swift {{could just as easily}} set up a clandestine coining operation in the backwoods of Virginia or aboard his ship. He also questions why Swift would take the time to produce such a detailed journal to cover his story.|$|E
25|$|England's second innings batting {{effort was}} an {{improvement}} on the first, but still left people with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers. Andrew Strauss was out for 0, Michael Vaughan looked brilliant for 21 runs but then edged Makhaya Ntini through to Mark Boucher. Alastair Cook scored a decent score of 60, {{but not enough}} to get England out of trouble. Kevin Pietersen came in for the most criticism, scoring 13 runs of 4 balls before edging through to the keeper off the bowling of Jacques Kallis.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Medwin's legacy {{tends to}} raise <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers. Was he a chancer who lived beyond his means and ruined {{his father and}} wife? He tended to fall out with former {{associates}} including Shelley's widow and Trelawney. His writings on Byron and Shelley are often imprecise. Shelley's fame grew throughout the 19th century and his legacy became an obsession for Medwin as for others in the Pisan circle. Medwin was opportunistic and disregarded the feelings of many former friends, but he remains {{the main source of}} information on Shelley's childhood. His Conversations of Lord Byron is now seen generally as vivid and essentially a true picture of the man.|$|E
25|$|A {{mental health}} care {{navigator}} is an individual who assists patients and families to find appropriate {{mental health care}}givers, facilities and services. Individuals who are care navigators are often also trained therapists and doctors. The need for mental health care navigators arises from the fragmentation of the mental health industry, which can often leave those in need with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers. Care navigators work closely with patients through discussion and collaboration to provide information on options and referrals to healthcare professionals, facilities, and organizations specializing in the patients’ needs. The difference between other mental health professionals and a care navigator is that a care navigator provides information and directs a patient to the best help rather than offering diagnosis, prescription of medications or treatment.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Kenneth Nguyen from The Age commented [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist', {{is perhaps}} the most complex, confronting installment thus far of a series that prides itself on being complex and confronting." [...] The reporter went on to praise the [...] "expertly scripted" [...] reveal and thought Diane Ruggiero's [...] "command of the tightrope high-school milieu seems pretty much spot-on. It is Ruggiero's resolution of the mystery, however, that will keep fans talking. Like the best resolutions, I suppose, it raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whoever it was, I hope {{we shall}} {{meet him at}} the Picnic!" [...] said Lady Muriel. [...] "It's a far <b>more</b> {{interesting}} <b>question</b> <b>than</b> 'Isn't this a picturesque ruin?' Aren't those autumn-tints lovely?' I shall have to answer those two questions ten times, at least, this afternoon!" ...|$|R
50|$|If the {{contestant}} answered <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> correctly <b>than</b> Stein, the contestant won {{the entire}} $5,000 grand prize that Stein had {{put into the}} bank {{at the beginning of}} the show. If Stein answered <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> correctly, the contestant kept only the money won in the first two rounds. If the round ended in a tie, the contestant won an additional $1,000.|$|R

500|$|Other {{critics were}} more mixed or {{negative}}, with many criticizing the negative reveal {{of the feminist}} Lilith House. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV thought that the episode raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered: such as [...] " [...] seem to accept that several rapes were faked, and then Veronica seems to just leave without that question being answered," [...] arguing that the abrupt ending to the scene constituted an out-of-character moment (she should have acted more negatively). In addition, he criticized Bell's performance, commenting [...] "Speaking of Veronica, she seemed like she was on something tonight. Just outright acting silly-odd, dancing around with some pretty lame jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} in Madrid, and Clarke's love of theatrics, raised awkward {{questions about his}} sexuality. His arrest was somewhat hushed up at the time, which may have raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it prevented. There {{is no indication that}} Clarke was homosexual. He was involved in two bad relationships with women. In 1922 he met a Slavic woman called Nina in Wiesbaden, but she disappeared after Clarke smuggled currency to her friend in Bulgaria. Then in the late 1920s a woman in Sussex, who [...] "meant everything in the world" [...] to him, refused an offer of marriage. He often claimed to hate children and never married. Despite this Clarke was known for having beautiful female acquaintances, to whom his friends referred as [...] "Dudley's Duchesses".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
60|$|Women are, one may say, the {{foundation}} of his art. They are Russian of course. Never was a writer so profoundly, so whole-souledly national. But for non-Russian readers, Turgenev's Russia is but a canvas on which the incomparable artist of humanity lays his colours and his forms in the great light and the free air of the world. Had he invented them all and also every stick and stone, brook and hill and field in which they move, his personages {{would have been just}} as true and as poignant in their perplexed lives. They are his own and also universal. Any one can accept them with no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> <b>than</b> one accepts the Italians of Shakespeare.|$|R

500|$|American singer-songwriter Johnny Nash {{created a}} cover of [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] for his {{eleventh}} studio album, I Can See Clearly Now (1972). It was first used as the B-side to his previous single, [...] "There Are <b>More</b> <b>Questions</b> <b>Than</b> Answers", which was also released in 1972, and was produced by Nash. Rita Marley, Bob's wife, was upset that JAD Records lent the track for Nash to cover, as the label [...] "wanted to make a star out of Johnny Nash, not of Bob Marley". Additionally, Steve Sullivan (author of Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 1) incorrectly claimed that Marley was commissioned to write [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] solely for Nash. However, Sullivan also writes {{that the success of}} Nash's version allotted Marley enough money to start his own record label, which he had always wanted to do. The label was eventually created and became known as Tuff Gong.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} launched {{several new}} rounds of conjecture, and ultimately raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were {{founded on the}} assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An Army Corps of Engineers hydrologist noted that the bills had disintegrated in a [...] "rounded" [...] fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried. That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see Later developments above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.|$|E
500|$|... "Flesh and Stone" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Daniel Martin gave the episode a positive review on The Guardian guardian.co.uk, {{saying that it}} [...] "can lay credible claim to being the greatest episode of Doctor Who there has ever been". He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's face as he realises {{he is going to}} have to leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance". IGN's Matt Wales gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it was [...] "packed with huge, iconic moments" [...] and stated, [...] "by the end of it, we were left with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers and a far better sense of Moffat's meticulous planning".|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>question,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{anything}} else, {{shows how}} long you've been away, Jenny. It would be family--family, with a judicious {{mixture of the}} others, and with money." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the first}} day that Man {{stared up at the}} stars and saw other worlds, there has been no <b>more</b> {{haunting}} <b>question</b> <b>than</b> this: What will we find there?

Will we find, on some distant, frozen planet, an alien life of unimaginable horror? ...|$|R
40|$|Whenever the {{constitutional}} {{relationship between the}} Houses of Parliament in a Westminster system and the courts is called into question, the answer is often not as clear as one would like.

Sometimes, they leave <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> unanswered <b>than</b> first raised...|$|R
500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} nothing. Here he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{the episode}} was {{promoted}} {{with the promise}} of answering questions, it caused increased media speculation. With the conclusion of [...] "One Son", many critics applauded the way the series was able to wrap up the Syndicate arc. A.M. Jamison of the Dayton Daily News wrote that [...] "'One Son' ends dramatically, drawing to a close one quest and opening a new set of challenges not only for Mulder but the Earth as well". Noel Holston and Justin of the Star Tribune awarded the episode four stars out of five, noting that it answered even <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> [...] "Two Fathers". They also applauded the familial bonds that held the episode together. However, some critics felt that the answers were slightly rushed. Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "Mr. Carter and his co-writer Frank Spotnitz have a wonderfully indirect way of setting up dramatic situations and an unbelievably shorthand way of resolving them".|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "Further Instructions" [...] was [...] "an entertaining hour of television. The episode certainly offers {{its fair share}} of excitement, but as with any typical Lost episode we are presented with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers". Carabott also called it an improvement over the preceding episode, [...] "The Glass Ballerina." [...] Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine expressed relief in having Locke [...] "back to the way we fondly remember him--as a wide-eyed, knife-wielding, face-smeared madman", but disliked his flashbacks, calling them a [...] "largely under-developed affair". Dignan was also pleased to have Hurley back at the camp and referred to him as [...] "someone [...] will keep the show grounded", but concluded his review by unhappily noting the sudden emergence of Nikki and Paulo as [...] "a colossal misjudgment on the producers' part" [...] and [...] "a dangerous precedent that bears keeping an eye on." ...|$|E
