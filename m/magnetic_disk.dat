40|$|Abstract Compared with {{traditional}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks,</b> Flash memory has many advantages {{and has been}} used as external storage media for a wide spectrum of electronic devices (such as PDA, MP 3, Digital Camera and Mobile Phone) in recent years.

In this paper we explore problems of indexing flash-resided data and present a new dynamical hash index for flash memory in two schemas.

25|$|In 1972, Stephen Bernard Dorsey, Founder and President of Canadian company Automatic Electronic Systems (AES), {{introduced}} the world’s first programmable word processor {{with a video}} screen.

25|$|In {{the case}} of an axially-symmetric magnet {{spinning}} at constant velocity, the distribution of the magnetic field intensity B of the magnet is constant with time, even after accounting for the relativistic corrections to B, and therefore by the Maxwell–Faraday equation the electric field induced by the rotation of the magnet is curl-free, which is caused purely by length contraction of the electric fields of its constituting subatomic particles. This means that in this particular example with a rotating <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> and a stationary conducting disk, the induced electric field cannot be described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation, which describes the curl of the electric field induced by a changing magnetic flux density.|$|E

In our benchmarks, we show that early generation SSD suffer from write amplification, and will, because of that, have problems achieving good performance on random write operations. By introducing a log-based file system, we see that we can remove the effect of write amplification received by random write operations, and give us a more stable perfor- mance. We discuss, and benchmark, possible alternatives for optimizing existing applications for <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks,</b> by introducing SSDs, as an alter- native to <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> as storage device.
