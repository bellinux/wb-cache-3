5|$|Philip Seymour Hoffman. Luis Guzmán is also {{considered}} an Anderson regular. Hoffman acted in Anderson's first four films {{as well as}} The Master. Except for Paul F. Tompkins, Kevin Breznahan, and Jim Meskimen, who all had equally minor roles in <b>Magnolia,</b> There Will Be Blood had an entirely new cast. Anderson {{is one of three}} directors – the others being Jim Sheridan and Martin Scorsese – with whom Daniel Day-Lewis has collaborated more than once. Robert Elswit has been cinematographer for all of Anderson's films except The Master which was shot by Mihai Mălaimare Jr. Jon Brion served as composer for Hard Eight, <b>Magnolia,</b> and Punch-Drunk Love, and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead for There Will Be Blood, The Master, Inherent Vice and Phantom Thread. Dylan Tichenor edited Boogie Nights, <b>Magnolia,</b> There Will Be Blood, and Phantom Thread. Anderson also regularly works with producing partners JoAnne Sellar, Scott Rudin, Michael De Luca, and Daniel Lupi as well as casting director Cassandra Kulukundis.|$|E
40|$|Mannitol {{biosynthesis}} in Candida <b>magnoliae</b> HH- 01 (KCCM- 10252), a yeast {{strain that}} is currently used for the industrial production of mannitol, is catalyzed by mannitol dehydrogenase (MDH) (EC 1. 1. 1. 138). In this study, NAD(P) H-dependent MDH was purified to homogeneity from C. <b>magnoliae</b> HH- 01 by ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and affinity chromatography. The relative molecular masses of C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography, were 35 and 142 kDa, respectively, indicating that the enzyme is a tetramer. This enzyme catalyzed both fructose reduction and mannitol oxidation. The pH and temperature optima for fructose reduction and mannitol oxidation were 7. 5 and 37 °C and 10. 0 and 40 °C, respectively. C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH showed high substrate specificity and high catalytic efficiency (kcat = 823 s− 1, Km = 28. 0 mM, and kcat/Km = 29. 4 mM− 1 s− 1) for fructose, which may explain the high mannitol production observed in this strain. Initial velocity and product inhibition {{studies suggest that the}} reaction proceeds via a sequential ordered Bi Bi mechanism, and C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH is specific for transferring the 4 -pro-S hydrogen of NADPH, which is typical of a short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (SDR). The internal amino acid sequences of C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH showed a significant homology with SDRs from various sources, indicating that the C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH is an NAD(P) H-dependent tetrameric SDR. Although MDHs have been purified and characterized from several other sources, C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH is distinguished from other MDHs by its high substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency for fructose only, which makes C. <b>magnoliae</b> MDH the ideal choice for industrial applications, including enzymatic synthesis of mannitol and salt-tolerant plants...|$|R

Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and <b>Magnolia.</b> Of the four, <b>Magnolia</b> is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.|$|E
5|$|Within {{his first}} three films, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and <b>Magnolia,</b> Anderson {{explored}} themes of dysfunctional families, alienation and loneliness. Boogie Nights and <b>Magnolia</b> were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having {{a heightened sense of}} reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E

5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to <b>magnolia</b> (<b>Magnolia</b> grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

The small town of Olivia, which was founded in 1892 as a Swedish Lutheran community, is located on the shores of Keller Bay.

5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay <b>magnolia</b> (<b>Magnolia</b> virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
