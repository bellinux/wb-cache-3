40|$|Maintaining {{the pace}} of MOSFET device scaling has become {{increasingly}} difficult in the sub- 100 nm gate length regime. Increased chip functionality and device performance gains drive scaling. But, simple scaling of the channel length and gate oxide thickness is no longer sufficient to deliver the ~ 17 % yearly speed / power performance enhancement target for high performance logic device technologies. Problems include short channel device effects such as sub-threshold leakage current and threshold voltage changes induced by the drain voltage (DIBL), and {{the high level of}} leakage current through the ultra-thin gate dielectric. These leakage currents cause higher static power dissipation. Active switching power is another key problem where a higher number of gates switching at high frequency with only modest reductions in supply voltage result in high active power density. The problems facing device scaling necessitate new solutions. The desired solution is one that enables continued critical dimension scaling at high yield, increases <b>MOSFET</b> <b>drive</b> current while reducing source to drain and gate leakage currents, reduces short channel effects, and reduces the active power density. The potential solution space includes changes in device fabrication materials, device architectures, and the silicon wafer starting materials. This paper will describe device problems faced for sub- 65 nm technology nodes. Potential silicon wafer solutions for sub- 65 nm technology nodes will be discussed and compared.

40|$|Cellular VLSI is that {{subclass}} {{of electronic}} systems for which small perturbations in a repeated cell design can dramatically influence {{the cost and}} performance of the entire system. This thesis presents examples of how the room-temperature quantum effects of tunneling and resonance {{may be used to}} condense the functionality of many conventional VLSI devices into a smaller and more efficient subunit, thus yielding tremendous benefits for the system as a whole. In particular, two and three-terminal applications of a complimentary pair of quantum-effect devices, the resonant-tunneling diode and the tunneling-switch diode, are presented. The first example is an image-segmentation network for machine vision, implemented by using resonant-tunneling diodes in one and two-dimensional networks to extract boundaries between regions of constant spatial texture. In this case a single quantum-effect device may replace up to thirty-three CMOS transistors per pixel. The second example is an artificial neural-network processor based on multistate resistors for synaptic conductances. These programmable resistors were produced by combining a vertically-integrated stack of resonant-tunneling diodes with a resistive load and a single <b>MOSFET</b> <b>driven</b> in its ohmic region. This macrostructure has the potential to provide synaptic changes on the picosecond time scale at length scales well below one micron. The third example is a current-mode transistorless memory array based on a two-dimensional network of cells containing only a single tunneling-switch diode and a resistive load.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{circuits}} are described. The first uses external <b>MOSFETs</b> <b>driven</b> by the Power OK (POK) {{output of}} a Li-cell charger IC (MAX 8814), to switch a load between battery and charging source without intervention from a microcontroller or system software. For charger ICs without a POK output (such as the MAX 1507), the second circuit {{does the same}} switching using MOSFETs and a comparator (MAX 920). A similar {{version of this article}} appeared in the July 19, 2010 issue of Electronic Design magazine. Most rechargeable battery-powered systems include a switch that connects the load either to the battery or to a source of charging power. Without it, a system with depleted battery may not operate immediately when plugged in. A switching circuit also allows the system to operate on adapter power while the battery is charging. The simplest and lowest-cost method for this battery/adapter power handoff is a diode-OR connection. The load connects to each power source (battery and adapter) through separate Schottky diodes, so power is applied by the higher voltage—battery or adapter. The drawback to this approach is the power loss (P D = I BATTERYV DIODE) and voltage drop (V DIODE = 0. 350 V at 0. 5 A, from the PMEG 2010 AEH data sheet) incurred when the battery services the load. Such losses may not be significant for high-voltage multicell batteries, but for 1 -cell Li+ batteries or 2 – 4 cell NiMh batteries, the percentages of power loss and diode drop across the blocking diode are considerable. The circuit of Figure 1 switches loads with a voltage drop of only 45 mV at 0. 5 A, which is a head-room improvement of 350 mV...|$|R
