5|$|Goofus and Gallant {{was created}} by Garry Cleveland <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> was first {{featured}} in the magazine Children's Activities in 1940. According to family legend, the grandchildren of <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and Gallant respectively. At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded Highlights for Children, they brought Goofus and Gallant {{with them to the}} new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and Gallant turned from elves to human boys. Throughout Goofus and Gallants history, numerous artists have drawn for the strip, including Marion Hull Hammel, who illustrated the strip for 32 years beginning in the early 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Myers, born March 2, 1842, was of German {{descent and}} the son of Abram <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> Ann Ela Myers.

5|$|E. Budin {{collected}} the first specimen {{of the species}} on August 21, 1917, in Jujuy Province, northwestern Argentina, {{and the next year}} Oldfield Thomas used the animal as the holotype of a new subspecies of Akodon puer, a Bolivian species. He described the new subspecies Akodon puer cænosus as darker and duller in color than the Bolivian form, but otherwise identical. In 1920, Thomas recognized additional differences between the two after examining more specimens and classified the Argentine form as a separate species, Akodon cænosus. Most subsequent authors followed this arrangement, but since the 1980s some have placed the form (now spelled caenosus) in A.puer again. In 1990, Philip <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> others reviewed the Akodon boliviensis group, which includes A.puer and A.caenosus, and again considered caenosus as a subspecies of puer. They retained caenosus as a separate subspecific name for the Argentine populations of puer because of its small size, dark fur, and distinctive karyotype. <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> colleagues had included the name lutescens J.A. Allen, 1901, as a subspecies of Akodon puer Thomas, 1902, and in 1997 Sydney Anderson noted that the older name lutescens should instead be used for the species because of the Principle of Priority; therefore, he utilized the combination Akodon lutescens caenosus for the Argentine subspecies. Through the 1990s and 2000s, authors continued to differ on the classification of caenosus as either a full species or a subspecies or puer (=lutescens).|$|E

Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{midway between}} Key West and the Dry Tortugas, Tropical Storm Marco adopted a steady northward track and quickly intensified, {{reaching}} peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) on October 11, while still southwest of Englewood, Florida. The {{center of the}} storm continued on its off-shore parallel for another six hours after reaching its peak intensity, until it reached a position about sixmi (10km) west of Bradenton Beach; although the {{center of the storm}} remained offshore, much of its circulation was over land. Initially the storm still was forecast to move ashore between Fort <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> Sarasota. However, the cyclone continued its northward trajectory, the center remaining offshore, and it weakened to a tropical depression prior to making landfall near Cedar Key early on October 12.|$|E
5|$|After {{stalling}} offshore {{for almost}} a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. <b>Myers</b> <b>and</b> Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, back over the open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling {{at the core of}} the deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.|$|E

Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch.

5|$|Local {{chapters}} of the American Red Cross organized first-aid stations and shelters; transportation was provided {{to those who were}} unable to reach the shelters. In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba.

The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort <b>Myers,</b> <b>and</b> the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers from the Florida Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm.
