One advantage that <b>multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> has over the single imputation and complete case methods is that, <b>multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> is flexible {{and can be used}} in a wide variety of scenarios. <b>Multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> can be used in cases where the data is missing completely, missing at random, and even when the data is missing not at random. However, the primary method of <b>multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> is <b>multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> by chained equations (MICE). It is also known as [...] "fully conditional specification" [...] and, [...] "sequential regression multiple imputation." [...] An important thing to note is that MICE should be implemented only when the missing data follow the missing at random mechanism.|$|E

50|$|As alluded in the {{previous}} section, single imputation {{does not take into}} account the uncertainty in the imputations. After imputation, the data is treated as if they were the actual real values in single imputation.

50|$|Listwise {{deletion}} is also problematic {{when the}} reason for missing data may not be random (i.e., questions in questionnaires aiming to extract sensitive information). Due to the method, much of the subjects' data will be excluded from analysis, leaving a bias in data findings. For instance, a questionnaire may include questions about respondents drug use history, current earnings, or sexual persuasions. Many of {{the subjects in the}} sample may not answer due to the intrusive nature of the questions, but may answer all other items. Listwise deletion will exclude these respondents from analysis. This may create a bias as participants who do divulge this information may have different characteristics than participants who do not. <b>Multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> is an alternate technique for dealing with missing data that attempts to eliminate this bias.|$|E
50|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{advisory}} panel instead recommended methods that provide valid type I error rates under explicitly stated assumptions taking missing data status into account, {{and the use}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>imputation</b> methods based on all the data available in the model. It recommended more widespread use of Bootstrap and Generalized estimating equation methods whenever the assumptions underlying them, such as Missing at Random for GEE methods, can be justified. It advised collecting auxiliary data believed to be associated with dropouts to provide more robust and reliable models, collecting information about reason for drop-out; and, if possible, following up on drop-outs and obtaining efficacy outcome data. Finally, it recommended sensitivity analyses as part of clinical trial reporting to assess the sensitivity of the results to the assumptions about the missing data mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|In statistics, {{imputation}} is {{the process}} of replacing missing data with substituted values. When substituting for a data point, it is known as [...] "unit imputation"; when substituting for a component of a data point, it is known as [...] "item imputation". There are three main problems that missing data causes: missing data can introduce a substantial amount of bias, make the handling and analysis of the data more arduous, and create reductions in efficiency. Because missing data can create problems for analyzing data, imputation is seen as a way to avoid pitfalls involved with listwise deletion of cases that have missing values. That is to say, when one or more values are missing for a case, most statistical packages default to discarding any case that has a missing value, which may introduce bias or affect the representativeness of the results. Imputation preserves all cases by replacing missing data with an estimated value based on other available information. Once all missing values have been imputed, the data set can then be analysed using standard techniques for complete data. Imputation theory is constantly developing and thus requires consistent attention to new information regarding the subject. There have been many theories embraced by scientists to account for missing data but the majority of them introduce large amounts of bias. A few of the well known attempts to deal with missing data include: hot deck and cold deck imputation; listwise and pairwise deletion; mean imputation; regression imputation; last observation carried forward; stochastic imputation; and <b>multiple</b> <b>imputation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fifty-hundred-and-seventy-seven {{overweight}} or moderately obese adults (BMI 25-39.9) were recruited nationally, primarily from large employers. Those {{randomly assigned to}} the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide {{and a series of}} tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. <b>Multiple</b> <b>Imputation</b> was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment {{were significantly more likely to}} have reached Protons or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs.18.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.|$|E
