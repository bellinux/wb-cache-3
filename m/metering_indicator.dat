40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the influence of sex and body position on respiratory characteristics {{and the effects of}} thoracic, abdominal and paced breathing, and relaxation training on psychological and physiological indices of arousal. Two separate experiments were conducted, each using equal numbers of male and female subjects. The psychological measures of arousal used were: the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, a self-report measure of arousal, and Time Estimation. Physiological data collected included: Skin Conductance, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, thoracic-abdominal index and the inspiration/expiration ratio. Respiratory characteristics were measured using mercury-in-rubber strain gauges. In Experiment 1 the respiratory patterns of 28 subjects were assessed in two body positions: sitting and supine. Subjects were divided according to sex, and allocated randomly to either the sitting-supine order, or the supine-sitting order. In this way four experimental groups were formed. The differences in respiratory patterns, psychological measures, and physiological indices could, therefore, be attributed to either: sex, body position, or the order in which assessment occurred. Experiment 1 revealed that in the sitting position female subjects breathe relatively more thoracically than do male subjects. In the supine position both sexes breathe predominantly abdominally. Thoracic I/E ratios were found to be higher in male subjects than in female subjects and both thoracic and abdominal I/E ratios were effected by •body position and order of position. In the supine position subjects displayed longer inspiratory times than in the sitting position. Similarly, in the sitting-supine order subjects displayed longer inspiratory times than in the supine-sitting order. It was shown that predominantly abdominal breathing was associated with longer thoracic and abdominal inspirations than was thoracic breathing. • Experiment 2 used 48 subjects who were also divided according to sex and randomly allocated to one of four treatment conditions: thoracic, abdominal or paced breathing, or relaxation training. In this experiment subjects were assessed only in the sitting position. Thoracic and abdominal training was accomplished with the aid of visual and auditory feedback procedures. Subjects in the paced breathing treatment were required to inhale and exhale as indicated by the sweep of an analogue <b>meter</b> <b>indicator.</b> Relaxation training required subjects to perform tape-recorded relaxation exercises. Subjects in the paced breathing condition served as attention controls, whilst the subjects in the relaxation training condition served as an arousal control group. Experiment 2 revealed that training subjects to breathe thoracically or abdominally failed to produce consistent changes in the indices of arousal. Both male and female subjects reported feeling less aroused following relaxation training. Time Estimation and the physiological indices failed to parallel the self-report data. The present results are discussed in respect to current respiratory literature and major methodological issues were identified for future research...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if residents of Richmond, Nelson, with an on-demand, mains pressure, and metered drinking-water supply had the same microbiological drinking-water quality at the kitchen tap as dwellings with a restricted, low-flow supply. Both dwelling types were supplied with water from the same untreated, reticulated water supply scheme. The {{results from this study}} provide information for both consumers and the supplier regarding the microbiological quality of drinking-water supplied at the kitchen tap. A cross-sectional, interviewer administered survey of 50 dwellings with a metered supply and 61 dwellings with a restrictor supply was conducted during May-July 2012. Microbiological water quality of each dwelling was ascertained by testing water samples from the kitchen tap for the presence of indicator organisms, using the Colilert®- 18 method. When total coliforms were used as an <b>indicator,</b> <b>metered</b> dwellings did not have the same water quality as restrictor-only dwellings (p< 0. 0005) : more restrictor-only dwellings were contaminated than metered dwellings. Drinking-water at the kitchen tap for 84 % of metered dwellings and 48 % of restrictor-only dwellings complied with the microbiological criteria set in the DWSNZ 2005 (Revised 2008) of < 1 total coliform per 100 ml. When E. coli was used as an <b>indicator,</b> <b>metered</b> dwellings were found to have the same water quality as restrictor-only dwellings (p= 0. 242). Drinking-water for all metered dwellings and 94 % of restrictor-only dwellings complied with the microbiological criteria set in the DWSNZ 2005 (Revised 2008) of < 1 E. coli per 100 ml.

40|$|Abstract. Context is a {{critical}} ingredient of ubiquitous computing. While {{it is possible to}} use specialized sen-sors and beacons to measure certain aspects of a user’s context, we are interested in what we can infer from using the existing 802. 11 wireless network infrastruc-ture that already exists in many places. The context parameters we infer are the location of a client (with a median error of 1. 5 <b>meters)</b> and an <b>indicator</b> {{of whether or not the}} client is in motion (with a classifica-tion accuracy of 87 %). Our system, called LOCADIO, uses Wi-Fi signal strengths from existing access points measured on the client to infer both pieces of context. For motion, we measure the variance of the signal strength of the strongest access point as input to a sim-ple two-state hidden Markov model (HMM) for smooth-ing transitions between the inferred states of “still ” and “moving. ” For location, we exploit the fact that Wi-Fi signal strengths vary with location, and we use another HMM on a graph of location nodes whose transition probabilities are a function of the building’s floor plan, expected pedestrian speeds, and our still/moving infer-ence. Our probabilistic approach to inferring context gives a convenient way of balancing noisy measured data such as signal strengths against our a priori as-sumptions about a user’s behavior. ...|$|R
30|$|Determination of {{cardiovascular}} function in small animals {{has been well}} characterized using a number of in vivo model systems. In particular, {{the application of the}} direct Fick principle [1], employing electromagnetic flow <b>meters</b> [2], <b>indicator</b> dilution [3], and thermal [4] dilution methods have been used with great success. The invasive nature of these techniques makes them better suited for acute rather than longitudinal measurements of function. To overcome this limitation, non-invasive small animal quantitative PET methods have been developed for both rats [5 – 10] and mice [11]. Primary challenges in quantifying cardiac function via small animal PET include limited spatial resolution and suboptimal detection sensitivity of these devices. Currently, a majority of the small animal PET scanners in use have a fixed ring geometry and yield a spatial resolution {{at the center of the}} field of view (CFOV) in the range of 1.3 – 1.7  mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and a overall system sensitivity of 3 – 5  % [7, 12 – 14]. Kreissl et al. [11] acquired cardiac PET data in listmode and reconstructed the images into short-duration frames (0.3  s/frame) in order to measure the first pass kinetics of the radiotracer through the heart. In order to gain greater spatial resolution and system sensitivity, small animal PET scanners, like IndyPET 3, have been developed with a slip-ring geometry which encodes all events spatially as the gantry rotates in order to increase spatial sampling by using 12 coincidence banks, thus yielding resolution at CFOV of < 1  mm while simultaneously maximizing sensitivity (> 7  %) with long detector crystal lengths [15]. Although these advances provide substantial benefit for cardiac PET imaging, the use of high temporal resolution frame rates [11] with a rotating gantry configuration will eliminate the resolution gain provided by the unique spatial sampling schemes employed in these systems. The objective of the current study was to develop a novel sinogram binning and data processing scheme that enables rapid cardiac function studies to be performed while maintaining the improved spatial resolution produced by small animal PET systems that incorporate a rotating gantry. To test this approach, we developed an animal model that enabled simultaneous measurement of cardiac function with a transonic flow meter and PET determination of function using tracer kinetic models which utilizes the sinogram binning.|$|R

The variables RCI, aboveground dry matter, total leaf N concentration, production components, grain yield, relative yield, and N use efficiency were evaluated. The RCI correlated with leaf N concentrations. By monitoring the RCI with the chlorophyll meter, the period of N sidedressing of common bean could be defined, improving N use efficiency and avoiding unnecessary N supply to common bean.

40|$|The study {{carries out}} an {{evaluation}} of TMCs (traffic management centers) using three methodologies; case studies, performance based regressions and time series analysis. The study {{is an extension of}} previous work that assessed the contribution of different types of intelligent transportation investments and initiatives. However, this research sought to distinguish the separate contributions of the ITS investments from the synergies of integration under a traffic management center. Secondly, the research investigated the time dimension of benefits where we investigated if there was an 'S' curve effect in which a change in the network due to an ITS investment or the introduction of a TMC lead to benefits distributed over time. The distribution was important to evaluating ITS investments. If one measured the impact of the investment too soon, in the disequilibrium period, it would underestimate the true contribution of the investment or change in process or management strategy. We found the institutions that affect TMC operations with their designation of responsibilities, who can do what, when and where, requires change before the TMC can be an effective addition to the management of the transportation network. TMCs represent an integration of hardware and people and that process and management were most important in ensuring the TMCs had added value. Our performance related regressions used levels and changes in congestion (measured by a congestion index) and changes in VMT for autos and trucks. We found that for auto VMT ramp meters were more important than CMSs in improving the system. This was, more VMT can be obtained from the system, holding congestion constant, with ramp meters. We found that TMCs had no statistical impact on auto VMT. In the case of truck VMT, the results were just the reverse; CMSs appeared to be more important than ramp meters in improving system efficiency when efficiency was measured by extracting more truck VMT from the system, holding congestion constant. As with the auto results, TMCs were not significant in the analysis. The regression using the congestion index found ramp meters appear to be 4 times as effective as CMSs. TMCs as before were not statistically significant in affecting congestion. Overall the model did not have a lot of explanatory power in sorting out the differences in congestion among counties or what the underlying contribution is of ITS relative to investments. But it is evident that among conventional congestion relief measures maintaining infrastructure (roads) is more effective than expanding capacity. It also appears that ramp <b>meters</b> and CMSs, <b>indicators</b> of improved network management are more effective in reducing congestion than are expanding the network. ...|$|R
