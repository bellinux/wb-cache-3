500|$|Hilda Solis is {{the third}} oldest of seven {{siblings}} (four sisters, two brothers) {{and grew up in}} a tract home in La Puente, California. She had to help raise her youngest siblings, and later said of her childhood: [...] "It wasn't what you would call the all-American life for a young girl growing up. We had to mature very quickly." [...] She graduated from La Puente High School, where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a guidance counselor who told her mother that “Your daughter is not college material. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.” However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead.|$|E
5000|$|Monica, {{the hostess}} at Pepper's, is spacey and oblivious. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> sees things others don't, or <b>maybe</b> <b>she's</b> just crazy. She is hopelessly {{in love with}} Rob, {{although}} the feeling is not mutual.|$|R

500|$|James and Mona Rocha {{argued that}} while [...] "Veronica showed poor {{judgment}} in the episode, {{the blame for}} her rape should not be put on her—instead, Dick, Logan, Sean, Dick, and Cassidy (Beaver) should take the blame. Responsibility and blame aren't zero-sum reckonings, such that adding to one person's blame automatically subtracts it from someone else's." [...] Regarding Logan, they stated that [...] "she wouldn't have been raped, if not for Logan's buying the GHB." [...] On Dick, they wrote that [...] "Dick didn't intend to drug Veronica, but he did intend to drug someone." [...] The pair argued that Veronica made some choices that were causally related to her rape, but they concluded {{that she did not}} deserve blame. [...] "If someone like Veronica makes a bad prudential choice that causes her harm, then <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> blame herself, but we can't blame her for any moral wrong done to her as a result. She may have acted foolishly, but that was within her rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Asher {{explains}} in Danse Macabre, he is bisexual and deeply {{in love with}} Jean-Claude. [...] Realizing that Jean-Claude, although bisexual, prefers women, Asher was able to form a stable relationship only with their mutual lover, Julianna. [...] After arriving in St. Louis, Asher {{fell in love with}} both Jean-Claude and Anita, but feared that they could not love him fully, either because of his scars or because of their feelings for each other. [...] Recently, he has accepted that both Jean-Claude and Anita love him for himself, although he is unwilling to be restricted to one-way monogamy with Anita, resulting in a longtime dalliance with Narcissus. (Many of Jean-Claude's vampires, and even Anita herself, assume that they have an affair but this relationship is denied by both of them. [...] "The Harlequin" [...] confirms that they are having sex, but [...] "Blood Noir" [...] rectifies this by stating that they are not sexually involved, Anita thinking that <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> let them be lovers if it doesn't freak her out too much) ...|$|E

50|$|If {{one finds}} oneself believing all three propositions of an {{inconsistent}} triad, then (in {{order to be}} rational) one must give up or modify {{at least one of}} those beliefs.

Yet she's tied to him for life, both of them caught in an unbreakable mate bond.|$|E
