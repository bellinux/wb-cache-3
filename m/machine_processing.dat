The jobs that are processed together form a batch, and all jobs in a batch start and complete at the same time. For a batch of jobs, the processing time of the batch {{is equal to the}} largest processing time among the jobs in the batch.

50|$|A {{loopback}} is {{a manufacturing}} term {{that refers to}} a situation where work returns to a previous step for further processing.

If loop-backs present a problem, management can assist employees to clarify roles and tasks by focusing on their place within the overall service process.|$|R

50|$|RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) DLs (Description Languages) are formal {{languages}} {{designed to}} provide a structured description of a RESTful web API that is useful both to a human and for automated <b>machine</b> <b>processing.</b> API Description Languages are sometimes called interface description languages (IDLs). The structured description might be used to generate documentation for human programmers; such documentation may be easier to read than free-form documentation, since all documentation generated by the same tool follows the same formatting conventions. Additionally, the description language is usually precise enough to allow automated generation of various software artifacts, like libraries, to access the API from various programming languages, which takes the burden of manually creating them off the programmers.|$|E

The parties signed the relevant agreement in 2007. It took two years to put up a new plant, employ and train personnel and install production equipment. In 2009, the new enterprise was launched as world’s most sophisticated production plant set up by Rostec and Ural Boeing Manufacturing. In October 2012, VSMPO-AVISMA and Boeing signed a memorandum to expand production capacity of Ural Boeing Manufacturing. The joint venture purchased four new machines which are scheduled to be installed in 2013. US$12 million will be additionally invested in the development. The partners develop new titanium alloys and technologies for aircraft engineering, in particular, «Ti5553» designed to reduce the aircraft weight.|$|E
50|$|CDC {{decided to}} fight for the {{high-performance}} niche, but Norris considered that the company had become moribund and unable to quickly design competitive machines. In 1983 he set up a spinoff company, ETA Systems, whose design goal was a <b>machine</b> <b>processing</b> data at 10 GFLOPs, about 40 times the speed of the Cray-1. The design never fully matured, and it was unable to reach its goals. Nevertheless, the product was one of the fastest computers on the market, and 7 liquid nitrogen-cooled and 27 smaller air cooled versions of the computers were sold during the next few years. They used the new CMOS chips, which produced much less heat. The effort ended after half-hearted attempts to sell ETA Systems. In 1989, most of the employees of ETA Systems were laid off, and the remaining ones were folded into CDC.|$|E
