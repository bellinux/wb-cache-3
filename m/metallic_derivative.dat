For a wide spread resistive strains of pathogenic bacteria, {{there is a need}} for some new antibacterial agents to treat the patients, infected with such resistive pathogenic bacteria. Here we synthesized new gold and silver derivatives of amoxicillin and some other beta lactam antibiotics like cefuraxime, cephradine, ceftriaxone etc belonging to beta lactam antibiotics family some of them were penicillins while others are cephalosporins. We synthesized <b>metallic</b> <b>derivatives</b> of amoxicillin in the form of gold and silver nanoparticles and their nano alloys using NaBH 4 and TMA as reducing agents. Reducing agents of different nature (organic and inorganic), NaBH 4 and trimethylamine were used for the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles to study their effect on sizes and shapes of nanoparticles as well as to avoid the sodium salt formation of amoxicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics using TMA. It was found that nanoparticles synthesized with NaBH 4 were of small size compared to nanoparticles synthesized with TMA. Gold nanoparticles stabilized with amoxicillin were prepared using NaBH 4 and TMA as reducing agents. The applications for metallic sensing like Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Hg etc were studied.

The Pb 4 + ions are partly substituted by ions of lower valency like Sr 2 +, Ba 2 + and this results in oxidation of copper (Cu 2 +	Cu 3 +) which in turn esta blishes mixed valency states (MVS). The general unit cell formula Cu 28 -m Pbm_x Ax_p Mp Oy can be proposed and variation of parameters m, p, x with permutation of ions A and M results in a pronounced conductivity of samples at room temperature (RT).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Stearates are commonly used in polymer technology as slip additives and lubricants. The release properties of stearic acid and its <b>metallic</b> <b>derivatives</b> are extensively manipulated in rubber processing industries where they are used as mold release agents. Previous unrelated {{studies have shown that}} increased additions of stearic acid consistently reduced mold sticking. Despite their widespread usage, however, few studies have been directed to study their mechanism of action. In a preliminary study conducted by AWE and Loughborough University, the attainment of low levels of adhesion was studied and in particular the use of stearic acid as an adhesion modifier was studied. It was found that adding minute amounts of stearic acid resulted in dramatic reductions to the strength of aluminium bonded with a PDMS-based adhesive. The cause of this fall-off in adhesion (as measured by T-peel test) was initially attributed to the migration of stearic acid to the surface forming a weak boundary layer. The possibility that stearic acid acts as an inhibitor for the cure reaction was also considered. Surface analysis predominantly with static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to ascertain locus of failure and the likelihood of stearic acid at the interface. Failure was identified as having taken place in a cohesive, and potentially interphasial, layer near the interface of the joint. No evidence was given to support the WBL theory proposed by most researchers, thus findings from the present study contradicted existing literature.

40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) {{has been}} used as the gate {{material}} for MOSFETs for several decades. This is because it is highly compatible with CMOS processing, and its work function can be selectively modified by ion implantation of the appropriate dopants. The gate-depletion effect, which increases the equivalent SiO 2 thickness (EOT) of the gate dielectric by several Angstroms and thereby degrades transistor performance, becomes a significant issue for poly-Si gate technology as the EOT is scaled to 1 nm and below in sub- 50 nm devices, however. Because of this, alternative gate-electrode materials which can either reduce or eliminate the gate depletion effect have been investigated by many researchers. While refractory metals and their <b>metallic</b> <b>derivatives</b> are attractive candidates, there are numerous process integration challenges that must be overcome before a viable metal-gate CMOS technology can be developed. This paper highlights some of these challenges and reviews three different process integration schemes. successful demonstrations of MOS capacitors and transistors with sub- 1 nm EOT using high-k gate dielectrics viz. oxides of Hf, Zr, Al and La [4 - 6]. Many of these materials are not thermally stable in contact with poly-Si above certain temperatures, and therefore cannot be used in a conventional dual poly-Si gate CMOS process, in which the highest annealing temperature can exceed 1000 °C. Therefore, alternative gate materials that are thermally stable with various advanced gate-dielectric materials will be needed. For thin gate dielectrics, boron penetration into the channel is a serious problem for poly-Si gate technology. It occurs even with high-k dielectrics [7], and can be eliminated with the use of metallic gate electrodes. Metal gate materials appear to be essential for future CMOS devices, because of these issues for poly-Si gate technology. However, there are significant process integration challenges that must be overcome before a metal gate technology can be considered to be viable for integrated-circuit manufacturing. These are discussed in the following section...|$|R

40|$|For recent decades, {{the most}} {{commonly}} biodegradable polymers used in clinical and therapeutic applications are aliphatic polyesters such as polyglycolide, polylactide, polycaprolactone and their copolymers, mainly due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. However, the lack of functional groups on the backbone of polyesters, which could otherwise be used for tuning physicochemical properties and for introducing bioactive units, limits their further biomedical applications. Polymers with repeating phosphoester bonds in the backbone are structurally versatile and biodegradable through hydrolysis and possibly enzymatic digestion of phosphates linkages under physiological conditions. An advantage of polyphosphoesters (PPEs) compared to aliphatic polyesters is the possible functionalization of side chains due to the patenvalency of the phosphorous atom, allowing the introduction of bioactive molecules and extensive modification of the {{physical and chemical properties}} of final material. The Ring-Opening Polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters is a well-established process to provide linear polyesters with predictable molecular weight, narrow polydispersity and well-defined end-groups. Up to now, metallic compounds are particularly used as initiators or polymerization catalysts to synthetize these materials but <b>metallic</b> <b>derivatives</b> are cytotoxic and a lack of residual metal contaminants is strongly required in view of biomedical applications. To tackle these drawbacks, we developed synthetic approaches that are metal-free (i. e., organocatalytic) using organocatalysis based on supramolecular recognition. A variety of organocatalysts such as 1, 8 -diazabicyclo[5. 4. 0]undec- 7 -ene (DBU), 1, 5, 7 -triazabicyclo[4. 4. 0]undec- 5 -ene (TBD) and a bicomponent thiourea-tertiary amine catalyst were studied. Each of these catalysts is efficient to produce linear polyphosphoesters (PPEs) from cyclic phosphate monomers (CPMs) but with different sensitivity towards transesterification side reactions. Compared with polymerizations carried out with Sn(Oct) 2 as a metal catalyst, the control of polymerization is much better so {{that it is possible to}} prepare PPEs with molecular weight close to 70000 g. mol- 1 and polydispersity index below 1. 10. The chain extension experiments through the use of hydroxy end-capped PPEs as macro-initiators confirm the controlled/living nature of organo-catalyzed ROP of CPMs and pave the way to the synthesis of block copolymers based on polyphosphates. Finally, these polymerizations procedures are expected to facilitate the synthesis of well-defined PPEs with various architectures and free of potentially toxic metal remnants. The easy availability of catalysts, the mild conditions of polymerizations and the metal-free nature of the polymerizations makes these catalysts very attractive candidates for the synthesis of PPEs for biomedical applications such as drug and gene delivery, tissue engineering and dental applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate some of the chemical properties of two remarkable quasi one-dimensional materials, (SN) (,x) and (CH) (,x). Polymeric sulfur nitride, (SN) (,x), is the first example of a covalent polymer which is a metal even though it contains no metal atoms. Polyacetylene, (CH) (,x), is the simplest possible organic polymer. It can be doped with a variety of materials to give a series of either p- or n- type semiconductors and ultimately a series of 2 ̆ 2 organic metals. 2 ̆ 2 ^ In Sections III and IV, a brief survey of the (SN) (,x) and (CH) (,x) literature, respectively, is given. Section II gives a qualitative description of the basic theories of conductivity, while Section V involves a discussion of some other quasi one-dimensional materials. ^ In the Experimental Section (VI), details of the experimental procedures employed are given. Specific experiments described in detail include the investigation of the thermal decomposition of (SN) (,x) in air and in vacuum, the study of the reactions of (SN) (,x) with H(, 2) O, Cl(, 2), Br(, 2), I(, 2), ICI and IBr, the synthesis and characterization of <b>metallic</b> bromine <b>derivatives</b> of (SN) (,x), the synthesis and characterization of metallic halogen (Br(, 2), ICl and IBr) derivatives of S(, 4) N(, 4), the basic studies directed toward the synthesis of copolymers of (SN) (,x), and, finally, the investigation of a new species for doping (CH) (,x). ^ In the Discussion Section, the results and conclusions drawn from the experiments are presented and discussed together with their relationship to published results from other investigators. The results and conclusions are summarized below: (1) Polymeric sulfur nitride, (SN) (,x), remains shiny and golden when heated in air at ca. 170 (DEGREES) C, decomposing only after several days. (2) When heated in vacuum at ca. 145 (DEGREES) C, (SN) (,x) decomposes quantitatively over several days to sulfur and nitrogen. (3) Crystals of (SN) (,x) undergo no change, remaining shiny and golden, when immersed in degassed distilled water for 24 hours. The extent of reaction varies for longer periods, possibly depending on the degree of crystal imperfection. Water was found not {{to increase the amount of}} hydride impurity in (SN) (,x) (determined via mass spectrometry) after immersion for 8 days. (4) The reaction of (SN) (,x) with 0. 5 atmosphere of Cl(, 2) at 0 (DEGREES) C for 24 hours was found to be negligible. At ca. 55 (DEGREES) C, (NSCl) (, 3 (s)) is produced in equilibrium with NSCl(,(g)). (5) The first <b>metallic</b> <b>derivatives</b> of (SN) (,x), the polythiazyl^ bromides, (SNBr(,y)) (,x) (where 0. 43 (GREATERTHEQ) y (GREATERTHEQ) 0. 25), were synthesized from the reaction of (SN) (,x) with Br(, 2). They were characterized by gravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and X-ray powder diffraction. (6) The polythiazyl bromides were also synthesized from the reaction of S(, 4) N(, 4) with Br(, 2). In addition, ICl and IBr derivatives, (SN(ICl) (, 0. 4) (,x) and SN(IBr) (, 0. 4) (,x)), were made from S(, 4) N(, 4). (7) Considerable progress was made in basic studies directed ultimately toward the synthesis of copolymers of (SN) (,x). ^ Specifically, this involved a new synthesis of (SN) (,x) from the reaction of SCl(, 2) with (CH(, 3)) (, 3) Si-N=S=N-Si(CH(, 3)) (, 3). (8) Several (NO) (2 ̆ 7 +) and (NO(, 2)) (2 ̆ 7 +) salts were found to be excellent materials for introducing dopant species into (CH) (,x). When silvery films of (CH) (,x) were allowed to react with^ (NO(, 2)) (2 ̆ 7 +) (BF(, 4)) (2 ̆ 7 -), (NO) (2 ̆ 7 +) (BF(, 4)) (2 ̆ 7 -), (NO(, 2)) (2 ̆ 7 +) (SbF(, 6)) (2 ̆ 7 -) or (NO) (2 ̆ 7 +) (SbCl(, 6)) (2 ̆ 7 -), flexible golden films having conductivities in the metallic regime were obtained. Some examples of the compositions obtained are (CH) (2 ̆ 7 + 0. 055) (BOF(, 2)) (, 0. 055) (H(, 3) O) (2 ̆ 7 +) (BOF(, 2)) (2 ̆ 7 -) (, 0. 015) (,x), CH(H(, 3) O) (2 ̆ 7 +) (SbF(, 5) OH) (2 ̆ 7 -) (, 0. 011) (.)
