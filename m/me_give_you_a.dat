500|$|Under {{free trade}} the trader {{is the master}} and the {{producer}} the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [...] that protection is immoral.... Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [...] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates {{the rest of the}} world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest'.... Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.|$|E
2500|$|... "These kids don't need steroids {{to become}} players... we overemphasize the steroids {{and not the}} {{athletic}} ability and skills of these people. We're taking away the hard work the athlete puts in and saying he became great just because of steroids. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> perfect example. I have an identical twin brother, Ozzie. He {{is the closest thing}} to me genetically. And in my prime I was a super athlete". [...] "My twin brother used the same chemicals, same workouts, the same nutrition. Why didn't he make it in the big leagues? That is the perfect example that we are giving steroids way too much credit. If steroids are that great it would have made him a superstar." ...|$|E
60|$|That sounds rather magniloquent. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> simple example.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{leave this}} use, let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> few things, that, if God will, may provoke thee {{to fear the}} Lord.|$|R
6000|$|... "The mules {{that the}} brave burgess {{is going to}} bring his daughter's dowry on. They are cranky brutes, Hal; bad {{customers}} for blind men-- best let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> hand out of the way." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet before I {{do quite}} take my leave of <b>thee,</b> let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> few motives to take along with thee. It may be {{they will be}} as good as a pair of spurs to prick on thy lumpish heart in this rich journey.|$|R
60|$|LEE TAI. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea. It's quite warm still.|$|E
60|$|And now, before I {{conclude}} this use, let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> few heart-endearing considerations to this so {{good and}} so happy a work.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good morning; only, Ulick, excuse me, but let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hint; if the {{situation}} is to like you, you must mind your Irish.' ...|$|E
3000|$|... “That is what {{government}} principals would like…But let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> example from the Health Council. We always explicitly {{made the point}} that there had to be interaction (between government and experts, rh), during problem structuring, in the models for risk calculation and risk assessment…” [...]...|$|R
60|$|To explain, and at {{the same}} time, as I think, to verify my hypothesis, let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> example--fictitious, it is true, but {{probable}} fact nevertheless; because it is patched up of many fragments of actual fact: and let us see how, in following it out, we shall pass through almost every possible form of superstition.|$|R
5000|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> example. According to Nanthan of Gaza, [...] "the messiah's soul is {{engulfed by}} the qelippah ... {{just as the}} shell appears before {{the core of the}} fruit, even so the messianic qellipah (that is, Jesus) {{appeared}} first in this world ... Therefore he that is the messiah will restore to holiness his qelippah which is Jesus Christ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> welcome, my men," [...] said he. [...] "I {{have been}} told your story. I hope this visit to my ship has {{interested}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you are not}} in a hurry, {{perhaps you}} will come in, and let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea," [...] she said, looking him full in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sit down, sir,' he said, at length. 'Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, {{would have}} <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when {{anything}} occurs to please her.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Original Chinese: 你帮我，我给你很多钱。 nǐ bāngwǒ, wǒ gěinǐ hěnduō qián. (If <b>you</b> help <b>me,</b> I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lot of money.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Honora was {{a little}} taken aback, but {{recovered}} sufficiently to retort: [...] "You'd hardly expect <b>me</b> to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> unprejudiced judgment." ...|$|R
6000|$|KIT. That I do. But, thank goodness, it's nobody. Kiss me: no, I won't kiss you: kiss <b>me.</b> I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{present for}} that. See! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll be damned!" [...] Commander Cox said. [...] "It sure didn't {{take you}} long." [...] He leaped {{down the steps}} two at a time. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen to me," [...] he said, laying {{his hand}} on Denis's sleeve. [...] "You want to make your living by writing; you're young, you're inexperienced. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little sound advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 100. [...] "Boys, you've {{passed a}} fairly good examination, all things considered. Now let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> word of advice before I go. Remember that all, who are really anxious to learn, work HARD." ...|$|E
6000|$|The barber {{sees that}} he is dealing with a man of determination, and he warms to his task. He bends low and whispers into the {{prostrate}} ear: [...] "You've got a good many grey hairs coming in; better let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> application of Hairocene, only cost <b>you</b> half <b>a</b> dollar?" [...] "No." [...] "Your face," [...] he whispers again, with a soft, caressing voice, [...] "is all covered with wrinkles; better let me rub some of this Rejuvenator into the face." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Son, do {{you know}} the Tourmalet well? Could <b>you</b> guide <b>me?</b> I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> gold coin. When we get to the other top, I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> another one" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! aye! you are right, constable," [...] said Boatfield, still {{a little}} bewildered, [...] "do you come along to Sarre with <b>me,</b> I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> warrant this very night. Have <b>you</b> <b>a</b> horse here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hand to your room," [...] said he to his wife. [...] "This {{has come}} {{something}} of the suddenest; and, at any rate, you will wish to read your letter by yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] he said, [...] "I {{wish you}} would let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lift in the only way I can. You know you had never any idea of economy, and I'm afraid you must {{find it hard to}} get along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I do. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hunch. Throw {{down this}} I.W.W. outfit. Go to Ruxton and get Anderson of 'Many Waters' ranch {{to give you}} a job. Tell him who you are and that I sent you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worn out, of course!" [...] he said, sympathetically. [...] "Unpardonable {{on my part}} not to {{have thought}} of it before. We will resume our {{conversation}} to-morrow. Permit <b>me</b> to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> candle. Mrs. Wragge!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it was I. This happens very charmingly, for I {{feel as if}} it {{were for}} <b>me</b> to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> formal {{reception}} here, an official welcome. I talked to you so much about Europe." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{when the}} King had mustered his forces, (for {{it is he}} that mustereth the host to the battle,) he gave unto the captains their several commissions, with charge and commandment in the {{audience}} of all the soldiers, that they should take heed faithfully and courageously to do and execute the same. Their commissions were, for the substance of them, the same in form, though, as to name, title, place and degree of the captains, there might be some, but very small variation. And here let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> account of the matter and sum contained in their commission.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you'll do {{what you}} can to make it hot for him," [...] {{returned}} Tom. [...] "It's your way, Mr. Fogg. But just let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> word of advice--you take care that you don't get your fingers burnt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{tell you}} a story; let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> secret chapter of my life --a chapter that has never been {{referred}} to by me since its events transpired. Listen patiently, and promise that you will not interrupt me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have too}} much to do indoors," [...] he said. [...] "It would do you good to get a bit of {{exercise}} out of doors. Come down to the Coach Road tomorrow afternoon, and let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lesson. Go on--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> allow <b>me</b> to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lift?" [...] he said, with {{a marked}} absence of cordiality in his tone; [...] "or {{if you would}} prefer it, I can easily order a {{carriage}} from the hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't {{remember}} me,' said Sir Jasper, 'but I {{was your}} father's colonel, and I {{want to find}} some way of helping your brother. Your sister tells <b>me</b> she <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> letter to carry to Mr. Stebbing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you must}} sign {{with your eyes}} shut; I will hold your hand. Come, before you put your head into the noose. You ought to be thankful to <b>me</b> for <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance to do {{something}} amusing." ...|$|R
