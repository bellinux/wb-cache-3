5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene duplication, which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene, or a functional copy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E

Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine.
