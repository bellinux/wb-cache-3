40|$|A 43 -year-old {{man with}} a long history of dyspnea which had {{progressively}} worsened over the preceding month is presented. He had worked in an antimony mine for 3 years. Radiologically, there were diffuse reticulonodular shadowing opacities in both lung parenchymas. Histopathologic examination of the open-lung biopsy specimen revealed alveolar spaces filled with dust-laden macrophages and amorphous proteinaceous semifluid, the latter being immunoreactive for Human Surfactant Apoprotein A, associated with marked interstitial accumulation of the similar-looking macrophages along the bronchovascular bundles and mild interstitial fibrosis. Silicotic nodules or mixed dust fibrosis were not seen. The patient was diagnosed as silicoproteinosis with unusual histopathological features because he had worked in an antimony mine for only 3 years and had 86 % silica in a mineralogical analysis.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{provide an}} update on {{respiratory}} diseases caused by coal mine dust. MethodsThis article {{presents the results of}} a literature review initially performed for an International Conference on Occupational and Environmental Lung Disease held in summer 2013.

These include Coal Workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 Pneumoconiosis, silicosis, <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> dust-related diffuse fibrosis (which can be mistaken for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CMDLD continues to be a problem in the United States, particularly in the central Appalachian region. Treatment of CMDLD is symptomatic.

40|$|Information {{regarding}} {{adverse health}} effects resulting from exposure to respirable coal mine dust was reviewed {{as a basis for}} the development of new occupational safety and health standards. Evidence indicated that coal mine dust exposures over a working lifetime may result in the development of simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis, progressive massive fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on epidemiology studies, a working lifetime exposure to levels of coal dust at the current Mine Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit of 2 mg/m 3 increased the risk of developing these disorders. When exposure also occurs to crystalline silica (14808607) at respirable size particles, the danger of developing silicosis or <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> was also present. NIOSH recommends in this report that the exposures to respirable coal mine dust be limited to 1 mg/m 3 as a time weighted average concentration for up to 10 hours a day during a 40 hour work week.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{respiratory}} disease from dust exposure {{in the agricultural}} workplace have focused on allergic diseases caused by inorganic dusts, specifically occupational asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Exposures to inorganic (mineral) dusts among farmers and farm workers may be substantial. Such exposures are most frequent in dry-climate farming regions. In such locations farming activities that perturb the soil (e. g., plowing, tilling) commonly result in exposures to farm operators of 1 - 5 mg/m 3 respirable dust and 2 20 mg/m 3 total dust. The composition of inorganic dust in agriculture generally reflects the soil composition. Crystalline silica may represent up to 20 % of particles, and silicates represent up to 80 %. These very high concentrations of inorganic dust are likely to {{explain some of the}} increase in chronic bronchitis reported in many studies of farmers. Pulmonary fibrosis (<b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> <b>pneumoconiosis)</b> has been reported in agricultural workers, and dust samples from the lungs in these cases reflect the composition of agricultural soils, strongly suggesting an etiologic role for inorganic agricultural dusts. However, the prevalence and clinical severity of these cases are unknown, and many exposures are to mixed organic and inorganic dusts. Epidemiologic studies of farmers in diverse geographic settings also have observed an increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease morbidity and mortality. It is plausible that agricultural exposure to inorganic dusts is causally associated with chronic bronchitis, interstitial fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the independent contribution of mineral dusts beyond the effects of organic dusts remains to be determined.

The segregation of sulphate from nitrate and chloride in individual dust particles is demonstrated for the first time. This is likely caused by the dust plume encountering elevated SO 2 (g) in the Chinese interior before reaching coastal urban areas polluted by both SO 2 (g) and NO x (g). This caused the fractions of <b>dust</b> <b>mixed</b> with nitrate and/or chloride to be strongly dependent on the total dust loadings, whereas <b>dust</b> <b>mixed</b> with sulphate did not show this same dust concentration dependence. Ammonium was also significantly <b>mixed</b> with <b>dust</b> and the amount correlated strongly with the total amount of secondary acid reaction products in the dust.

Vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficients and single-scattering albedos (SSA) were derived from measurements with a multi-wavelength Raman lidar system. The data are used as input parameters for our radiative transfer calculations. We considered four cases of radiative forcing in SBDART: 1. dust, 2. pollution, 3. <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> plume {{and the use of}} vertical profiles of SSA, and 4. <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> plumes and the use of column-averaged values of SSA. In our sensitivity study we examined the influence of SSA and aerosol layer height on our results. The ADRF at the surface and in the atmosphere shows a small dependence on the specific shape of the aerosol extinction vertical profile and its light-absorption property for all four cases. In contrast, {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA), the ADRF is largely affected by the vertical distribution of the aerosols extinction. This effect increases if the light-absorption capacity (decrease of SSA) of the aerosols increases. We find different radiative effects in situations in which two layers of aerosols had different light-absorption properties. The largest difference was observed at the TOA for an absorbing aerosol layer at high altitude in which we considered in one case the vertical profile of SSA and in another case the column-averaged SSA only. The ADRF at the TOA increases when the light-absorbing aerosol layer is located above 3  km altitude. The differences between height-resolved SSA, which can be obtained from lidar data, and total layer-mean SSA indicates that the use of a layer-mean SSA can be rather misleading as it can induce a large error in the calculation of the ADRF at the TOA, which in turn may cause errors in the vertical profiles of heating rates...|$|R
