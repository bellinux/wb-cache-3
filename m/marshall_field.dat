5|$|Members of the Art Institute Board met the {{day after}} the {{incident}} and agreed not to display Mirth & Girth any further. Chairman <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field</b> also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers. After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.|$|E

Two projects carried out in the late 1920s, for Edgar W.

Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> and its divisions in 1982. It purchased the United Kingdom retail chain Argos in 1979. The company sold Kohl's grocery stores to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's,</b> as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990, Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation) purchased <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's,</b> Dillard's purchased Ivey's (another <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> division), Investcorp S.A. purchased Saks Fifth Avenue, and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).|$|R

At <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's,</b> women were not only typists or other types of clerical workers, they also had {{a major role in}} the sales department. Women sales clerks were trained in etiquette and acquired a thorough understanding of the merchandise. The presence of saleswomen was a crucial part of the success of <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's,</b> as they made female customers more comfortable and therefore made shopping at <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> fun.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006: <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> {{stores in}} Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee and Detroit take the Macy's name, ending {{the run of}} <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> - and the then-still freshly renamed Dayton's and Hudson's - as unique, upscale Midwestern {{department}} store brands.|$|R
25|$|Dayton-Hudson Corporation renamed itself Target Corporation in 2000 and renamed its Dayton's and Hudson's {{department}} stores <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> in 2001.

25|$|In 1901, <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field</b> & Company, {{previously}} {{a private}} partnership, was incorporated. Spurred on by Selfridge, <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field</b> razed the three buildings north of it {{which had been}} occupied since 1888, {{as well as the}} Dankmar Adler, (1844–1900), and Louis Sullivan, (1856–1924),-designed 1879 Central Music Hall at the southeast corner of State and Randolph Streets in 1901. In their place rose a massive, twelve-story building fronting on State Street in 1902, including a grand new entrance. In 1906, a third new building opened on Wabash Avenue north of the 1893 structure, which was then the oldest part of the store.|$|E
2500|$|After the Federated purchase, <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> {{stores were}} {{assigned}} to the new Macy's North Division. During 2006, all <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> stores, most Filene's and all the stores of nine other May-owned chains were renamed Macy's, the conversion officially opening on September 9, 2006. Hundreds of protesters gathered under <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> famous clock that day, and returned on the one-year anniversary, September 9, 2007. Dozens attended [...] "Field's Fans" [...] rallies each anniversary from 2008 to 2012.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} after <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> agreed to buy out Frederick & Nelson's and {{take control of the}} Seattle company in 1929, the Frederick & Nelson candy makers in Seattle were summoned to Chicago to {{introduce}} Frango mints to <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> to help build slumping sales during the Great Depression. Soon, the candy kitchen at <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> had produced its own Midwestern interpretation of the Frango Chocolate recipe. Although the Northwest version still uses the original Frederick & Nelson recipe, the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> recipe has been modified a few times. [...] This, as well as the use of different ingredients and equipment, would account for any difference in taste between the two versions.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{the demand}} for <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> Frango mints was far greater than demand for Macy's Frangos. No longer a unique product of Chicago's famed <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's,</b> the Macy's-branded Frangos are viewed as just another mint; at 75% off retail, sales of Frango mints under Macy's remain {{significantly}} below previous years' sales at <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's.</b> However, this may also be due to Chicagoans' hostility to Federated, Macy's and Lundgren in particular over {{the demise of the}} <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> stores and the way the stores changed after their absorption into Macy's, becoming middle-tier retailers rather than the high-end competitor that the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> stores had been during much of the 20th century. Macy's {{is considered to be a}} lower-tier retail chain than Federated's own top-tier retailer Bloomingdale's; the folding of the Field's stores into Macy's was seen by Chicagoans as both a demotion of a 150-year-old Chicago institution and an insult to the city itself, and critics urged a boycott of Macy's after the Macy's takeover.|$|R
25|$|The former {{flagship}} <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field</b> and Company Building {{location on}} State Street in the Loop of downtown Chicago was officially renamed Macy's on State Street in 2006 {{and is now}} one of four national Macy's flagship stores.|$|E

The Field Family eventually retained only a ten percent stake. Second company president, John G. Shedd retired in late 1922.|$|E

50|$|Dayton's was an American {{department}} store chain founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1902 by George Draper Dayton. In 1969, the Detroit-based J.L. Hudson Company {{merged with the}} Dayton Company to form the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, adding 21 Michigan-based stores to the total. In 1990, the {{department store}} division of Dayton-Hudson (now Target Corporation) acquired Chicago-based <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's.</b> Both Dayton's and Hudson's retained their individual store names until 2001, when they were united under the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> nameplate. Prior to changing its name to <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's,</b> Dayton's stores numbered 19, serving communities throughout the upper Midwest.|$|R
50|$|Ivey's was {{purchased}} by <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> in 1980. <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> itself would be purchased by BATUS Retail Group in 1982. Field's and its The Crescent, Frederick & Nelson, and Ivey's divisions joined other BATUS divisions, Gimbel's, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue. BATUS sold Ivey's to Dillard's in 1990, prior to the sale of <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field's</b> to Dayton Hudson Corporation. Ivey's typically offered more upscale merchandise than another Charlotte-based chain, Belk, which was a competitor to Ivey's in many Southern cities. The two chains were frequent neighbors at many malls and in many downtowns.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} was {{to include an}} office block and a first class hotel. Peck persuaded many Chicago business tycoons to go on board with him, including <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field,</b> Edson Keith, Martin A. Ryerson, Charles L. Hutchinson and George Pullman. The association hired the renowned architectural firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan to design the building. At the time, a young Frank Lloyd Wright was employed at the firm as draftsman, {{and he may have}} contributed to the design.|$|E
25|$|Field, {{the store}} he created and his {{successor}} John G. Shedd, helped establish Chicago's prominence throughout the world in business, art, culture, and education. The Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum of Natural History (as renamed in 1905 for its first major benefactor), the Museum of Science and Industry, the John G. Shedd Aquarium and the University of Chicago have all been aided by the philanthropy of Marshall Field's. <b>Marshall</b> <b>Field</b> was also a major sponsor of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E

The stadium became so densely packed {{that one of the}} temporary grandstands hastily erected to support 400 persons collapsed, injuring several persons. The game was stopped for ten minutes while order was restored, and Bartelme immediately gave the order that no more tickets were to be sold. Thousands were turned away.|$|E
