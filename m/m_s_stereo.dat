40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to (1) {{determine}} the activity profiles of a large sample of English FA Premier League soccer players and (2) examine high-intensity running during elite-standard soccer matches for players in various playing positions. Twenty-eight English FA Premier League games were analysed during the 2005 - 2006 competitive season (n = 370), using a multi-camera computerised tracking system. During a typical match, wide midfielders (3138 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 565) covered a greater distance in high-intensity running than central midfielders (2825 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 473, P = 0. 04), full-backs (2605 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 387, P < 0. 01), attackers (2341 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 575, P < 0. 01), and central defenders (1834 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 256, P < 0. 01). In the last 15 min of a game, high-intensity running distance was ∼ 20 % less than in the first 15 -min period for wide midfielders (467 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 104 vs. 589 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 134, P < 0. 01), central midfielders (429 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 106 vs. 534 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 99, P < 0. 01), full-backs (389 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 95 vs. 481 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 114, P < 0. 01), attackers (348 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 105 vs. 438 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 129, P < 0. 01), and central defenders (276 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 93 vs. 344 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 80, P < 0. 01). There was a similar distance deficit for high-intensity running with (148 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 78 vs. 193 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 96, P < 0. 01) and without ball possession (229 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 85 vs. 278 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 97, P < 0. 01) between the last 15 -min and first 15 -min period of the game. Mean recovery time between very high-intensity running bouts was 72 s (s = 28), with a 28 % longer recovery time during the last 15 min than the first 15 min of the game (83 s, s = 26 vs. 65 s, s = 20, P < 0. 01). The decline in high-intensity running immediately after the most intense 5 -min period was more evident in attackers (216 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 50 vs. 113 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 47, P < 0. 01) and central defenders (182 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 26 vs. 96 <b>m,</b> <b>s</b> = 39, P < 0. 01). The results suggest that high-intensity running with and without ball possession is reduced during various phases of elite-standard soccer matches and the activity profiles and fatigue patterns vary among playing positions. The current findings provide valuable information about the high-intensity running patterns of a large sample of elite-standard soccer players, which could be useful in the development and prescription of specific training regimes...|$|R

40|$|Coronal bright fronts (CBFs) {{are large}} scale wavefronts that {{propagate}} though the solar corona at hundreds of kilometers per second. While their kinemat- ics {{have been studied}} in detail, many questions remain regarding the temporal evolution of their amplitude and pulse width. Here, contemporaneous high ca- dence, multi-thermal observations of the solar corona from the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft are {{used to determine the}} kinematics and expansion rate of a CBF wavefront observed on 2010 August 14. The CBF was found to have a lower initial velocity with weaker deceleration in STEREO observations compared to SDO (~ 340 km s? 1 and ? 72 <b>m</b> <b>s?</b> 2 as opposed to ~ 410 km s? 1 and ? 279 <b>m</b> <b>s?</b> 2). The CBF kinematics from SDO were found to be highly passband-dependent, with an initial velocity ranging from 379 ? 12 km s? 1 to 460 ? 28 km s? 1 and accel- eration ranging from ? 128 ? 28 <b>m</b> <b>s?</b> 2 to ? 431 ? 86 <b>m</b> <b>s?</b> 2 in the 335 ?A and 304 ?A passbands respectively. These kinematics were used to estimate a quiet coronal magnetic field strength range of ~ 1 ? 2 G. Significant pulse broadening was also observed, with expansion rates of ~ 130 km <b>s?</b> 1 (<b>STEREO)</b> and ~ 220 km s? 1 (SDO). By treating the CBF as a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves within a Gaussian envelope, the resulting dispersion rate of the pulse was found to be ~ 8 ? 13 Mm 2 s? 1. These results are indicative of a fast-mode magnetoacoustic wave pulse propagating through an inhomogeneous medium...|$|R

40|$|Multi-unit {{recordings}} of muscle-nerve sympathetic activity (<b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a) or skin-nerve sympathetic activity (s. s. a) {{were made in}} the left peroneal nerve of sixteen healthy volunteers during simulated diving by immersion of the face in a tub of water. The procedure was varied by the use of different water temperatures, by diving with snorkel breathing, by apnoea without diving, and by apnoea with a stream of air against the face instead of immersion in water. Diving for 12 s elicited a pronounced activation of <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a., the mean increase from control periods being 360 %. The response was stronger with lower water temperatures. Immersion of the whole face evoked a stronger increase in <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. than immersion of mouth and nose only. Diving without apnoea elicited a significant but weaker increase in <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a., whereas apnoea only for 12 s did not influence the sympathetic outflow. Cool air against the face during apnoea for 12 s was associated with a significant increase in <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. The increase in <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. usually occurred before the bradycardia. On emersion, <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. ceased abruptly, whereas the bradycardia persisted for a few seconds. Mental arithmetic during diving did not change the <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. response but reduced the bradycardia. <b>M.</b> <b>s.</b> a. increased despite increasing blood pressure levels. On emersion, <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. did not reappear until the pre-diving blood pressure level was attained. S. s. a was inhibited on diving, with concomitant vasodilatation in the skin as recorded in the big toe. It is concluded that the response of <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. to diving is initiated by a central 'pattern recognition' of an input from facial receptors, that this input and the effects of apnoea, acting by mutual reinforcement, maintain the strong sympathetic outflow, and that the mechanism releasing <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a. on diving overrides the normal blood pressure regulatory function of <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> a.

40|$|Stereo motion vectors (SMVs) {{from the}} Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) were {{evaluated}} against Meteosat- 9 cloud-motion vectors (CMVs) over a one-year period. In general, SMVs had weaker westerlies and southerlies than CMVs at all latitudes and levels. The E-W wind comparison showed small vertical variations {{with a mean}} difference of- 0. 4 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1,- 1 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1,- 0. 7 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1 and corresponding rmsd of 2. 4 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1, 3. 8 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1, 3. 5 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1 for low-, mid-, and high-level clouds, respectively. The N-S wind discrepancies were larger and steadily increased with altitude, having a mean difference of- 0. 8 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1,- 2. 9 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1,- 4. 4 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1 and rmsd of 3. 5 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1, 6. 9 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1, 9. 5 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1 at low, mid, and high levels. The best overall agreement was found in marine stratocumulus off Namibia, while differences were larger in the Tropics and convective clouds. The SMVs were typically assigned to higher altitudes than CMVs. Attributing each observed height difference to MISR and/or Meteosat- 9 retrieval biases will require further research; nevertheless, we already identified a few regions and cloud types where CMV height assignment {{seemed to be the}} one in error. In thin mid-and high-level clouds over Africa and Arabia as well as in broken marine boundary layer clouds the 10. 8 -μm brightness temperature-based heights were often biased low due to radiance contributions from the warm surface. Contrarily, low-level CMVs in the South Atlantic were frequently assigned to mid levels by the CO 2 -slicing method in multilayer situations. We also noticed an apparent cross-swath dependence in SMVs, whereby retrievals were less accurate on {{the eastern side of the}} MISR swath than on the western side. This artifact was traced back to sub-pixel MISR co-registration errors, which introduced cross-swath biases in E-W wind, N-S wind, and height of 0. 6 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1, 2. 6 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> - 1, and 210 m.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Shrews {{previously}} {{recognized as}} Sorex monticolus were classified into two species (one with 14 subspecies, the other monotypic) {{on the basis}} of a morphometric analysis of 3610 individuals from throughout their range. Sorex m. neomexicanus has been recognized previously as a subspecies of Sorex monticolus but is recognized herein as a distinct species. This taxon occurs in the Sacramento and Capitan mountains of New Mexico. This region possibly acted as a boreal-forest refugium for S. monticolus-type shrews during the Pleistocene glaciation, and during the warmer interglacial period, after the most recent glaciation, the valleys became too arid for survival and these shrews survived in forested, montane regions of New Mexico. These mountains are sufficiently isolated from other mountainous regions in the state to reduce or eliminate gene flow between these populations of shrews. S. monticolus as defined herein exhibits relatively little morphometric variation. Even among nominate races, the only obvious morphometric variation is a north-south cline in greatest length of skull. There is a general trend of increasing size from south to north. The southern subspecies restricted to isolated mountains (<b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> monticolus and <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> parvidens) have the shortest skull lengths of all S. monticolus. The subspecies found in the northern coastal and insular areas of southeast Alaska and British Columbia (<b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> longicaudus, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> prevostensis, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> malitiosus, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> insularis, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> calvertensis, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> alascensis, and <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> elassodon) have the longest skulls. <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> setosus, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> isolatus, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> soperi, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> obscurus and <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> shumaginensis all have skulls of intermediate length. Insular and coastal populations of S. monticolus have longer skulls than the S. monticolus that occupy the mainland. Shrews with long skulls that occur on the mainland (<b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> longicaudus and <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> alascensis) also occur on some islands, and the mainland portion of their distributions are restricted to a narrow band along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia. The southernmost subspecies of S. monticolus with short skulls are restricted to small montane islands. The morphometric variation among nominate races is sufficient to warrant continued separation at the subspecies level of all taxa except <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> calvertensis and <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> elassodon. Were it not for differences in pelage color, based on my morphometric analysis, <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> calvertensis and <b>S.</b> <b>m.</b> elassodon should be synonomyzed...|$|R
