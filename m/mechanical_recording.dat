50|$|Dell Hymes {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for launching the second paradigm, which fixed the name linguistic anthropology in the 1960s, though he also coined the term ethnography of speaking (or ethnography of communication) to describe the agenda he envisioned for the field.

5000|$|In 1899, Joseph Gray {{addressed}} this {{problem with a}} mechanical voting machine that simultaneously recorded votes in its mechanism and punched those votes on a paper ballot that the voter could inspect before dropping it in a ballot box. Gray explained that [...] "in this manner we have a mechanical check for the tickets ballots, while the ticket is also a check upon the register vote counter." [...] This check is only effective, of course, {{if there is an}} audit to compare the paper and <b>mechanical</b> <b>records.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Until the mid-1920s {{records were}} played on purely <b>mechanical</b> <b>record</b> players usually {{powered by a}} wind-up spring motor. The sound was [...] "amplified" [...] by an {{external}} or internal horn that was coupled to the diaphragm and stylus, {{although there was no}} real amplification: the horn simply improved the efficiency with which the diaphragm's vibrations were transmitted into the open air. The recording process was in essence the same non-electronic setup operating in reverse, but with a recording stylus engraving a groove into a soft waxy master disc and carried slowly inward across it by a feed mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Electrical transcriptions {{were made}} {{practical}} {{by the development}} of electrical recording, which superseded Thomas Edison's original purely <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> method in the mid-1920s. Marsh Laboratories in Chicago began issuing electrical recordings on its obscure Autograph label in 1924, but it was Western Electric's superior technology, adopted by the leading labels Victor and Columbia in 1925, which launched the then-new microphone-based method into general use in the recording industry.|$|E
5000|$|Focusing on {{technologies}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> and reproduction, which North asserts did {{nothing less than}} to reorganize human perception, the author argues that the codification and stylization of the recorded media, which paradoxically served, for example, to distance and aestheticize the world while simultaneously bringing it closer and making it more familiar, are encoded in modernism's heightened awareness of writing's own literariness, which called attention to its status as mediation and thus [...] "complicated the process of representation" [...] by destabilizing the word.|$|E

50|$|The {{third and}} final section of Camera Works extends North's general {{theoretical}} framework while applying it directly to several texts by select modernist American writers, examining ways in which F.

Dubois's The Souls of Black Folk, James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man, and the novels, essays, and unpublished journalism of Ernest Hemingway negotiated visual elements stylistically and as subject of their narratives and, according to North, how these negotiations register a response to writing's confrontation with the new media, their technologies of <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> and reproduction, and, finally, modernism's own crisis of representation.|$|E

5000|$|In 1924, {{the investors}} sold Emerson to the Scranton Button Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania. About this time, {{electric}} microphones replaced <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> techniques, and Emerson {{switched to the}} new method of sound recording in 1926. Scranton Button Co. halted production of new records by its Emerson subsidiary in 1928, but the company retained the name and later applied it to a line of radios. After about 1924 or 1925, Emerson {{was no longer a}} popular label. It seldom recorded any artists of note, mostly standard performers who were jobbing around New York, which explains why the later [...] "Electrosonic Emerson" [...] records are so scarce.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phonograph}} is a device, {{invented in}} 1877, for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> and reproduction of sound. In its later forms, {{it is also}} called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910), or, since the 1940s, a record player. The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into {{the surface of a}} rotating cylinder or disc, called a [...] "record". To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. In early acoustic phonographs, the stylus vibrated a diaphragm which produced sound waves which were coupled to the open air through a flaring horn, or directly to the listener's ears through stethoscope-type earphones.|$|E

5000|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, {{music was}} {{recorded}} in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artists finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and compact disc.

40|$|Sociologists have {{increasingly}} {{come to recognize}} that the discipline has unduly privileged textual representations, but efforts to incorporate visual and other media are still only in their beginning. This paper develops an analysis of the ways objects of knowledge are translated into other media, {{in order to understand the}} visual practices of sociology and to point out unused possibilities. I argue that the discourse on visual sociology, by assuming that photographs are less objective than text, is based on an asymmetric media-determinism and on a misleading notion of objectivity. Instead, I suggest to analyse media with the concept of translations. I introduce several kinds of translations, most centrally the distinction between tight and loose ones. I show that many sciences, such as biology, focus on tight translations, using a variety of media and manipulating both research objects and representations. Sociology, in contrast, uses both tight and loose translations, but uses the latter only for texts. For visuals, sociology restricts itself to what I call ‘the documentary’: focusing on <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> technologies without manipulating either the object of research or the representation. I conclude by discussing three rare examples of what is largely excluded in sociology: visual loose translations, visual tight translations based on non-mechanical recording technologies, and visual tight translations based on <b>mechanical</b> <b>recording</b> technologies that include the manipulation of both object and representation...|$|E
