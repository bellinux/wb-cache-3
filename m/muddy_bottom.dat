500|$|In spring 2003, a {{joint project}} was {{launched}} by the Estonian Maritime Museum and the commercial diving company Tuukritööde OÜ {{with the aim of}} finding Rusalka which had sunk 110 years earlier. On 22 July 2003 the wreck of Rusalka was located in the Gulf of Finland, [...] south of Helsinki, by the museum's research vessel Mare. Two days later, deep divers Kaido Peremees and Indrek Ostrat more precisely located and videoed the wreck. Most unusually, the wreck is in a near-vertical position; following her sinking, the vessel plunged, bow first, [...] directly downward into the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom</b> of the gulf, and is buried in the bottom to almost half her length. The divers found the stern of the lost vessel rising [...] above the sea bed and her rudder turned to starboard.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{most of the}} Matagorda Bay system, Lavaca Bay has {{a mostly}} <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom</b> with large amounts of oyster reefs and spoils islands formed by the {{dredging}} of several canals. The shores are lined with grassy bluffs and a thick cover of trees. The Lavaca River enters near the Port Lavaca Causeway as it traverses Lavaca Bay from Port Lavaca to Point Comfort {{at the center of}} the bay, which is also its narrowest width. The river flows [...] southeast from its source in northeast Gonzales County, draining approximately [...] into Lavaca Bay. South of the Port Lavaca Causeway in Point Comfort, on the bay's eastern shore, a heavy industrial sector is located, which lines the coast to Cox Bay, which extends to the east. South of Cox Bay is the larger Keller Bay extension, which extends the bay to its easternmost point near Olivia. Below the extension, is a narrow peninsula, bounded by Matagorda Bay to the south, which extends west to mouth of Lavaca Bay. Across the mouth on the western shore, past the Matagorda Ship Channel, which runs through the middle of the bay to Point Comfort, the town of Magnolia Beach is found. To the northwest is the town of Alamo Beach, located on Gailinipper Point, from which a major oyster reef begins across the bay to Point Comfort. The point is located on the northeastern extreme of a headland that juts to the north, forming Chocolate Bay to the west. Port Lavaca is found north of Chocolate Bay, back at the Port Lavaca Causeway. North of the causeway is a large circular extension, forming the northern boundary of the Lavaca Bay. The northwestern extreme is formed by Garcitas Cove, fed by Garcitas Creek, which flows [...] from its source in DeWitt County. To the east is Venado Creek, which converges with the bay, northwest of the mouth of the Lavaca River.|$|E

2500|$|In the deeps of the {{geologic}} timescale the two shorelines of the Lehigh River {{occupied by}} the 19th-century towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were situated {{on the bottom of}} an ancient river-fed tarn, a mountain lake which filled the valley on the west bank and covered the relative flatlands on the east bank. The <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom</b> of that high tarn (the range then rivaling the Himalayas in size), where the waters pooled at a lower elevation amongst the twisted folds of four near-parallel ridgelines, created a level region whose settlements became the relatively flat lands on either bank of the Lehigh. The ridgelines, which run east-northeast to west-southwest, are (from north to south) Broad, Nesquehoning, Pisgah, and Mauch Chunk ridges (or Mountains)each of which runs over [...] west to the gaps cut by the Schuylkill River.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the storm}} had abated, the men built a raft from planks and barrels and sent two men to shore. The raft broke up in the waves, and both men drowned. After making a second, more solid, raft, the others {{were able to make}} it safely to shore. Over the next few days they {{returned}} to the ship daily to retrieve cargo, managing to salvage some of La Salle's papers and clothes, barrels of flour, casks of wine, glass beads, and other trade items. Before long, however, a strong southerly wind drove the hull into the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom,</b> and soon only the rear deck remained above water. Of the 27people originally assigned to the ship, the only survivors were Tessier, a priest, a military officer, a regular soldier, a servant girl, and a small boy. They remained on the peninsula for three months, as the only way to the fort was to walk through Karankawa territory. [...] After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of any assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

Her gaskets were off, her sails unfurled; she was just starting back to the United States.

60|$|The next {{lesson was}} more interesting, {{the lesson of}} {{catching}} fish. The school was a quiet, shallow pool with a <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom</b> against which the fish showed clearly, and with a convenient stub leaning over it from which to swoop. The old birds had caught a score of minnows, killed them, and dropped them here and there under the stub. Then they brought the young birds, showed them their game, and told them by repeated examples to dive and get it. The little fellows were hungry and took to the sport keenly; but one was timid, and only after the mother had twice dived and brought up a fish--which she showed to the timid one and then dropped back in a most tantalizing way--did he muster up resolution to take the plunge.|$|E
6000|$|Slowly but perceptibly, in truth, the bow was rising, {{and above}} the {{whistling}} of the wind I could hear his chattering as she settled.... Then several things happened simultaneously: an agonized cry behind me, distant shouts from the shore, a sudden upward lunge of the bow, and the torture of being submerged, inch by inch, in the icy, yellow water. Despite the splashing behind me, I sat as though paralyzed until I was waist deep and the boards turned under me, and then, with a spasmodic contraction of my whole being I struck out--only to find my feet on the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom.</b> Such was the inglorious end of the good ship Petrel! For she went down, with all hands, {{in little more than}} half a fathom of water.... It was not until then I realized that we had been blown clear across the pond! ...|$|E

60|$|From Crowland the marauders proceeded, taking Turgar with them, {{to another}} large and wealthy abbey in the neighborhood, which they plundered and destroyed, {{as they had}} the abbey at Crowland. Sidroc made Turgar his own attendant, keeping him always near him. When the {{expedition}} had completed their second conquest, they packed the valuables which they had obtained from both abbeys in wagons, and moved toward the south. It happened {{that some of these}} wagons were under Count Sidroc's charge, and were {{in the rear of the}} line of march. In passing a ford, the wheels of one of these rear wagons sank in the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom,</b> and the horses, in attempting to draw the wagon out, became entangled and restive. While Sidroc's whole attention was engrossed by this difficulty, Turgar contrived to steal away unobserved. He hid himself in a neighboring wood, and, with a degree of sagacity and discretion remarkable in a boy of his years, he contrived to find his way back to the smoking ruins of his home at the Abbey of Crowland.|$|E
60|$|A frog {{is like an}} ostrich. When he sees nothing, {{because his}} head is hidden, he thinks nothing can see him. At the sudden alarm Mother Quoskh would stretch her neck, {{watching}} the frog's flight; then turn her head so that her long bill pointed directly at the bump on the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom,</b> which marked the hiding place of Chigwooltz, and croak softly as a signal. At the sound {{one of the young}} herons would hurry forward eagerly; follow his mother's bill, which remained motionless, pointing all the while; twist his head till he saw the frog's back in the mud, and then lunge at it like lightning. Generally he got his frog, and through your glass you would see the unfortunate creature wriggling and kicking his way into Quoskh's yellow beak. If the lunge missed, the mother's keen eye followed the frog's frantic rush through the mud, with a longer trail this time behind him, till he hid again; whereupon she croaked the same youngster up for another try, and then the whole family moved jerkily along, like a row of boys on stilts, to the next clump of lily pads.|$|E

6000|$|Speaking of the fishes {{reminds me}} of a queer little inset upon that great world-dreaming. The odd fate of the crew of the {{submarine}} vessel B 94 has always seemed memorable to me. So far as I know, they were the only men alive who never saw that veil of green drawn across the world. All the while that the stillness held above, they were working into the mouth of the Elbe, past the booms and the mines, very slowly and carefully, a sinister crustacean of steel, explosive crammed, along the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom.</b> They trailed a long clue that was to guide their fellows from the mother ship floating awash outside. Then in the long channel beyond the forts they came up at last to mark down their victims and get air. That must have been before the twilight of dawn, for they tell of the brightness of the stars. They were amazed to find themselves not three hundred yards from an ironclad that had run ashore in the mud, and heeled over with the falling tide. It was afire amidships, but no one heeded that--no one in all that strange clear silence heeded that--and not only this wrecked vessel, but all the dark ships lying about them, it seemed to their perplexed and startled minds must be full of dead men! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{number of}} the mammiferous remains {{embedded}} in the Pampas is, as I have remarked, wonderful: it should be borne in mind that they have almost exclusively {{been found in the}} cliffs and steep banks of rivers, and that, until lately, they excited no attention amongst the inhabitants: I am firmly convinced that a deep trench could not be cut in any line across the Pampas, without intersecting the remains of some quadruped. It is difficult to form an opinion in what part of the Pampas they are most numerous; in a limited spot they could not well have been more numerous than they were at P. Alta; the number, however, lately found by Senor F. Muniz, near Luxan, in a central spot in the Pampas, is extraordinarily great: {{at the end of this}} chapter I will give a list of all the localities at which I have heard of remains having been discovered. Very frequently the remains consist of almost perfect skeletons; but there are, also, numerous single bones, as for instance at St. Fe. Their state of preservation varies much, even when embedded near each other: I saw none others so perfectly preserved as the heads of the Toxodon and Mylodon from the white soft earthy bed on the Sarandis in Banda Oriental. It is remarkable that in two limited sections I found no less than five teeth separately embedded, and I heard of teeth having been similarly found in other parts: may we suppose that the skeletons or heads were for a long time gently drifted by currents over the soft <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom,</b> and that the teeth occasionally, here and there, dropped out? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took a walk}} on Spaulding's Farm {{the other}} afternoon. I saw the setting sun {{lighting}} up {{the opposite side of}} a stately pine wood. Its golden rays straggled into the aisles of the wood as into some noble hall. I was impressed as if some ancient and altogether admirable and shining family had settled there {{in that part of the}} land called Concord, unknown to me,--to whom the sun was servant,--who had not gone into society in the village,--who had not been called on. I saw their park, their pleasure-ground, beyond through the wood, in Spaulding's cranberry-meadow. The pines furnished them with gables as they grew. Their house was not obvious, to vision; the trees grew through it. I do not know whether I heard the sounds of a suppressed hilarity or not. They seemed to recline on the sunbeams. They have sons and daughters. They are quite well. The farmer's cart-path, which leads directly through their hall, does not in the least put them out,--as the <b>muddy</b> <b>bottom</b> of a pool is sometimes seen through the reflected skies. They never heard of Spaulding, and do not know that he is their neighbor,--notwithstanding I heard him whistle as he drove his team through the house. Nothing can equal the serenity of their lives. Their coat of arms is simply a lichen. I saw it painted on the pines and oaks. Their attics were in the tops of the trees. They are of no politics. There was no noise of labor. I did not perceive that they were weaving or spinning. Yet I did detect, when the wind lulled and hearing was done away, the finest imaginable sweet musical hum,--as of a distant hive in May, which perchance was the sound of their thinking. They had no idle thoughts, and no one without could see their work, for their industry was not as in knots and excrescences embayed.|$|E
