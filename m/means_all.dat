25|$|The {{salivary glands}} of some species however, are {{modified}} to produce proteins; salivary amylase {{is found in}} many, but by no <b>means</b> <b>all,</b> bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{written form}} of Portuguese used in Brazil is {{regulated by the}} Brazilian Academy of Letters and is sometimes called Brazilian Portuguese (although the term primarily <b>means</b> <b>all</b> dialects spoken in Brazil as a whole). In Portugal, the language is regulated by the Sciences Academy of Lisbon, Class of Letters, which shapes the standard spelling set of norms associated with European Portuguese. This written variation is the one preferred by Portuguese African and Asian ex-colonies, including Cabo Verde, Mozambique, Angola, Timor-Leste, Macau and Goa.|$|E

25|$|Eton {{is one of}} the {{original}} seven public schools as defined by the Public Schools Act 1868. Following the public school tradition, Eton is a full boarding school, which <b>means</b> <b>all</b> pupils live at the school, and it is one of four such remaining single-sex boys' public schools in the United Kingdom (the others being Harrow, Radley, and Winchester) to continue this practice. Eton has educated 19 British prime ministers and generations of the aristocracy and has been referred to as the chief nurse of England's statesmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{observations were}} made by {{a team led by}} Thomas Breuer of the Wildlife Conservation Society in September 2005. Gorillas are now known to use tools in the wild. A female gorilla in the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo was recorded using a stick as if to gauge the depth of water whilst crossing a swamp. A second female was seen using a tree stump as a bridge and also as a support whilst fishing in the swamp. This <b>means</b> <b>all</b> of the great apes are now known to use tools.|$|E
25|$|Evangelical Christians {{believe that}} {{religious}} pluralism is heresy and contradicts the Bible. Some Christians {{have argued that}} religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some, but by no <b>means</b> <b>all,</b> Christians hold such pluralism to be logically impossible. Roman Catholicism believes that while it is the fullest and most complete revelation of God to Man, other Christian denominations have also received genuine revelation from God, although partial and incomplete.|$|E

25|$|All {{nations in}} the Darkness series are monarchies with the {{exception}} of Kuusamo, in which seven princes have a hereditary power-sharing arrangement. While by no <b>means</b> <b>all</b> absolute monarchies, in all of them kings (or princes in Kuusamo) seem to have the executive power. There are foreign ministers, but no prime ministers and no cabinets - a foreign minister evidently reporting directly to the King. None of the people have family names, even if they are members of the nobility. To the extent that monarchs are limited in their power, the limitation comes mainly from hereditary aristocracies which still maintain many privileges of feudal times.|$|E
25|$|The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is {{a central}} {{component}} of the Australian healthcare system. The scheme provides reimbursement to community pharmacy for the costs of dispensing prescription medicines prescribed {{in accordance with the}} PBS Schedule, a comprehensive but closed formulary. Drugs are added to the formulary on the basis of an assessment of comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness compared to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice. The result is that where {{there is no evidence of}} incremental benefit, a drug may not be listed at a higher price than the comparator with the result that for many (but by no <b>means</b> <b>all)</b> drugs the prices for subsidy purposes are a great deal cheaper than in many other major markets.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{translation of}} the New Testament into an Egyptian Coptic version — the Sahidic of the late 2nd century — uses the Alexandrian text as a Greek base; although other 2nd and 3rd century translations — into Old Latin and Syriac tend rather {{to conform to the}} Western text-type. Although the overwhelming majority of later minuscule manuscripts conform to the Byzantine text-type; detailed study has, from time to time, identified individual minuscules that transmit the alternative Alexandrian text. Around 17 such manuscripts have been discovered so far — consequently the Alexandrian text-type is witnessed by around 30 surviving manuscripts — by no <b>means</b> <b>all</b> of which are associated with Egypt, although that area is where Alexandrian witnesses are most prevalent.|$|E

25|$|A {{key feature}} of ObjC is {{its support for}} categories, methods that {{can be added to}} extend classes at runtime. Categories allow {{extending}} classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original source code. An example might be to add spell checker support to the base NSString class, which <b>means</b> <b>all</b> instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed extensions, and declared with the keyword extension. Unlike ObjC, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types and enums to extant instances.|$|E
25|$|A {{voyage to}} explore {{the east coast of}} New Holland, with a view to a British {{colonization}} of the country, had been recommended in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744–1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour: The first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted it, to come to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this <b>means</b> <b>all</b> the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; and we might know as well, and as certainly, as the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer our Expectations.|$|E
25|$|Goals {{are related}} in a {{hierarchical}} format {{where you find}} some goals are dependent on other sub goals {{for them to be}} complete which <b>means</b> <b>all</b> the sub goals must be achieved for the main goal to be achieved. There is other goals where only one of the goals need to be fulfilled for the main goal to be achieved. In goal modelling, there is use of deontic operator which falls in between the context and achieved state. Goals apply to tasks, milestones, resource roles and resources as well and can be considered as action rule for at task. EEML rules were also possible to although the goal modelling requires much more consultation in finding the connections between rules on the different levels. Goal-oriented analysis focuses on the description and evaluation of alternatives and their relationship to the organisational objectives.|$|E
