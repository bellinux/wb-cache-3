50|$|The Reflex 500mm 8 lens is a supertelephoto <b>mirror</b> <b>lens</b> of high optical quality which {{shares the}} unique {{characteristics}} of all mirror lenses {{with a central}} obstruction. Since its aperture is fixed at 8, it lacks FD signals and controls. It must be used in manual or stopped-down metering mode.|$|E

50|$|Austin's 10-h.p. {{four-seater}} phaeton {{was called}} Sirdar. It was supplied fitted with leather upholstery and horsehair cushions. A Cape hood was fitted and side curtains. There was a double folding glass screen with brass fittings, a spare wheel and tyre, Lucas paraffin side and tail lamps and Solar <b>mirror</b> <b>lens</b> acetylene headlamps with separate generator. A speedometer and mileage recorder, horn, tyre pump, lifting jack, kit of tools and accessories were all supplied.|$|E
50|$|The Minolta/Sony Reflex 500mm lens is {{the only}} {{production}} <b>mirror</b> <b>lens</b> designed to auto focus with an SLR camera. There are other mirror lenses that can mount onto current mounts such as Canon EF-mount and Nikon F-mount, but all of these mirror lenses are manual focus only. Only this lens can have its focus controlled by the camera's autofocus motor in conjunction with TTL autofocus sensing. In terms of the Minolta AF and subsequent Sony α SLR systems, this lens is an anomaly, being the only lens guaranteed to auto focus at 8. Minolta also produced a V-mount 400 mm f/8 Reflex lens that can autofocus at 8, but only the Minolta Vectis S-1, Minolta Vectis S-100 and Minolta Dimâge RD 3000 can use it.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of catadioptric systems (panoramic mirror lenses) {{is that because}} one uses mirrors to bend the light rays instead of lenses (like fish eye), the image has almost no chromatic aberrations or distortions. The image, {{a reflection of the}} surface on the mirror, {{is in the form of}} a doughnut to which software is applied in order to create a flat panoramic picture. Such software is normally supplied by the company who produces the system. Because the complete panorama is imaged at once, dynamic scenes can be captured without problems. Panoramic video can be captured and has found applications in robotics and journalism. The <b>mirror</b> <b>lens</b> system uses only a partial section of the digital camera's sensor and therefore some pixels are not used. Recommendations are always to use a camera with a high pixel count in order to maximize the resolution of the final image.|$|E

50|$|Dedicated {{photographic}} <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> {{fell out}} of favor in the 1980s for various reasons. However, commercial reflector astronomical Maksutov-Cassegrain and Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with 14 to 20 inch (or even larger) diameter primary mirrors are available. With an accessory camera adapter, they are 4000mm f/11 to f/8 equivalent.|$|R
50|$|The Minolta SR-2 is well {{built and}} {{thoroughly}} constructed; including features that remained {{characteristic of the}} Minolta SLR camera range to follow until {{the advent of the}} auto focus cameras in the 1980s. The main features are a single stroke wind-on lever; an instant return mirror and a sturdy three-pronged bayonet lens mount with an internal automatic aperture stop-down mechanism. This mount is the earliest example of a modern 35mm SLR bayonet lens mount, used throughout the entire lifespan of the Minolta manual focus camera area. The automatic aperture mechanism on this camera does not reopen the aperture after exposure, a feature at the time regarded as unnecessary, since the darkened finder might indicate the camera not being made ready for the next exposure. The SR-2 was joined a year later by the budget model SR-1, and was replaced in 1960 by the improved SR-3. This range was complemented by an increasing selection of high quality Minolta SR mount Rokkor lenses, within a few years ranging from 35mm to 600mm, and an RF 800mm f8 <b>mirror</b> <b>lens</b> in 1960, some of these even multicoated from the very start.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{explore the}} {{potential}} of a supercritical angle (SA) objective for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). This novel microscope objective combines tight focusing by an aspheric lens with strong axial confinement of supercritical angle fluorescence collection by a parabolic <b>mirror</b> <b>lens,</b> resulting in a small detection volume. The tiny axial extent of the detection volume features an excellent surface sensitivity, as is demonstrated by diffusion measurements in model membranes with an excess of free dye in solution. All SA-FCS measurements are directly compared to standard confocal FCS, demonstrating a clear advantage of SA-FCS, especially for diffusion measurements in membranes. We present an extensive theoretical framework that allows for accurate and quantitative evaluation of the SA-FCS correlation curves...|$|E

40|$|The article {{considers}} a multi-element feed {{consisting of the}} circular waveguides. This feed {{can be used to}} excite antennas of various types, for example a <b>mirror,</b> <b>lens</b> or phased antenna arrays with spatial excitation. The feed of this type should be used in cases when it is necessary to form a multi-beam radiation pattern {{in which there is a}} minimum angular distance between the beams. Besides, in some cases for reasons of design to use the weak radiation pattern antenna of other types is inappropriate. The paper for the first time provides calculating the multi-element feed patterns, obtaining the new results, and studies the differences in radiation pattern characteristics of a single waveguide and a waveguide in the presence of the similar ones. CAD was used to conduct the study based on the finite difference method in the time domain and on the finite element one...|$|E
