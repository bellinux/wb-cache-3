50|$|The {{class was}} {{undergoing}} {{a series of}} confidence-building exercises before their graduation in late October when Cramer {{was involved in a}} training accident on October 21, 1957. During an ambush drill, a Vietnamese soldier near Cramer was readying to throw a lit block of <b>melinite</b> (French military explosive)when it prematurely detonated. The <b>melinite</b> was later determined to have deteriorated in storage and was unstable. Cramer died instantly {{and other members of the}} team and their students were wounded.|$|E
50|$|The mine weighs 5.5 lb and is overall 8.25 in high. The metal {{supporting}} plate measures 6.4 in by 4 in. The explosive charge consists of 5 ounces of <b>Melinite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jane Avril (9 June 186817 January 1943) was a French can-can dancer {{made famous}} by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec through his paintings. Extremely thin, 'given to jerky {{movements}} and sudden contortions', she was nicknamed La <b>Mélinite,</b> after an explosive.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} in 1858 of rifled bores replaced Smooth-bore rifles, {{and extended}} {{the reach of}} projectiles to 2,500m. Then <b>melinite</b> replaced gunpowder in 1885, which increased the blast of explosions, and forts of the Loyasse generation become obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Gros Andreau bombs proved {{effective}} and relatively {{safe to use}} and were first dropped on Karlsruhe on 22 June 1916, being withdrawn from use in 1918 and replaced with bombs filled with <b>Melinite</b> (picric acid and guncotton) and Mononitronaphthalene known as MMN bombs.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, Turpin sued Jules Verne for basing Thomas Roch {{from the}} Facing the Flag novel {{on him and}} the <b>Melinite</b> explosive. Verne, defended by Raymond Poincaré, was found innocent; his letter to his brother Paul however {{confirms}} the character was indeed based on Turpin.|$|E
50|$|At midnight, {{having failed}} to remove the bandits, French {{authorities}} succeeded in positioning {{one and a half}} kilograms of <b>melinite</b> in the house. The resulting explosion rendered the structure's inhabitants unconscious, and Garnier was then executed by a 9 mm shot to the right temple. Both men were buried in unmarked graves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fancy name}} [...] "melimelonite", {{based on the}} French word for 'mishmash', [...] "méli-mélo", may be a {{reference}} to <b>melinite,</b> a high explosive composed of picric acid and guncotton adopted by the French army in 1887; and perhaps also to melon, an heptazine polymer described by Berzelius in 1830, whose structure remained a chemical puzzle until the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|In 1885, {{based on}} {{research}} of Hermann Sprengel, Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887 the French government adopted it under the name <b>Melinite,</b> with addition of gun cotton. Since 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an improved formula known as Schimose.|$|E
50|$|New {{missiles}} using nitrocellulose, {{introduced in}} 1883, were shown in tests at Kummersdorf {{to be effective}} against standard fortifications. A still stronger explosive material - <b>melinite</b> - was introduced in 1886 by France and 1888 by Germany. As a consequence the Commission worked from 1885-1887 on strengthening the Prussian fort system. The conclusion was that the artillery {{had to be more}} distributed rather than being concentrated in forts, and the forts themselves were to be defended from attack from all sides, serving as strong points of infantry resistance, largely using machine guns. The role of linear fortifications was reduced to a minimum.|$|E
50|$|Shimose {{developed}} a new explosive based on a form of picric acid used by France as <b>melinite</b> and by Britain as lyddite. The new explosive was more stable than picric acid, and generated more heat and blast power than any other explosive available at the time. It also does not produce much smoke, which was an important advantage over normal gunpowder in combat. Shimose powder {{was adopted by the}} Imperial Japanese Navy from 1893, not only for naval artillery, but also for naval mines, depth charges and torpedo warheads. It {{played an important role in}} the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, in August 1914, in {{response}} to the then acute shortage of artillery ammunition Renault suggested that car factories such as Renault could manufacture 75mm shells using hydraulic presses rather than with the usual longer and costlier lathe operations. Identical methods were also used by Andre Citroen in his own factory. The resulting shells helped overcome the shortages, but as they had to be manufactured in two pieces they were inherently weak at the base thus sometimes letting hot gases detonate the <b>melinite</b> inside the shell. Over 600 French 75mm guns were destroyed by premature explosions in 1915, and their crews killed or injured.|$|E
50|$|The lead {{elements}} of the Wehrmacht 1st Cavalry Division, the only horsed cavalry division in the German army, all others having converted to armoured cars and tanks, arrived at the river at Saumur just before midnight on 18 June with reconnaissance units riding motorcycles with sidecars, followed by armoured cars. A 25 mm gun manned by Cadet Hoube scored the first hit. It {{was the start of}} the battle that was to continue until 20 June. The French blew the Pont Napoleon at Saumur just after midnight, the Montsoreau bridge at 1:15 am and 1,700 kilos of <b>melinite</b> destroyed the railway bridge to the east of Saumur at 3:00 am.|$|E
50|$|Although {{smokeless}} powders {{were used}} as a propellant, {{they could not be}} used as the substance for the explosive warhead, because shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in the artillery barrel at the time of firing. Picric acid was the first high-explosive nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eugène Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887, the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name <b>Melinite.</b> In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name Lyddite.|$|E
50|$|The French 75 {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the first modern artillery piece. It was the first field gun to include a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, which kept the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since it {{did not need to be}} re-aimed after each shot, the crew could reload and fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position. In typical use, the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target, either shrapnel or <b>melinite</b> high-explosive, up to about 8500 m away. Its firing rate could even reach close to 30 rounds per minute, albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese fleets had practised gunnery {{regularly}} {{since the}} beginning of the war, using sub-calibre adapters in their guns and gaining more experience than the Russians. The Japanese also used mostly high-explosive shells with shimose (<b>melinite),</b> which was designed to explode on contact and wreck the upper structures of ships. The Russians used armour-piercing rounds with small guncotton bursting charges and unreliable fuses. Japanese hits caused more damage to Russian ships relative to Russian hits on Japanese ships, setting the superstructures, the paintwork and the large quantities of coal stored on the decks on fire. (The Russian fleet often bought low-quality coal at sea from merchant vessels on most of their long voyage due to the lack of friendly fuelling ports).|$|E
50|$|Following {{publication}} of the book, Verne was sued by the chemist Eugène Turpin, inventor of the explosive <b>Melinite,</b> who recognized himself {{in the character of}} Roch and was not amused. Turpin had tried to sell his invention to the French government, which in 1885 refused it, though later purchasing it (it was extensively used in the First World War); but Turpin had never gone mad, nor did he ever offer his invention to any but the Government of France, so he had some justified grievance. Verne was successfully defended by Raymond Poincaré, later president of France. A letter to Verne's brother Paul seems to suggest, however, that after all Turpin was indeed the model for Roch. The character of Roch and his revolutionary powerful explosive might also have been inspired by the real-life Alfred Nobel who invented dynamite and later reportedly regretted having introduced such a destructive force into the world.|$|E
50|$|The first cannon {{to contain}} all 'modern' {{features}} {{is generally considered}} to be the French 75 of 1897. It was the first field gun to include a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, which kept the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since it {{did not need to be}} re-aimed after each shot, the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position. In typical use, the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target, either shrapnel or <b>melinite</b> high-explosive, up to about 5 miles (8,500 m) away. Its firing rate could even reach close to 30 rounds per minute, albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew. These were rates that contemporary bolt action rifles could not match. The gun used cased ammunition, was breech-loading, had modern sights, a self-contained firing mechanism and hydro-pneumatic recoil dampening.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Bar-le-Duc, Meuse, France, Raymond Poincaré {{was the son}} of Nicolas Antonin Hélène Poincaré, a {{distinguished}} civil servant and meteorologist. Raymond was also the cousin of Henri Poincaré, the famous mathematician. Educated at the University of Paris, Raymond was called to the Paris Bar, and was for some time law editor of the Voltaire. Extremely ambitious and hard-working with a ferocious desire to be the best at everything he did, he become at the age of 20 the youngest lawyer in France. and was appointed Secrétaire de la Conférence du Barreau de Paris. As a lawyer, he successfully defended Jules Verne in a libel suit presented against the famous author by the chemist, Eugène Turpin, inventor of the explosive <b>melinite,</b> who claimed that the [...] "mad scientist" [...] character in Verne's book Facing the Flag was based on him. At the age of 26, Poincaré was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, making him the youngest deputy in the entire chamber.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} of military counterintelligence, alias the [...] "Statistics Section" [...] (SR), should be noted. Spying {{as a tool}} for secret war was a novelty as an organised activity in the late 19th century. The Statistics Section was created in 1871 but consisted {{of only a handful of}} officers and civilians. Its head in 1894 was Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Sandherr, a graduate of Saint-Cyr, an Alsatian from Mulhouse, and a convinced anti-Semite. Its military mission was clear: to retrieve information about potential enemies of France and to feed them false information. The Statistics Section was supported by the [...] "Secret Affairs" [...] of the Quai d'Orsay at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was headed by a young diplomat, Maurice Paléologue. The arms race created an acute atmosphere of intrigue in French counter-espionage from 1890. One of the missions of the section was to spy on the German Embassy at Rue de Lille in Paris to thwart any attempt to transmit important information to the Germans. This was especially critical since several cases of espionage had already hit the headlines of newspapers, which were fond of sensationalism. Thus in 1890 the archivist Boutonnet was convicted for selling plans of shells that used <b>melinite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Picric acid was {{the first}} high {{explosive}} nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. Nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose (guncotton) were available earlier but shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in the artillery barrel {{at the time of}} firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eugène Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name <b>Melinite.</b> In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an [...] "improved" [...] formula known as shimose powder. In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with picric acid become highly unstable if the compound reacts with metal shell or fuze casings to form metal picrates which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of picric acid was demonstrated in the Halifax Explosion. Picric acid was used in the Battle of Omdurman, Second Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. [...] Germany began filling artillery shells with TNT in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.|$|E
40|$|In {{this picture}} {{we see a}} number of Japanese artillerymen placing one of the 500 -pound shells on a small track, by means of which it will be drawn along the little narrow-gauge {{railroad}} {{to one of the}} immense siege guns. These enormous shells, when directed at the forts, tore gaping holes in the parapets, and, according to the testimony of General Stoessel, they had a terrible effect both on the solid rock and masonry and on the morale of the Russian soldiers, who saw the "impregnable" forts melt and crumble away under this awful bombardment. The mortars from which these shells were fired had a bore of eleven inches, or twenty-eight centimeters. The shells were designed to burst on contact. They were loaded with a high explosive, the invention of the Japanese, Dr. Shimose, and corresponding in its terrific effect to the American maximite, the English lyddite and the French <b>melinite.</b> Original format: 1 photomechanical print on stereo card : halftone, stereograph, color; 9 x 18 c...|$|E
