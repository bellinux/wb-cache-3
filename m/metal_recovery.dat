25|$|A {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) is a device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy {{by the action of}} microorganisms. These electrochemical cells are constructed using either a bioanode and/or a biocathode. Most MFCs contain a membrane to separate the compartments of the anode (where oxidation takes place) and the cathode (where reduction takes place). The electrons produced during oxidation are transferred directly to an electrode or, to a redox mediator species. The electron flux is moved to the cathode. The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an ionic membrane. Most MFCs use an organic electron donor that is oxidised to produce CO2, protons and electrons. Other electron donors have been reported, such as sulphur compounds or hydrogen. The cathode reaction uses a variety of electron acceptors that includes the reduction of oxygen as the most studied process. However, other electron acceptors have been studied, including <b>metal</b> <b>recovery</b> by reduction, water to hydrogen, nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction.|$|E

Further study demonstrates that direct leaching of the ore is effective both in chloride as well [...] as in sulfate oxidizing solutions coupled with separating of leached solid components by flotation. Three variants of the ore processing with ferric chloride or fenic sulfate leaching are analyzed: one flowsheet with direct ore leaching in ferric chloride solution followed by leaching-flotation step, with subsequent zinc separation in a solvent extraction step and electrolysis in chloride solution; and two flowsheets of direct ore leaching with ferric sulfate solution followed by a leaching-flotation step, with zinc sulfate electrolysis and other <b>metals</b> <b>recovery</b> in chloride leaching sreps.

The recovery efficiency of Cu and Pb for SCWO pre-treatment at 420 C was 99. 8 % and 80 %, respectively, whereas most of the Sn and Cr were immobilized in the residue. The recovery of all studied metals was enhanced by SCWD pre-treatment and increased along with pre-treatment temperature.
