25|$|Current <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> rarely {{takes into}} account {{circular}} migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E

It is shown that optimal file migration is able to generate substantial cost improvement under certain conditions and that it is robust both with respect to the initial file allocation at an initial system design/reorganization point and to impreciseness of system environments. This analysis should provide system designers and administrators guidance toward achieving effective file migration control. file migration, dynamic file placement, Markov decision model, optimal policies, analytic properties, distributed computer systems...|$|R
