40|$|A fast mode collisionless {{bow shock}} is a {{permanent}} feature of the solar wind interaction with the earth. The shock is approximately stationary in earth coordinates, its structure, however, changes in space due to different [MATH] values, and in time, due to different solar wind conditions (Mach number M and β, Te/T 1 [...] .). The earth's bow shock has revealed itself as an impressive tool for studying collisionless shock waves. After the large theoretical efforts in studying collisionless shock waves, in the past, it is possible, today, to verify experimentally that different dissipation mechanisms are at work in different plasma regimes. The extensive examination of bow shock morphology allow us, today, to correlate distinctions in bow shock structure, revealed {{by a variety of}} diagnostics, with M, β and Bn in the solar wind. For quasi parallel geometries and apparently for any M and β, the shock layer broadens and breacks up, showing limited level of plasma wave noise and <b>marked</b> <b>precursor</b> effects. For quasi perpendicular shock waves, on the contrary, electromagnetic turbulence increases with β, almost independent of M; while electrostatic noise level increase with M, almost independent of β.

40|$|We perform Monte-Carlo {{simulations}} {{to analyse}} {{the structure and}} microscopic dynamics of a viscous Lennard-Jones liquid coupled to a quenched reference configuration of the same liquid. The coupling between the two replicas is introduced via a field epsilon conjugate to the overlap Q between the two particle configurations. This allows us to study the evolution of various static and dynamic correlation functions across the (epsilon, T) equilibrium phase diagram. As the temperature is decreased, we identify increasingly <b>marked</b> <b>precursors</b> of a first-order phase transition between a low-Q and a high-Q phase induced by the field epsilon. We show in particular that both static and dynamic susceptibilities have a maximum at a temperature-dependent value of the coupling field, which defines a `Widom line'. We also show that, in the high-overlap regime, diffusion and structural relaxation are strongly decoupled because single particle motion mostly occurs via discrete hopping on the sites defined by the reference configuration. These results, obtained using conventional numerical tools, provide encouraging signs that an equilibrium phase transition exists in coupled viscous liquids, but also demonstrate that important numerical challenges must be overcome to obtain more conclusive numerical evidence.

Multiplication of the α-synuclein gene locus increases α-synuclein expression and causes PD. Thus, overexpression of wild-type α-synuclein is toxic.

Our {{data show that}} α-synuclein compromises autophagy via Rab 1 a inhibition and Rab 1 a overexpression rescues the autophagy defect caused by α-synuclein. Inhibition of autophagy by α-synuclein overexpression or Rab 1 a knockdown causes mislocalization of the autophagy protein, Atg 9, and decreases omegasome formation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} spleen {{has important}} functions in immunity and haematopoiesis but {{little is known}} about the events that occur during its early embryonic development. Here we analyse the origin of the cells that gives rise to the splenic mesenchyme and the process by which the precursors assume their position along the left lateral side of the stomach. We report a highly conserved regulatory element that regulates the Nkx 2 - 5 gene throughout early spleen development. A transgenic mouse line carrying this element driving a reporter gene was used to show that morphogenesis of the spleen initiates bilaterally and posterior to the stomach, before the splenic precursors grow preferentially leftward. In addition the transgenic line was used in an organ culture system to track spleen precursor cells during development. Spleen cells were shown to move from the posterior mesenchyme and track along the left side of the stomach. Removal of tissue from the anterior stomach resulted in splenic cells randomly scattering suggesting a guidance role for the anterior stomach. Using a mouse line carrying a conditional Cre recombinase to <b>mark</b> early <b>precursor</b> cell populations, the spleen was found to derive from posterior mesenchyme distinct from the closely adjacent stomach mesenchyme...|$|R
40|$|Following antigen encounter, {{activated}} T {{cells can}} {{give rise to}} functionally distinct T cell subsets. Understanding how different T cell subsets arise requires technologies that can monitor the developmental potential of single precursor cells (chapter 2). This thesis describes the {{development and use of}} two novel genetic tagging strategies aimed at following cell differentiation in vivo. These strategies are based on the <b>marking</b> of <b>precursor</b> cells with unique DNA sequences (barcodes), following which cell fate is analyzed by barcode comparison of different daughter populations. The first technology, termed cellular barcoding, makes use of a retroviral barcode library to provide T cells with unique genetic tags via in vitro transduction. Cellular barcoding was used to analyze the kinship of diverse T cell populations (chapter 3 - 5) as well as to measure the clonality of antigen-specific T cell responses under varying conditions of infection (chapter 6). The second technology, termed in vivo barcoding, makes use of a transgenic mouse model in which unique DNA sequences are introduced via inducible VDJ recombination. The feasibility of in vivo barcoding was demonstrated by conditionally labeling lung and liver cells with different barcodes (chapter 7). Together, these studies have yielded important new insights for vaccine optimization. Promotor: T. N. M. SchumacherWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} pancreas, the endocrine cell {{types of}} the islets of Langerhans, including the α-, β-, δ-, and pancreatic polypeptide cells {{as well as}} the exocrine cells, derive from foregut endodermal progenitors. Recent genetic studies have identified a network of transcription factors, including Pdx 1, Isl 1, Pax 4, Pax 6, NeuroD, Nkx 2. 2, and Hlxb 9, regulating the development of islet cells at different stages, but the molecular mechanisms controlling the specification of pancreatic endocrine precursors remain unknown. neurogenin 3 (ngn 3) is a member of a family of basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors that is involved in the determination of neural precursor cells in the neuroectoderm. ngn 3 is expressed in discrete regions of the nervous system and in scattered cells in the embryonic pancreas. We show herein that ngn 3 -positive cells coexpress neither insulin nor glucagon, suggesting that ngn 3 <b>marks</b> early <b>precursors</b> of pancreatic endocrine cells. Mice lacking ngn 3 function fail to generate any pancreatic endocrine cells and die postnatally from diabetes. Expression of Isl 1, Pax 4, Pax 6, and NeuroD is lost, and endocrine precursors are lacking in the mutant pancreatic epithelium.

40|$|Ectopic {{pancreas}} is {{a developmental}} anomaly occasionally found in humans. Hes 1, a main effector of Notch signaling, regulates the fate and differentiation of many cell types during development. To gain {{insights into the}} role of the Notch pathway in pancreatic fate determination, we combined the use of Hes 1 -knockout mice and lineage tracing employing the Cre/loxP system to specifically <b>mark</b> pancreatic <b>precursor</b> cells and their progeny in Ptf 1 a-cre and Rosa 26 reporter mice. We show that inactivation of Hes 1 induces misexpression of Ptf 1 a in discrete regions of the primitive stomach and duodenum and throughout the common bile duct. All ectopic Ptf 1 a-expressing cells were reprogrammed, or transcommitted, to multipotent pancreatic progenitor status and subsequently differentiated into mature pancreatic exocrine, endocrine, and duct cells. This process recapitulated normal pancreatogenesis in terms of morphological and genetic features. Furthermore, analysis of Hes 1 /Ptf 1 a double mutants revealed that ectopic Ptf 1 a-cre lineage–labeled cells adopted the fate of region-appropriate gut epithelium or endocrine cells similarly to Ptf 1 a-inactivated cells in the native pancreatic buds. Our data demonstrate that the Hes 1 -mediated Notch pathway is required for region-appropriate specification of pancreas in the developing foregut endoderm through regulation of Ptf 1 a expression, providing novel insight into the pathogenesis of ectopic pancreas development in a mouse model...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The somitic {{compartment}} {{that gives}} rise to trunk muscle and dermis in amniotes is an epithelial sheet on the external surface of the somite, and {{is known as the}} dermomyotome. However, despite its central {{role in the development of}} the trunk and limbs, the evolutionary history of the dermomyotome and its role in nonamniotes is poorly understood. We have tested whether a tissue with the morphological and molecular characteristics of a dermomyotome exists in nonamniotes. We show that representatives of the agnathans and of all major clades of gnathostomes each have a layer of cells on the surface of the somite, external to the embryonic myotome. These external cells do not show any signs of terminal myogenic or dermogenic differentiation. Moreover, in the embryos of bony fishes as diverse as sturgeons (Chondrostei) and zebrafish (Teleostei) this layer of cells expresses the pax 3 and pax 7 genes that <b>mark</b> myogenic <b>precursors.</b> Some of the pax 7 -expressing cells also express the differentiationpromoting myogenic regulatory factor Myogenin and appear to enter into the myotome. We therefore suggest that the dermomyotome is an ancient and conserved structure that evolved prior to the last common ancestor of all vertebrates. The identification of a dermomyotome in fish makes it possible to apply the powerful cellular and genetic approaches available in zebrafish to the understanding of this key developmental structure...|$|R
40|$|In this {{population-based}} {{study of}} {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} (ALL) diagnosed among children aged under 15 years in England and Wales during 1986 – 1995, we analysed incidence at census ward level {{in relation to a}} range of variables from the 1991 census, which could be relevant to theories of infectious aetiology. ‘Population-mixing' measures, used as surrogates for quantity and diversity of infections entering the community, were calculated from census data on the origins and destinations of migrants in the year before the census. Incidence at ages 1 – 4 years tended independently to be higher in rural wards, to increase with the diversity of origin wards from which in-migrants had moved during the year before the census, and to be lower in the most deprived areas as categorised by the Carstairs index. This last association was much weaker when urban/rural status and in-migrants' diversity were allowed for. There was no evidence of association with population mixing or deprivation for ALL diagnosed at ages 0 or 5 – 14 years. The apparent specificity to the young childhood age group suggests that these associations are particularly <b>marked</b> for <b>precursor</b> B-cell ALL, with the disease more likely to occur when delayed exposure to infection leads to increased immunological stress, as predicted by Greaves.

The autologous serum supported greater cell proliferation than did fetal calf serum in all subjects regardless of age.

40|$|The subpallium {{comprises}} {{large parts}} of the basal ganglia including striatum and globus pallidus. Genes and factors involved {{in the development of the}} subpallium have been extensively studied in most vertebrates, including amphibians, birds and rodents. However, our knowledge on patterning of the human subpallium remains insufficient. Using double fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we investigated the protein distribution of transcription factors involved in patterning of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in the human forebrain at late embryonic development. Furthermore, we compared the development of cortical and striatal precursors between human fetal brain and E 14 and E 16 fetal rat brains. Our results reveal that DLX 2 <b>marks</b> SVZ <b>precursors</b> in the entire subpallium. Individual subpallial subdomains can be identified based on co-expression of DLX 2 with either PAX 6 or NKX 2 - 1. SVZ precursors in the dLGE and POH are characterized by DLX 2 /PAX 6 co-expression, while precursors in the MGE and PO co-express DLX 2 /NKX 2 - 1. SVZ precursors in the vLGE are DLX 2 (+) /PAX 6 (-) /NKX 2 - 1 (-). In terms of staging comparisons, the development of the corpus striatum in the human fetal brain during late embryonic stages corresponds well with the development of the striatum observed in E 14 fetal rat brains. Our study demonstrates that the pattern underlying the development of the subpallium is highly conserved between rodents and humans and suggests a similar function for these factors in human brain development.

40|$|Background Structural and {{functional}} oligodendrocyte deficits {{as well as}} impaired myelin integrity have been described in affective disorders and schizophrenia, and may disturb the connectivity between disease-relevant brain regions. Olig 1, an oligodendroglial transcription factor, might be important in this context, but has not been systematically studied so far. Methods Nissl- and Olig 1 -stained oligodendrocytes were quantified in the pregenual anterior cingulate (pACC) /dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and adjacent white matter of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 9), bipolar disorder (BD, n = 8), schizophrenia (SZ, n = 13), and matched controls (n = 16). Potential downstream effects of increased Olig 1 -expression were analyzed. Antidepressant drug effects on Olig 1 -expression were further explored in OLN- 93 oligodendrocyte cultures. Results Nissl-stainings of both white matter regions showed a 19 – 27 % reduction of total oligodendrocyte densities in MDD and BD, but not in SZ. In contrast, nuclear Olig 1 -immunoreactivity was elevated in MDD in the pACC-adjacent white matter (left: p = 0. 008; right: p = 0. 018); this effect tended to increase with antidepressant dosage (r = 0. 631, p = 0. 069). This reactive increase of Olig 1 was confirmed by partly dose-dependent effects of imipramine and amitriptyline in oligodendrocyte cultures. Correspondingly, MBP expression in the pACC-adjacent white matter tended to increase with antidepressant dosage (r = 0. 637, p = 0. 065). Other tested brain regions showed no diagnosis-dependent differences regarding Olig 1 -immunoreactivity. Conclusions Since nuclear Olig 1 -expression <b>marks</b> oligodendrocyte <b>precursor</b> cells, its increased expression along with reduced total oligodendrocyte densities (Nissl-stained) in the pACC-adjacent white matter of MDD patients might indicate a (putatively medication-boosted) regenerative attempt to compensate oligodendrocyte loss...|$|R

We assessed {{whether the}} shed ectodomain of CSPG 4 (sCSPG 4) might circulate and reflect potential changes in CSPG 4 tissue expression (pCSPG 4) due to desmoplastic and malignant aberrations occurring in pancreatic tumors. Serum sCSPG 4 {{was measured using}} ELISA in test (n =  83) and validation (n =  221) cohorts comprising donors (n =  11 + 26) and patients with chronic pancreatitis (n =  11 + 20) or neoplasms: benign (serous cystadenoma SCA, n =  13 + 20), premalignant (intraductal dysplastic IPMNs, n =  9 + 55), and malignant (IPMN-associated invasive carcinomas, n =  4 + 14; ductal adenocarcinomas, n =  35 + 86). Pancreatic pCSPG 4 expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR (n =  139), western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. sCSPG 4 was found in circulation, but its level was significantly lower in pancreatic patients than in donors. Selective maintenance was observed in advanced IPMNs and PDACs and showed a nodal association while lacking prognostic relevance. Pancreatic pCSPG 4 expression was preserved or elevated, whereby neoplastic cells lacked pCSPG 4 or tended to overexpress without shedding. Extreme pancreatic overexpression, membranous exposure and tissue(high) /sera(low) -discordance highlighted stroma-poor benign cystic neoplasm. SCA is known to display hypoxic markers and coincide with von-Hippel-Lindau and Peutz-Jeghers syndromes, in which pVHL and LBK 1 mutations affect hypoxic signaling pathways. In vitro testing confined pCSPG 4 overexpression to normal mesenchymal but not epithelial cells, {{and a third of}} tested carcinoma cell lines; however, only the latter showed pCSPG 4 -responsiveness to chronic hypoxia. siRNA-based knockdowns failed to reduce the malignant potential of either normoxic or hypoxic cells. Thus, overexpression of the newly established conditional hypoxic indicator, CSPG 4, is apparently non-pathogenic in pancreatic malignancies but might mark distinct epithelial lineage and contribute to cell polarity disorders. Surficial retention on tumor cells renders CSPG 4 an attractive therapeutic target. Systemic 'drop and restoration' alterations accompanying IPMN and PDAC progression indicate that the interference of pancreatic diseases with local and remote shedding/release of sCSPG 4 into circulation deserves broad diagnostic exploration...|$|R
40|$|In {{the adult}} mouse brain, {{neuronal}} precursor cells continuously emanate from neural stem cells (NSC) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and migrate into the olfactory bulb (OB) where they differentiate {{to serve as}} replenishment for GABAergic interneurons. During the migration process, PSA-NCAM (Polysialic acid-Neural cell adhesion molecule) specifically <b>marks</b> the neuronal <b>precursors</b> (PSA+ cells). This phenomenon was exploited {{in the framework of}} this doctoral thesis to isolate a homogeneous cell population of neuronal precursor cells using Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Here, the first comprehensive picture of the gene expression in PSA+ precursors was generated using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE). Comparison of SAGE data for PSA+ cells and for adult total brain (ATB) led to the identification of precursor-enriched genes. For selected genes, the results were validated using cDNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR, and the expression was analyzed at the cellular level in mouse brain using in situ hybridizations. Genes previously described in this context like the proliferation inhibitor CD 24, the sialyltransferase STX and the Reelin receptor ApoER 2 confirmed the identity of the precursor cells and the accuracy of the SAGE. Individual characterized genes that were so far unknown in the PSA+ cell population were identified as well as functional groups of genes by means of cluster analysis of SAGE data. The presence of transcription factors of the Sox and Dlx families, Pax 6 and Meis 2 indicated that secondary neurogenesis might be largely controlled by the same factors that are active during development. Clusters for apoptosis and proliferation are both upregulated. The high expression of chemotactic factors in the neuronal precursors suggests that they might be involved in neuronal cell migration. In addition, novel genes like RIKEN 3110003 A 17 were observed. First functional data based on the SAGE are being generated in the framework of our collaboration with the Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille. Given that a lack of markers for NSC considerably impedes progress in NSC biology, the second part of this work aimed at identifying potential NSC markers by comparing SAGE data for embryonic stem (ES) cells, PSA+ cells and ATB. The selection strategy was based on two assumptions. First, in a hierarchical order of developmental potential, ES cells are positioned above NSC, which are above restricted precursors that in turn are above adult neurons and glia. Second, the genetic programs of ES cells and NSC overlap. Thus, genes that are highly expressed in ES cells and downregulated or absent in PSA+ neuronal precursors and ATB should in part also be expressed by the few stem cells in the adult brain. Eight candidates coding for cell surface proteins were identified from the resulting list of candidates and were investigated. Due to a public database mistake in situ hybridizations were performed for the glutamate transporter GLT 1 and demonstrated expression in embryoid bodies, neurospheres and, strikingly, in the SVZ, the neurogenic area of the mouse forebrain. Taken together, this doctoral thesis generated the first gene expression profile for PSA+ neuronal precursors, which -together with the SAGE library for Bruce- 4 ES cells- will serve as a starting basis for future functional analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis is to optimize the electric arc furnace (EAF) practice from an environmental view point. Two aspects that {{meet the requirements of}} the secondary steelmaking industries today, viz. Mo alloying with maximum retainment of the alloying element in molten steel and optimization of foaming by carbonate addition with a view to optimize the energy need of the process. Both these aspects would also {{have a significant impact on}} the process economy. Iron molybdate (Fe 2 MoO 4) has been synthesized from commercial grade materials and proposed as a new potential precursor for steel alloying with Mo. The thermal stabilities of different molybdates, viz. Fe 2 MoO 4, CaMoO 4 and MgMoO 4, were studied using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). It was found that Fe 2 MoO 4 is the most stable one and doesn’t evaporate in Ar atmosphere when heating up to 1573 K. The synthesis of Fe 2 MoO 4 requires high temperature (1373 K) and long holding time (up to 16 hours). In a view of this, the possibilities for in-situ formation of Fe 2 MoO 4 and CaMoO 4 from their precursor mixtures were studied with the aid of high-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TGA analysis. Laboratory and industrial trials on steel alloying with Mo were conducted using precursor mixtures as sources of Mo. It was found that the mixture, which contains FeOx, MoO 3 and C (Fe 2 MoO 4 precursor), can provide the Mo yield up to 98 % at both the laboratory as well as industrial trials. The Mo yields even in the case of C+MoO 3 and C+MoO 3 +CaO mixtures were around 93 % in these trials. The higher yield for the MoO 3 +C+FeOx mixture was attributed to the stabilization of Mo in the <b>precursor</b> (<b>marked</b> by the decrease in the Gibbs energy of Mo) and the readiness to dissolve in the steel bath. The heat effect of the slag foaming with carbonates addition was studied at 1623 and 1673 K with the aid of thermal analysis technique with a new crucible design. Experiments were conducted by adding limestone and dolomite pieces of defined shapes (together with iron sinkers) in molten slag and monitoring the temperature changes accompanying the decomposition of carbonates. It was found that the decomposition energies for dolomite and limestone for the studied slag composition are in the range 56 - 79 % of theoretical values, which is linked to the energy saving effect of slag foaming. No influence of sample shape on decomposition energy was found both for limestone and dolomite. The kinetics of slag foaming by limestone particles was studied at 1773 K with the aid of X-ray imaging system. A model was proposed to describe the decrease in foam height with time on the basis of CaO shell formation during decomposition reaction. The energy impact of limestone and raw dolomite addition was examined in a 100 -ton EAF. It was found that, in the case of addition of carbonates after the scrap is completely molten; the endothermic heat effects for limestone and dolomite (2255 and 2264 kJ/kg respectively) were only 70 % from theoretical values. This is indicative of the resistance to heat transfer due to increased foaming. QC 2010091...|$|R
