25|$|After the election, Sked was {{pressured}} into resigning by a party faction led by Farage, David Lott and <b>Michael</b> <b>Holmes,</b> who deemed him too {{intellectual and}} dictatorial. Sked left the party, alleging {{that it had}} been infiltrated by racist and far-right elements, including BNP spies. This connection was emphasised in the press, particularly when Farage was photographed meeting with BNP activists. Holmes took over as party leader, and in the 1999 European Parliament elections—the first UK election to use proportional representation—UKIP gained 7% of the vote and three seats, in South East England (Farage), South West England (Holmes), and the East of England (Jeffrey Titford).|$|E
25|$|Allen {{realized}} during {{college that}} he wanted to play music professionally and began trying to write music. He played his first gig at a local bar in downtown Conway during his sophomore year, and he went on to drop out of college {{in the middle of his}} junior year to follow his dream of becoming a professional musician. He worked as a shoe salesman at a sporting goods store during the day to make ends meet and continued playing gigs in Little Rock and Fayetteville at night. In 2007, Allen wrote and self-produced an album entitled Brand New Shoes with college friends and bandmates <b>Michael</b> <b>Holmes</b> (drums) and Chase Erwin (bass). The album's title makes reference to Allen's days as a shoe salesman, and only 600 copies of the album were produced, most of which were given to family and friends.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{direction}} of UKIP's leader <b>Michael</b> <b>Holmes,</b> the party's chairman Nigel Farage began recruiting former Referendum Party members to their own group; according to Farage, around 160 of the Referendum Party's candidates joined UKIP. Among those who did so was Jeffrey Titford, who later became one of UKIP's first MEPs. Other {{former members of the}} Referendum Party joined the Democratic Party, a small Eurosceptic group founded in 1998. In the 1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election, one candidate stood under the banner of the now-defunct [...] "Referendum Party"; they came eleventh, with 57 votes. In the 2001 general election, much of the support that had previously gone to the Referendum Party went not to UKIP but to the Conservatives, whose leader William Hague had employed Eurosceptic rhetoric throughout his campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Kelly and the Dots had {{released}} {{their debut}} album Talk in March 1981, which had peaked at #38 on the National albums charts, but its third single [...] "Lowdown" [...] released in May had no chart success. Considerable line-up changes had occurred within the Dots since its 1978 formation in Melbourne. The band that travelled to The Philippines in July 1981 with Kelly was Tony Thornton on drums, Alan Brooker on bass guitar, Tim Brosnan on guitar and <b>Michael</b> <b>Holmes</b> on guitar. After returning to Australia, the band {{became involved in}} Gillian Armstrong's 1982 film Starstruck which starred Jo Kennedy. Paul Kelly and the Dots supplied [...] "Rocking Institution" [...] for the soundtrack and Kelly added to the score. Acting in a minor role in Starstruck was Kaarin Fairfax, who later became Kelly's second wife. Kelly had replaced Holmes with Maurice Frawley on guitar and Thornton with Huk Treloar on drums. Whilst in Melbourne Kelly was assaulted and had his jaw broken. The single [...] "Clean this House" [...] was released in April, and [...] "Alive and Well" [...] in July, but neither album nor singles had any chart success. The line-up changes and Kelly's broken jaw had delayed the release of Manila until August 1982. The Dots were disbanded and the Paul Kelly Band was formed in 1983, Kelly's next album was the solo release Post which was recorded after he had relocated to Sydney by January 1985.|$|E
