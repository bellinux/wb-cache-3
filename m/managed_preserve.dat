40|$|As {{deforestation}} and fragmentation pose {{a constant}} threat to rainforests and the biodiversity they harbor, conservation and preservation {{are of the}} utmost import. To evaluate the overall ecological well-being of an ecosystem and by extension its conservation priority, the degree of disturbance and fragmentation should be determined. One way of examining the disturbance status of an area {{is to examine the}} local avifauna using birds as bioindicators. The overall ecological state of the Costa Rican tropical cloud forest in which the Savegre Lodge is situated can be inferred by examining the avifauna cataloged through mist netting and observation during one week studies in March of 2003 and 2005. Because this area is a rainforest preserve which relies heavily on ecotourism, it is hypothesized that the biodiversity and health of the ecosystem have been preserved, as disturbance is kept to a minimum. Of the 116 species cataloged, 34 species were caught in the mist nets. Nine of the cataloged species are considered rare or uncommon and 13 are highly sensitive to human disturbance. The presence of a number of rare and/or highly disturbance-sensitive species at Savegre, in addition to the plethora of common species, suggests that this habitat has not been disturbed or significantly fragmented and points to the overall good health of the environment. The area around the Savegre Lodge stands {{as an example of a}} well <b>managed</b> <b>preserve</b> where biodiversity remains intact even in the presence of ecotourism...|$|E

40|$|Herpetofaunal declines {{have been}} {{documented}} globally, and southern Florida, USA, is an especially vulnerable region because of high impacts from hydrological perturbations and nonindigenous species. To assess the extent of recent change in herpetofauna community composition, we established a baseline inventory during 1995 - 97 at a <b>managed</b> <b>preserve</b> in a habitat rich area of southwest Florida, and repeated our sampling methods fifteen years later (2010 - 11). Nine drift fence arrays were placed in four habitat types: mesic flatwood, mesic hammock, depression marsh, and wet prairie. Trapping occurred daily for one week during 7 - 8 sampling runs in each period (57 and 49 total sampling days, respectively). Species richness was maintained in mesic hammock habitats but varied in the others. Catch rates of several native species (Anaxyrus terrestris, Lithobates grylio, Anolis carolinensis, Nerodia fasciata) declined significantly. Other native species (Lithobates sphenocephalus, Siren lacertian, and Notophthalmus viridescens piaropicola) that were abundant in 1995 - 97 declined by greater than 50 %. Catch rate of only two species (the nonindigenous Anolis sagrei and the native Diadophis punctatus) increased significantly. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated similarity within habitat types but significant dissimilarity between sampling periods, confirming shifts in community composition. Analysis of individual species' contributions to overall similarity across habitats shows a shift from dominance of native species in the 1990 s to increased importance of nonindigenous species in 2010 - 11. Although natural population fluctuations may have influenced {{differences between the two}} sampling periods, our results suggest considerable recent change in the structure and composition of this southwest Florida herpetofaunal community. The causes are unknown, but hydrological shifts and ecological impacts of nonindigenous species may have contributed...|$|E
