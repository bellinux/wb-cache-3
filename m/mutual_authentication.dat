In this approach, an AMI system can provide trust services, data privacy and integrity by <b>mutual</b> <b>authentications</b> whenever a new smart meter initiates and joins the smart grid AMI network. Data integrity and confidentiality are fulfilled through message authentication and encryption services respectively using the corresponding keys established in the <b>mutual</b> <b>authentications.</b> A transmission scheme is proposed to facilitate the data collection and management message delivery between smart meters and a local collector for AMI communications. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a better end-to-end delay and packet losses comparing with a basic security method, and the proposed method can provide secure and reliable communications for AMI in smart grid systems...|$|R

In this paper, a backward unlinkable secret handshake scheme with revocation support (BU-RSH) is constructed. For a full-fledged secret handshake scheme, it is indispensable to furnish it with practical functionality, such as unlinkability, revocation and traceability. The revocation is achieved in the BU-RSH scheme, as well as the unlinkability and the traceability. Moreover, the anonymity of revoked members is improved, so that the past transcripts of revoked members remain private, i. e., backward unlinkability. In particular, the BU-RSH scheme is provably secure in the standard model by assuming the intractability of the `-hidden strong Diffie-Hellman problem and the subgroup decision problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of wireless cellular networks has made security an ever increasing concern. GSM {{is the most popular}} wireless cellular standard, but security is an issue. The most critical weakness in the GSM protocol is the use of one-way entity authentication, i. e., only the mobile station is authenticated by the network. This creates many security problems including vulnerability against man-in-the-middle attacks. Several solutions have been proposed to establish <b>mutual</b> entity <b>authentication.</b> However, none provide a flaw-free bilateral authentication protocol. In this paper, we show that a recently proposed solution is vulnerable to a "type attack". Then, we propose a novel <b>mutual</b> entity <b>authentication</b> using the TESLA protocol. The proposed solution not only provides secure bilateral authentication, but also decreases the call setup time and the required connection bandwidth. An important feature of the proposed protocol is that it is compatible with the GSM standard...|$|R

For a reliable secure communication, <b>mutual</b> entity <b>authentication</b> is very often seen as the necessity to the establishment of a secure connection. Authentication is necessary in wireless communication such as GSM or for Ad-Hoc purposes [26]. Here Latin word ad-hoc means for the specific purpose only. Authentication is also necessary in situations where we need more than two entities in the authentication exchange such as a mobile user, a local AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) server and a remote (home) AAA server [8, 21]. In such situations it is essential to include authentic and secure key exchange mechanism that ensures enhancement of trust in communication.
