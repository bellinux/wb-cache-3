40|$|International audienceMaximum residue limits (MRLs) for {{residues}} {{of veterinary}} drugs are the maximum concentrations of residues permitted in or on a food by national or regional legislation. In {{the process of}} MRLs recommendations by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), analysis of pharmacokinetic data describing the ADME process (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) is a crucial step and {{requires the use of}} different pharmacokinetic tools. The results of animal metabolism studies are the prime determinants of the residue definition in food commodities. Substances labelled with radioactive isotopes are used so that the disposition of the residue can be followed as total residue and main metabolites concentrations. Residue depletion studies with radiolabelled parent drug will lead to the estimate of the time course of the total residue and to determine a <b>marker</b> <b>residue.</b> Depletion studies with an unlabelled drug provide more information on the time course of the <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> in raw commodities after administration under approved practical conditions of use. By use of this information and after conversion with the total/residue marker ratio, MRLs are derived by comparison of the acceptable daily intake with the daily intakes calculated with different scenarios of dietary exposure. Progress in pharmacokinetic model such as physiologically based pharmacokinetics and population pharmacokinetics will drive the future research in this field to improved veterinary drug development...|$|E
40|$|Recently doubts {{have arisen}} on the {{usefulness}} of semicarbazide as <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> for the illegal use of the antibiotic nitrofurazone (NFZ) in aquaculture and poultry production. Most notably azodicarbonamide (ADC) has been implicated as an alternative source of semicarbazide. ADC is used in some countries as a dough conditioner at concentrations up to 45 mg kg¿ 1. The use of ADC-treated flour or dough in coated or breaded food products may generate false non-compliant results in the analytical method for nitrofurazone metabolites, which is currently in use. During the dough preparation process ADC is largely reduced to biurea, which {{can be considered as}} an appropriate <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> of ADC. Thus far no methods have been published for the determination of biurea in food commodities. Due to its polar nature {{it is very difficult to}} generate sufficient retention on conventional C 18 HPLC columns. With a TSK amide HILIC type column good retention was obtained. A straightforward extraction-dilution protocol was developed. Using a mixture of dimethyl formamide and water biurea was nearly quantitatively extracted from a variety of fresh, coated and processed products. Mass spectrometric detection was performed with positive electrospray ionisation. The sensitivity and selectivity of the mass spectrometer for biurea was very good, allowing detection at concentrations as low as 10 ¿g kg¿ 1. However, in some extracts severe ion suppression effects was observed. To overcome the implications of ion suppression on the quantitative performance of the method an isotopically-labelled biurea internal standard was synthesized and incorporated in the method. The method developed can be used effectively in nitrofurazone analysis to eliminate the risk of false non-compliant results due to the presence of azodicarbonamide-treated components in the food product...|$|E

The scientific literature in this field is very extensive {{and there is also}} a wealth of data available on the websites of various regulatory jurisdictions. Therefore, this review is limited to selected examples, cited to illustrate general principles. The areas considered are: (1) the relationship of dose to plasma concentration through the pharmacokinetic properties, area under plasma concentration-time curve, bioavailability, and clearance; (2) the critical dependence of drug pharmacokinetics and residue depletion on product formulation; (3) disease state and population pharmacokinetics; and (4) the requirement for residue depletion studies for generic products shown to be bioequivalent to pioneer products...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{nitrofuran}} antibiotics {{cannot be}} used in food production within the EU because of their potential health risks to the consumer. The recent discovery of their widespread use in global food industries and the finding of semicarbazide (SEM) in baby food {{as a result of}} packaging contamination have focussed attention on the toxicity and stability of these drugs and their metabolites. The stability of the nitrofuran <b>marker</b> <b>residues</b> AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM were tested. Muscle and liver of nitrofuran treated pigs were cooked by frying, grilling, roasting and microwaving. Between 67 and 100 % of the residues remained after cooking, demonstrating that these metabolites are largely resistant to conventional cooking techniques and will continue to pose a health risk. The concentration of metabolites in pig muscle and liver did not drop significantly during 8 months storage at – 20 °C. Metabolite stock and working standard solutions in methanol were also stable for 10 months at 4 °C. Only a 10 ng ml- 1 solution of SEM showed a small drop in concentration over this extended storage period...|$|R

To control the food chain and guarantee consumers’ health, {{there is a need}} of highly sensitive analytical methods for the identification of <b>marker</b> <b>residues</b> of such treatments. In the present study, a group of bulls (n= 16) received trenbolone acetate (200 [*]mg) and estradiol (40 [*]mg) by a commercial ear implant during a time range of 71 days, and a second group (n= 16) was kept for control. The aim of the research was to measure the residual urinary concentrations of the administered drugs (β-trenbolone and β-estradiol), their main metabolites (α-trenbolone and α-estradiol), and possible alterations of the urinary profile of other endogenous hormones metabolically related. The analytical method was based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

A standard method (ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, UPLC-MS/MS) was used to analyze SEM in seawater, sediment, and shellfish. A series of sections and stations were set up in radical distribution in western Laizhou Bay, with six voyages and 150 monitoring samples. The concentrations of SEM in seawater and shellfish were 10 (- 11) and 10 (- 10) kg/L, respectively, and no SEM was detected in the sediment. Distribution characteristics at each state, temporal and spatial trends, multivariate analyses, and the causes were analyzed to assess the pollution,level, which aimed to offer a database for drafting the national baseline values of SEM in seawater and sediment in future. The data obtained could be used for integrated watershed management of marine environment and economic activities for constructing a blue economic zone of Shandong Peninsula in China.

The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) assessed the supplementary information supplied by the applicant on the diclazuril impurity/metabolite R 070016 {{and concluded that the}} compound is devoid of genotoxic activity. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel {{is in a position to}} adopt the already proposed ADI for diclazuril (1. 7 mg diclazuril per person per day). The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety. Consequently, no MRLs are required for chickens and turkeys for fattening...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnthelmintic {{drugs are}} widely used for {{treatment}} of parasitic worms in livestock but {{little is known about}} the stability of their residues in food under conventional cooking conditions. As part of the European Commission-funded research project ProSafeBeef, cattle were medicated with commercially available anthelmintic preparations, comprising 11 active ingredients (corresponding to 21 <b>marker</b> <b>residues).</b> Incurred meat and liver were cooked by roasting (40 min at 190 °C) or shallow frying (muscle 8 - 12 min, liver 14 - 19 min) in a domestic kitchen. Raw and cooked tissues and expressed juices were analysed using a novel multi-residue dispersive solid phase extraction method (QuECheRS) coupled with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. After correction for sample weight changes during cooking, no major losses were observed for residues of oxyclozanide, clorsulon, closantel, ivermectin, albendazole, mebendazole or fenbendazole. However, significant losses were observed for nitroxynil (78 % in fried muscle, 96 % in roast muscle), levamisole (11 % in fried muscle, 42 % in fried liver), rafoxanide (17 % in fried muscle, 18 % in roast muscle) and triclabendazole (23 % in fried liver, 47 % in roast muscle). Migration of residues from muscle into expressed cooking juices varied between drugs, constituting 0 % to 17 % (levamisole) of total residues remaining after cooking. With the exception of nitroxynil, residues of anthelmintic drugs were generally resistant to degradation during roasting and shallow frying. Conventional cooking cannot, therefore, be considered a safeguard against ingestion of residues of anthelmintic veterinary drugs in beef...|$|R
40|$|Future climatic {{conditions}} may coincide {{with an increased}} potential for wildfires in grassland and forest ecosystems, whereby charred biomass would be incorporated into soils. Molecular changes in biomass upon charring have been frequently analysed {{with a focus on}} black carbon. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, known to be liberated during incomplete combustion of biomass have been preferentially analysed in soot particles, whereas determinations of these compounds in charred biomass residues are scarce. We discuss the influence of increasing charring temperature on the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon composition of crop grass combustion residues. Straw from rye, representing C 3 grasses and maize, representing C 4 grasses, was charred in the presence of limited oxygen at 300, 400 and 500 °C. Typical n-alkane distribution patterns with a strong predominance of long chain odd-numbered n-alkanes maximising at C 31 were observed in raw straw. Upon combustion at 300 °C aliphatic hydrocarbons in char were dominated by sterenes, whereas at 400 °C sterenes disappeared and medium chain length n-alkanes, maximising around n-C 20, with a balanced odd/even distribution were present. At a charring temperature of 500 °C n-alkane chain length shifted to short chain homologues, maximising at C 18 with a pronounced predominance of even homologues. Even numbered, short chain n-alkanes in soils may thus serve as a <b>marker</b> for <b>residues</b> of charred biomass. Aromatic hydrocarbons indicate an onset of aromatization of biomass already at 300 °C, followed by severe aromatization upon incomplete combustion at 400 – 500 °C. The diagnostic composition of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons from charred biomass affords potential for identifying residues from burned vegetation in recent and fossil soils and sediments...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} {{amino acid}} sequence of th variable (V) region of the mu heavy chain of a human IgM immunoglobulin (Cam) has been determined. The strategy for sequence determination involved sequenator analysis of the CNBr cleavage products of the succinylated carboxymethylated Fab mu fragment, and of tryptic peptides of the CNBr polypeptides and thermolytic subpeptides. The variable region of this heavy chain (VH) belongs to the VHIII subgroup; it has greater than 70 % homology with other VHIII sequences and contains the VHIII <b>marker</b> peptide, Phe-Thr-Ile-Ser-Arg (<b>residues</b> 67 - 71). As more sequences have been published, the number of subgroup-specific residues has diminished {{to the point that}} no position is absolutely subgroup specific.

Estimation of {{tulathromycin}} depletion in plasma {{and milk}} after subcutaneous injection in lactating goats using a nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic modeling approach. Bmc Veterinary Research, 12, 10. doi: 10. 1186 /s 12917 - 016 - 0884 - 4 Background: Extra-label use of tulathromycin in lactating goats is common and may cause violative residues in milk. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop a nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic (NLME-PK) model to estimate tulathromycin depletion in plasma and milk of lactating goats. Eight lactating goats received two subcutaneous injections of 2. 5 mg/kg tulathromycin 7 days apart; blood and milk samples were analyzed for concentrations of tulathromycin and the common fragment of tulathromycin (i. e., the <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> CP- 60, 300), respectively, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Based on these new data and related literature data, a NLME-PK compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination was used to model plasma concentrations and cumulative excreted amount in milk. Monte Carlo simulations with 100 replicates were performed to predict the time when the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval of milk concentrations was below the tolerance. Results: All animals were healthy throughout the study with normal appetite and milk production levels, and with mild-moderate injection-site reactions that diminished by the end of the study. The measured data showed that milk concentrations of the <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> of tulathromycin were below the limit of detection (LOD = 1. 8 ng/ml) 39 days after the second injection. A 2 -compartment model with milk as an excretory compartment best described tulathromycin plasma and CP- 60, 300 milk pharmacokinetic data. The model-predicted data correlated with the measured data very well. The NLME-PK model estimated that tulathromycin plasma concentrations were below LOD (1. 2 ng/ml) 43 days after a single injection, and 62 days after the second injection with a 95 % confidence. These estimated times are much longer than the current meat withdrawal time recommendation of 18 days for tulathromycin in non-lactating cattle. Conclusions: The results suggest that twice subcutaneous injections of 2. 5 mg/kg tulathromycin are a clinically safe extra-label alternative approach for treating pulmonary infections in lactating goats, but a prolonged withdrawal time of at least 39 days after the second injection should be considered to prevent violative residues in milk and any dairy goat being used for meat should have an extended meat withdrawal time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{method is}} described for the semi-quantitative determination of semicarbazide (SEM), the <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> for the banned nitrofuran drug nitrofurazone, in chicken eggs. The sample homogenate is subjected to acid hydrolysis and derivatisation with o-nitrobenzaldehyde, followed by ethyl acetate / hexane extraction and detection by ELISA. The ELISA procedure has been validated using 0. 3, 1. 0 and 3 μg Kg- 1 of SEM in fortified samples.

40|$|To {{identify}} {{regions of}} the ryanodine receptor (RyR) important for ion conduction we modified the channel with sulfhydryl-reacting compounds. After addition of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds channel conductance was decreased while other channel properties, including channel regulation by ATP, caffeine, or Ca, were unaffected. The site of action was accessible to the MTS compounds from the cytoplasmic, but not the luminal, side of the channel. In addition, the hydrophilic MTS compounds were only effective when the channel was open, suggesting that the compounds covalently modify the channel from within the water-filled ion conducting pathway. The decrease in channel current amplitude occurred in a step-wise fashion and was irreversible and cumulative over time, eventually leading to the complete block of channel current. However, the time required for each consecutive modification during continuous exposure to the MTS compounds increased, suggesting that successive modification by the MTS compounds is not independent. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that the channel forms a wide vestibule on the cytoplasmic side and contains a much smaller opening on the luminal side. Furthermore, our results indicate that the MTS compounds can serve as functional <b>markers</b> for specific <b>residues</b> of the RyR to be identified in molecular studies...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variations}} of {{human leukocyte antigen}} (HLA) genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus are strongly associated with disease susceptibility and prognosis for many diseases, including many autoimmune diseases. In this study, we developed a Korean HLA reference panel for imputing classical alleles and amino acid residues of several HLA genes. An HLA reference panel has potential for use in identifying and fine-mapping disease associations with the MHC locus in East Asian populations, including Koreans. A total of 413 unrelated Korean subjects were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the MHC locus and six HLA genes, including HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB 1, -DPB 1, and -DQB 1. The HLA reference panel was constructed by phasing the 5, 858 MHC SNPs, 233 classical HLA alleles, and 1, 387 amino acid <b>residue</b> <b>markers</b> from 1, 025 amino acid positions as binary variables. The imputation accuracy of the HLA reference panel was assessed by measuring concordance rates between imputed and genotyped alleles of the HLA genes from {{a subset of the}} study subjects and East Asian HapMap individuals. Average concordance rates were 95. 6 % and 91. 1 % at 2 -digit and 4 -digit allele resolutions, respectively. The imputation accuracy was minimally affected by SNP density of a test dataset for imputation.

Confocal microscopy was used, using a polyclonal antibody against human oviductin and Con A as a <b>marker</b> for mannose <b>residues,</b> to reveal the colocalization of human oviduct-specific glycoprotein with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments. Setting: University-based anatomy and cell biology department. Patient(s) : Women undergoing laparoscopy for tubal ligation or hysterectomy due to uterine fibroma. Intervention(s) : An immortalized OE-E 6 /E 7 cell line was previously established using human oviductal epithelial cells. Electron microscopy, RT-PCR, sequencing, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were performed. Main Outcome Measure(s) : The presence of human oviductin mRNA and protein in OE-E 6 /E 7 cells. Result(s) : OE-E 6 /E 7 cells retain morphological features characteristic of secretory cells and express human oviductin mRNA and its translated protein. Conclusion(s) : OE-E 6 /E 7 cells were characterized {{for the first time}} by electron microscopy and shown to exhibit histological features typical of secretory cells. Reverse-transcription PCR with sequencing and confocal microscopy showed, respectively, that human oviductin mRNA and protein are expressed in OE-E 6 /E 7 cells.

A high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was used. The results showed the presence of all anticoccidial residues; however, the DNC levels were higher when the nicarbazin was administered individually than when it was used in association with narasin throughout the experimental period. After six days of withdrawal, the DNC level following nicarbazin administration alone was lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) of 200 μg kg- 1. However, when the nicarbazin was co-administered with narasin, the concentrations of DNC were lower than the MRL after four days of withdrawal. These results may be justified because the dosage of nicarbazin, when administrated individually, is greater than when it is used in combination with narasin. The levels of narasin were lower than the MRL of 15 μg kg- 1 throughout the evaluation period. It was concluded that nicarbazin is rapidly metabolized from the broiler muscles up to six days of withdrawal since the DNC levels were lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) and the concentrations of narasin were lower than the MRL throughout the evaluation period...|$|E

In some countries, particularly in Europe, bromadiolone, a Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticide (SGAR), is intensively used {{in the field for}} controlling the population outbreaks of the Water vole Arvicola terrestris. Among non target species, dozens to hundreds of secondary poisonings of Red foxes Vulpes vulpes have been reported each year. To date, SGAR monitoring has been carried out only based on necropsy and toxicological investigation of carcasses. We have shown that the molecule is measurable in faeces of captive foxes fed with bromadiolone-contaminated voles. The present work aims at (1) assessing the feasibility of bromadiolone analysis in faeces collected in situ, (2) determining if there is a relationship between direct (liver residues) and indirect (faeces bromadiolone <b>residues)</b> <b>markers</b> of exposure. In a 50 km² area, 48 % of the faeces collected 15 to 45 days after treatment contained bromadiolone. In an other area of 125 km² treated 1 to 6 month before sampling, 85 % of fox livers and 29 % of faecal pellets from rectum, contained bromadiolone. We demonstrated an exponential relationship between pellet and liver concentrations. This may suggest a gradient between animals having been exposed long ago and those exposed more recently.

30|$|Furthermore, {{evaluation}} of long-term toxicity of herbicides is generally performed onmammalian physiology employing only their active principle, {{rather than the}} completeformulations as used in agriculture. This {{was the case for}} glyphosate (G) [17], the declared active chemical constituent of R. It is important to note thatG is only able to efficiently penetrate target plant organisms with the help ofadjuvants present in the various commercially used R formulations [18]. Even if G has shown to interact directly with the active site of aromataseat high levels [19], at low contaminating levels, adjuvants may be better candidates than G toexplain the toxicity or endocrine disruptive side effects of R on human cells [8, 20] and also in vivo for acute toxicity [21]. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the far greater toxicity of fullagricultural formulations compared to declared supposed active principles alone hasrecently been demonstrated also for six other major pesticides tested in vitro[22]. When G residues are found in tap water, food, or feed, they arise from thetotal herbicide formulation although little data is available as to the levels of the Radjuvants in either the environment or food chain. Indeed, adjuvants are rarelymonitored in the environment, but some widely used adjuvants (surfactants) such asnonylphenol ethoxylates, another ethoxylated surfactant like POEA present in R, arewidely found in rivers in England and are linked with disruption of wildlife sexualreproduction [23]. Adjuvants are found in groundwater [24]. The half-life of POEA (21 to 42 days) is even longer than for G (7 to 14 days) in aquatic environments [25]. As a result, the necessity of studying the potential toxic effects of totalchemical mixtures rather than single components has been strongly emphasized [26 – 28]. On this basis, the regular measurement of only G or other supposed activeingredients of pesticides in the environment constitute at best <b>markers</b> of fullformulation <b>residues.</b> Thus, in the study of health effects, exposure to the dilutedwhole formulation may be more representative of environmental pollution than exposure toG alone.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the {{opportunistic}} fungus Candida albicans has been the centre of considerable morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts, such as cancer patients, HIV-infected individuals or transplant recipients. Among Candida virulence factors, cell wall is a plastic and dynamic structure, that · is constantly changing in response to environmental signals. Several evidences demonstrated {{its role in the}} host-fungus interactions {{as well as in the}} response to antimicrobial drugs. Cell wall is mainly composed of three components interconnected by covalent bonds: B- 1 - 3 and J. 3 1 - 6 glucans, mannoproteins and chitin. The glucans and chitin form a microfibrillar ne~ork, in which several proteins referred to as glucan associated proteins (GAPsi 1 J are embedded, more or less tightly bound to the polysaccharides. The mayor GAPs are enolase (46 kDa), aldolase (40 kDa), two isoforms of phosphoglyceromutase (32 and 29 kjpa) and two B 1 - 3 glucanases (44 and 34 kDa). Although most effective anticandidal drugs hchre direct or indirect activities on one or more steps of cell wall construction, it is not clear whether or to what extent the antimycotic efficacy and/or the emergence of drug resistance may involve modifications of cell wall GAP composition. Our studies have demonstrated that when different Candida strains were grown in the presence of effective antimycotic drugs, a substantial decrease in the expression of three enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (enolase, aldolase and phosphoglyceromutase) occurred, which were apparently replaced by enhancement of the exoglucanase constituents (34 and 44 kDa). These changes were not found when the fungus was made resistant to the drugs and surprisingly, the drug-resistant strains were significantly more pathogenic than parent strains in a mouse systemic candidiasis model. [2 J To further characterize the modification in GAP composition, the rate of cell wall mannosilation was studied by using fluorescent ConA as a <b>marker</b> of mannosilated <b>residues</b> in Candida strains èxposed to the drugs. Microscopie analysis showed a substantial increase in the fluorescent signals localized in the cell wall of sensitive-drugs treated cells. Since some exoglucanase constituents are mannosilated, these observations confirm the drug-induced increased expression of 34 kDa protein described above. Moreover, electron-microscopie analysis showed a strong modification in cell wall morphology in cells exposed to ef(ective doses of the drugs,'~rther suggesting that this cellular structure plays a key role in antimycotic response. In order to verify whether a stress mechanism was involved in the drug-induced modification of GAP composition, we tested intracellular levels of glutathi 9 ne (GSH) as a marker of redox. state in sensitive and resistant strains. We found that in s'ensitive cells GSH levels was significantly decreased in response to effective doses of antifungal drugs. On the contrary, in resistant cells GSH content was not modified also in the presence of drugs at high doses. The results clearly indicate that Candida response to antimicrobic drugs is related to specific alterations of GAP composition in cell wall. Detailed knowledge of these alterations and identification of the related mechanisms of induction could consti tute an useful tool to identify new therapeutic strategies for the cure of locai and systemic candidiasis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNitrofuran {{antibiotic}} residues in food {{continue to}} be of international concern. The finding of sources of semicarbazide (SEM), other than through the misuse of nitrofurazone, present {{a challenge to the}} use of SEM as a definitive <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> for this drug. Detection of intact (parent) nitrofurazone would avoid confusion over the source of SEM residues. Broiler chickens were fed sub-therapeutic nitrofuran-containing diets and tissues analysed for parent compounds and metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Depletion half-lives in muscle were longer for tissue-bound metabolite residues, 3. 4 d (AOZ, AMOZ) to 4. 5 d (SEM), than total metabolite residues, 2. 0 d (AOZ) to 3. 2 d (SEM). Metabolite concentrations were higher in eyes than muscle. Metabolite half-lives in eyes ranged from 8. 5 d (AHD) to 20. 3 d (SEM). Nitrofuran parent compounds were also detected in eyes [...] Furaltadone was detected in single eyes after 21 d withdrawal of a 6 mg kg- 1 furaltadone diet. When 50 eyes from broilers containing metabolites in muscle close to the 1 µg kg- 1 MRPL were pooled into single samples, 1. 2 ng furazolidone and 31. 1 ng of furaltadone were detected, but nitrofurazone was not detected due to the long depletion half-life of SEM in muscle. Further studies are required to improve LC-MS/MS nitrofurazone sensitivity and refine the sample size necessary to use nitrofurazone detection in pooled eyes as a complement to SEM detection in muscle...|$|E
40|$|Metamizole (MT) is an {{analgesic}} and antipyretic drug labelled {{for use in}} humans, horses, cattle, swine, and dogs. MT {{is rapidly}} hydrolysed to the primary metabolite 4 -methylaminoantipyrine (MAA). MAA is formed in much larger amounts compared to other minor metabolites, {{and it has been}} selected from the regulatory European Medicines Agency as a <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> for MRL calculation. The aim of thisresearch was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of MAA after 20 mg/kg MT by intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administrations in healthy sheep. Twelve sheep were randomly allocated to two equal treatment groups according to a 2 × 2 crossover study. Blood was collected at predetermined times within 36 h and plasma was analysed by a validated HPLC UV method. No behavioural changes or alterations in health parameters were observed in the IV or IM groups of animals during or after (up to 7 days) the drug administration. Plasma concentrations of MAA after IV administration of MT were detectable from 5 min to 8 h in all the sheep, they were still detectable at 10 h in two animals, and the plasma quantification of MAA was possible from 5 min to 10 h in all the animals after IM administration. The only two significantly different parameters between the groups were maximum concentration(Cmax) and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) (P < 0. 01). The AUCIM/AUCIV was 1. 12. The present study showed that no clinically relevant difference in the MAA was found after IM and IV administration of MT. Further studies are now necessary to assess the safety and efficacy profile of MT in sheep...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the identification and}} quantitative determination of 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid hydrazide (DSH), the <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> of nifursol metabolites in poultry (turkey, broiler) muscle and liver tissue. The method {{is based on the}} acid-catalysed hydrolysis of tissue-bound metabolites to free DSH and in situ derivatisation with 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde to the corresponding nitrophenyl derivative NPDSH. A structural analogue of DSH, 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 - dinitrobenzoic acid hydrazide (HBH) was synthesised to serve as an internal standard. The analytes were isolated from the matrix by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Determination was performed by LC-MS/MS with negative electrospray ionisation. The [M - H]+ ions of NPDSH and NPHBH at m/z 374 were fragmented by collision induced dissociation (CID) producing transition ions at m/z 182, 183 and 226. The transition ions at m/z 182 and 226 were selected for monitoring of NPDSH while the transition ion at m/z 183 was selected for NPHBH. The method has been validated according to the EU criteria of Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC at 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 μg kg- 1 in muscle and liver tissue. A decision limit (CCα) was obtained of 0. 04 and 0. 025 μg kg- 1 in muscle and liver, respectively. Similarly a detection capability (CCβ) was obtained of 0. 10 and 0. 05 μg kg- 1 in muscle and liver, respectively. The introduction of HBH as an internal standard did not lead to a significant improvement of the quantitative performance of the method. In fact for liver better performance characteristics were obtained when the IS was not taken into account. Nevertheless, as a qualitative marker for recovery, HBH could still be very useful in the analysis of unknown samples. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, a {{sensitive}} and specific method {{was developed and}} fully validated for the quantification of the EU <b>marker</b> <b>residue</b> of tiamulin, 8 -alpha-hydroxy-mutilin, in rabbit muscle and liver tissues using liquid chromatography combined with positive heated electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with selection of the [M + H](+) ion in both quadrupoles 1 and 3, resulting in the SRM transition m/z 337. 25 > 337. 25 for quantification. Chromatography was performed using a Hypersil Gold C 18 column using a gradient elution program with water and methanol as mobile phases. The sample preparation procedure {{for the analysis of}} 8 -alpha-hydroxy-mutilin in liver and muscle samples consisted of three main steps: (1) extraction of the tissue matrix using 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid/acetone (50 / 50, v/v), (2) hydrolysis of tiamulin and metabolites to 8 -alpha-hydroxy-mutilin in alkaline medium at 45 A degrees C, and (3) liquid-liquid extraction in acidic medium using ethyl acetate. This is the first method presenting fully validated results, encompassing a linearity of 50 to 2, 000 mu g/kg, within-run and between-run accuracy and precision, limit of quantification (50 mu g/kg for both muscle and liver tissues), limit of detection (muscle, 11. 9 mu g/kg; liver, 20. 6 mu g/kg), extraction recovery (muscle, 66. 2 %; liver, 75. 5 %), signal suppression and enhancement (muscle, 51. 7 %; liver, 43. 3 %), carryover, applicability and practicability, and stability during storage and analysis. This novel method is therefore sensitive enough to be used for residue depletion studies of tiamulin in rabbits and for food safety monitoring with respect to MRL compliance of residues...|$|E

Liver (n = 736) and breast muscle samples (n = 342) were tested. DNC residues were determined in 40 % and 26 % of liver and breast muscle samples at levels greater than 12. 5 and 5 μg kg- 1, respectively. DNC residues were determined at > 200 μg kg- 1 in 12 and 0 % of liver and muscle samples, respectively. Samples of breast muscle (n = 217) imported from 11 countries were also tested for DNC residues. A lower incidence of DNC residues (6 %) was determined in imported breast muscle. Egg samples (n = 546) were tested and DNC residues were determined in nine samples, with levels ranging between 14 and 122 μg kg- 1. Analysis of poultry, carried out as part of official food inspection in the period 2004 to 2006, indicates a {{reduction in the number of}} broiler liver samples containing DNC at > 200 μg kg- 1, to approximately 7 %.
