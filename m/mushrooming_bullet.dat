60|$|Jim {{came out}} of his stupor. A <b>mushrooming</b> <b>bullet</b> had torn a great hole in his leg. Gale, upon examination, could not be sure the bones had been missed, but there was no bad break. The {{application}} of hot salt water made Jim groan. When he had been bandaged and laid beside Ladd, Gale went on to the cavalryman. Thorne was very weak and scarcely conscious. A furrow had been plowed through his scalp down to the bone. When it had been dressed, Mercedes collapsed. Gale laid her with the three in a row and covered them with blankets and the tarpaulin.|$|E
5000|$|In his African Rifles and Cartridges, John [...] "Pondoro" [...] Taylor {{wrote of}} the [...]333 Jeffery [...] "Time and again have I driven it the length of an animal’s body, and cut the {{perfectly}} <b>mushroomed</b> <b>bullet</b> out of his hindquarters. I have never had one break up." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the blind}} man and the dog, from midnight to dawn, {{successfully}} fought off twelve men equipped with the thunder of gunpowder and the wide-spreading, deep-penetrating, <b>mushroom</b> <b>bullets</b> of soft lead. And {{the blind man}} defended himself only with a bow and a hundred arrows. He discharged many hundreds of arrows which Jerry retrieved for him and which he discharged over and over. But Jerry aided valiantly and well, adding to Nalasu's acute hearing his own acuter hearing, circling noiselessly about the house and reporting where the attack pressed closest.|$|R
5000|$|Until 2001, K'Nex did {{not make}} sets {{containing}} licensed brands (as Lego had with Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc.), but often based its sets around popular fads (such as mech warriors and RC cars). In 2001, K'Nex broke from this trend and introduced a line of toys using the BattleTech/MechWarrior [...] label, and later launched the OCC (Orange County Chopper) line of toys in 2006 and a line of Sesame Street building sets in 2008. In 2011, K'Nex released a brand of Mario Kart Wii building sets with buildable karts and tracks as well as items and obstacles such as <b>Mushrooms,</b> <b>Bullet</b> Bills, Chain Chomps, Thwomps, Goombas, Shells and many more. This set came with Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Yoshi as the racers. Other licensed products that K'Nex has issued in recent years include Lincoln Logs, Tinkertoy, Angry Birds, KISS, The Beatles, and Monster Jam.|$|R

6000|$|... "That 150-grain soft-nose bullet is some executioner," [...] he declared, forcefully. [...] "Your <b>bullet</b> <b>mushroomed</b> {{just after}} {{it went into}} his breast. It tore his lung to pieces, cut open his heart, made a mess of kidneys an' paunch, an' broke his spine.... An' look at this hole where it came out!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ballistic vests use {{layers of}} very strong fibers to [...] "catch" [...] and deform a <b>bullet,</b> <b>mushrooming</b> {{it into a}} dish shape, and {{spreading}} its force over a larger portion of the vest fiber. The vest absorbs the energy from the deforming bullet, bringing it to a stop before it can completely penetrate the textile matrix. Some layers may be penetrated but as the bullet deforms, the energy is absorbed by a larger and larger fiber area.|$|R
40|$|During {{a recent}} {{homicide}} trial in San Diego, testimony was given concerning the ballistics of the fatal. 22 bullet. There {{was evidence of}} a second strike on a portion of <b>bullet’s</b> <b>mushroomed</b> surface (Fig. 1 A). It was alleged that the missile was tumbling when it struck the second object and that this second strike was {{from the direction of}} the base toward the nose of the bullet. In this case, the direction of the bullet impact on the second surface had important implications for the crime scene reconstruction. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, the direction of the second impact is at about a 45 o angle from the central axis of the bullet and there is a peculiar direction change of the tool marks in a portion of the strike zone. A careful examination of the bullet’s second impact surface suggests that the direction of this strike was toward the base of the bullet (i. e., from left to right in Fig...|$|R
