Happening in the ChristmasÂ´ cycle, since December, 24 to January, 6. They suffer influence of Coco (coconut), in musical forms and the everyday issues that are sung. The joy of Music of Baianas is extremely contagious, according to some authors the pace is called Pancada Motor (<b>Motor</b> <b>Knock).</b> They were a strong tradition of Alagoas, but today {{there are only a few}} groups in the state.|$|E

Pearson regained consciousness before he was lifted out of the car on a backboard and transported by ambulance to a waiting helicopter that transported him to Bristol Regional Medical Center. Pearson suffered a fractured pelvis, fractured right hand, and compound fracture to his left ankle, and underwent surgery the night of March 20 to repair the ankle injury. Two days later after the accident, he was released from the Bristol hospital and transported to Charlotte, NC. He was admitted into Carolinas Medical Center in fair condition.|$|R
40|$|The {{biogenic}} amines octopamine (OA) and tyramine (TA) modulate insect motor {{behavior in}} an antagonistic manner. OA generally enhances locomotor {{behaviors such as}} Drosophila larval crawling and flight, whereas TA decreases locomotor activity. However, the mechanisms and cellular targets of TA modulation of locomotor activity are incompletely understood. This study combines immunocytochemistry, genetics and flight behavioral assays in the Drosophila model system to test {{the role of a}} candidate enzyme for TA catabolism, named Nazgul (Naz), in flight motor behavioral control. We hypothesize that the dehydrogenase/reductase Naz represents a critical step in TA catabolism. Immunocytochemistry reveals that Naz is localized to a subset of Repo positive glial cells with cell bodies along the motor neuropil borders and numerous positive Naz arborizations extending into the synaptic flight <b>motor</b> neuropil. RNAi <b>knock</b> down of Naz in Repo positive glial cells reduces Naz protein level below detection level by Western blotting. The resulting consequence is a reduction in flight durations, thus mimicking known motor behavioral phenotypes as resulting from increased TA levels. In accord with the interpretation that reduced TA degradation by Naz results in increased TA levels in the flight motor neuropil, the motor behavioral phenotype can be rescued by blocking TA receptors. Our findings indicate that TA modulates flight motor behavior by acting on central circuitry and that TA is normally taken up from the central motor neuropil by Repo-positive glial cells, desaminated and further degraded by Naz...|$|R

Caption: "The mother of four children, supporting her family while her husband is in the hospital, was killed Tuesday morning when the car {{in which she was}} riding with three other Tinker field workers smashed into a passenger train at Meridian. The others were seriously injured. The 33 -year-old woman's death, and that of a 19 -year-old Hooker youth Monday, raised the state traffic toll to 293 for the year [...] only five less than the same time last year. The dead: Mrs. Zelma Smith, 33, of 119 N Redman, Bethany. Eugene Kriger, 19, Hooker. Hurled Into Ditch, Mrs. Smith has been employed in the sheet metal department at Tinker air force base since her husband, Tom, has been a patient for ________________________________________________ STATE TRAFFIC DEATHS 1955 to date, 293; July, 29 1954 to date, 298 : July, 23 ________________________ the last several months at Veterans administration hospital with a blood ailment. She was thrown from the car when it smashed into the passenger train and then was hurled into a 10 -foot-deep bar ditch beside the tracks. The accident occurred at 6 : 20 a. m. The victim suffered a deep puncture wound in the right chest wall. She was dead on arrival at Mercy hospital. Mrs. Smith was riding with Pauline Blanche Hill, 38, of 207 1 / 2 S College, Bethany, and George Maupin, 47, of 5101 NW 23, in a 1950 model auto driven by G. Y. Posey, 24, of 3735 N Williams. Driver Still Dazed, Posey and Mrs. Hill both were taken to Mercy hospital. He suffered a severe cut on his right side and a possible broken shoulder. Mrs. Hill, who works in the blueprint section at Tinker, suffered severe scalp lacerations. Maupin, who works in the mill section of the machine shot at (Related news, picture, Page 13) Tinker, suffered broken ribs and a cut on his arm. He was taken to St. Anthony hospital. Posey, an apprentice machinist, was still dazed an hour after the accident. He told a reporter: "I just don't remember ever seeing a train. No one yelled, or anything. I don't know how it happened. " Skid Marks Laid Down, Troopers R. E. Fromme and Leo Maxwell said Posey's vision was not obscured as he approached the crossing from the north on Meridian. His car laid down 70 feet of skid marks on the pavement before it crashed {{between the first and second}} passenger cars behind the diesel engine. The <b>motor</b> was <b>knocked</b> out of the car when it was hurled into the deep ditch. The auto was demolished. Fromme said train crewmen estimated damage to the two passenger cars at "between 4, 000 and 5, 000. " Cremen plan to "sidetrack" one car in Oklahoma City because of a damaged brake system. About 55 mph, When ambulance drivers arrived on the scene, just north of W Reno, Mrs. Smith's body was lying in front of the smashed auto. The other three had climbed from the car but were still dazed. The engineer, L. B. Maynard, Shawnee, and conductor, A. G. Osborn, Amarillo, Texas, estimated the speed of the train at the time of the accidnet at 55 miles and hour. There is a cross-arm railroad sign at the crossing, but no automatic signal light. The skid marks indicated Posey swerved to the left in a futile effort to avoid smashing into the train. ...|$|R
