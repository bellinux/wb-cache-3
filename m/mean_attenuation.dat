50|$|The various {{methods have}} {{slightly}} different interpretations, however, each method has an effective percentile {{associated with the}} rating for which that percent of the users {{should be able to}} achieve the rated attenuation. For instance the NRR is determined by the <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> minus two standard deviations, thus it translates to a 98% statistic. That is at least 98 percent of users should be able to achieve that level of attenuation. The SNR and HML are a mean minus one standard deviation statistic. Therefore, approximately 86% of the users should be able to achieve that level of protection. Similarly, the NRR(SF) is a mean minus one standard deviation and represents an 86% of users should achieve that level of protection. The difference between the ratings lies in how the protectors are tested. NRR is tested with an experimenter-fit protocol. SNR/HML are tested with an experienced subject-fit protocol. NRR(SF) is tested with a naive subject-fit protocol. According to Murphy et al. (2004), these three protocols will yield different amounts of attenuation with the NRR being the greatest and NRR(SF) being the least.|$|E

Recent work correlates mean computed tomography (CT) attenuation in the level I (L 1) vertebra with bone mineral density (BMD), {{making it possible to}} objectively evaluate the magnitude of bone loss in osteoporosis by this method. The aims of this study were to evaluate the utility of using CT scans in patients with acute thoracic and lumbar spine fractures to diagnose osteoporosis and using CT attenuation to evaluate the association between age and BMD. Methods:We performed a retrospective study of patients with acute fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine who had also undergone an abdominal (or L 1) CT scan and compared <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> in L 1 against threshold values. We also compared differences in CT attenuation between younger (< 65 years) and older (65 years) and older patients. Results: A total of 124 patients were evaluated (74 thoracic and 50 lumbar fractures). Overall, there was a strong correlation between age and bone density as measured by CT attenuation (r. 76). Among those with thoracic fractures (< 65 years), <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> was 196. 51 HU. Forty-one patients were 65 years and had <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> of 105. 90 HU (P <. 001).

At the threshold of 110 HU, set for specificity, the magnitude of difference between the age-stratified cohorts was greater in the thoracic spine (P <. 0001 vs P. 003). Discussion: Using opportunistic CT, we demonstrate the relative frequency of osteoporosis in patients with acute fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine and confirm that the association increases with age.

Artifacts are caused by abrupt transitions between low- and high-density materials, which results in data values that exceed the dynamic range of the processing electronics. Two-dimensional CT images are conventionally rendered so that the view is as though looking up at it from the patient's feet. Hence, the left side of the image is to the patient's right and vice versa, while anterior in the image also is the patient's anterior and vice versa. This left-right interchange corresponds to the view that physicians generally have in reality when positioned in front of patients. CT data sets have a very high dynamic range which must be reduced for display or printing. This is typically done via a process of [...] "windowing", which maps a range (the [...] "window") of pixel values to a greyscale ramp. For example, CT images of the brain are commonly viewed with a window extending from 0 HU to 80 HU. Pixel values of 0 and lower, are displayed as black; values of 80 and higher are displayed as white; values within the window are displayed as a grey intensity proportional to position within the window. The window used for display must be matched to the X-ray density of the object of interest, in order to optimize the visible detail.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} the radiological characteristics of focal autoimmune pancreatitis (f-AIP) useful for differentiation from pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and triple-phase computed tomography (CT) scans of 79 patients (19 with f-AIP, 30 with PC, and 30 {{with a normal}} pancreas) were evaluated retrospectively. A radiologist measured the CT attenuation of the pancreatic parenchyma, the f-AIP and PC lesions in triple phases. The <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> values of the f-AIP lesions were {{compared with those of}} PC, and the <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> values of pancreatic parenchyma in the three groups were compared. The diagnostic performance of CT attenuation changes from arterial phase to hepatic phase in the differentiation between f-AIP and PC was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We also investigated the incidence of previously reported radiological findings for differentiation between f-AIP and PC. RESULTS: The <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> values of f-AIP lesions in enhanced phases were significantly higher than those of PC (arterial phase: 60 1; 7 vs 48 1; 10, P < 0. 05; pancreatic phase: 85 1; 6 vs 63 1; 15, P < 0. 05; hepatic phase: 95 1; 7 vs 63 1; 13, P < 0. 05). The <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> values of f-AIP lesions were significantly lower those of uninvolved pancreas and normal pancreas in the arterial and pancreatic phase of CT (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001), with no significant difference at the hepatic phase or unenhanced scanning (P = 0. 4, P = 0. 1). When the attenuation value increase was equal or more than 28 HU this was considered diagnostic for f-AIP, and a sensitivity of 87. 5 %, specificity of 100 % and an area under the ROC curve of 0. 974 (95 %CI: 0. 928 - 1. 021) were achieved. Five findings were more frequently observed in f-AIP patients: (1) sausage-shaped enlargement; (2) delayed homogeneous enhancement; (3) hypoattenuating capsule-like rim; (4) irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and/or stricture of the common bile duct (CBD); and (5) MPD upstream dilation &#x 2264; 5 mm.

The study included 194 patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative CT between January 2013 and December 2013. Quantitative CT feature analysis of the lung adenocarcinomas were performed using in-house software based on plug-in package for ImageJ. Ten quantitative features demonstrating the tumor size, attenuation, shape and texture were extracted. The CT parameters obtained from 1 -mm and 5 -mm data were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to investigate the association between tumor recurrence and preoperative CT findings. The 1 -mm and 5 -mm data were highly correlated in terms of diameter, perimeter, area, <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> and entropy. Circularity and aspect ratio were moderately correlated.

40|$|Background and objective: Advances in {{high-resolution}} {{computed tomography}} (CT) scanning {{have increased the}} detection of small ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules and also allowed such images to be investigated in detail. However, {{it is difficult to}} differentiate atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) from adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) with CT, even at follow-up, because they share many similar CT manifestations. While AAH is thought to be a precursor or even an early-stage lesion of lung adenocarcinoma, and the stepwise progression from AAH to AIS is thought to be reasonable. Therefore, the hypothesis that the attenuation of GGO is increased gradually from AAH to AIS is proposed. The aim {{of this study was to}} distinguish AAH from AIS with CT attenuation in patients with pure GGO nodules.  Methods: Between January 2010 and December 2012, the CT findings in terms of the greatest diameter and <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> (HU) were reviewed and correlated with pathology in 56 patients with AAH (n= 21) and non-mucinous AIS (n= 38) by two independent observers. All the 59 lesions were pure GGO nodules with size of 2 cm or smaller. To determine variability of measuring CT attenuation, we calculated the 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the limits of agreement by using Bland-Altman analysis. Student t test was used to compare AAH and AIS in terms of diameter and CT attenuation. And receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value of <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> for differentiating AAH from AIS and obtain the diagnostic value. Two-tailed P value of less than 0. 05 was considered to be significant.  Results: For the manually measured CT attenuation, the 95 %CI for the limits of agreement was - 40 HU, 50 HU for inter-observer variability. Although there was significant difference in nodule diameter between AAH and AIS (P= 0. 046), the overlap was considerable. The <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> was (- 718 ± 53) HU (95 %CI: - 822, - 604) for AAH, which was significantly smaller than (- 600 ± 35) HU (95 %CI: - 669, - 531) for AIS (P= 0. 013). The area under curve (AUC) from ROC was 0. 903 for differentiating AAH from AIS, and the cut-off value of - 632 HU was optimal for differentiation between AAH and AIS, with sensitivity of 0. 79, specificity of 0. 95, and accuracy of 0. 85.  Conclusion: The <b>mean</b> CT <b>attenuation</b> can help the radiological differentiation between AAH and AIS...|$|R

Sixty-five nodules were classified as lipid-rich adenomas if they had an unenhanced CT attenuation of {{less than or equal}} to 10 H. Thirty-one masses were classified as lipid-poor adenomas if they had an unenhanced CT attenuation greater than 10 H and stability for more than 1 year. Thirty-six masses were classified as lung cancer metastases if they showed rapid growth in 1 year (n = 27) or were biopsy-proven (n = 9). Histogram analysis was performed for all lesions to provide the <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> value and percentage of negative pixels. RESULTS: All lipid-rich adenomas had more than 10 % negative pixels; 51. 6 % of lipid-poor adenomas had more than 10 % negative pixels and would have been classified as indeterminate nodules on the basis of <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> alone.

40|$|PURPOSE: To use {{qualitative}} and quantitative computed tomography (CT) {{to test the hypothesis}} that impaired lung function with silicosis is due to progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and associated emphysema. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six men with silicosis underwent volumetric and thin-section CT of the thorax. Lung function, Borg scale dyspnea grade, silica exposure duration, and cigarette consumption were determined. Nodular profusion (NP) at chest radiography was graded according to the International Labor Organization radiographic classification system; NP and PMF at CT were visually graded by using five-point (ie, grades 0 - 4) and four-point (grades 0 - 3) scales, respectively. Emphysema and NP, which together are defined as the NP index, were quantified by using attenuation threshold values of less than - 950 HU and greater than - 100 HU, respectively. <b>Mean</b> lung <b>attenuation</b> was also determined. Relationships among the CT, chest radiographic, and clinical parameters were analyzed by using Spearman correlation. RESULTS: NP at chest radiography correlated (r > 0. 50) with all CT parameters of nodularity. CT PMF had the highest correlation with emphysema (r = 0. 58, P <. 001). NP at chest radiography and all CT parameters were inversely related to lung function. At multiple regression analysis, PMF and emphysema index (both at CT) were significant determinants of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) (P =. 006 and. 03, respectively) and FEV 1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio (P =. 007 and. 02, respectively). <b>Mean</b> lung <b>attenuation</b> remained related to FVC (P =. 03), diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (P =. 04), and Borg scale grade (P =. 01). Cigarette consumption and silica exposure duration had no independent effects on lung function. CONCLUSION: Qualitative and quantitative CT parameters can be used as indirect measures of functional impairment in silicosis. PMF and emphysema are independently related to airflow obstruction, whereas <b>mean</b> lung <b>attenuation</b> is related to clinical dyspnea and reduced lung volume. © RSNA, 2003. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

BackgroundAttenuated plaques identified by grayscale intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) might predict transient deterioration in coronary flow and/or no-reflow during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MethodsWe analyzed clinical, angiographic, and IVUS data from 364 patients (n = 364 infarct-related arteries) enrolled in the randomized HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial. No-reflow was final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade ≤ 2 in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Attenuated plaque was hypoechoic or mixed atheroma with ultrasound attenuation without calcification. A <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> score was created by measuring the angle of attenuation each 1 mm, scoring the angle as 1 to 4 (corresponding to < 90 °, 90 ° to 180 °, 180 ° to 270 °, or 270 ° to 360 °, respectively), summing the scores, and normalizing for analysis length. ResultsOverall, 284 (78. 0 %) patients had attenuated plaques; no-reflow occurred in 37 (10. 2 %). Patients with no-reflow had a higher <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> score (median [interquartile range] 2. 2 [0. 0 to 2. 8] vs. 1. 3 [0. 7 to 1. 8], p < 0. 001), lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (52. 8 % [43. 2 % to 61. 5 %] vs. 61. 4 % [52. 2 % to 68. 1 %], p = 0. 002), and more baseline angiographic thrombus (89. 2 % vs. 74. 1 %, p = 0. 043) with no differences in post-PCI stent expansion versus patients without no-reflow. Multivariate analysis indicated that <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> score was the strongest predictor of no-reflow. The <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> score that best predicted no-reflow was ≥ 2 points (90 ° to 180 °, sensitivity of 81. 5 %, and specificity of 80. 5 %).

The amount of attenuated plaque strongly correlated with no-reflow; the larger the attenuated plaque, the greater the likelihood of no-reflow.

This was done by determining the total volume of arm voxels added to the Dixon sequence-derived attenuation map by MLAA with attenuation values higher than 0.005  cm- 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study {{was to assess the}} {{differentially}} diagnostic value of radiographic characteristics of pure ground glass nodules (GGNs) between minimally invasive adenocarcinoma and non-invasive neoplasm. Sixty-seven pure GGNs (28 minimally invasive adenocarcinomas (MIA) and 39 pre-invasive lesions) were analyzed from June 2012 to June 2015. Pre-invasive lesions consisted of 15 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and 24 adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features and volume of MIA and pre-invasive lesions were assessed. Fisher exact test, independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. Inter-observer agreement indexes for the diameter, <b>mean</b> HRCT <b>attenuations</b> and volume of pure GGNs were all high (ICC> 0. 75). Univariate analyses showed that lesion diameter, <b>mean</b> HRCT <b>attenuation,</b> and volume value differed significantly between two groups. Among HRCT findings, GGN shape as round or oval (F = 13. 456, P = 0. 002) and lesion borders as smooth or notched (F = 15. 742, P = 0. 001) frequently appeared in pre-invasive lesions in comparison with MIA. Type II and type III of the relationship between blood vessels and pure GGNs suggested higher possibility of malignancy than type I. HRCT features of pure GGNs can help to differentiate MIA from non-invasive neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} a methodology in which fractile distances {{for a given}} macroseismic intensity are used as a point measure on which to do attenuation characterization. The use of statistically derived distances expected not to be exceeded at a given probability avoids ambiguous definition of isoseismal radii, and consequent mis- interpretation of attenuation parameters with a physical content. The utility and definiteness of such a fractile distance is evident when treating many earthquakes, of different magnitudes and for which the macroseismic data-sets are of different sizes. The methodology is applied to 55 Italian earthquakes {{of the last four}} centuries, with epicentral intensity ranging from VII to XI MCS. Propagation properties in volcanic districts are peculiar, with a rapid decay of observed intensity from the epicentre. The attenuation properties of the other crustal en- vironments are not clcarly correlated with the geodynamic domain; the earthquakes show a mean behaviour that appears to depend on relatively homogeneous conditions of propagation. Source depth, tectonic style and finiteness of the source are not addressed because only macroseismic surveying had been applied to most of the earthquakes, and they cannot be linked to surficial fault ruptures. The study is intended to provide <b>mean</b> <b>attenuations</b> {{that can be used in}} probabilistic seismic hazard studies; the variabiljty of individual earthquake attenuations for a region introduces the need to use different parameters in future deterministic earthquake scenarios...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the attenuation {{and integration of}} spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs) in the dendrites of presumed motoneurons (MNs) of organotypic rat spinal cord cultures. Simultaneous whole cell recordings in current-clamp mode were made from either the soma and a dendrite or from two dendrites. Direct comparison of the two voltage recordings revealed that the membrane potentials at the two recording sites followed each other very closely except for the fast-rising phases of the EPSPs. The dendritic recording represented a low-pass filtered version of the somatic recording and vice versa. A computer-assisted method was developed to fit the sEPSPs with a generalized alpha-function for measuring their amplitudes and rise times (10 - 90 %). The <b>mean</b> EPSP peak <b>attenuation</b> between the two recording electrodes was determined by a maximum likelihood analysis that extracted populations of similar amplitude ratios from the fitted events at each electrode. For each pair of recordings, the amplitude attenuation ratio for EPSP traveling from dendrite to soma was larger than that traveling from soma to dendrite. The linear relation between <b>mean</b> ln <b>attenuation</b> and distance between recording electrodes was used to map 1 /e attenuations into units of distance (micron). For EPSPs with typical time course traveling from the somatic to the dendritic recording electrode, the <b>mean</b> 1 /e <b>attenuation</b> corresponded to 714 micron for EPSPs traveling in the opposite direction, the <b>mean</b> 1 /e <b>attenuation</b> corresponded to 263 micron. As predicted from cable analysis, fast EPSPs attenuated more in both the somatofugal and somatopetal direction than did slow EPSPs. For EPSPs with rise times shorter than approximately 2. 0 ms, the attenuation factor increased steeply. Compartmental computer modeling of the experiments with biocytin-filled and reconstructed MNs that used passive membrane properties revealed amplitude attenuation ratios of the EPSP traveling in both the somatofugal and somatopetal direction that were comparable to those observed in real experiments. The modeling of a barrage of sEPSPs further confirmed that the somato-dendritic compartments of a MN are virtually isopotential except for the fast-rising phase of EPSPs. Large, transient differences in membrane potential are locally confined {{to the site of}} EPSP generation. Comparing the modeling results with the experiments suggests that the observed attenuation ratios are adequately explained by passive membrane properties alone...|$|R
30|$|Spherical {{regions of}} {{interest}} (ROIs) (diameter, 10  mm; volume, 519  mm 3) {{were placed in}} the following nine anatomic structures by a single reader (KC, 1  year experience): liver at the diaphragm, liver at the porta hepatis, renal cortex at the renal hilum, psoas muscle at the iliac crest, bladder, gluteus maximus {{at the level of the}} top of the acetabulum, buttock fat, ischiorectal fossa fat and intraperitoneal fat in the left upper quadrant. Background noise was determined by placing the ROI in the air outside the patient’s body. In each structure, efforts were made to place the ROI in as homogeneous an area as possible, away from blood vessels, fat planes, etc. <b>Mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> in HU and standard deviation of the <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> in the ROI were recorded on CD-CT and LD-CT images reconstructed with FBP, ASiR- 40, ASiR- 70 and ASiR- 90 including 2  mm, 5  mm and 5  mm MIP reformats. The standard deviation of the <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> in the ROI served as an objective measure of noise [34]. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within each ROI was calculated by dividing the mean HU by its standard deviation [35]. It was not possible to accurately place the ROIs within the required anatomical structures in two patients (both with BMI[*]>[*] 40) because of severe degradation of image quality in the LD-CT series; therefore quantitative analysis of image noise was performed in 31 of 33 patients equating to a total of 11, 160 data points for analysis (31 patients; 4 LD reconstructions; 3 reformat types; 10 ROIs; 3 values per ROI). Objective noise indices were statistically compared by deriving the mean objective noise (SD of HU within ROI) at the ten measured levels for each data set.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{correlate}} left main (LM) coronary artery dimensions with the presence of atherosclerosis by multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography (CA) and to assess coronary atherosclerotic plaques with a semiquantitative method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients (41 men, mean age 60 +/- 11) with suspected coronary artery disease underwent 64 -MDCT coronary angiography. LM dimensions (length, ostial and bifurcation diameters), quantitative [location, Hounsfield unit (HU) attenuation] and qualitative (composition, shape) analysis of plaques within the LM were performed. All patients underwent conventional CA. RESULTS: Thirty patients (mean age 55 +/- 10) without plaques in the LM presented the following average dimensions: length 10. 6 +/- 6. 1 mm, ostial diameter 5. 5 +/- 0. 7 mm, bifurcation diameter 4. 9 +/- 0. 9 mm. LM plaques (n= 36) were detected in 32 patients (mean age 64 +/- 10) with the following LM average dimensions: length 11. 3 +/- 4. 0 mm, ostial diameter 6. 0 +/- 1. 2 mm and bifurcation diameter 6. 0 +/- 1. 2 mm. Plaques were calcified (40 %, <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> 742 +/- 191 HU), mixed (43 %, <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> 387 +/- 94 HU) or noncalcified (17 %, <b>mean</b> <b>attenuation</b> 56 +/- 14 HU) and were frequently eccentric (77 %). Age was significantly different in the two groups (p< 0. 05). LM diameters of patients with plaques were improved (p< 0. 05). A moderate correlation was found between the LM bifurcation diameter and the corresponding plaque area (r= 0. 56). Significant conventional CA lesions of the LM were present in just three patients (5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Increased LM diameters are associated with the presence of atherosclerosis. MDCT CA indicates relevant features of LM atherosclerotic burden, as rupture and subsequent thrombosis of vulnerable plaques may develop from lesions characterised as nonsignificant at conventional CA...|$|E

40|$|Introduction/purpose Different {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} severe vacuolar hepatopathy with fat accumulation in canine and feline liver. Hepatic lipidosis, in cats, usually results from chronic anorexia and weight loss due to different causes. In dogs, steatosis is generally associated with diabetes mellitus and with hepatocellular vacuolar changes occurring in canine hyperadrenocorticism. The definitive diagnosis is histological, but ultrasonographic or tomographic images may allow a non-invasive description of vacuolar hepatopathy. In human medicine, unenhanced CT is considered {{the best way to}} assess fat accumulation within the liver. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe an uncommon tomographic pattern of canine and feline vacuolar hepatopathy with fat accumulation. Methods One Labrador retriever and one domestic shorthair cat were referred to our centers after hematology, biochemistry and abdominal ultrasound, for a total body CT due to a suspicion of hyperadrenocorticism syndrome and hepatic disease, respectively. Blood tests revealed an increase of liver enzymes in both animals, albumin/globulin ratio in the cat and blood urea nitrogen, glucose and triglycerides in the dog. Ultrasonography showed an increased liver echogenicity and - in the dog - increase in size of the left adrenal gland. Plain and post-contrast (600 mg/kg i. v. Iodine) total body CT acquisition with soft tissue algorithm was performed. Circular regions of interest (ROI) with an area of 2 cm 2 were drawn over the liver avoiding major hepatic and portal vessels. For each ROI, mean (standard deviation, SD) attenuation values (HU, Hounsfield Units) were recorded. <b>Mean</b> (SD) hepatic <b>attenuation</b> values of the two investigated animals were compared to the <b>mean</b> (SD) hepatic <b>attenuation</b> values measured in 10 dogs and 10 cats which underwent CT for unrelated liver diseases, used as control. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) and tissue core biopsy of the liver were also performed in the cat and in the dog, respectively. Results On pre-contrast images, the liver of the dog had a <b>mean</b> (SD) hepatic <b>attenuation</b> value of - 18, 39 HU (12, 78) (Fig. 1), while the liver of the cat had attenuation of - 25, 04 HU (7, 15) (Fig. 2). The average of the <b>mean</b> (SD) hepatic <b>attenuation</b> values in all dogs without hepatic diseases was 63, 85 HU (12, 03), while it was 55, 25 HU (6, 77) in the cats with normal liver. Post-contrast CT images revealed a <b>mean</b> (SD) hepatic <b>attenuation</b> value of 30, 04 HU (15, 7) in the dog and 25, 61 (10, 48) in the cat. The control animals presented an average of the <b>mean</b> (SD) hepatic <b>attenuation</b> values of 136, 28 (15, 02) in dogs and 129, 25 (9, 66) in cats. (Fig. 3). The tomographic diagnosis of lipidosis in the cat and steatosis/hyperadrenocorticism in the dog were confirmed by cytological and histopathological examination, respectively. Discussion/Conclusions Negative hepatic attenuation values with fat storage describe a hypoattenuating reverse CT pattern of the parenchyma, when compared to hepatic vascular structures...|$|R

In the estimate many parameters should be evaluated, including the <b>mean,</b> variance, <b>attenuation</b> and the normality. Then how the inaccuracies of so many parameters affect the security becomes a problem.

Through analyzing Eve's possible attack way of obtaining additional information, we show which parameter is determinant under specific conditions. Finally, we will see that the minimum sample size for the channel test should be exponentially proportional to the transmission distance...|$|R
