5|$|Though the German {{advance in}} the south was slower than planned, it was faster than the Soviets expected. On 9 July, the first German units reached the Psel River. The next day, the first German {{infantry}} crossed the river. Despite the deep defensive system and minefields, German tank losses remained lower than the Soviet's. At this point, Hoth turned the II SS Panzer Corps away from Oboyan to attack toward the northeast {{in the direction of}} Prokhorovka. The main concern of Manstein and Hausser was the inability of Army Detachment Kempf to advance and protect the eastern flank of the II SS Panzer Corps. On 11 July, Army Detachment Kempf finally achieved a breakthrough. In a surprise night attack, the 6th Panzer Division seized a bridge across the Donets. Once across, Breith <b>made</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> push troops and vehicles across the river for an advance on Prokhorovka from the south. A linkup with the II SS Panzer Corps would result with the Soviet 69th Army becoming encircled.|$|E

5|$|Elvas {{was reached}} by the Spanish army on 22 October and a siege begun. Although the fortifications could not ensure safety from a {{full-scale}} assault supported with heavy guns, they enabled the defenders to withstand a considerable attack for enough time to allow the Portuguese to mobilize a relief army in Estremoz, firstly under André de Albuquerque and later under António Luís de Meneses, Count of Cantanhede. On 17 January, around 8 o'clock in the morning, the Portuguese attacked the Spanish in their trenches. The battle was undecided in its initial stages, as the Duke of San Germán and other Spanish generals <b>made</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> collect their troops and recover the lost ground, but after some time, the Portuguese forces of Cantanhede managed to break the lines and the Spanish retreated to Badajoz with great loss: from the initial army of 17, 500 men, only 5,000 infantry men plus 1,300 horsemen managed to reach Badajoz, and all the artillery together with 5,000 men, 15,000 firearms, luggage and correspondence, were captured. The Portuguese army again besieged Badajoz shortly after, bringing events in the region full circle, but failed once again to take the city. By then, {{the signing of the}} Treaty of the Pyrenees had ended Spains's war with France and the recovery of Portugal had become the main objective of Philip IV.|$|E

In spite of this delay however, still no passengers came forward, and the ship would make her historic voyage purely in an experimental capacity.|$|E
25|$|The support {{given by}} Federal Reserve Board, under Ben Bernanke, and the US Treasury with Paulson at the helm, in the {{acquisition}} of Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan and the $200bn facility made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac attracted {{a great deal of}} criticism in congress by both Republicans and Democrats. Paulson and Geithner <b>made</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> enable Barclays to acquire Lehman Brothers, including convincing other large Wall Street firms to commit their own funds to support the deal. In light of the recent Bear Stearns criticism, Paulson was against committing public funds towards a bailout, for fear of being labelled 'Mr Bailout'. When British regulators indicated they would not approve the purchase, Lehman went into bankruptcy, and Paulson and Geithner worked to contain the systemic impact.|$|E

25|$|The French <b>made</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> rescue Jacobite chieftains {{as well as}} Charles, {{and gave}} him a hero's welcome on his return to France, but soon tired of his badgering them to provide a renewed assault on the Hanoverians. After French {{victories}} knocked the Netherlands out of the war, the British offered reasonable peace terms and made the expulsion of Charles from France a precondition of negotiations. Charles ignored the French court's order to depart, continued to demand military action and support for his extravagant lifestyle and flaunted his presence around Paris as peace negotiations for the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle got under way. After British complaints the French government lost patience with Charles and in December 1748 he was seized {{on his way to the}} Opéra and briefly jailed before being expelled.|$|E
25|$|In late 1809, , {{under the}} command of Commander Francis Stanfell, formed part of the {{squadron}} off Guadeloupe under Captain Volant Vashon Ballard of Blonde. On 11 January 1810, Ballard detached Stanfell to attempt to cut out a French brig anchored near the shore. At about 9pm, Scorpion spotted Oreste clearing the north point of the bay. Stanfell set off in pursuit. During the chase Scorpions crew had to use her sweeps before she could close with Oreste at about 11:30pm. The action lasted for two to two-and-a-half hours, with Scorpion also being exposed to fire from the shore. Oreste <b>made</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> escape or run on shore, but Stanfell's skillful sailing frustrated these efforts. Oreste, which had been dismasted, finally struck her colours at 1:30am on 12 January. At this point a barge from Blonde arrived and assisted in the capture.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 1968, Ralph Ponte, one {{of three}} {{civilian}} pilots to hold a rating for the F-15, was flying a series of routine Phos-Chek drops on a fire raging near Hollister, California. In {{an effort to reduce}} his return time Ponte opted to reload at a small airfield nearer the fire. The runway was shorter than the one in Fresno, and despite Ponte reducing his load, hot air from the nearby fire reduced the surrounding air pressure and rendered the aircraft overweight. Even at full power the Reporter had not rotated after clearing the 3,500ft (1,067m) marker, and Ponte quickly decided to abort his takeoff. He <b>made</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> control the hurtling craft, but the Reporter careened off the runway and through a vegetable patch, before striking an embankment which tore off the landing gear. The aircraft then slid sideways, broke up, and caught fire. Ponte scrambled through the shattered canopy unhurt, while a firefighting TBM Avenger dropped its load of Phos-Chek on the plane's two engines, possibly saving Ponte's life. The F-15, though intact, was deemed too badly damaged to rebuild, and was soon scrapped, bringing an end to the career of one of Northrop's most successful designs.|$|E

Our experimental investigation results in discovery of four type effective catalysts to the reaction of decarboxylation of model carboxylic acid compounds. The adsorption experiment revealed the effectiveness of several solid materials to naphthenic acid adsorption and acidity reduction of crude oil, which can be either natural minerals or synthesized materials. The test with crude oil also received promising results, which can be potentially developed into a practical process for oil industry. The theoretical work predicted several possible catalytic decarboxylation mechanisms that would govern the decarboxylation pathways {{depending on the type of}} catalysts being used.
