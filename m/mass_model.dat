We construct a refined sample {{of more than}} 100 multiple images for each cluster {{by taking advantage of}} the full depth HFF images, and conduct <b>mass</b> <b>modeling</b> using the GLAFIC software, which assumes simply parametrized mass distributions. Our <b>mass</b> <b>modeling</b> also exploits a magnification constraint from the lensed Type Ia supernova HFF 14 Tom for Abell 2744 and positional constraints from the multiple images S 1 -S 4 of the lensed supernova SN Refsdal for MACS J 1149. 6 + 2223. We find that our best-fitting <b>mass</b> <b>models</b> reproduce the observed image positions with RMS errors of ∼ 0. 4 arcsec, which are smaller than RMS errors in previous <b>mass</b> <b>modeling</b> that adopted similar numbers of multiple images. Our model predicts a new image of SN Refsdal with a relative time delay and magnification that are fully consistent with a recent detection of reappearance. We then construct catalogs of z∼ 6 - 9 dropout galaxies behind the four clusters and estimate magnification factors for these dropout galaxies with our best-fitting <b>mass</b> <b>models.</b> The dropout sample from the four cluster fields contains ∼ 120 galaxies at z≳ 6, about 20 of which are predicted to be magnified by a factor of more than 10.

Boris Chertok claimed that a <b>mass</b> <b>model</b> lunar module was also carried; however, most sources indicate {{that only the}} L1S-2 and boost stages were on board N-1 5L. Launch took place at 11:18 PM Moscow time. For a few moments, the rocket lifted into the night sky. As soon as it cleared the tower, there was a flash of light, and debris could be seen falling {{from the bottom of}} the first stage. All the engines instantly shut down except engine #18. This caused the N-1 to lean over at a 45-degree angle and drop back onto launch pad 110 East. The nearly 2300 tons of propellant on board triggered a massive blast and shock wave that shattered windows across the launch complex and sent debris flying as far as 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the epicenter of the explosion. Launch crews were permitted outside half an hour after the accident and encountered droplets of unburned RP-1 still raining down from the sky. The majority of the N-1's propellant load had not been consumed in the accident, and most of what had burned was in the first stage of the rocket. Moreover, the worst-case scenario, mixing of the RP-1 and LOX to form an explosive gel, had not occurred. The subsequent investigation revealed that up to 85% of the propellant on board the rocket did not detonate, reducing the force of the blast. The launch escape system had activated at the moment of engine shutdown (T+15 seconds) and pulled the L1S-2 capsule to safety 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) away. Impact with the pad occurred at T+23 seconds. Launch Complex 110 East was thoroughly leveled by the blast, with the concrete pad caved in and one of the lighting towers knocked over and twisted around itself. Despite the devastation, most of the telemetry tapes were found intact in the debris field and examined.|$|E

In particular, nuclear masses at the limits of stability are critical in the development of stellar structure and the origin of the elements. In this contribution we test and validate the predictions of recently refined nuclear <b>mass</b> <b>models</b> against the newly published AME 2016 compilation. The basic paradigm underlining the recently refined nuclear <b>mass</b> <b>models</b> is based on existing state-of-the-art models that are subsequently refined through the training of an artificial neural network. We observe a significant improvement in the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) predictions relative to the corresponding "bare" models when compared to the nearly 50 new masses reported in the AME 2016 compilation. Further, AME 2016 estimates for the handful of impactful isotopes in the determination of r-process abundances are found to be in fairly good agreement with our theoretical predictions. Indeed, the BNN-improved Duflo-Zuker model predicts a root-mean-square deviation relative to experiment of about 400 keV. Given the excellent performance of the BNN refinement in confronting the recently published AME 2016 compilation, we are confident of its critical role in our quest for <b>mass</b> <b>models</b> of the highest quality. Moreover, as uncertainty quantification {{is at the core of}} the BNN approach, the improved <b>mass</b> <b>models</b> are in a unique position to identify those nuclei that will have the strongest impact in resolving some of the outstanding questions in nuclear astrophysics.
