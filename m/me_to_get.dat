The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E

[...] A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936. [...] Frise talked of their blunderings to the Star: [...] "We've fried eggs on the city hall steps. We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement. I once let Greg persuade <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a steam shovel to do my spring digging and ruined my garden.

500|$|The {{story was}} {{collected}} together {{and published by}} Editions Casterman as Objectif Lune in 1953. The title had been Hergé's own choice, having rejected Casterman's suggestion of Tintin and the Nuclear Rocket. For publication in book form, the story was re-coloured, with various changes being made; for instance, in the serialised version, the uniforms worn by staff were green, and they are changed to blue for the book volume. A number of scenes were also deleted. Hergé sent a copy to Ananoff, with a message stating that [...] "Your help, your knowledge, has been invaluable, enabling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my little characters to the Moon... and {{to bring them back}} safe and sound." [...] An English-language translation of the book was published in 1959.|$|E

The song was written by series music producer Adam Anders with his wife Nikki Hassman, and writing partner Peer Åström. According to Anders the song was specifically crafted for Michele and was based on the storyline of Michele's character in the series, Rachel Berry. Anders told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lea’s storyline kind of inspired that song for me,” says Anders. [...] "Basically, you try to do everything right and you have good motivations with everything you’re doing but everything ends up going wrong.

500|$|Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence. Aged five, Beyoncé {{attended}} {{her first}} ever concert where Jackson performed and she {{claims to have}} realized her purpose. When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, [...] "if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed." [...] She admires Diana Ross as an [...] "all-around entertainer" [...] and Whitney Houston, who she said [...] "inspired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up there and do what she did." [...] She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song [...] "Vision of Love" [...] as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child. Her other musical influences include Aaliyah, Prince, Lauryn Hill, Sade Adu, Donna Summer, Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.|$|E
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come to my Knowledge, all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time. Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set {{the theme of the}} work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E

500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to write a piece that calls you into the movie and lets you know something bad is going to happen from the get go", Walker said. According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E
500|$|Strapping Young Lad {{began working}} on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's {{previous}} album did {{not live up to}} expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder. [...] "I think that as an artist, in order for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the next plateau, I kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy," [...] he explains. [...] "And Alien was no exception with that." [...] Although Townsend considered the album an [...] "impenetrable mass of technicality", it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game [...]|$|E
500|$|... "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)", is {{a remake}} of [...] "A Tout le Monde" [...] which {{originally}} appeared on the 1994 album Youthanasia. The song is a more uptempo version of the original song, and features Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia singing backing vocals. Scabbia stated she was [...] "really surprised about it because 'A Tout le Monde' is a song that I've always loved. It was a big surprise for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this invitation—I was really honored {{to be part of}} it." [...] Mustaine chose Scabbia over three other choices because of her [...] "reign in the heavy metal business". Mustaine later stated that he originally intended for the song to be a B-side for Japan, but the president of Roadrunner Records (Megadeth's label for this release) wanted [...] "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)" [...] released as the album's first single.|$|E

500|$|In August 2006, Carson joined Charlton Athletic on {{loan for}} the 2006–07 season, after Charlton failed {{in a bid}} for Norwich City goalkeeper Robert Green. Carson {{explained}} that [...] "Liverpool want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some experience and then hopefully I can go back next season and be challenging Pepe [...] for the number one spot. There {{were a couple of}} Championship clubs interested but I need to be playing Premiership football because Robert Green, Ben Foster and Chris Kirkland are going to be playing week in, week out so I need to be performing." [...] He played in 36 of 38 Premier League matches, missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal. Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain thanked his teammates. [...] "It wouldn't {{even have}} been close to {{possible}} without them. They wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it as much I did." [...] He added, [...] "They had {{to do more than}} just give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic." [...] Imhoff said Zinkoff's announcements did not help the Knicks' cause.|$|E
500|$|Heffron, humiliated {{and tired}} after several decades in ministerial office, {{resigned}} as Premier {{six months later}} on 30 April 1964 {{at the age of}} 73. His announcement came as a surprise to many members of his own party, although there had been existing hints in the previous months that the Labor caucus had been discussing a departure plan for Heffron, to be replaced by the Deputy Premier Renshaw. Heffron insisted that he had made the decision to himself a year prior, declaring: [...] "It was purely my own decision, so I cannot complain about anyone throwing me out or advising <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. Sometimes we are advised to get out – there are hints, but we don't take any notice when they come from outside, {{but it is not the}} same, of course, as coming from your own party." [...] Renshaw succeeded him as Premier. On 24 June 1964, Heffron was granted by Queen Elizabeth II retention of the title [...] "The Honourable" [...] for having served for more than three years as a Member of the Executive Council of New South Wales.|$|E
