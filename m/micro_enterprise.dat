The paper analyses statistical data, considers theory on knowledge management in <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises,</b> as well as explores recent trends and recommendations contained in literature and scientific journals. It is concluded that majority of <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> in rural areas of Vidzeme region pay insufficient attention to knowledge management. Unfortunately, <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> in rural areas are not knowledge intensive; they face different challenges, as well as lack basic knowledge management skills and tools.

According to EUROSTAT statistics [1], [2], 29. 6 % of the EU employees work in <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> (< 10 employees), while 20. 6 % are employed in small firms (< 50 employees). Indeed, half of the European workforce is working in small and <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> (with great variations between sectors).

To correct for endogeneity and selection bias we match clustered and dispersed <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> that share the same observable characteristics except for being clustered both in urban and rural areas. We classify these characteristics into enterprise specific factors and presence of activities outside clusters that include concentration of big manufacturing factories both in the same industry and operating in other industries and, access to markets, credit and transport infrastructure. We find that enterprise specific factors like gender and schooling affect the likelihood of being clustered both in urban and rural areas. Concentration of big textile factories are also important both in urban and rural areas depicting the importance of backward and forward linkages in terms of inputs sharing, and information spillover between big producers and <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> operating in the same industry. Concentration of big producers from other industries, on the other hand, are not important. Clustering is found to be important around markets and where there is access to transport infrastructure in urban areas. However, <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> are more likely to cluster in remote rural areas implying the importance of traders who link <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> with distant markets. The matching reveals that clustered <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> have higher level of profit both in urban and rural areas than dispersed ones showing that location economies exists within clusters...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} {{learning}} needs of <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> and to critically evaluate whether educators can deliver marketing skills to <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> {{to meet their}} needs. Prior Work Writers suggest that the marketing behaviour of small firms appears {{to be related to}} the motivation, belief, attitude and the objectives of the owner-manager and that when small businesses are formed, they are often based on a particular skill of the founder and that there are a number of barriers to learning. Academic research appears unable to resolve a number of questions about small businesses and their use of marketing and that further research is needed. Approach <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> are relatively easier to identify and make contact with relevant individuals compared with larger organisations. The geographic area of Hampshire, United Kingdom, has been chosen because of its accessibility, segmentation will be by type, e. g. Sole traders, Partnerships and Limited Companies. Both empirical quantitative and qualitative research paradigms will be engaged and the results compared with studies undertaken in 2005 by Simpson, Padmore and Taylor. Method(s) A qualitative naturalistic approach is being used to explore the views, behaviour and experiences within <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> compared to the quantitative data will give a more general and scientific overview. Techniques like qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires will be adopted as they are considered to be more appropriate in the field of social science research and in particular for this study. Results Potential outcomes: that the external and internal influences on a <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> do/do not impact on an individuals learning decision, that <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> do/do not really know what marketing is and do/do not engage in learning, that firms are not well understood by educators or that they are understood but fail to deliver appropriate skill training due to other constraints and that educators need to make a paradigm shift in their methods of delivery to <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises.</b> Implications The findings will establish how <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> acquire and learn the skills to market their business and evaluate the needs and wants of <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> and how they want to engage in learning new skills versus current delivery systems which are not customer led. Finally, after a critical analysis of whether educators can deliver marketing skills to <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> to meet the needs and wants of this sector more effectively a new model will be developed to reflect the research results. Value The core value of this paper is to put forward a new model for discussion of how these firms could have marketing skills delivered to them in a way which matches their needs and wants. The research will then lead us into a deeper understanding of <b>Micro</b> <b>Enterprises</b> and the development of alternative ways of delivering marketing skills to them. Approaches to training will have to change if educators want to engage with this sector...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Quantitative methods {{known as}} scoring {{models have been}} {{traditionally}} developed for credit granting decisions using statistical procedures. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a non-parametric credit scoring model for <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> that are not maintaining balance sheets, and without having a track record of performance and other credit-worthy parameters. Design/methodology/approach – Multilayer perceptron procedure is used to evaluate credit reliability in three classes of risk, i. e. bad risk credit, foreclosed risk credit and good risk credit. Findings – The development of a neural network model for <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> facilitates bankers and financial institutions in credit granting decisions in an automatic manner in the Indian context. Originality/value – This study applies comprehensive information on parameters of financial package prepared by Indian financial institutions and banks to <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> to design a credit risk model. This model, instead of categorizing borrowers in terms of their “ability to pay”, attempts a solution to the unsolved problem of credit availability to <b>micro</b> <b>enterprises</b> in an Indian context, having no past performance track record.
