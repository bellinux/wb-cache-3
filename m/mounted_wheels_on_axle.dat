50|$|The C.37 had a fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage. There were {{pairs of}} main <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> single <b>axles</b> attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine {{at each end}} on short, forward raked V-struts.

50|$|Wooden toy {{trains are}} toy trains {{that run on}} a wooden track system with grooves to guide {{the wheels of the}} rolling stock. While the trains, tracks and scenery {{accessories}} are made mainly of wood, the engines and cars connect to each other using metal hooks or small magnets, and some use plastic <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> metal <b>axles.</b> Some trains are made to resemble anthropomorphical, fictional, and prototypical railroad equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the wings}} the {{fuselage}} tapered gently to a broad, triangular fin which carried a vertical edged balanced rudder that {{reached down to}} the keel. The tailplane [...] was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage so its elevators had a notch for rudder movement. The C.37 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were pairs of main <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> single <b>axles</b> attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine at each end on short, forward raked V-struts.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} is flat sided. The pilot's windscreen is {{just ahead of}} the wing leading edge but the side glazing of the single-seat cabin extends back to about two-thirds chord. The cabin roof extends into raised rear fuselage decking, which drops away slowly to the tail. The Donald has a tailskid undercarriage with main <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> split <b>axles,</b> hinged <b>on</b> a shallow V-strut attached to the fuselage underside. Faired, tapered legs are mounted on the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was an equal span pusher biplane with a monoplane tailplane and an elevator mounted on booms {{forward of the}} wings, the elevator being extended outboard of the supporting booms. Single-acting ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Green engined aircraft had a single rudder mounted underneath the tailplane, while Grace's E.N.V. engined example had an additional rudder mounted above it. The undercarriage was simpler than Farman's design, and consisted {{of a pair of}} <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> an <b>axle</b> attached to the skids: supplementary tailskids were attached {{to the ends of the}} tail booms.|$|R
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> stub <b>axles,</b> and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|R
50|$|In landplane {{configuration}} the C.39 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were {{pairs of}} main <b>wheels</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> single <b>axles</b> attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine {{at each end}} on short, forward raked V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>mounted</b> under the nose. The wheels could be replaced by flat bottomed floats, each fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of inverted W-struts, one to {{each side of the}} float, assisted by an inverted V-strut from the inside edge to the wing root. Though in floatplane configuration the C.43 sat level over the water, the tailskid was joined by a small, cylindrical float to protect the tail at take-off. In either configuration the undercarriage track was 5.0 m.|$|R

The wheel arrangement of two leading <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> one <b>axle,</b> two powered driving <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> one <b>axle,</b> and two trailing <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> one <b>axle</b> provided more stability and enabled a larger firebox than the earlier 0-2-2 and 2-2-0 types.|$|R

30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, braking <b>on</b> outside <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> <b>axles</b> {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than <b>on</b> rear <b>axles.</b> (2) To prevent understeering, braking <b>on</b> the inside <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> <b>axles</b> after the CG point can generate better effects than braking <b>on</b> the front <b>axles.</b> (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by braking <b>on</b> each <b>wheel</b> are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by distances between the axles and CG position. (4) In terms of braking wheel, when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kamm’s Circle, braking <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> the rear <b>axle</b> need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, braking <b>on</b> front <b>axles</b> is a better choice.|$|R
