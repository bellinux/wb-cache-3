5|$|Although {{increasing}} {{echelons of}} the scale correspond to stronger winds, the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects. Lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms, depending on factors such as local terrain, population density and total rainfall. For instance, a Category2 hurricane that strikes a <b>major</b> <b>urban</b> area will likely do more damage than a large Category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E

The open and maritime aspects and lack of <b>major</b> <b>urban</b> developments have also led to the county being allocated relatively high targets for the generation of energy from renewable sources.|$|E

Over the three decades between 1971 and 2001, Christchurch's population increased by 32% from 33,768 to 44,865; and between 1991 and 2001 by 8.5%.

5|$|It is {{not easy}} to assess the {{importance}} of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little hinterland. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's <b>major</b> <b>urban</b> and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were {{an essential part of the}} Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.|$|E
