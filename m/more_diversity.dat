5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|FutureSex/LoveSounds is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Justin Timberlake. It was released on September 8, 2006 by Jive Records and its affiliated label of the Zomba Group of Companies. During a two-year hiatus, Timberlake resolved his feelings on being unable to record any new material, and as he returned to record some new music, he began collaborating with his longtime record producer Timbaland, alongside the latter's colleague Danja. The album's contents were produced at Timbaland's Thomas Crown Studios. The album shares some lyrical themes with Timberlake's debut album Justified (2002), although FutureSex/LoveSounds has <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> in music genres. It infuses R and pop with techno, funk, and elements of rock. The reprises and interludes interspersed on the album's tracks were created by the production team {{with the goal of}} channeling Timberlake's influences; including David Bowie and Prince.|$|E

The calculation is based on land-cover database derived from remotely sensed data in the late of 1980 s, the middle of 1990 s and the late of 1990 s. The calculation result shows that on national scale, ecotope diversity has a decrease trend during the period from the late of 1980 s to the middle of 1990 s and has an increase trend from the middle of 1990 s to the late of 1990 s; on economic-region scale, the central region and eastern region have <b>more</b> ecotope <b>diversity</b> than the western region; on provincial scale, for any one of the three economic regions, if a province, termed A, has <b>more</b> ecotope <b>diversity</b> than a compared province, termed 13, in one period, A must have <b>more</b> ecotope <b>diversity</b> than B in other two periods generally; on county scale, 14 hot-spots of ecological <b>diversity</b> conservation have <b>more</b> ecotope <b>diversity</b> in the three periods.

25|$|The mtDNA {{from the}} finger bone {{differs from that}} of modern humans by 385 bases (nucleotides) in the mtDNA strand out of {{approximately}} 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between chimpanzees and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs. This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago. The mtDNA from a tooth bore a high similarity to that of the finger bone, indicating that they belonged to the same population. From a second tooth, an mtDNA sequence was recovered that showed an unexpectedly large number of genetic differences compared to that found in the other tooth and the finger, suggesting a high degree of mtDNA diversity. These two individuals from the same cave showed <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were as different as modern-day humans from different continents.|$|E

500|$|The senior art {{director}} for Halo 4 is Kenneth Scott; {{he described the}} visual style of Halo 4 as being more ingrained in the expanded universe fiction, and more [...] "mature" [...] than before.

[...] The game also features <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> in Forerunner structures, including fully active Forerunner technology as opposed to the mostly inert and abandoned structures seen in the earlier games. The majority of the game is lit statically using lightmaps; this allowed the art team to achieve realistic lighting effects with full global illumination and ambient occlusion.

500|$|The Gothic {{soap opera}} Dark Shadows, on American {{television}} from 1966 to 1971 and produced by Dan Curtis, featured the vampire character Barnabas Collins, portrayed by Canadian actor Jonathan Frid, which proved {{partly responsible for}} making the series {{one of the most}} popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later Dan Curtis 1972 television series [...] revolved around reporter Carl Kolchak hunting a vampire on the Las Vegas Strip. Later films showed <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as Blade in the Marvel Comics' Blade films and the film Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy, released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with adaptation to a long-running hit series of the same name and its spin-off Angel. Still others showed the vampire as protagonist, such as 1983's The Hunger, 1994's Interview with the Vampire and its indirect sequel of sorts Queen of the Damned, and the 2007 series Moonlight. The 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, it was {{announced}} that actress and singer Queen Latifah would guest star on the show as a Congresswoman named Regina Bookman who demands from Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy, <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> in its NBC programming lineup. Latifah is a fan of the show and big fan of Baldwin and series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. She said in an interview she was [...] "out of my mind" [...] excited to guest-star. Latifah is due to appear in a future episode of 30 Rock. It was also confirmed that actor-director Rob Reiner would appear as himself, and in [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] he played a Congressman. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported in August 2010 that the show set a casting call [...] "for an African-American male in the 30s-60s age range" [...] to play a fictitious host named Rutherford Rice, a well-spoken host of Right On, a fictitious talk show focusing on African American issues. In this episode, Rutherford Rice was played by actor Reg E. Cathey, best known for his role on the HBO drama The Wire as Norman Wilson. Actor John Amos made a brief appearance in the episode in which he stars in one scene from the Let's Stay Together show alongside a talking dog named Stanley the Dog. This was actor Todd Buonopane's fourth appearance as the character Jeffrey Weinerslav, an NBC Human resource mediator.

500|$|In Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History, Robert Harvey wrote that, with Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons [...] "had {{demonstrated}} {{as never}} before {{the capacity of the}} [...] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics". In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection, Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times wrote that the dark legacy of Watchmen, [...] "one that Moore almost certainly never intended, whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book," [...] is [...] "a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences, his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones." [...] Alan Moore himself said his intentions with works like Marvelman and Watchmen were to liberate comics and open them up to new and fresh ideas, thus creating <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> in the comics world by showing the industry what could be done with already existing concepts. Instead it had the opposite effect, causing the superhero comic to end up stuck in a [...] "depressive ghetto of grimness and psychosis". In 2009, Lydia Millet of The Wall Street Journal contested that Watchmen was worthy of such acclaim, and wrote that while the series' [...] "vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate", that [...] "it's simply bizarre to assert that, as an illustrated literary narrative, it rivals in artistic merit, say, masterpieces like Chris Ware's 'Acme Novelty Library' or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of Edward Gorey".|$|E

Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into <b>more</b> <b>diversity</b> and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors".
