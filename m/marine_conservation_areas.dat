5|$|National <b>Marine</b> <b>Conservation</b> <b>Areas</b> (NMCAs) are a {{relatively}} new invention in the park system. Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, created in 2015, is the only unit that uses this designation in its name. Fathom Five National Marine Park was created in 1987, prior to the NMCA concept, and subsequently classified as an NMCA without changing its legal name. The case of Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park is similar, while Gwaii Haanas is an NMCA Reserve, {{with the intention of}} becoming an NMCA.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 39 National Parks and eight National Park Reserves (Kluane {{is the name}} for two areas–a {{national}} park and an adjacent proposed national park (a National Park Reserve)). National Park Reserves are areas intended to become national parks pending settlement of native land claims. Until then, they are managed under the National Parks Act as quasi-parks, but are included here in the main list. This page also includes the country's three National <b>Marine</b> <b>Conservation</b> <b>Areas</b> (NMCAs), a single NMCA Reserve, the lone National Landmark, and proposed parks. National parks currently cover an area of 303,571km², or about 3.0% of the total land area of Canada. Rounding out the national park system {{is a collection of}} National Historic Sites, listed separately.|$|E
5|$|These {{areas have}} or {{will have a}} {{different}} mandate than their terrestrial counterparts. They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect ecological integrity. The government {{has announced plans to}} add five marine parks to the system as part of the <b>Marine</b> <b>Conservation</b> <b>Areas</b> Act. The first to be announced was Lake Superior in 2007; it was officially established in 2015. Other areas under negotiation are the southern Strait of Georgia and Gwaii Haanas in British Columbia, and there are discussions to study the feasibility of an area on the southern coast of Newfoundland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact on}} bird and marine {{life in the}} Baltic Sea is also a concern, as the Baltic sea is {{recognized}} by the International Maritime Organization as a particularly sensitive sea area. [...] The World Wide Fund for Nature requested that countries party to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) safeguard the Baltic marine habitats, which could be altered by {{the implementation of the}} Nord Stream project. [...] Its Finnish branch said it might file a court case against Nord Stream AG if the company did not properly assess a potential alternative route on the southern side of Hogland. [...] According to Nord Stream AG, this was not a suitable route for the pipeline because of the planned conservation area near Hogland, subsea cables, and a main shipping route. [...] Russian environmental organizations warned that the ecosystem in the Eastern part of the Gulf of Finland is the most vulnerable part of the Baltic Sea and assumed damage to the island territory of the planned Ingermanland nature preserve as a result of laying the pipeline. Swedish environmental groups are concerned that the pipeline is planned to pass too closely to the border of the marine reserve near Gotland. [...] Also Greenpeace is concerned that the pipeline would pass through several sites designated <b>marine</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 2008, South Coast Regional Stakeholders began {{a public}} {{planning}} process {{to design the}} part of the statewide MPA network that spans from Pt. Conception in Santa Barbara county to the U.S. border with Mexico. On Dec. 15, 2010, the CA Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations to create 36 new MPAs encompassing approximately 187 square miles (8 percent) of state waters in the study region. Approximately 116 square miles (4.9 percent) have been designated as no-take state marine reserves (82.5 square miles/3.5 percent) and no-take state <b>marine</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>areas</b> (33.5 square miles/1.4 percent), with the remainder designated as state <b>marine</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>areas</b> with different take allowances and varying levels of protection.
