The analytical method used was gas chromatography combined with the technique of solid phase microextraction. The product under development consists in a bar of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> texturized using the hydrocolloid gellan gum, matching 1 % of the weight of the <b>mango</b> <b>puree.</b> This percentage is composed by gellan low and high acyl, with the ratio 25 / 75, respectively. The product also has an edible coating, comprised by 1 % of gellan gum which is formed with a 90 / 10 low acyl/high acyl ratio. The thermal treatment to inactivate enzymes of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> caused a decrease of most volatile compounds. The texturized <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> has exhibited an ability to release the volatiles, similar to <b>mango</b> <b>puree.</b> The edible coating applied {{to the surface of the}} texturized product showed retention capacity for a small number of volatiles. The applied conservation processes, high hydrostatic pressures and thermal treatments, showed similar effects and didn’t change the volatile profile of the bar significantly.

The sensory properties of foods may be affected by adding this medium. Purpose: To evaluate if {{and to what extent}} sensory and rheological characteristics of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> were altered by adding barium sulfate to the food. Material and Methods: This study evaluated four food samples based on <b>mango</b> <b>puree,</b> with no or added barium sulfate contrast medium (0 %, 12. 5 %, 25. 0 %, and 37. 5 %), by a radiographic method, and measured sensory texture properties and rheological characteristics. The sensory evaluation was performed by an external trained panel using quantitative descriptive analysis. The ease of swallowing the foods was also evaluated. Results: The sensory texture properties of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> were significantly affected by the added barium in all evaluated attributes, as was the perception of particles. Moreover, ease of swallowing was significantly higher in the sample without added contrast medium. All samples decreased in extensional viscosity with increasing extension rate, i. e., all samples were tension thinning. Shear viscosity was not as dependent on the concentration of BaSO(4) as extensional viscosity. Conclusion: Addition of barium sulfate to a model food of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> has a major impact on perceived sensory texture attributes as well as on rheological parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} mango endogenous pectinases to change the viscosity of <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> Hereto, the structure of pectic polysaccharide and the presence of sufficiently active endogenous enzymes of ripe mango were determined. Pectin of mango flesh had a high molecular weight and was highly methoxylated. Pectin methylesterase showed a negligible activity which is related to the confirmed presence of a pectin methylesterase inhibitor. Pectin contained relatively high amounts of galactose and considerable β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity was observed. The possibility of stimulating β-Gal activity during processing (temperature/pressure, time) was investigated. β-Gal of mango was rather temperature labile but pressure stable relatively to the temperature and pressure levels used to inactivate destructive enzymes in industry.

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are acknowledged for their wide range of health benefits such as prevention of chronic disease, and reduction of food intake by increasing the satiety. However they are perishable, often season dependent and for many, cultivation is limited to specific climate and regions. Therefore processing to produce intermediate ingredients such as purée is a common solution to facilitate their consumption, increase their shelf-life and year-round availability. Owing to their convenience next to their perception of year-round available natural products, fruit purées {{are becoming more and}} more popular. In fruit and vegetable based products, the cell wall polysaccharide pectin is an important polymeric component partially defining the functional and flow properties of such systems. Mango, accounting for almost 39 % of the world’s tropical fruit production (82. 2 million tons in 2009), is one of the most popular fruits in western countries (FAO, 2011). <b>Mango</b> <b>purée</b> obtained from fruit disintegration has an extremely high consistency leading to many limitations for further purée processing and manipulation. A common practice in industry to handle this problem is by diluting purée with water for which flavor reconstitution and sugar addition are required. However such process is not preferred due to the addition of sugar and sensorial drawbacks. The present drawbacks for the current solution incited us to formulate one of the aims of this work which was based on the intimate relation between pectin nanostructure and function. The aim was to utilize different naturally-present pectin modifying enzymes (i. e. pectinases) to tailor the flow properties of <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> by alteration of pectin nanostructure. To reach the aim, in the first approach, the possibility of using endogenous pectin-degrading enzymes to influence the high consistency of <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> was investigated. In the second approach, exogenous enzymes (single enzyme and mixtures) with and without an additional application of intensive mechanical disintegration were used. It was shown that the most active endogenous pectin-degrading enzyme, β-galactosidase, being temperature labile but pressure stable, was not able to significantly decrease <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> consistency. It was observed that the high consistency of <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> can not be solely related to pectin polymers and their modification. Other polymers such as starch and cellulose also contribute to the high consistency observed whether directly (starch) or indirectly (cellulose). We also observed that the enzymatic treatment significantly changed particle morphology. Our results suggest that particle morphology is an important factor in consistency changes in <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> The sequence of the enzymatic and mechanical treatments was found to be crucial to the final consistency observed. In general, the amount of serum is the main parameter having a strong and positive correlation with Bostwick consistency index, meaning that release of water and most likely with some degraded polymers into the serum by the enzymatic treatments decreased the consistency. Although mango processing increases the ease of consumption and mango year round availability, large amounts of mango peel is produced as one of the waste streams of mango processing. It should come as no surprise that currently wasted mango peel has to receive proper attention to sustain mango processing by decreasing downstream concerns. Escaping from the existing environmental limitations imposed by classical pectin extraction using mineral acids, the second aim of this work was to obtain a high quality pectin with a commercial valuable functionality from mango peel. A method of acidic-chelator-assisted pectin extraction isolated, with a higher yield compared to the common extraction technique, a pectin with unique chemical characteristics. The citric acid extracted mango peel pectin was compared with apple pectin in terms of chemical structure and some valuable industrial functional properties to evaluate the functionality as related to pre-determined pectin nanostructure. Despite the high molecular weight of the extracted pectin, a high ratio of neutral sugar branches limited the pectin gelation capacity but contributed to noticeable emulsification properties. The present work showed the potential of a well-known cocktail of exogenous enzymes to tailor <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> consistency especially when such treatment was combined in a specific sequence with high pressure homogenization. Additionally, a sustainable way of pectin extraction was introduced, by which pectin with valuable functionality was obtained from currently wasted low cost mango peel. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: During the {{therapeutic}} videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing, gradation of bolus volume, texture, and viscosity {{can be implemented}} to determine the optimal bolus characteristics in that particular patient. When a thickened liquid is given to a dysphagic patient it is served at room temperature. However, in these patients with a delayed oral and/or pharyngeal stage of swallow, the bolus is held {{for a long time}} in the oral cavity. The temperature of the thickened liquid thereby increases. PURPOSE: To study the rheological exploration (variation of viscosity with temperature) of thickened food used for radiologic swallowing examinations in patients with oral and pharyngeal dysfunction, in particular in mixtures of barium sulfate suspensions and in iodine solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Deep-frozen <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> was thawed at room temperature. It was then mixed with barium sulfate contrast medium to a density of 25 % w/w. Resorce Thicken Up was mixed at room temperature at two concentrations: 4. 3 % w/w (4. 5 g thickener + 100 g distilled water) and 6. 0 % w/w (4. 5 g thickener + 70 g distilled water). The thickener consisted of modified corn starch. Resorce Thicken Up was also mixed at room temperature with two concentrations of an iodine contrast material, iohexol (Omnipaque, 350 mg I/ml). The two concentrations were: 4. 3 % w/w (4. 5 g thickener + 100 g iohexol) and 6 % w/w (6 g thickener + 100 g iohexol). Measurements were carried out from 20 degrees C to 37 degrees C using a Stresstech HR rheometer. The rheometer was equipped with a concentric cylinder measuring system (inner cylinder 15 mm). RESULTS: The samples containing thickener in water as well as in iohexol showed a dependence on thickener concentration and temperature. The <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> with barium sulfate displayed very small temperature dependence. The thickener solutions in iohexol had significantly higher viscosity compared with the other thickener solutions and the <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> The relative decrease shows that <b>mango</b> <b>purée,</b> the 6 % thickener solution in water, and solutions with iohexol exhibited similar relative viscosity change at different temperatures. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is therefore that it is important always to make the solution with high precision. It is also of importance to observe how long the patient keeps the bolus in the mouth. This might vary and actually it may not be possible to influence this factor. When different types of thickeners are compared, it is important to take into account the temperature at which the thickener is observed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{parameters}} {{are important in}} product quality control and process design: thermo-physical and rheological properties. Reliable estimates of thermal properties (thermal conductivity, diffusivity, density, specific heat, and glass transition temperature) are needed to model {{the rate of heat}} transfer during food processing. Measurements of rheological parameters like viscosity and elasticity have been recognized as important tools to provide fundamental insights on structural organization of the food. Small amplitude oscillatory testing is useful in evaluation of gel characteristics and texture development in different food products. Proper design of industrial plants, modeling and automation in food process industry require data on these properties for better quality control and improve the shelf life. Thermal processing has been a traditionally accepted method for developing safe and shelf-stable products. However, a disadvantage of thermal treatment is the reduced sensory and nutritional qualities. High pressure (HP) treatment, a novel non-thermal preservation technique, is used for producing high quality products. HP processing {{can also be used to}} achieve products with better textural properties and improved nutrition when supplemented with proteins. This research was carried out in two parts. In first part, experiments with mango pulp were carried out at four temperatures (20, 40, 60 and 80 °C) and total soluble solids concentrations (15, 20, 30 and 40 °Brix) and their rheological and thermo-physical properties were evaluated and modeled. Thermal properties of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> were primarily dependent on the moisture content of the sample, and increased with temperature and decreased with concentration. Density showed a reverse trend. Glass transition temperatures increased with an increase in concentration indicating better stability. Separate models were developed for each thermal property as a function of temperature and concentration (R 2 > 0. 90). <b>Mango</b> <b>puree</b> exhibited pseudoplaticity during steady shear measurements, and the power law model well described their flow behavior. Consistency coefficient increased with concentration and decreased with temperature. The flow behavior index decreased with concentration and generally increased with temperature beyond 40 °C. Dynamic oscillation shear measurements revealed that <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> behaved like a weak gel and demonstrated visco-elastic properties. In the second part, experiments were divided in to two parts. In first part, the original soluble solids in <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> (28 °Brix) was lowered to 20, 23 and 26 °Brix and each was supplemented with 2, 5 and 8 % of whey protein. Effect of HP treatment at 425, 500, and 575 MPa with 0, 3 and 6 min holding times on rheological properties were evaluated. Pressure treatment resulted in a positive effect on elastic (G') and viscous modulii (G") as well as complex viscosity (eta*). Values of G' were higher than G" demonstrating the product to behave more and more like a gel. The changes in rheological parameters at 500 MPa were modeled based on soluble solids and protein content. In the second part of the experiments, the protein (P) and soluble solids concentrations (S) were simultaneously varied maintaining a total solids content at 28 % (same as in the original <b>mango</b> <b>puree)</b> and their combined influence (P/S: 2 / 26, 3 / 25, 5 / 23, 7 / 21 and 8 / 20) on the rheology of the product after selected HP treatments (425 - 575 MPa, 0 - 6 min) were evaluated. The effects of holding time and pressure level were similar to those observed previously in first part of this study. However, the positive effect of added protein was over dominated by negative effect of the simultaneous decrease in the soluble solids concentration, resulting in an overall decreasing effect as protein content increased (with a same magnitude decrease in soluble solids content). Developed models well predicted the combined influence of protein and soluble solids concentration on rheological parameters (R 2 > 0. 85). Sensory evaluation of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> supplemented with protein (2, 5 and 8 %) was performed before and after high pressure treatment (500 MPa/ 3 min) using a nine point hedonic scale.

Cell-wall polysaccharides from mesocarp and pericarp of fully ripe table mangoes were characterized analyzing the alcohol-insoluble residues (AIR). Content of celluloses, hemicelluloses, lignin and soluble and insoluble pectin were assessed after selective extraction. After hydrolysis of main fractions, neutral sugars were determined by gas chromatography showing that xylose prevails (12 - 14 %) in the non-cellulosic fraction of insoluble cell walls from mesocarp, indicating predominance with cellulose, of xilan-type polysaccharides in mango flesh. Water insoluble AIR (WAIR) was incubated with commercial preparations, characterized for their main enzymatic activities and comprising balanced proportion of pectinases and cellulases with other different secondary activities. At equivalent 500 ?l per kilogram of purée and at 45 °C, solubilisation rates of uronids and neutral sugars reach respectively 100 and 90 % only when xylanase activities were present.

The NIRSystem 6500 was used to scan the spectra in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 1100 nm. The partial least square regression (PLSR) was used to develop a model for each component. The result was a wavelength that corresponds to each component. It was found that the second derivative spectra of glucose, sucrose, citric acid, malic acid, starch and cellulose mixtures showed the best PLSR result.

ChambersFresh mangoes {{are highly}} perishable, and therefore, {{they are often}} {{processed}} to extend shelf-life and facilitate exportation. Studying the transformation that mango cultivars undergo throughout processing can aid in selecting appropriate varieties for products. In the 1 st part of this study, the flavor and texture properties of 4 mango cultivars available in the United States (U. S.) were analyzed. Highly trained descriptive panelists in the U. S. evaluated fresh, purée, and sorbet samples prepared from each cultivar. Purées were made by pulverizing mango flesh, passing it through a china cap, and heating it to 85 °C for 15 s. For the sorbets, purées were diluted with water (1 : 1), sucrose was added, and the bases were frozen in a batch ice cream freezer. Much of the texture variation among cultivars was lost after fresh samples were transformed into purées, whereas much of the flavor and texture variation among cultivars was lost once fresh <b>mangoes</b> and <b>mango</b> <b>purées</b> were transformed into sorbets. Compared to the other cultivars, Haden and Tommy Atkins underwent greater transformations in flavor throughout sorbet preparation, and processing reduced the intensities of some unpleasant flavors in these cultivars. Tommy Atkins was the only cultivar that had flavor differences from other cultivars when it was in sorbet. Results suggest that cultivar variation is generally not detectable in mango sorbet unless the cultivar has a distinct initial flavor. In the 2 nd part of this study, descriptive panelists in Thailand evaluated the flavor and texture properties of fresh samples and purées prepared from 6 cultivars grown in Thailand. Thermal processing had unique effects on the flavor of each cultivar, especially Nam Dok Mai and Chok Anun; Nam Dok Mai significantly decreased in mango identity and peach flavors after processing, whereas Chok Anun significantly increased in sweet, mango identity, and pineapple flavors.

The walnut is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) -rich whole food that is readily available in the U. S and has been shown to potentially reduce risk of Metabolic Syndrome. Furthermore, consumption of polyphenol rich plant-based foods have also been shown to be negatively correlated with the risk of the development of chronic diseases. In Study 1 we tested the hypothesis that addition of walnut and polyphenol-rich foods to a high-fat obesogenic diet (HF) would improve metabolism in male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Mice were provided HF supplemented with walnut (W), or W diet supplemented with blueberry (W+BB), raspberry (W+RB), apple (W+AP), cranberry (W+CB), cherry (W+CH), broccoli (W+BR) and green tea (GT) for 9 weeks. Animals were fed experimental diets ad libitum; body weight, glucose tolerance, liver lipid accumulation, and expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and inflammation were measured. Glucose tolerance was significantly lower in W+RB when compared to HF, meanwhile W+AP showed an intermediate value between W+RB and HF. A custom-designed focused gene array was used to evaluate expression of 87 different mRNAs. A subset of six groups were evaluated: LF, HF, W, W+RB, W+CH, and W+GT. Finally, a biochemical evaluation of 594 different metabolites was conducted and examined by principle component analysis (PCA). In Study 2 mice were fed experimental diets for ten weeks. Diets were formulated to include a typical dietary level of whole raspberry food products: HF+ raspberry juice concentrate (RJC), HF+ raspberry <b>puree</b> <b>concentrate</b> (RPC), HF+ raspberry fruit powder (RFP), and HF+ raspberry seed extract (RSE). Body weight, glucose tolerance, liver lipid accumulation, and expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and inflammation were observed. Addition of raspberry food products to high-fat diet reduced body weight gain significantly, particularly for raspberry juice and <b>puree</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Serum insulin and resistin levels were measured and suggest intake of raspberry products and phytochemicals improve glucose control.

A custom-designed focused gene array was used to evaluate expression of 87 different mRNAs related to hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, inflammation, nuclear hormone reception action, and other cell signaling pathways We demonstrated that intake of walnut, alone, or in combination with a polyphenol-rich food, and consumption of raspberry and raspberry products, may have significant effects on physiological parameters related to metabolic syndrome and changes in hepatic gene expression levels consistent with an improved metabolic state...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a multivariate {{approach}} combining targeted and untargeted data {{was used to}} obtain insight into quality changes in pasteurised mango juice (cv. ‘Totapuri’) {{as a function of}} storage (42 °C for 8 weeks). Mango juice samples were formulated with addition of different potential precursors for different quality-related chemical reactions: ascorbic acid, citric acid and sugars. Control (diluted <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> with water), ascorbic acid-enriched (AA 250 and AA 500), citric acid-enriched (CA, CA + AA 250 and CA + AA 500) and sugar-enriched (S) samples were characterised for a range of targeted quality parameters as well as for a volatile fingerprint (untargeted). Selection of shelf-life markers or quality parameters significantly changing during shelf-life was performed over all formulations as well as per mango juice formulation. Our study showed that a common trend over all formulations was observed for colour values (VID > │ 0. 90 │), while specific shelf-life markers were selected for each formulation. In acidified mango juice samples (CA, CA + AA 250, CA + AA 500), more terpene oxides were selected compared to other formulations. In ascorbic acid-enriched samples (AA 250, AA 500, CA + AA 250, CA + AA 500), furfural and ascorbic acid were significantly changing during shelf-life. It seems that the reaction pathways for compounds being formed or degraded upon shelf-life are clearly affected by the acidity level. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{shows the}} {{potential}} of the integrated fingerprinting-kinetics approach in evaluating shelf-life changes of pasteurised mango juice (cv. ‘Totapuri’). Seven mango juice formulations (i. e. control (<b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> and water), ascorbic acid-enriched (AA 250 and AA 500), citric acid-enriched (CA, CA + AA 250 and CA + AA 500) and sugar-enriched (S) samples) were pasteurised and stored at 42 °C for 8 weeks. In this part, the kinetics of the shelf-life markers selected from the multivariate fingerprinting approach were modelled. Changes in selected targeted parameters could be best described by a zero-order (colour values, °Brix, furfural, HMF), a first-order (ascorbic acid), a fractional conversion (fructose, glucose, oxygen) and a second-order model (sucrose). Differences in the rate constant were observed, with faster ascorbic acid degradation and furfural formation in AA-enriched samples and faster hydrolysis of sugars and HMF formation in CA-enriched samples compared to control samples. To describe changes in selected volatiles (terpenes, sulphur compounds, acids, ketones and esters), different kinetic models were selected. Two trends were observed: changes as affected by different mango juice formulations (e. g., faster reaction in CA-enriched samples or in a lower pH condition) and changes irrespective of the formulations. Referring to the literature, in general, acid-catalysed reactions, ascorbic acid degradation and oxidation reactions are the main reactions responsible for the observed quality changes in stored mango juice. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Studies for the {{development}} of a novel convenient fruit product based on <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> and gellan gum were carried out. Two gellan types (low acyl-L and high acyl-H) used in specific L/H ratios (75 / 25, 50 / 50, 25 / 75) for an overall concentration of 1 g of gellan/ 100 g of puree were tested, in order to design different mango bars. The influence of the L/H gellan ratio on their texture properties (TPA and SR tests), microstructure (Cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy) and texture sensory acceptance (Preference- Ranking test) was studied. The results obtained enabled to separate the bars in two groups: the ones showing greater hardness and brittleness (only L gellan, and L/H at the ratios of 75 / 25 and 50 / 50); and those presenting a softer structure with higher cohesiveness and springiness values (L/H of 25 / 75 and only H gellan). The microstructure of mango bars was consistent with the texture results. Those presenting higher hardness have shown a microstructure composed of a denser biopolymer network with lower pore size; while for softer bars with higher springiness, larger pores and thin strings were observed. From the Preference-Ranking test, the most appreciated mango bar in terms of texture was the one prepared with a L/H ratio of 25 / 75. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Four {{formulations}} of cranberry gels using raw materials manufactured {{by a variety}} of different processes were examined for their rheological and textural properties. Generally, with higher treatment temperature and holding times, the gels’ rheological and textural properties improved. Gels were examined 24 hours, 48 hours, and 4 days after being prepared. Gels generally showed some further improvement of gel strength during the storage, particularly for gels that were initially processed for the shortest time at the lowest temperature. The pectin molecular properties of five different types of raw cranberry purees were examined for the effect of processing conditions. Pectin was extracted from each type of puree, yield determined and FT-IR analysis was performed in order to determine degree of esterification of each type of extracted pectin. Degree of esterification ranged from ~ 60 - 90 %. Puree from fresh fruit and cranberry <b>puree</b> <b>concentrate</b> had the highest yield and degree of esterification, whereas purees from the byproducts of puree processing had lower yields and degree of esterification. Purees exposed to elevated temperatures and prolonged heating times showed signs of hydrolysis...|$|R
40|$|A double-blind, randomized, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trial was}} conducted from March 2001 to March 2002 involving 309 infants who received either a processed complementary food (CF) or an unprocessed placebo from 6 to 12 mo of age. The groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. The study {{took place in}} Kilosa district, Tanzania. The processed CF contained germinated, autoclaved, and dried finger millet (65. 2 %), kidney beans (19. 1 %), roasted-peanuts (8 %), and <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> (7. 7 %). The same blend, but not processed, served as the placebo. Processing increased iron solubility and energy density without affecting viscosity. Mean length for age, weight for age, hemoglobin, and zinc protoporphyrin at 6 and 12 mo did not differ between the 2 groups. The {{results show that the}} processed food did not differ from the unprocessed placebo in improving growth, hemoglobin, and iron status of infants when given under the study conditions. The control group consumed equal amounts of macronutrients, and the higher energy density in this study did not seem to have any benefits. In our study, there was a very intensive follow-up; at every encounter with mothers, giving the required amounts and adding extra lipids was strongly reinforced. Under those conditions, a well-balanced complementary food with additional lipids can meet the energy needs of young children. The reduction in phytates by 34 % and improvement in iron solubility to 19 % due to processing might not have been enough to compensate for the rather low iron content of the complementary food...|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{investigation}} were to enumerate coliforms in fresh <b>mangoes,</b> <b>puree,</b> cheeks, and cheeks-in-puree {{in order to determine}} the source of these organisms in the processed products, to determine methods for their control, and to identify coliforms isolated from cheeks-in-puree to determine whether they have any public health significance. Product from four processors was tested on two occasions. The retail packs of cheeks-in-puree having the highest coliform counts were those in which raw puree was added to the cheeks. Coliform counts in these samples ranged between 1. 4 × 103 and 5. 4 × 104 cfu/g. Pasteurisation reduced the coliform count of raw puree to < 5 cfu/g. Forty-seven percent of the 73 colonies, isolated as coliforms on the basis of their colony morphology on violet red bile agar, were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae using the ATB 32 E Identification System. Klebsiella strains were tested for growth at 10 °C, faecal coliform response, and fermentation of -melizitose, to differentiate the three phenotypically similar strains, K. pneumoniae, K. terrigena and K planticola. Results indicated that 41 % of K. pneumoniae isolates gave reactions typical of K. pneumoniae. A further 44 % of strains gave an atypical reaction pattern for these tests and were designated ‘psychrotrophic’ K. pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumoniae counts of between 2. 1 × 103 and 4. 9 × 104 cfu/g were predicted to occur in the retail packs of mango cheeks-in-puree produced by the processors who constituted this product with raw puree. In view of the opportunistic pathogenic nature of K. pneumoniae, its presence in these products is considered undesirable and steps, such as pasteurisation of puree, should be taken in order to inactivate i...|$|R

40|$|This model investigates {{particularly}} {{the impact of}} an integral and a non-integral number of waves on the swallowing of food stuff such as jelly, tomato <b>puree,</b> soup, <b>concentrated</b> fruits juices and honey transported peristaltically through the oesophagus. The fluid is considered as a Casson fluid. Emphasis is {{on the study of}} the dependence of local pressure distribution on space and time. Mechanical efficiency, reflux limit and trapping are also discussed. The effect of Casson fluid vis-à-vis Newtonian fluid is investigated analytically and numerically too. The result is physically interpreted as that the oesophagus makes more efforts to swallow fluids with higher concentration. It is observed that the pressure is uniformly distributed when an integral number of waves is there in the oesophagus; but it is non-uniform when a non-integral number of waves is present therein. It is further observed that as the plug flow region widens, the pressure difference increases, which indicates that the averaged flow rate will reduce for a Casson fluid. It is also concluded that Casson fluids are more prone to reflux...|$|R
