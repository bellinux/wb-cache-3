Only a very small amount of the total agricultural produced waste is utilized for useful applications while their large volumes are disposed causing environmental pollution. Substrates complemented with organic and/or inorganic substances often boost mushroom production (Renganathan et al. 2008). In this study, we estimated the mushroom production gap, fresh weight, <b>moisture,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and protein <b>content</b> of fruit body in P. eryngii mushroom on different substrate compositions. Unfortunately, the first run of experiment was totally associated with a massive bacterial contamination. We tried to reproduce the study with all combined factors.

In this study, leaf fuel moisture content such as Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC), Leaf Relative Water Content (RWC), Dead Fuel Moisture Content (DFMC), and Leaf <b>Dry</b> <b>Matter</b> <b>Content</b> (LDMC) (hereinafter known as moisture content indices (MCI)) were calculated {{in the field for}} different forest species at 32 sites in a temperate humid forest (Zaringol forest) located in northeastern Iran. These data and several relevant vegetation-biophysical indices and atmospheric variables calculated using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data with moderate spatial resolution (30 m) were used to estimate MCI of the Zaringol forest using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods. The prediction of MCI using ANN showed that ETM+ predicted MCI slightly better (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 6 %– 12 %)) than MLR (MAPE between 8 % and 17 %). Once satisfactory results in estimating MCI were obtained by using ANN from ETM+ data, these data were then upscaled to estimate MCI using MODIS data for daily monitoring of leaf water and leaf <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> at 500 m spatial resolution. For MODIS derived LFMC, LDMC, RWC, and DLMC, the ANN produced a MAPE between 11 % and 29 % for the indices compared to MLR which produced an MAPE of 14 %– 33 %. In conclusion, we suggest that upscaling is necessary for solving the scale discrepancy problems between the indicators and low spatial resolution MODIS data. The scaling up of MCI could be used for pre-fire alert system and thereby can detect fire prone areas in near real time for fire-fighting operations...|$|R

Managing waste ash generated from cashew nut processing is a major challenge, as land filling and open dumping of the waste ashes have been the main options in management of the ash in Nigeria. Economically viable ways of using waste ash rather than having to dispose of it have to be investigated. The CNS was air-dried for 4 weeks and combusted to ashes; the resulting ash was extracted with water for its potash content. Some parameters of the CNS, including <b>moisture,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> and ash <b>content,</b> were determined. Potash yield obtained was 33. 4 % of 150 g CNS ash used; analysis of the potash gave it a percentage purity of 78 %, while purity on recrystalization increased to 86 %.

40|$|Engineering {{feedstock}} {{supply systems}} that deliver affordable, high-quality biomass remains {{a challenge for}} the emerging bioenergy industry. Cellulosic biomass is geographically distributed and has diverse physical and chemical properties. Because of this feedstock supply systems that deliver cellulosic biomass resources to biorefineries require integration of a broad set of engineered unit operations. These unit operations include harvest and collection, storage, preprocessing, and transportation processes. Design decisions for each feedstock supply system unit operation impact the engineering design and performance of the other system elements. These interdependencies are further complicated by spatial and temporal variances such as climate conditions and biomass characteristics. This paper develops an integrated model that couples a SQL-based data management engine and systems dynamics models to design and evaluate biomass feedstock supply systems. The integrated model, called the Biomass Logistics Model (BLM), includes a suite of databases that provide 1) engineering performance data for hundreds of equipment systems, 2) spatially explicit labor cost datasets, and 3) local tax and regulation data. The BLM analytic engine is built in the systems dynamics software package PowersimTM. The BLM is designed to work with thermochemical and biochemical based biofuel conversion platforms and accommodates a range of cellulosic biomass types (i. e., herbaceous residues, short- rotation woody and herbaceous energy crops, woody residues, algae, etc.). The BLM simulates the flow of biomass through the entire supply chain, tracking changes in feedstock characteristics (i. e., <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> ash <b>content,</b> and <b>dry</b> bulk density) as influenced by the various operations in the supply chain. By accounting {{for all of the}} equipment that comes into contact with biomass from the point of harvest to the throat of the conversion facility and the change in characteristics, the BLM evaluates economic performance of the engineered system, as well as determining energy consumption and green house gas performance of the design. This paper presents a BLM case study delivering corn stover to produce cellulosic ethanol. The case study utilizes the BLM to model the performance of several feedstock supply system designs. The case study also explores the impact of temporal variations in climate conditions to test the sensitivity of the engineering designs. Results from the case study show that under certain conditions corn stover can be delivered to the cellulosic ethanol biorefinery for $ 35 /dry ton...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} meat yield, proximate and mineral composition in donkey carcasses, aged between 5 - 8 years. Proximate analysis of the minced carcass was done and reported as <b>moisture,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> crude protein, total ash and organic <b>matter.</b> Moisture <b>content</b> was 68. 35 - 74. 72 % and the <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> was 23. 68 - 30. 68 %. Total ash content was also higher in donkeys (5. 10 - 8. 19 %) as compared to 1. 5 - 1. 09 % in beef, however, the organic <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> was slightly lower in donkeys (91. 81 - 94. 90 %), compared to 98. 5 and 98. 91 % reported in beef.

40|$|In modern {{agricultural}} production, {{high quality}} seed which germinates quickly and evenly in different environments {{is the main}} requirement for high yields. The research {{was carried out in}} the Laboratory for Seed Testing in Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad. Two cytoplasmic male sterile lines L- 1 and L- 2 were used for the research. Seed treatments with fungicides (benomil, metalaxyl and fludioxonil) and insecticides (tiametoxam and imidacloprid) were applied to evaluate effects of chemical treatments and storage duration on seedlings <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content.</b> This treated seed was kept in a storage facility where all commercial seed is stored. The first assessment was done after the treatments and had been repeated every three months. Analysis of variance of the tested parameters showed statistically significant effects of chemical treatments and storage duration on seedling <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> in L- 1 line. In line L- 2, statistically significant effect of chemical treatment on seedling <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> was observed, whereas the effect of storage duration on seedlings <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> was highly significant.
