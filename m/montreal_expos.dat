5|$|Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the NHL all require venues {{to perform}} both the Canadian and American {{national}} anthems at games that involve teams from both countries, with the away team's anthem being performed first, {{followed by the}} host country. Major League Baseball teams have played the song at games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the former <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos,</b> and National Basketball Association teams do so for games involving the Toronto Raptors, and previously, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Major League Soccer has the anthem performed at matches involving Toronto FC, Montreal Impact, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> hired Virdon {{as their}} manager before the 1983 season, {{replacing}} Jim Fanning, {{and signed a}} two-year contract.

With a 64–67 record in August 1984, the Expos fired Virdon during the 1984 season, replacing him with Fanning. Gary Lucas, a pitcher for the Expos, felt that they had lost many one-run games because Virdon was too conservative in his managing, not employing the hit and run play and relying on the starting pitcher for long in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{have played}} in seven World Series championships in their history, winning in 1980 and 2008. Carlton won his Opening Day start against the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> in 1980, while Myers {{received}} a no-decision against the same franchise (now the Washington Nationals) in 2008, a game that the Phillies eventually lost, and lost the opening game against the Atlanta Braves in 2009.

Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California; the school was also the alma mater of baseball star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos,</b> noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins was , taller than a typical infielder. He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet.|$|E
5|$|After being demoted back to Buffalo, the Indians traded Robertson on August 3 to the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> for Pierre-Luc Marceau. He {{pitched in}} seven {{games for the}} Edmonton Trappers to end the season, {{finishing}} with a 1–3 record and a 5.73 ERA. He was on the Expos' 40-man roster for September, but did not play a game for them, and in October he {{was removed from the}} roster. In November, the Cincinnati Reds signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. During spring training in 2005, Robertson competed with Aaron Harang, Brandon Claussen, Luke Hudson, and Josh Hancock for two spots in the Reds' rotation. At the end of spring training, he was assigned to the Reds' minor league squad, the Louisville Bats. Robertson spent the season there, pitching in 28 games, 18 of them starts, and ended the year with a 5–11 record and a 5.46 ERA. After the season ended, Robertson was released, becoming a free agent.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} a July 4 {{game against the}} Braves (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add Tom Griffin into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> before making a start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 27. Four days later, Richard threw his first shutout against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits and struck out nine batters. Nineteen days later, Richard pitched another complete game, this time giving up two runs while striking out nine and walking three batters. He concluded the season with six wins and two losses in 16 total games, 10 of which he started. He finished with a 4.00ERA, and struck out 75batters in 72innings. He walked 38batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had in his two previous minor league seasons.|$|E
5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E
5|$|In June 2003, Young was {{promoted}} to the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League. He went 4–4 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 starts. In July, he went 3–0 and finished with an ERA of 3.03 over five starts. His season was highlighted by an eight-strikeout final outing on August 30 against the Norwich Navigators and a win on July 27 against the Reading Phillies in which he threw seven shutout innings. He was traded by the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> to the Texas Rangers organization on April 3, 2004 in a preseason deal along with Josh McKinley for Einar Díaz and Justin Echols. He started the 2004 season with the Frisco RoughRiders of the Texas League where he went 6–5 with a 4.48 ERA in 18 starts. The only two home runs he allowed in his final 12 starts and 61 innings with the RoughRiders occurred on July 3, against Round Rock. He struck out a season-high eight batters on May 9 against El Paso.|$|E
5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 hit club is {{the group}} of batters who have {{collected}} 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers. Cap Anson {{was the first to}} join the club on July 18, 1897, although his precise career hit total is unclear. Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927; he ultimately finished his career with more than 4,100. Pete Rose became the second member of the 4,000 hit club on April 13, 1984 while playing for the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos.</b> Cobb, also the major leagues' all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Rose collected his 4,192nd hit. Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 hits. Roberto Clemente's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits, reaching the mark in the last at bat of his career on September 30, 1972.|$|E
5|$|Mota was {{originally}} {{signed by the}} New York Mets in 1990 as an infielder. After several years in their organization, he was drafted by the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> in the Rule 5 draft in 1996 and converted into a pitcher in 1997. Mota had a 2.96 ERA in 1999, his rookie season, but he struggled in his next two seasons and {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers prior to 2002. His struggles continued in his first year with the Dodgers, but Mota had a career year in 2003, as he had a 6–3 record with a 1.97 ERA in 76 games. He became the setup man to closer Éric Gagné in 2004, but was traded to the Florida Marlins midseason. Mota started 2005 as their closer, but Todd Jones took over the role when Mota got hurt in April. Following the year, Mota was traded to the Boston Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|Selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in {{the third}} round of the June 2000 draft, he had brief {{professional}} experiences in the Pirates, <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos,</b> and Texas Rangers minor league systems before debuting with the Rangers in August 2004. Young's professional baseball career took off in the 2006 season, when he was the major league leader in opponent batting average, hits per nine innings and road earned run average (ERA) and was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for June. Additionally, he extended his streak of consecutive undefeated games started as a visiting pitcher to 24, and secured the only Padres win in the team's 3–1 series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Division Series. In 2007, he defended his opponent batting average and hits per nine innings titles, but instead of winning the road ERA title he won the home ERA title.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with a 76–54 record and a 6.5-game lead in the NL West over the Houston Astros, while the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> were 11 games back in third place in the NL East with a 66–64 record {{entering}} the game. With the August 30 win, the Dodgers retained their 6.5-game lead. The win marked the Dodgers' fifth consecutive win and twelfth out of 15. Hershiser contributed a two-run double in the second inning to help the Dodgers build a 3–0 lead. After Hershiser gave up two runs in the fifth, no baserunners reached second base against him in the final four innings, thus marking the first four scoreless innings of his streak. The game marked Hershiser's third consecutive and tenth complete game of the season. Following the game, his 2.84 ERA ranked third on the team behind Tim Leary (2.44) and John Tudor (2.37).|$|E
5|$|The Expos called Barrett to the Major Leagues on September 19, 1998, in a {{game against}} the Cincinnati Reds as a third baseman. He managed to hit a home run and a single in the game. After only playing eight games as an Expo, Barrett was sent to play for the Harrisburg Senators, a Class AA team from the Eastern League. He {{recorded}} 145 hits, and seventy-eight runs, nineteen home runs, and eighty-seven RBI en route to winning the Double-A All-Star Catcher and <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> Minor League Player of the Year awards. His performance allowed him to claim a spot on the Expos’ starting roster during the 1999 season. During his first full season, Barrett had fifty-nine starts as a catcher, sixty-two as a third-baseman, and six as shortstop. He also led all National League rookies with thirty-two doubles, while ranking as one of top statistical tiers in runs, hits, and run batted in among all other rookies.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Nationals are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Washington, D.C.. They {{play in the}} National League East division. The team {{was known as the}} <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos</b> from 1969 to 2004. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Nationals have used five different Opening Day starting pitchers in their nine seasons. The five starters have a combined Opening Day record of 1win, 6losses and 3no decisions. No decisions are awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game, or if the starting pitcher does not pitch at least five innings with the lead. The overall Opening Day record of the team is 46.|$|E
5|$|The Grizzlies {{were the}} first NBA {{relocation}} since the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California and became the Sacramento Kings in 1985. It was followed by two others in the same decade. The first was the relocation of the original Charlotte Hornets to New Orleans in 2002, with the team becoming the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans). (That relocation is no longer treated by the league as such; after the 2013–14 season, the franchise then known as the Charlotte Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name and also received sole rights {{to the history of}} the Hornets in Charlotte.) The second was in 2008, when the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the NHL, two teams were moved from Canada to the U.S. during the mid-1990s: the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, and the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and were rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014 (a new Winnipeg Jets team returned to the city by relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers in 2011). In 2005, one of Canada's two Major League Baseball teams (the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos)</b> relocated to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The failure of the Vancouver franchise was part of the reason the NBA changed the expansion drafting rules following the return of Charlotte to the league as the Bobcats in 2005. The Bobcats were allowed to pick fourth in their first draft, and were later not restricted from first picks.|$|E
5|$|Burrell hit a leadoff walk-off {{home run}} on April 7, 2002, in the 11th inning of a 3–2 {{victory over the}} Florida Marlins. Three days later, on April 10, Burrell hit a two-run walk-off {{home run in the}} 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7–5 victory over the Braves. He was the first player in the major leagues to hit two such home runs in a four-day period since Albert Belle did it in 1995, and he was the first Phillie to hit two such in a season since Von Hayes hit two in 1989. In May, he hit eight home runs, the most by a Phillie in May since {{teammate}} Mike Lieberthal hit eight in 1999. From June 2 through June 16, he had an 11-game hitting streak, his longest of the season. During the streak, on June 2, he tied a career-high with five RBI in an 18–3 victory over the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Expos.</b> Burrell had 22 home runs by the All-Star break, the most by a Phillie since Mike Schmidt had 31 by the 1979 All-Star break. On July 15, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Matt Herges in an 11–8 victory over Montreal. He had two home runs, five RBI, and a grand slam in a 7–6 loss to the Dodgers on August 9. On August 30, Burrell had three RBI (including the game-winner) in a 7–5 victory over the Mets. He had his one hundredth RBI that day, becoming the first Phillie with 100 RBI by August 31 since Greg Luzinski did it in 1977. Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), and games (157). He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI in a season. His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127). He was 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} month by taking {{two of a}} three-game series against the Giants, besting Jonathan Sánchez, who threw a no-hitter earlier in the 2009 season, and Tim Lincecum, who won the 2008 NL Cy Young Award. This was {{followed}} by a trip to Texas for a four-game series against the Houston Astros; the Phillies were unable to muster much offense during the series and were swept. On September 8, in {{the first game of the}} series against the Washington Nationals, Ibañez and Utley each hit their 30th home runs of the season, making them members of the 12th quartet of teammates in major league history to each reach 30 in a single season, joining Howard and Werth. The Phillies offense backed Lee to his sixth win the following night, with Madson earning his second consecutive save after assuming the de facto closer's role from Lidge. However, the Phillies could not overcome a pair of three-run home runs by Adam Dunn and Ian Desmond to secure the sweep in the last game of the series, despite Stairs' grand slam; it was their third loss of the season to Washington in fifteen games. The Mets came to Philadelphia for their last series of the season, which began on September 11. The Phillies won game one, 4–2, but the Mets came from behind in the second game of the series, scoring five runs in the final two innings to win 10–9. Making up a postponed game from earlier in the season, the Phillies won the first game of a day-night doubleheader behind Kyle Kendrick's first major league victory in 13 months. Eight shutout innings from Martínez in the nightcap gave the Phillies a 1–0 win, a 3–1 win in the 4-game set, and a 12–6 win in the season series. Martínez' eight innings also began a streak of 26 consecutive scoreless innings by Phillies pitchers: Madson followed with a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season; Cliff Lee pitched a complete game shutout against the Nationals the following night; and Blanton, Park, and Madson combined for eight scoreless innings against Washington on September 16 until Tyler Walker allowed a run in the top of the ninth inning, an RBI single by Willie Harris which scored Justin Maxwell. Hamels closed out the series with a strong performance, perfect through his first five innings and finishing with one run allowed in eight; with their 15th win over the Nationals, the Phillies matched their best season record against the franchise, set against the 1976 <b>Montréal</b> <b>Expos.</b>|$|E
