5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through {{the lines of the}} rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 <b>March,</b> <b>with</b> an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the HTC One {{was made}} {{available}} to mobile operators and major retailers in at least 181 countries. Manufacturing delays led to a staggered release beginning in late <b>March,</b> <b>with</b> its release date in certain markets (such as Asia and North America) pushed to late-April. Nevertheless, with around 5 million units being sold during its first two months of worldwide availability, HTC stated that the One was the most successful launch in the company’s history.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to <b>march</b> <b>with</b> {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|Damaged in an {{air raid}} in August 1944, U-255 was {{decommissioned}} for repairs.

5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in <b>March,</b> <b>with</b> the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E

The {{following}} week it made its debut on the DVD sales charts in third position. By the end of 2007 it had sold nearly 5.6 million units, for a total of $94.4 million in sales.|$|E
5|$|In March 1460 Warwick visited York in Ireland to {{plan the}} way ahead, and {{returned}} to Calais. Then, on 26June, he landed at Sandwich with Salisbury and March, and from here the three earls rode north to London.

At Northampton, on 10July, King Henry was taken captive, while the Duke of Buckingham and others were killed in battle.|$|E

5|$|On 14 <b>March,</b> <b>with</b> {{the ship}} at 84°4′N, the pair finally began their polar march. This was their third attempt {{to leave the}} ship; on 26 February and again on the 28th, damage to sledges had forced them to return after {{travelling}} short distances. After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled his equipment, minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three sledges, before giving the order to start again. A supporting party accompanied the pair and shared the first night's camp. The next day, Nansen and Johansen skied on alone.|$|E

5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a {{breeding}} season that extends from July to <b>March,</b> <b>with</b> migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics {{and other species}} including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within {{a breeding}} season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds {{have been identified in}} the same territory for periods of up to five years.|$|E
5|$|Unable to <b>march</b> <b>with</b> the able-bodied {{prisoners who}} were being {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him to}} the fort.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became {{redundant}} {{and were}} abandoned. Their maintenance became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. In March 1948 the question of public access to the War Rooms was raised in Parliament and the Minister responsible, Charles Key MP, considered that 'it would not be practicable to throw open for inspection by the general public accommodation which forms part of an office where confidential work is carried on'. Even so, a tour was organised for journalists on 17 <b>March,</b> <b>with</b> members of the press being welcomed by Lord Ismay and shown around the Rooms by their custodian, Mr. George Rance.|$|E
5|$|As the SS Panzer Corps {{began to}} emerge from the city, they engaged Soviet units {{positioned}} directly southwest of the city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 <b>March</b> <b>with</b> the Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein's forces to drive to Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. However, weather and exhaustion forced Manstein's counterstroke to end soon thereafter.|$|E
