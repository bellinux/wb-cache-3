Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.|$|E

25|$|Equal {{economic}} opportunity, a base {{social safety}} net provided by the welfare state, and strong labor unions have historically been {{at the heart of}} Democratic economic policy. The welfare state supports a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, social security, universal health care, public education, and public housing. They also support infrastructure development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation, while stimulating private sector job creation. Additionally however, since the 1990s the party has at times supported centrist economic reforms, which cut the size of government and reduced <b>market</b> <b>regulations.</b> The party has continuously rejected laissez-faire economics as well as market socialism, instead favoring Keynesian economics within a capitalist market-based system.|$|E
25|$|Wealth {{inequality}} in Latin America and the Caribbean remains {{a serious issue}} despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators observed over the past decade. A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation, observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share {{have been attributed to}} the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> and institutions. Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{two forms}} of colonial-era produce {{marketing}} boards had different aims. Some, as in the Rhodesias, supported white commercial farmers; others as in Nyasaland and Tanganyika controlled African smallholders and restricted competition {{between them and the}} settlers. The declared objectives of Nyasaland’s colonial legislation on the production, control and marketing of economic crops were to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the crops, and to stabilise the income of farmers through periods of price fluctuation. Restrictions were imposed on the number of growers and their output to improve produce quality and to match production to demand. This was done by registering growers, fixing producer prices, licensing buyers and exporters and establishing commodity boards, which often had exclusive responsibility for crop production and marketing. For most of the colonial period, statutory interference in the production and marketing of the crops grown on European-owned estate was kept to a minimum. Controls for their tea and tobacco were introduced at the request, or with the consent, of the settler associations responsible for these crops. The use of marketing controls allowed the Nyasaland government to increase its revenues. By offering smallholders prices that were lower than the world market prices, the colonial state indirectly taxed the smallholders, extracting a significant part of their profits. <b>Market</b> <b>regulations</b> were extended to food crops after the Second World War and, by the mid-1950s, marketing boards controlled the trade of most African smallholder produce.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the decline of the feudal social order and thanks to {{privileges}} and concessions granted by the bishop, the citizens of Sion had a limited independence in the Middle Ages. [...] A contract between Bishop Kuno and his maior William of Turn from 1179, is seen as {{the first step in the}} creation of an independent city government. [...] An agreement between the bishop, the collegiate church of St. Viztums and William of Turn in 1217 is the first written charter of freedom for the city. [...] It includes civil and criminal laws and punishments as well as trade and <b>market</b> <b>regulations.</b> [...] In 1269, the burghers of the town had their own council with its own statutes. [...] The council governed the use and management of the common lands through twelve councilors led by the Viztum. [...] These administrators later became syndics and were known by this title in 1323. [...] In 1338, the vicar general confirmed the existing rights and freedom of the citizens of Sion in a document. [...] The document was renewed by the bishop in 1339 and was presented to each successive bishop to re-confirm after his election. [...] In the same year, Emperor Louis the Bavarian raised Sion to a free imperial city and collected the surrounding lands into a barony. [...] In 1346, the episcopal Viztum and the citizenry collectively wrote the police regulations. [...] Sion was now a city with city walls, documented freedoms and the market right.|$|E

60|$|In {{regard to}} the proper {{circumscription}} of the constituencies which elect the local representative bodies, the principle which, when applied as an exclusive and unbending rule to Parliamentary representation, is inappropriate, namely community of local interests, is here the only just and applicable one. The very object of having a local representation is in order {{that those who have}} any interest in common which they do not share with the general body of their countrymen may manage that joint interest by themselves, and the purpose is contradicted if the distribution of the local representation follows any other rule than the grouping of those joint interests. There are local interests peculiar to every town, whether great or small, and common to all its inhabitants; every town, therefore, without distinction of size, ought to have its municipal council. It is equally obvious that every town ought to have but one. The different quarters of the same town have seldom or never any material diversities of local interest; they all require to have the same things done, the same expenses incurred; and, except as to their churches, which it is probably desirable to leave under simply parochial management, the same arrangements may be made to serve for all. Paving, lighting, water supply, drainage, port and <b>market</b> <b>regulations,</b> can not, without great waste and inconvenience, be different for different quarters of the same town. The subdivision of London into six or seven independent districts, each with its separate arrangements for local business (several of them without unity of administration even within themselves), prevents the possibility of consecutive or well-regulated co-operation for common objects, precludes any uniform principle for the discharge of local duties, compels the general government to take things upon itself which would be best left to local authorities if there were any whose authority extended to the entire metropolis, and answers no purpose but to keep up the fantastical trappings of that union of modern jobbing and antiquated foppery, the Corporation of the City of London.|$|E
