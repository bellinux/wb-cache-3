40|$|This thesis tackles {{problems}} concerning abstract data structures — expressibility and decidability {{results for}} logics for reasoning about abstract data structures, and techniques for proving the correctness {{of programs that}} implement abstract data structures. The main expressivity issue addressed {{is the question of}} whether certain spatial adjunct connectives contribute to the expressive power of context logic for trees. The question is answered in the affirmative for context logic in its basic form, but in the negative for a <b>multi-holed</b> variant of context logic. This result is interesting, since the adjunct connectives {{play an important role in}} expressing the weakest preconditions of programs. The decidability results show that <b>multi-holed</b> context logic is decidable for trees, sequences and terms, by encoding logical formulae with automata. Concerning the correctness of programs that implement abstract data structures, this thesis presents two techniques for justifying abstract local reasoning about such implementations in the sequential setting. In the concurrent setting, this thesis presents an approach to verifying implementations of abstract specifications that incorporate a fiction of disjointness using a fine-grained permissions model. 2 To all from whom I have ever learned, in the hope that I might reciprocate your generosity in some small part. ...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} project aiming at {{development}} of a miniaturized hydrogen generator for small mobile/onboard fuel cell applications, a series of experiments was conducted on a novel micro-reactor to examine the effectiveness of its design in promoting the mixing of reactant agents. The reactor is essentially a tubular vessel fitted with a <b>multi-holed</b> baffle plate mounted on a central tube. The mixing phenomenon within the micro-reactor was studied using the micro-PIV (micro-particle image velocimetry) flow visualization technique. Experiments were conducted on a 1 : 1 scale replica of the reactor. Results indicate that the application of the <b>multi-holed</b> baffle plate considerably improves the mixing performance of the reactor when compared with a simpler co-axial jet tubular reactor. However, the geometrical characteristics of the baffle plate and central tube are found to have dramatic impacts upon the flow structure and mixing patterns within the reactor. Hence, the optimization of the reactor geometry is required to achieve the desirable mixing performance. For the range of Reynolds numbers studied here, the optimum reactor geometry is achieved when the central tube and baffle holes are of similar diameters and baffle holes are located half way between the stream-wise axis and the reactor wall...|$|R

It was found that all three mixers increased mixing through the mechanism of generating coherent structures, which in turn increased interface contact between the fluid streams.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{current work}} {{attempts}} to experimentally {{determine the effects}} of <b>multi-hole</b> micro-nozzles fabricated using the MEMS-LIGA method. Spray behavior is quantified by SMD measurements using Malvern Spraytec system and cone angle, penetration length through use of a high speed camera imagery. MEMS-LIGA based method was chosen as the method of fabrication for its ability to fabricate diameters below the EDM capability. The advantage of the LIGA method is quality of the nozzle cross-section and the ability to maintain very close tolerances in diameter and nozzle-to-nozzle distance. A total of 17 planar (2 D) and 8 curved (3 D) nozzles were tested at different injection pressures (up to 400 bar). The current work uses a HEUI system and documents the effects of Injection (Rail) Pressure, number of micro-nozzles and nozzles ’ placement. The results suggest that the <b>multi-hole</b> micro nozzle behavior is to some extent similar to that of a single hole nozzle but additional variables like number of nozzles, solid cone angle and placement play a critical role and are specific to the <b>multi-hole</b> behavior. The current work presents spray tip penetration and cone angle data for both single hole and <b>multi-hole</b> nozzles.

40|$|High-pressure <b>multi-hole</b> nozzles, {{carrying}} a Diesel-derived technology, {{are believed to}} be promising Fuel Injection Equipment (FIE) for Direct-Injection (DI) Spark Ignition (SI) gasoline engines. Having explored thoroughly swirl pressure atomisers and their spray behaviour, <b>multi-hole</b> nozzles represent the second-generation injectors. Thus, complete investigation of <b>multi-hole</b> nozzle flow, spray characteristics and their engine performance is a vital part of development of future DI gasoline engines. The internal nozzle flow of an enlarged transparent <b>multi-hole</b> injector was investigated for different flow rates and needle lifts under steady state flow conditions. High-resolution CCD camera and high speed digital video systems were employed to visualize the nozzle flow patterns and cavitation development. The images identified the onset of cavitation in <b>multi-hole</b> gasoline nozzles and revealed the transition from pre-film to film stage cavitation. Cavitation strings were also visualized inside the injection hole that could extend to the needle face. However, these structures are highly unstable and directly affected by needle lift and cavitation number, although it appeared to be independent of the Re, in a behaviour similar to that of <b>multi-hole</b> diesel injectors. The sprays from various high-pressure <b>multi-hole</b> nozzle designs injected into a high-pressure/temperature constant-volume chamber have been visualised and quantified in terms of droplet velocity and diameter with a two-component phase-Doppler Anemometry (PDA) system at injection pressures up to 200 bar and chamber pressures varying from atmospheric to 12 bar. The overall spray angles relative to the axis of the injector were found to be almost independent of injection and chamber pressure, a significant advantage relative to swirl pressure atomisers. Within the measured range, the effect of injection pressure on droplet size was rather small while the increase in chamber pressure from atmospheric to 12 bar resulted in much smaller droplet velocities, by up to fourfold, and larger droplet sizes by up to 40 %. The effect of chamber temperature on <b>multi-hole</b> sprays confirmed the expected trends that dictate smaller droplet size distributions as temperature rise from 50 to 90 and 120 °C. Additionally, multiple-injection proved to have similar dependencies to the single injection with certain operating limits. Laser-induced fluorescence has been mainly used to characterise the two-dimensional fuel vapour concentration inside the cylinder of a multi-valve twin-spark ignition engine equipped with high-pressure <b>multi-hole</b> injectors. The effects of injection timing, in-cylinder charge motion and injector tip layout have been quantified. The flexibility in nozzle design of the <b>multi-hole</b> injectors {{has proven to be a}} powerful tool in terms of matching overall spray cone angle and number of holes to specific engine configurations. Injection timing was found to control spray impingement on the piston and cylinder wall, thus contributing to quick and efficient fuel evaporation. Multipleinjection performed well under certain operating conditions and proved to be a powerful tool in the hands of engine manufacturers. It was confirmed that in-cylinder charge motion plays a major role in engine's stable operation by assisting in the transportation of the air-fuel mixture towards the ignition locations (i. e. spark-plugs) in the way of a uniformly distributed charge or by preserving stratification of the charge depending on operating mode of the engine...|$|E

Four wound infusion systems (PAINfusor by Baxter, OnQ Pump with Soaker catheter by I-Flow, PolyFuser Polymedic by Temena and Infiltralong by Pajunk) have been tested. Test results demonstrate that the distribution of the infused flow is different for the four catheters and closely connected to the catheter design (i. e. hole size and position, lumen diameter).
