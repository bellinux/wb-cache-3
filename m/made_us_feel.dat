500|$|Claudio Abbado, {{principal}} guest conductor since 1971, succeeded Previn {{as chief}} conductor in the orchestra's diamond jubilee year, 1979. In a 1988 {{study of the}} LSO in Gramophone magazine James Jolly wrote that Abbado {{was in many ways}} the antithesis of Previn in terms of style and repertoire, bringing to the orchestra a particular authority in the Austro-German classics as well as a commitment to the avant-garde. From the orchestra's point of view there were disadvantages to his appointment. His relationship with the players was distant and he was unable to impose discipline on the orchestra in rehearsals. He insisted on conducting without a score, and many times this led to barely-avoided disaster in concerts. Abbado had considerable international prestige, but this too had its downside for the LSO: he frequently made his major recordings with the Boston or Chicago Symphony Orchestras or the Vienna Philharmonic. One of the LSO's principals commented, [...] "Although we were sweating our guts playing those vast Mahler symphonies for... Abbado, he would go and record them with other orchestras, which <b>made</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like second, maybe even third choice".|$|E

Rhythmic oscillations of the PER protein, {{the product of the}} Drosophila period (per) gene, in brain neurons of the adult fly are strongly involved in the control of circadian rhythms.

The fusion proteins contained either the N-terminal half (SG), the N-terminal two-thirds (BG), or nearly all (XLG) of the PER protein. All constructs led to reporter signals only in the known per-expressing cell types within the anterior CNS and PNS. Whereas the staining intensity of SG flies was constantly high at different Zeitgeber times, the in situ signals in BG and XLG flie...|$|R

For the latter two characters, Conor and Mary, the Ireland episodes were only the beginning of their stint in EastEnders. Both characters remained in the serial as regulars, moving back to the soap's setting in Albert Square to be with the new-found family. They remained on-screen for two years. At the time of filming the Ireland episodes, Gleeson, from Thurles, County Tipperary, said, [...] "The EastEnders cast are all really nice people", and Shanley said, [...] "I've always been a big fan of EastEnders and to tell the truth I was a bit star struck ...

[...] Clark Pullen added, [...] "I was expecting the cast to be luvvies but they were all brilliant - real grafters and totally down to earth. They were all very supportive as well and made me feel right at home. I was pretty starstruck ... Wendy Richard who plays Pauline Fowler was great - she is the most wonderful woman and she quietly gave me advice on how to cope with the sudden fame and attention."
