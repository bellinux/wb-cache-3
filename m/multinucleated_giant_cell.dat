40|$|Background: Central and Peripheral <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> granulomas of jaws are uncommon, benign, {{reactive}} disorders {{that are}} characterized {{by the presence of}} numerous <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> and mononuclear cells within a stroma. The origin of the <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> is controversial; probably originating from fusion of histiocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Objective: To assess the expression of CD 34 and CD 68 in central and peripheral <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> granulomas to understand the origin of these <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty cases of Central and Peripheral <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> granulomas were evaluated immunohistochemically for CD 34 and CD 68 proteins expression. Results: Immunopositivity for CD 34 was seen only in cytoplasm of endothelial cells of blood vessels; whereas, consistent cytoplasmic immunopositivity for CD 68 was seen in few stromal cells. Statistical significance was seen in mean number of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells,</b> mean number of nuclei in <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells,</b> CD 68 expression and ratio of macrophages to <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> among two lesions. Conclusion: Although the central <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> granulomas share some clinical and histopathological similarities with peripheral <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> granulomas, differences in mean number of nuclei in <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> and CD 68 immunoreactivity may underlie the distinct clinical behavior...|$|R

50|$|A giant cell (<b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell,</b> multinucleate giant cell) is a mass {{formed by}} the union of several {{distinct}} cells (usually macrophages), often forming a granuloma. It can arise {{in response to an}} infection, such as from tuberculosis, herpes, or HIV, or foreign body. These multinucleate giant cells (MGCs) are cells of monocyte or macrophage lineage fused together.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> {{formations}} {{can arise}} from numerous types of bacteria, diseases, and cell formations.

In the process of giant cell formation, monocytes or macrophages fuse together, which could cause multiple problems for the immune system.|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{wild-type}} p 53 {{function is}} widely accepted to be permissive {{for the development}} of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells.</b> However, whether therapy-induced multinucleation is associated with cancer cell death or survival remains controversial. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure of p 53 -deficient or p 21 WAF 1 (p 21) -deficient solid tumor-derived cell lines to ionizing radiation (between 2 and 8 Gy) results in the development of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> that remain adherent to the culture dish for long times post-irradiation. Somewhat surprisingly, single-cell observations revealed that virtually all <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> that remain adherent {{for the duration of the}} experiments (up to three weeks post-irradiation) retain viability and metabolize 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), and the majority (> 60 %) exhibit DNA synthesis. We further report that treatment of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> with pharmacological activators of apoptosis (e. g., sodium salicylate) triggers their demise. Our observations reinforce the notion that radiation-induced multinucleation may reflect a survival mechanism for p 53 /p 21 -deficient cancer cells. With respect to evaluating radiosensitivity, our observations underscore the importance of single-cell experimental approaches (e. g., single-cell MTT) as the creation of viable <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> complicates the interpretation of the experimental data obtained by commonly-used multi-well plate colorimetric assays...|$|R

5000|$|Giant-cell tumor of {{the bone}} (GCTOB) is a {{relatively}} uncommon tumor {{of the bone}}. It {{is characterized by the}} presence of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells). Malignancy in giant-cell tumor is uncommon and occurs in about 2% of all cases. However, if malignant degeneration does occur, it is likely to metastasize to the lungs. Giant-cell tumors are normally benign, with unpredictable behavior. It is a heterogeneous tumor composed of three different cell populations. The giant-cell tumour stromal cells (GCTSC) constitute the neoplastic cells, which are from an osteoblastic origin and are classified based on expression of osteoblast cell markers such as alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. In contrast, the mononuclear histiocytic cells (MNHC) and <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> (MNGC) fractions are secondarily recruited and comprise the non-neoplastic cell population. They are derived from an osteoclast-monocyte lineage determined primarily by expression of CD68, a marker for monocytic precursor cells.

The gp 120 was also able to temporarily interfere with viral infection and to block the process of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> formation. However, if the carbohydrate chains were removed from gp 120 by enzymatic treatment, CD 4 binding and blockade of cell fusion was reduced by about a factor of 50.

40|$|AIMS: Collagenous colitis and {{lymphocytic}} colitis are the {{two types}} of microscopic colitis with specific morphological features. In this report we describe a new histopathological subtype of microscopic colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colonoscopy in four patients with chronic watery diarrhoea showed no macroscopic abnormalities. The random biopsies from the colon showed subepithelial <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> in combination with the features of collagenous colitis in three patients and lymphocytic colitis in one patient. These <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> were positive for CD 68. The density of macrophages was highest in the most superficial part of the lamina propria. In one patient, a previous biopsy showed features consistent with collagenous colitis without <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells.</b> Treatment with budesonide led to the disappearance of diarrhoea in all four patients. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and histopathological features of the four presented patients indicate that there exists a histopathological subtype of microscopic colitis characterized by the presence of subepithelial <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells,</b> which probably arise from fusion of subepithelial macrophages. Analysis of more patients with this histopathological subtype of microscopic colitis is necessary to determine whether they also form a clinically distinct group. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Multinucleated giant cells, {{formed by}} the fusion of monocytes/macrophages, are {{features}} of chronic granulomatous inflammation associated with infections or the persistent presence of foreign material. The tetraspanins CD 9 and CD 81 regulate <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> formation: soluble recombinant proteins corresponding to the large extracellular domain (EC 2) of human but not mouse CD 9 can inhibit <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> formation, whereas human CD 81 EC 2 can antagonise this effect. Tetraspanin EC 2 are all {{likely to have a}} conserved three helix sub-domain and a much less well-conserved or hypervariable sub-domain formed by short helices and interconnecting loops stabilised by two or more disulfide bridges. Using CD 9 /CD 81 EC 2 chimeras and point mutants we have mapped the specific regions of the CD 9 EC 2 involved in <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> formation. These were primarily located in two helices, one in each sub-domain.

A tyrosine residue in one of the active regions that is not conserved between human and mouse CD 9 EC 2, predicted to be solvent-exposed, was found to be only peripherally involved in this activity.

40|$|<b>Multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> are {{associated}} with granulomas arising from immunological and nonimmunological inflammatory reactions. They {{are an integral part}} of the host immune response to chronic infectious diseases. In the present study we have demonstrated that human lymphocytes when stimulated by specific antigens of T cell mitogens produce a soluble factor that causes peripheral blood monocytes to fuse and form <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. Production of the <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> factor by antigen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes correlates with the existence of cell-mediated immunity to specific antigen. Monocyte-depleted blood lymphocytes, but not purified blood monocytes, produce the <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> factor when cultured with antigens or T cell mitogens. Gel filtration and physiochemical studies indicate that the lymphocyte-derived <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> factor is a heat-labile protein of approximately 60, 000 mol wt.

40|$|Macrophages play {{essential}} {{roles in}} a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. One of the unique features of these phagocytic leukocytes is their ability to fuse, forming <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> are important mediators of tissue remodeling and repair and are also responsible for removal or sequestration of foreign material, intracellular bacteria and non-phagocytosable pathogens, such as parasites and fungi. Depending on the tissue where fusion occurs and the inflammatory insult, <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> assume distinctly different phenotypes. Nevertheless, the ultimate outcome is the formation of large cells that can resorb bone tissue (osteoclasts) or foreign material and pathogens (<b>giant</b> <b>cells)</b> extracellularly. While progress has been made in recent years, the mechanisms and factors involved in macrophage fusion are still not fully understood. In addition to cytokines and a number of adhesion proteins and receptors, it is becoming increasingly clear that NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play an important role in macrophage fusion. In this review, we provide an overview of macrophage multinucleation, with a specific focus on the role of NADPH oxidases and ROS in macrophage fusion and in the function of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, we provide an updated overview of the role of these cells in inflammation and various autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{focus of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that there would be no difference between the biocompatibility of resin-modified glass ionomer cements. Sixty male Wistar rats were selected and divided into four groups: Control Group; Crosslink Group; RMO Group and Transbond Group. The materials were inserted into rat subcutaneous tissue. After time intervals of 7, 15 and 30 days morphological analyses were performed. The histological parameters assessed were: inflammatory infiltrate intensity; reaction of multinucleated giant cells; edema; necrosis; granulation reaction; young fibroblasts and collagenization. The results obtained were statistically analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn test (P< 0. 05). After 7 days, Groups RMO and Transbond showed intense inflammatory infiltrate (P= 0. 004), only Group RMO presented greater expression of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> reaction (P= 0. 003) compared with the control group. After the time intervals of 15 and 30 days, there was evidence of light/moderate inflammatory infiltrate, lower level of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> reaction and thicker areas of young fibroblasts in all the groups. The hypothesis was rejected.

40|$|Inflammatory {{reactions}} were evoked by simultaneous implantation {{of pieces of}} Melinex plastic in the subcutaneous tissue of the dorsum and in the peritoneal cavity of rats. The cellular composition of the Melinex-adherent cells and their peroxidatic (PO) activity were investigated {{in relation to the}} duration of implantation. Several striking {{differences were found between the}} subcutaneous and peritoneal implants. On the 7 th and 14 th days, <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> were abundantly present on the subcutaneous implants, whereas they were relatively rare on the peritoneal implants. The subcutaneous implants bore no mast cells and only a few eosinophilic granulocytes, but both types of cell were observed frequently on the peritoneal implants. Macrophages and <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> on the subcutaneous implants show PO activity only in the granules are PO negative. On the peritoneal implants three types of macrophages can be dintinguished: exudate macrophages which have PO activity restricted to granules or are PO-negative; macrophages with PO activity in granules and both the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and nuclear envelope; and resident macrophages with PO activity only in the RER and nuclear envelope. In addition, two types of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> are found, one with and the other without PO activity in the RER and nuclear envelope. <b>Multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cells</b> with PO activity in the RER and nuclear envelope as well as exudate macrophages with PO activity in the RER and nuclear envelope were mainly found 32 h and 3 days after implantation of the Melinex in the peritoneal cavity.

40|$|Granuloma is a {{specialized}} form of inflammatory reaction featuring focal macrophage and T-cell accumulation and <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> formation. It is widely held that macrophage accumulation within granulomatous lesions results from recruitment of blood monocytes, whereas proliferation of monocyte/macrophages makes little {{contribution to this}} process. The present study of macrophage proliferation within immunologically induced granulomas in rat experimental Goodpasture's syndrome challenges the conventional view. In this disease, granulomatous lesions in the kidney and lung contained 60 to 70 % macrophages of an ED 1 +ED 2 -ED 3 -blood monocyte phenotype. However, double immunohistochemistry showed that up to 75 % of ED 1 + macrophages within granulomatous lesions were proliferating {{on the basis of}} proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. In contrast, no proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression or bromodeoxyuridine incorporations was detected in blood monocytes, indicating that proliferation of ED 1 +ED 2 -ED 3 - cells was a localized event within granulomatous lesions. A second finding of note was that almost all (> 95 %) nuclei within multinucleated giant cells were positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, but these nuclei lacked bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. This suggests a novel mechanism of <b>multinucleated</b> <b>giant</b> <b>cell</b> formation involving fusion of macrophages in G 1 phase, which then halts progression into S phase of the cell cycle.
