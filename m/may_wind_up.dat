5000|$|A company <b>may</b> enter <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> either voluntarily, or {{pursuant}} to {{an order of}} the court. If a company enters voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> then the directors are required to make a determination of solvency. [...] Any person (including {{a former director of}} the company) may act as liquidator in a solvent voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> However, if the directors are not able to make a determination of solvency, or if upon the application of a creditor to the court it is shown that either (a) the company is or is likely to become insolvent; or (b) the supervision of the Court will facilitate a more effective, economic or expeditious liquidation of the company in the interests of the contributories and creditors, then the court <b>may</b> order the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> be subject to the supervision of the court, and in such cases a licensed insolvency practitioner must be appointed as liquidator.|$|R

60|$|As to boasters, I will dismiss {{them with}} a few words. They are too easily known to merit {{particular}} description. They are usually loud and bold in the drawing-room, but rather mild in the field. They are desperately egotistical, fond of exaggeration, and prone to depreciate the deeds of their comrades. They make bad soldiers and sailors, and are usually held in contempt by others, whatever they may think of themselves. I <b>may</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> this digression--into which I have been tempted by an earnest desire to warn my fellow-men against the errors of nervous and muscular education, which, in my case, led to the weak conduct of which I had been guilty that day--I <b>may</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> this digression, I say, by remarking that the boys who are most loved in this world {{are those who are}} lambs, almost muffs, in the drawing-room, but lions in the field.|$|E

50|$|Horses {{that are}} chronic and {{consistent}} buckers cannot be ridden safely {{and if they}} cannot be retrained become unsuitable for any type of ordinary riding.

50|$|Suleyman is {{a former}} pirate, based in North Africa, who has built up a power base there and among a Muslim sect {{worldwide}} in the 22nd century.

6000|$|Dinner lasted two hours; the Empress rising, Friedrich Wilhelm {{leads her}} to her room; then retires to his own, and [...] "in {{a quarter of an}} hour" [...] is visited there by the Kaiser; [...] "who conducts him," [...] in so many minutes exact by the watch, [...] "back to the Empress,"--for a sip of coffee, as one hopes; which <b>may</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the Interview well. The sun is still a good space from setting, when Friedrich Wilhelm, after cordial adieus, neglectful of etiquette, is rolling rapidly towards Nimburg, thirty miles off on the Prag Highway; and Kaiser Karl with his Spouse move {{deliberately}} towards Chlumetz to hunt again. In Nimburg Friedrich Wilhelm sleeps, that night;--Imperial Majesties, in a much-tumbled world, of wild horses, ceremonial ewers, and Eugenios of Savoy and Malplaquet, probably peopling his dreams.

His debut for the Saints came on 5 September 1936, in the first Second Division match played at Villa Park, which ended in a 4-0 defeat. Whitelaw retained his place at right-half in the Southampton team, where he combined well with fellow half-backs, Bill Kennedy and Billy Kingdon, until December when he lost his place to Cyril King.

5000|$|The European Monsoon (more {{commonly}} known as the Return of the Westerlies) {{is the result of a}} resurgence of westerly winds from the Atlantic, where they become loaded with wind and rain.

5000|$|The European Monsoon (more {{commonly}} known as the Return of the Westerlies) {{is the result of a}} resurgence of westerly winds from the Atlantic, where they become loaded with wind and rain.

25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R

25|$|During {{the course}} of a <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a company <b>may</b> make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends.
