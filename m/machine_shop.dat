5|$|At its peak, around 1917, Thistle {{had about}} 600 residents. The town's {{railroad}} infrastructure included a five-stall roundhouse, depot, <b>machine</b> <b>shop,</b> and structures to restock passing trains with sand, coal and water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911.|$|E

The title The Hunting Party is a contextual metaphor: Linkin Park is the party that is hunting {{to bring back the}} energy and soul of rock.|$|E
5|$|All {{housing and}} major hangars were {{completed}} in 1918, including a large steel-and-wood hangar, two concrete hangars for seaplanes and flying boats, a supply warehouse, a <b>machine</b> <b>shop,</b> a photography laboratory and a powerhouse. In 1919, {{the field was}} named Luke Field after Frank Luke, a World War I ace and Medal of Honor recipient. The U.S. Army's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii {{with the development of}} civilian airports, the creation of the Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association, and a national flying code. The army's aviation division was generally favorably received by the Hawaiians, who took the military's investment in their land as a compliment.|$|E
5|$|Holloman {{was born}} in Thomaston, Georgia, and moved to Athens, Georgia with his family when he was 17. In Athens, he met Nan Stevens, the two were married on January 24, 1942, and they later had one son. He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II. After {{returning}} from the war, Holloman became an apprentice in a <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> for the Georgia Railroad in Macon, Georgia. While working there, he played amateur baseball, and did well enough for his colleagues to convince him {{to try out for}} the Macon Peaches, the local baseball team. He did so, and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers, where he began his professional career.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1923 in Crescent City, Florida, an {{outskirt}} of Jacksonville, to Glen Parmelee and Laura Mae (Lewis) Robinson. His family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, in 1937. After attending high school at Marion Military Institute in Alabama, Robinson opened a small <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> in Valdosta. He sold industrial products and metal tools to local industry. In 1942, with the encouragement of his father, Robinson enrolled {{as a student at}} the Georgia Institute of Technology to study chemical engineering. However, his education was interrupted by his enlistment into the Naval Signal Corps and service in the Pacific Theatre of World War II where he installed telephones on recaptured American possessions during the war.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> should have been used to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|The three story mansion {{house was}} broken up into {{workshops}} and living quarters. The workshops were a chemistry lab, a print shop, a shipping room, a carpentry work area and <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> facilities. The attic above the third story was devoted entirely {{for all the}} machines and associated tools necessary {{for the construction of}} airships. One first floor room was a large library with many books on aeronautics and science, where Myers researched often and brainstormed with his wife. There were out-buildings scattered throughout the five acres that contained gas engines, chemical labs, and furnace facilities.|$|E

5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time that the No. 3 {{locomotive}} was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale in New Jersey, and after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad in New Jersey, and that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel fuel. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} <b>machine</b> <b>shop,</b> and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E

5|$|By 1957, the DRR was {{becoming}} overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney {{determined that a}} third train was needed. Instead of having another locomotive built from scratch to pull the train, Disney believed that costs could be saved by purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam locomotive, and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable locomotive was found in Louisiana; it had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had previously {{been used as a}} switcher at a sugar cane mill in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to burn diesel oil for fuel to generate steam. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 3 locomotive and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 locomotive when it went into service were five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the Excursion Train, which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.|$|E
