40|$|This thesis has {{presented}} experimental and finite element (FE) {{analyses of the}} static and ultrasonic forming of two metals; aluminium 1050 and magnesium AM 50. Aluminium and magnesium {{are considered to be}} soft metals and can be easily shaped by any of the main industrial metalworking processes. Frequently aluminium and magnesium {{have been the subject of}} research studies. These two metals most commonly chosen in manufacturing industry because of their cost, mechanical properties and flexibility in processing. In this research, simple compression and forming tests were designed and the effects of superimposed ultrasonic excitation on workpiece and die, which is tuned to a longitudinal mode at 20. 8 kHz, were studied via stress-strain measurements. Research through experiments and finite element simulations studies in the application of ultrasonic excitation has been carried out to gain quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of improvement in ultrasonic forming characteristics, such as a reduction in material flow stress and oscillatory stress. This research study has shown these mechanisms by applying ultrasonic vibration to the tool and die in the forming test and, similarly, effects were measured and predicted in the experimental and numerical analysis. The development and application of high power ultrasonic techniques in forming processes required the use of specifically designed ultrasonic components to correctly transmit the energy from the transducer to the workpiece and die interface. The application along with the ultrasonic vibration amplitude required for the process, were considered in order to design the most suitable horn profile. In this study, a 20 kHz transducer was used to provide up to 10 µm of peak-to-peak vibration amplitude, depending on the generator setting. Therefore, the booster and horn were designed to provide a range of ultrasonic vibration amplitudes between 5 to 20 µm and also used as a tool and die in the study of ultrasonic metal forming. The horn was designed using finite element modelling (FEM), and modal frequencies and associated mode shapes were subsequently confirmed using experimental modal analysis (EMA). The ultrasonic system has been measured and calculated as having a longitudinal mode of vibration at 20. 8 kHz and to provide an amplitude gain of four. In this study, a generator uses mains electricity to generate a high frequency ultrasonic signal to drive the transducer, which is tuned to a specific frequency of 20 kHz. The booster and horn were designed to meet the criteria of transducer, which is to provide a longitudinal vibration at tuned frequency of 20 kHz. However, the profile of booster and horn have been measured and calculated as having a longitudinal mode of vibration at 20. 8 kHz, which is considered close to the transducer tuned frequency. The review of previous studies of superimposed ultrasonic excitation on upsetting showed that the most experimental characterisations of the volume effects mainly depended on an interpretation of measurements of the mean flow stress, and have neglected the oscillatory stress. In this study, the characteristics of oscillatory stress and the material behaviour in plastic deformation when superimposed ultrasonic excitation is applied on a static compression test under dry friction were considered. The effects were explained in terms of flow stress reduction, oscillatory stress, mean flow stress, maximum and minimum path of oscillatory stress in the stress-strain diagram. The results showed that the static flow stress of compressive deformation was lowered by the ultrasonic vibration superimposed on the static load and this phenomenon has been referred to as the material softening mechanism which is influenced by volume and surface effects. The volume effect is defined as a reduction in flow stress of the material being formed and the surface effect is defined as a reduction in frictional conditions at the interface between the vibrating device and the workpiece. Finite element models were used to investigate numerically the volume and surface effects during ultrasonically assisted compression. The finite element models were developed using material model parameters which were identified from the experimental analysis. The influence of volume and surface effects were investigated separately in the FE model and it was shown that the volume effect dominated the effective material softening results during ultrasonic excitation. The application of ultrasonic excitation on metals under plastic deformation conditions has been investigated previously. Most researchers have reported that superimposing ultrasonic excitation on metal working processes reduced the material flow stress. A further study of superimposed ultrasonic excitation on a static load during elastic deformation in metal working was not investigated, so it is not possible to determine the effect of ultrasonic excitation on the material. In this study, the investigation of oscillatory stress behaviour in the ultrasonic compression test of cylinder metal specimens during elastic deformation was carried out. In the stress-strain diagram, the ultrasonic vibration was shown to have lowered the static flow stress during elastic deformation under dry contact conditions and it was found that the reduction in static flow stress linearly increased with ultrasonic vibration amplitude. The stress reduction was influenced by volume and surface effects which occurred during the superimposed ultrasonic excitation. The results also showed that the maximum path of oscillatory stress exceeded the static flow stress, however, the mean flow stress is lower than the static flow stress at the onset of ultrasonic excitation. To investigate the influence that volume and surface effects have on material softening during experimental compression tests, a series of FE models were developed. As mentioned previously, the FE models were developed using material model parameters which were identified from the experimental analysis in Figure A 1, however, the mechanism of flow stress reduction which is related to acoustic softening and friction reduction which is labelled as (i) cannot be predicted in FE models. The FE models adopted the material softening effects in order to simulate realistic stress reduction compared with experimental results. The significant stress reduction in the FE analysis was obtained by adjusting the yield stress and contact conditions parameter. It was concluded that the surface effect dominated the stress reduction during <b>metal</b> <b>upsetting</b> test in elastic deformation. The study continued to a simple forming test where samples of flat sheet metal were forced into a shaped die by a shaped plunger on a test machine. The results of this study illustrated how ultrasonically assisted metal forming resulted in a lowering of the static forming force during ultrasonic excitation of the die. As a result, the static forming force was seen to be reduced by ultrasonic excitation of the die and the path of the maximum oscillatory force was observed to be parallel to or below the path of the static forming force. Force reduction was measured in these experiments using a high power ultrasonic transducer and also by tuning the die and then the punch during the metal forming test. It was found that a good coupling between punch, specimen and die allowed ultrasonic energy to be effectively transferred into the materials during superimposed ultrasonic excitation in the static forming test. This thesis has concluded that evaluation of the benefits of ultrasonic excitation not only relied on measurements of the mean flow stress alone but also on measurement of the oscillatory stress during superimposed ultrasonic excitation on forming tests. Findings on the effectiveness of ultrasonic excitation led the study to recognize that the lack of understanding of the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the forming process has resulted in difficulties in maximising the benefits and applications of this technology. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (FEA) based on rate-dependent crystal plasticity is used to study texture development in BCC <b>metals</b> during <b>upset</b> deformation. A reference case having zero friction between the work piece and die and employing published constitutive data for tantalum predicts that after 1 : 5 upset deformation, a random initial texture evolves to ~ 60 % of grains having and ~ 40 % of grains having within 10 º of the upset axis (ND). These values decrease if the Taylor iso-strain assumption in the FEA is relaxed, barreling occurs due to friction, strain rate sensitivity increases, or the latent-to-self hardening ratio decreases. Reducing operative slip systems from both { 110 }/ and { 112 }/ to just { 110 }/ increases but decreases texture. Texture intensity plots and texture maps are introduced to quantify these results...|$|R

40|$|A {{torsional}} {{upset forging}} process is analysed {{on the basis}} of plasticity theory for powder <b>metal</b> forging. Torsional <b>upset</b> forging is a process to be performed by rotating a lower die with a punch travelling along the longitudinal direction of a work-piece. In this study, an upper bound analysis considering bulging effect, finite element method simulation (DEFORM 3 D), and experimental research have been performed for the process. A simple kinematically admissible velocity field for a three dimensional deformation is presented for the torsional upset forging of a cylindrical billet. Distributions of stress, strain, and forging load in the process have been obtained, and compared with those in conventional upset forging. In the process, an increase in a friction factor and rotation speed results in a decrease in magnitude of <b>upset</b> force, dead <b>metal</b> zone, and non-homogeneous deformation. This process can reduce forming load, which leads to improvement of die life, and also reduce bulging effect. In addition, the initial sintered-structure and density distribution is improved by the process and surface defect due to high deformation is decreased. <br /...|$|R
50|$|According {{to a study}} {{published}} in Materials and Design, several parameters affect the final product. Flash time is the time that the arc is present. Upset time is {{the amount of time that}} the two pieces are pressed together. Flash time needs to be long enough to sufficiently heat the metal before it is pressed together. However, if it is too long, too much of the base metal begins to melt away. The upset time is critical in creating the desired mechanical properties of the finished weld. During the upset, any impurities in the base metal are pressed out creating a perfect weld. If the upset time is too short, all of the impurities may not be pushed out of the base metal creating a defective weld. The upset time is also crucial in the strength of the finished weld because it is during the upset that coalescence occurs between the two pieces of <b>metal.</b> If the <b>upset</b> time is too short, the two pieces of metal may not completely bond.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Besides {{weldable}} component geometries for the {{high-frequency welding}} process also possible process and system induced activated material reactions during discontinuous high-frequency welding {{are presented in}} this paper. Among others such material reactions can be a locally limited thermal influence on the base metal, defined plastic derformations during the upsetting process as well as grain refinement in the weld seam, comparable to thermomechanical treatment during rolling for increasing strength or ductility. The process versions of discontinuous high-frequency welding Discontinuous high-frequency welding is a pressure-welding process. The process sequence consists of two steps. First, the edges to be joined are simultaneously heated over their entire length to a temperature just below the liquidus temperature by Ohmic resistance heating. After completion of the heating process, the joining edges are mutually upset {{in order to ensure}} positive material bonding. The excellent tolerance compatibility of this welding method results from the mechanical pressure-welding process. Moreover, under some circumstances, oxides which are present in the seam are pinched out into the <b>upset</b> <b>metal</b> which is formed during the upsetting operation. This excess metal must then be removed from the resulting component in an additional operational step...|$|R
40|$|Fixing {{hardware}} made of carbon, high-carbon, and alloyed wires {{is one of}} {{the widespread}} critical parts in mechanical engineering. The characteristics of fixtures and fasteners and their performance figures are assessed at all stages of steel-making operation, from the choice of burden stock for metal smelting to the method of preparing calibrated rolled <b>metal</b> parts and <b>upsetting</b> end products. Material used for producing long high-duty bolts must be both sufficiently strong and ductile, have homogeneous mechanical properties and chemistry, and no inner or surface defects. When manufacturing fasteners, hot-rolled metal is often plastically deformed by drafting before cold upsetting, and all unacceptable defects are removed by the expensive procedure of lathe-turning. Moreover, this technology of metal processing entails losses of up to 5. 5 % in chips. This paper suggests a resource-efficient and environmentally friendlier fabrication method for calibrated rolled metal items made of steel 38 XA, 9. 65 mm diameter, for cold die-forging of high-duty bolts used in automotive engines, which helps spare expensive lathe-machining processes. Moreover, rolled steel produced using this technology is characterized by high resistance to plastic deformation when cold, which leads to increase n wear-resistance of tools in cold die-forging of bolts...|$|R
40|$|An {{upper bound}} {{solution}} for lateral extrusion of square, hexagon, spline and tracoidal forms has been developed. A simple kinematically admissible velocity field with optimization parameter is proposed. From the proposed velocity field the upper bound solution on relative punch pressure and extrusion load are determined {{with respect to}} chosen process parameters. The results are compared with theoretical and experimental result from a reference to illustrate {{the validity of the}} proposed velocity fields. This is indicating that the analysis presented here renders better upper bound solution. Three-dimensional brick shaped elements are utilized in finite element analysis by ALGOR software with linear and non-linear <b>metal</b> applied to <b>upset</b> forging of L shaped blocks. The upper bound elemental technique also used to analyze the problem. Detailed formulations of models are presented. The predictions both in forging load and the deformed configuration are in good agreement with the experiment qualitatively under different lubrication conditions. The proposed velocity field gives higher load values than the values experimentally obtained within 25 percent. The velocity field proposed in the present investigation can be used conveniently with short computational time for the prediction of extrusion loads & deformations in heading of different shapes. A higher order polynomial velocity field can be tested to get better results for different section...|$|R
