Ochetellus flavipes {{regularly}} attends the <b>mealybug</b> Prorsococcus acanthodus and protects it by building shelters. They also attend a number of butterfly larvae, including Anthene lycaenoides (Pale Ciliate Blue), Ogyris amaryllis (Satin Azure), Ogyris olane (Olane Azure) and Ogyris oroetes (Silky Azure).|$|E
25|$|The citrus <b>mealybug</b> {{looks very}} similar to the vine <b>mealybug</b> (Planococcus ficus), and the two species are mainly {{distinguished}} by the arrangement of pores and tubular ducts on the tiny body of the female. This similarity can pose a problem in agriculture. For example, when growers are ready to attempt biological pest control of either <b>mealybug,</b> the use of molecular analysis is recommended to confirm the identity of the species so an appropriate parasitoid can be employed.|$|E
25|$|Agents of {{biological}} control include {{a number of}} parasitoid wasps that attack the nymphs, including Leptomastidea abnormis, Leptomastix dactylopii, Chrysoplatycerus splendens, and Anagyrus pseudococci. Predators include the brown lacewing Sympherobius barberi, the green lacewing Chrysopa lateralis, hoverfly larvae, and the scale-feeding snout-moth larva. The <b>mealybug</b> destroyer (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri), a ladybird beetle, readily attacks the citrus <b>mealybug.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the leaf roller Sylepta derogata to protect <b>mealybugs</b> (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of <b>mealybugs</b> in shelters was observed when enemies and leaf rollers were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the <b>mealybugs</b> inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of <b>mealybugs</b> in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by leaf rollers did not affect the survival of <b>mealybugs</b> in the absence of enemies in plants. Ants and leaf rollers significantly improved the survival of <b>mealybugs</b> in predator-infested plants, whereas no such improvement was observed in parasitoid-infested ones...|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} work [17], a cellular automata (CA) model {{together with the}} Monte Carlo simulation technique has been employed to study {{the effect of the}} release frequency of green lacewings in controlling the spread of <b>mealybugs</b> in a cassava field [17]. Since the effect of an increased global temperature on the life cycles of <b>mealybugs</b> and green lacewings should be investigated so that we can appropriately modify the usual practices in the control of the spread of <b>mealybugs</b> in response to those changes, we investigate the effect of an increased temperature on the controlling of the spread of <b>mealybugs</b> in a cassava field using green lacewings in this paper.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} natural enemies exist. One survey in Egypt noted 12 species of {{parasitoid}} wasps on the citrus <b>mealybug.</b> It also recorded nine predatory insects, including ladybird beetles, moths, a gall midge, {{and a green}} lacewing.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{females and}} nymphs suck sap with their {{piercing}} mouthparts. This leads to plant {{damage in the}} form of wilting and chlorosis of the foliage, leaf drop, stunted growth, and sometimes the death of the plant. Fruits such as oranges become lumpy and discolored when the insect feeds on them, and they may fall off the tree. Insects packed with harvested fruits continue to feed, causing more losses during shipping. The <b>mealybug</b> secretes honeydew, which coats leaves and fruits and causes the growth of sooty molds. A layer of mold can reduce the ability of a leaf to perform photosynthesis, and makes fruit unmarketable. The citrus <b>mealybug</b> is also a vector for plant viruses.|$|E
25|$|There {{are usually}} several generations per year. The <b>mealybug</b> is {{most common in}} spring and summer, its populations {{fluctuating}} according to temperature and available host plants. Peak abundance is noted in early summer in Florida citrus. Mealybugs infesting plants in the constant conditions of greenhouses have stable, steadily reproducing populations all year.|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} effect of release {{frequency}} of green lacewings in controlling the spread of <b>mealybugs</b> in a cassava field was investigated by Promrak and Rattanakul in 2015, {{the effect of}} increased global temperature was not taken into account. In this work, cellular automata and Monte Carlo simulation are employed in order to study the effect of an increased global temperature on the life cycles of <b>mealybugs</b> and green lacewings which in turn effects {{the efficacy of the}} biological control of the spread of <b>mealybugs.</b> Computer simulations are carried out at different temperatures so that an efficient biological control of the spread of <b>mealybugs</b> in a cassava field is obtained.|$|R

40|$|Endosymbiosis {{has been}} a major driver of {{evolutionary}} diversification of eukaryotes. However, symbiosis can create conflict between partners and symbiont density is often tightly regulated within hosts to ensure optimal functioning of the holobiont. The horticultural pest insects, citrus <b>mealybugs,</b> make an intriguing and potentially-powerful case study for endosymbiosis, harbouring two obligate, nutritional, vertically transmitted bacteria: Tremblaya princeps and Moranella endobia, in a nested mutualism. In this thesis, I examine the variation in the density of each of these obligate symbionts in citrus <b>mealybugs</b> under controlled environmental conditions, using qPCR, as well as the diversity of facultative symbionts that infect the <b>mealybugs</b> using next-generation sequencing and conventional targeted PCR. Citrus <b>mealybugs</b> were found to harbour Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Cardinium and Rickettsia, which have been found to impact the fitness of their hosts in other insect species, whereas long-tailed <b>mealybugs</b> were not found to harbour any of these bacteria, but the symbiont communities in both species were found to be dominated by their obligate symbionts. The density of the two obligate symbionts varied by up to six-fold between different populations kept under identical environmental conditions and a hybridisation experiment indicated that M. endobia and T. princeps density may be controlled by symbiont and host genotype respectively. However, symbiont density was not found to correlate with life-history traits in the laboratory, the ability of <b>mealybugs</b> to exploit different plant species, or the susceptibility of the <b>mealybugs</b> to insecticide and artificial reduction of symbiont density by heat-stress also had no effect on host fitness. Citrus <b>mealybugs</b> harbour seemingly superfluous symbionts with no clear fitness costs or benefits...|$|R
25|$|Planococcus citri, {{commonly}} known as the citrus <b>mealybug,</b> is a species of mealybugs native to Asia. It has been introduced {{to the rest of the}} world, including Europe, the Americas, and Oceania, as an agricultural pest. It is associated with citrus, but it attacks a wide range of crop plants, ornamental plants, and wild flora.|$|E
25|$|The ant has {{developed}} associations {{with a range}} of organisms. Foraging workers often visit flowers for nectar, chiefly those of Pisonia, but also of Canavalia, Commicarpus, Ipomoea, Melanthera, Plumbago and Scaevola. O.glaber also associates with some insects, including the pineapple <b>mealybug</b> (Dysmicoccus brevipes) and aphids, which they import and tend with other bugs on domestic pot plants. O.glaber associates indirectly with Ananusia australis, an encyrtid parasitoid wasp. No predators of O.glaber are known.|$|E
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed <b>mealybug</b> under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly.|$|E
5000|$|An aqueous {{solution}} containing 50% v/v isopropyl alcohol and 1% w/v {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (found in most household detergents) is effective against <b>mealybugs.</b> Isopropyl alcohol dissolves the outer waxy covering, while the sodium dodecyl sulfate attacks the <b>mealybugs</b> themselves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mealybugs</b> {{are sexually}} dimorphic: females appear as nymphs, exhibiting reduced morphology, and lack wings, {{although}} unlike many female scale insects, they often retain legs and can move. Males are smaller, gnat-like and have wings. Since <b>mealybugs</b> (as {{well as all}} other Hemiptera) are hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word. However, male <b>mealybugs</b> do exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to wasp-like flying adults.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>mealybugs</b> excrete honeydew, a thick, sugary fluid {{created as}} a {{byproduct}} of digestion (large colonies of <b>mealybugs</b> can produce enough honeydew to seep through bark and leaves, leaving shiny, sticky patches on {{the exterior of the}} plant). Some ants have developed a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with obscure <b>mealybugs,</b> tending and protecting the insects from natural enemies to increase the production of honeydew, on which the ants feed. This relationship is similar to the one that some ants have with aphids.|$|R
2500|$|Planococcus citri {{was first}} {{described}} in 1813 by the Niçard naturalist Antoine Risso. It {{belongs to the}} genus Planococcus in the <b>mealybug</b> family Pseudococcidae. They are classified under the superfamily Coccoidea (scale insects) in the [...] order Hemiptera (true bugs).|$|E
2500|$|During mating, {{the citrus}} <b>mealybug</b> {{is known to}} engage in [...] "triple coitus"; a female may copulate with two males at the same time, and a third male may at least make {{attempts}} to join the process. Males spend {{the one or two}} days of their adult lives mating, and have been observed achieving copulation with up to 23 females, with an average of about nine.|$|E
2500|$|All <b>mealybug</b> species {{investigated}} so {{far have}} endosymbionts: symbiotic bacteria that live inside their bodies and synthesize useful compounds such as amino acids that the insect can utilize. Most mealybugs examined contain the betaproteobacterium Tremblaya princeps (Candidatus Tremblaya princeps). Other bacterial taxa have recently been found in mealybugs, as well. The citrus <b>mealybug</b> has a nested endosymbiosis. Its resident T. princeps contain their own endosymbionts, the gammaproteobacterium Moranella endobia (Candidatus Moranella endobia). This [...] "matryoshka" [...] nested arrangement of a bacterium inside a bacterium inside an insect {{has been compared to}} the structure of a cell. T. princeps has almost no metabolic functions except for the production of amino acids, having lost the genes for most other life functions. It relies on M. endobia for energy, and is even unable to reproduce without it. T. princeps attracted attention when genetic analysis revealed that it has the smallest genome of any bacterium studied thus far. At 139 kilo-base pairs, it has only about 120 genes, which helps to explain why it cannot function without its endosymbiont.|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} in global temperatures affects the sex ratio, survival rate, reproduction rate and {{life cycle of}} both <b>mealybugs</b> and green lacewings. Simulations of the spread of <b>mealybugs</b> in a cassava field at 25 ∘C, 27 ∘C and 30 ∘C have been carried out.|$|R
40|$|Saccharococcus sacchari is {{the primary}} colonizer of the {{developing}} “sterile” tissue between the leaf sheath and stem of sugar cane. The honeydew secreted by the <b>mealybugs</b> is acidic (about pH 3) and supports an atypical epiphytic microbiota dominated by acetobacter-like bacteria and acidophilic yeast species. However, Erwinia and Leuconostoc species predominate within the leaf sheath pocket region when the <b>mealybugs</b> die out. The unidentified acetobacters were readily isolated from S. sacchari throughout its life cycle and from other genera of <b>mealybugs</b> on sugar cane and various other plants, both above and below ground. No other insect present on sugar cane was a significant vector of acetic acid bacteria. The major factors restricting microbial diversity within the environs of <b>mealybugs</b> {{were considered to be}} yeast activity along with bacterial production of acetic acid, ketogluconic acids, and gamma-pyrones, in association with their lowering of pH. The microbial products may aid in suppressing the attack by the parasitic mold Aspergillus parasiticus on <b>mealybugs</b> but could act as attractants for the predatory fruit fly Cacoxenus perspicax...|$|R

2500|$|Mealybugs {{are sexually}} dimorphic. The adult female citrus <b>mealybug</b> is about [...] long with a white, brownish, or pink body covered in white wax. The {{edges of the}} body are lined with waxy filaments. It has a light gray {{longitudinal}} line down its back. Its legs and antennae are brown. The adult female lacks wings and resembles a nymph. The adult male is slightly larger, has long wax filaments on the posterior end of the body, and has functional wings. In flight the male resembles a gnat.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} {{have formed a}} relationship with an invasive <b>mealybug,</b> Phenacoccus solenopsis. Colony growth is known to increase if ants have access to resources produced by P. solenopsis, and the population density of these mealybugs is significantly higher in areas where red imported fire ants are present (the spread of P. solenopsis in areas it is not native is attributed {{to the presence of}} the ants). As well as that, the life expectancy and reproductive rate of P. solenopsis both increase. These mealybugs may even be transported by workers back to their nest. Predation of P. solenopsis decreases due to tending workers interfering with the predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Mealybugs are preyed on by the lady beetle (Menochilus sexmaculatus) and are hosts of two parasites (Aenasius bambawalei and Acerophagus coccois) if there are no ants present, but this is different if ants are present. Lady beetles are less frequently seen on plants with red imported fire ants, and the rate of [...] "mummy" [...] nymphs is significantly lower. This is clearly evident as scientists observed that cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) populations, and the predation of sentinel bollworm eggs, increased in areas with red imported fire ant presence. Red imported fire ants have developed a mutual relationship with another <b>mealybug</b> (Dysmicoccus morrisoni). The ants promote the colony growth of D. morrisoni through protection, covering the colonies up with debris and collecting the honeydew they secrete.|$|E
2500|$|The citrus <b>mealybug</b> {{can live}} [...] "on almost any {{flowering}} plant". It {{is considered a}} citrus pest with a preference for grapefruit, {{but it has been}} found on plants from almost 70 families. It is found on fruit, vegetable, and other food crops, including pineapple, sugar-apple, coconut, muskmelon, yam, figs, strawberry, sweet potato, mangoes, bananas, avocado, date palm, common guava, pomegranate, common pear, apple, eggplant, cacao tree, and soybean. It infests ornamental plants, including indoor plants, and it is common in greenhouses. It is found on Amaryllis, Begonia, Bougainvillea, Canna, Cyclamen, Impatiens, Narcissus, Nicotiana, cacti, coleus, croton, sedges, dahlias, spurges, gardenias, roses, and tulips.|$|E
50|$|Male obscure <b>mealybugs</b> do not feed, {{and have}} very short lifespans (2-3 days); males will spin cocoons shortly after hatching, where they develop wings. Upon {{emerging}} from their cocoons, male obscure <b>mealybugs</b> will fly toward {{the scent of}} the female's sex pheromone, mate as many times as possible, then die. Given the male's short lifespan, the timing of the female's emission of sex pheromone is crucial; females will emit the pheromone day and night around the time of male emergence (especially in the spring), then cease immediately after fertilization. Obscure <b>mealybugs</b> generally mate at dusk and at dawn.|$|R
50|$|The {{most serious}} pests are <b>mealybugs</b> that feed on citrus; other species damage sugarcane, grapes, {{pineapple}} (Jahn et al. 2003), coffee trees, cassava, ferns, cacti, gardenias, papaya, mulberry, sunflower and orchids. <b>Mealybugs</b> only {{tend to be}} serious pests {{in the presence of}} ants because the ants protect them from predators and parasites. <b>Mealybugs</b> also infest some species of carnivorous plant such as Sarracenia (pitcher plants); in such cases it is difficult to eradicate them without repeated applications of insecticide such as diazinon. Small infestations may not inflict significant damage. In larger amounts though, they can induce leaf drop.|$|R

The most distinctive feature of the obscure <b>mealybug</b> is the set of two to four exceptionally long caudal filaments growing from the posterior of large nymphs and adult females.

40|$|Species of {{the genus}} Acropyga are rarely {{encountered}} subterranean ants that rely on mealy-bugs or aphids to provide their nutritional needs. Female Acropyga (Formicinae) alates of pantropical and Mediterranean species carry <b>mealybugs</b> with their mandibles while swarming and probably inoculate their new nests with these <b>mealybugs.</b> The natural history of Acropyga and other mealybug-tending ant species, {{a summary of the}} various reports of Acropyga females toting <b>mealybugs,</b> and a new record from French Guiana are presented here.
