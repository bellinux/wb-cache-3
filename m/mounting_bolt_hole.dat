The cracked section will be repaired by welding to restore its function. The {{purpose of this}} research is to evaluate the effect of post weld heat treatment (PWHT) on ductility, grain size, and shear strength of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V plates (0. 063 in. thickness) welded by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) using commercial purity (CP) titanium wire electrode (AMS 4951 H). The weld quality was evaluated by non-destructive and destructive tests, using the acceptance criteria of AWS D 17. 1 and AWS B 2. 1 as references. The effect of PWHT was examined by preparing two weld specimens: with and without PWHT at 620 oC. Non-destructive inspection by dye penetrant and x-ray radiography tests revealed that the weld in these two specimens is free from surface and internal defects. Weld specimen without PWHT is brittle and failed during fillet break test, whereas PWHT specimen is ductile and pass the same test. Metallography observation was conducted to measured grain size of base metal and heat affected zone (HAZ). The average grain size of PWHT specimen is 18. 40 m on base metal and 36. 80 m on HAZ, and for non-PWHT specimen is 26. 85 m on base metal and 52. 10 m on HAZ. Using Hall-Petch approach, the yield strength is calculated about 920 MPa on the base metal of PWHT specimen, which result in the shear strength of about 531 MPa. Under static loading, the shear stress on the outer surface of exhaust cone due to exhaust gas is about 38 MPa, whic...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{construction}} field, the bolting robot provides convenience and reduces a process time of assembling steel frames. When assembling steel frames, the bolting robot finds a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> {{with the help}} of camera. If the light conditions are either too bright or too dark, however, it is hard to find a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> in the input image because the contrast between <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> and background is vague. In order to improve detection accuracy in such environment, this paper proposes the image processing algorithm using template matching (TM). First, the input image is converted from RGB to YCbCr in order to reduce influence of shadow. Then we separate Y channel of image in darkness or extract edges from Cb and Cr channel of image in brightness. Template image is created with the radius which can be calculated with the distance to a steel frame. We used TM to create the normalized cross correlation (NCC) image which shows correlation between processed image and template. Finally, <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> are extracted from the high-correlation part of NCC image. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to detect <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> under various illumination conditions...|$|R
