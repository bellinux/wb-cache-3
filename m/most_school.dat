The dispersement did not follow the new Basic Education Fair Funding formula which had been established by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in June 2015.

500|$|Although [...] the Faroese {{language}} is {{designated as the}} country's principal language, the Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands states that the Danish language [...] "is to be learnt well and carefully". Up to ninth grade, <b>most</b> <b>school</b> material is in Faroese; there are Danish classes since third grade. In upper secondary education this pattern is reversed; courses are taught in Danish, except the Faroese language courses. The Faroese {{language is}} taught 64 hours per week, overall, throughout compulsory education, while Danish is taught 29 hours per week; exams in both languages are equal in length. English language courses start from 4th grade and they are taught for 60 hours annually at that grade, 90 hours in 5th grade, 120 hours in 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th grade; pupils who chose to take the 10th grade {{have the option to}} get another 120 hours of English lessons.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, the AVJUHSD {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} California Proposition13, which placed a cap on county real estate taxes. The proposition limited property tax assessments to the 1975 standard, eliminating $7 billion of the $11.4 billion in property tax revenue collected each year. According to the Washington Post, the [...] "severe" [...] limitations this imposed on state funding forced local governments and <b>most</b> <b>school</b> districts in California to make [...] "drastic cutbacks". Furthermore, {{an article in the}} Los Angeles Times noted that Federal aid money for Californian schools, worth about $98 million each year, may be reduced if state-funded programs are cut. A recent Congressional report had found that Proposition 13 would not result in any major [...] "local spending" [...] cuts. In order to receive Federal aid, the state needed to maintain present levels of spending on local programs or secure local matching funds. However, the enforcement of this spending was [...] "flexible in many programs" [...] and the Federal Impact Aid program for schools was therefore in jeopardy.|$|E
500|$|Zahorchak {{served as}} acting {{education}} secretary from August 2004, when Phillips left the position, to September 2004, when Francis Barnes was hired. During the Barnes administration, Governor Ed Rendell encouraged local Pennsylvania school boards {{to participate in}} Act 72, a state property tax-relief program. Act 72 used proceeds from slot-machine gambling to finance property tax cuts from homeowners, and included with spending restrictions {{in exchange for the}} tax cuts. Barnes himself did not support the program, and <b>most</b> <b>school</b> boards rejected it because of the spending restrictions. Zahorchak, however voiced support for Act 72 and helped Rendell lobby local school districts to support it, which increased his visibility statewide. Zahorchak claimed Act 72 [...] "includes real property tax relief that shifts more of the responsibility for school funding back to the state". When Barnes resigned in September 2005, Zahorchak was again tapped to serve as acting secretary and was widely considered the most qualified candidate for the permanent position, although Governor Ed Rendell engaged in a thorough search for other potential candidates around the state.|$|E
