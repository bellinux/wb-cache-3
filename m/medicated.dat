40|$|This study uses {{secondary}} {{data analysis}} of random digit dialed telephone interviews with 1, 080 Black, Latino, and White parents living in two South Florida counties {{to test the}} predictive and mediating effects of parents’ religiosity in their willingness to <b>medicate</b> children with psychotropics for behavioral and emotional problems. Ordinary least squares multivariate regression {{was used to test}} if frequency of religious service attendance and congregational membership were associated with parents’ willingness to <b>medicate</b> children, and if these associations were moderated by parents’ race/ethnicity. A path analysis was used to test if congregational comfort mediated the association between parents’ race/ethnicity and their willingness to <b>medicate</b> children. Perceived benefits of psychotropics, perceived treatment stigma, and child’s use of psychotropics were entered as control variables in the analysis. Frequency of religious service attendance was not significantly associated with parents’ willingness to <b>medicate</b> children, and congregational comfort did not mediate the association between race/ethnicity and willingness to <b>medicate</b> children. Parents who have a congregation {{were significantly more likely to}} <b>medicate</b> their children compared to parents who do not have a congregation, but the association was not moderated by race/ethnicity. The findings provide some evidence for how congregations may influence parents with respect to mental health treatment willingness for children. Implications for the study of religiosity with respect to mental health, and its associated challenges, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This article {{sets forth}} two {{arguments}} why {{states should be}} prohibited from forcibly <b>medicating</b> mentally ill inmates {{in order to achieve}} competency for execution. First, the state does not have an important governmental interest in executing an individual who cannot be constitutionally executed. Second, such forcible medication violates the Eighth Amendment because it is left purely to chance whether antipsychotic medication will restore a mentally ill inmate to competency. In order to place the involuntary medication of death row inmates within the larger context of forcibly <b>medicating</b> mentally ill individuals, this article begins by addressing the state’s interest in forcibly <b>medicating</b> inmates and criminal defendants, as well as the legal standards that must be met in order to do so. It then examines the U. S. Supreme Court’s prohibition on the execution of the insane, and the competency standard that has developed as a result. This article then presents two arguments that defense counsel should make when the state wishes to forcibly <b>medicate</b> a mentally ill death row inmate in order to restore competency for execution...|$|R

25|$|The {{question}} of whether the drug could be administered involuntarily was the subject of several other hearings.

25|$|Cable cars rapidly {{spread to}} other cities, {{although}} the major attraction for most was the ability to displace horsecar (or mule-drawn) systems rather than the ability to climb hills.

The Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, supported Corby serving her time in Australia. Corby has been <b>medicated</b> for both depression and bouts of psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Fifty-eight {{days after}} the Langley bombing, Carrie has been {{reinstated}} to the CIA and answers questioning by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. During her testimony, she states that Brody {{had nothing to do}} with the attack. Information is leaked to the public about her previous immunity deal with Brody, as well as her sexual relationship with him. Saul acknowledges Carrie's bipolar disorder when he appears before the committee. In retaliation, Carrie leaks classified information to a reporter, leading Saul to have her temporarily committed to a mental hospital. She appears before a hospital committee to ask for her release, which her father and sister attend. When they tell her to begin taking lithium again, she flies into a rage and has to be forcibly <b>medicated</b> and restrained. She is then formally committed.|$|E
25|$|People may be {{admitted}} voluntarily if the treating doctor considers that safety isn't compromised by this less restrictive option. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those {{thought to have}} a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open. Some wards are mixed-sex whilst same-sex wards are increasingly favored to protect women inpatients. Once {{in the care of}} a hospital, people are assessed, monitored, and often given medication and care from a multidisciplinary team, which may include physicians, pharmacists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatric social workers, occupational therapists and social workers. If a person receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital is assessed as at particular risk of harming themselves or others, they may be put on constant or intermittent one-to-one supervision, and may be physically restrained or <b>medicated.</b> People on inpatient wards may be allowed leave for periods of time, either accompanied or on their own.|$|E

25|$|In Washington v. Harper, the {{individual}} protesting the involuntary medication was already incarcerated. The Court suggested {{in this case}} that a competent person has the right to refuse if the medication is administered for other than treatment reasons to a person not dangerous or extremely ill, but it accepted the institution's procedures for making such treatment decisions. However, Riggins was not convicted {{at the time he was}} involuntarily <b>medicated.</b> In Riggins v. Nevada, the Court said that not only had the medication to be a medically appropriate means of attaining an important state objective such as competency, but the medication must be the least intrusive means of attaining the objective. However, although the treatment must be the least intrusive (for example, to allow {{the individual}} to retain a clear head to consult with his attorney as well as to avoid medication side effects), the court did not say that involuntary medication is never appropriate to achieve the state's goal.|$|E
25|$|Milošević {{resigned}} the Yugoslav presidency amid demonstrations, {{following the}} disputed presidential election of 24 September 2000. He {{was arrested by}} Yugoslav federal authorities on 31 March 2001 on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The initial investigation into Milošević faltered for lack of evidence, prompting the Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić to extradite him to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to stand trial for charges of war crimes instead. At {{the outset of the}} trial Milošević denounced the Tribunal as illegal because it had not been established with the consent of the United Nations General Assembly; therefore he refused to appoint counsel for his defence. Milošević conducted his own defence in the five-year-long trial, which ended without a verdict when he died in his prison cell in The Hague on 11 March 2006. Milošević, who suffered from heart ailments and hypertension, died of a heart attack. The Tribunal denied any responsibility for Milošević's death, and stated that he had refused to take prescribed medicines and <b>medicated</b> himself instead.|$|E
25|$|After a short {{residence}} in London, Lucas proceeded {{to the continent}} {{for the purpose of}} studying medicine. At Paris he studied under Petit, and after visiting Rheims proceeded to Leyden, where he graduated M.D. on 20 December 1752. The title of his thesis was De Gangrena et Sphacelo, written in Latin. Не then visited Spa, Aachen, and other baths for the purpose of investigating the composition of their mineral waters. He returned to England in 1753, proceeding to Bath, and after a series of elaborate experiments conducted in public he went to London, where he established himself in practice. In 1756 he published An Essay on Waters. In three Parts: (i) of Simple Waters, (ii) of Cold <b>Medicated</b> Waters, (iii) of Natural Baths. This treatise, reviewed by Dr. Johnson, gave great offence to the faculty at Bath, and having occasion to visit that place in 1757 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy with the heads of the profession there owing to their refusal to consult with him. But the book obtained for him considerable reputation, and enabled him, it is improbably said, to make an annual income of £3,000 by his profession. On 25 June 1759 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and he established a successful practice in London.|$|E

25|$|Austin {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on WWE programming in a year at WrestleMania 21 where he was confronted by Roddy Piper in Piper's Pit, until Carlito interrupted to insult both. This resulted in Carlito receiving a stunner from Austin and Piper throwing {{him out of the}} ring. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a Stone Cold Stunner as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at ECW One Night Stand in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff. He returned at Raw Homecoming, delivering Stone Cold Stunners to Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, Stephanie McMahon and Linda McMahon. An angle including Jim Ross being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday, with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job had Austin won and Austin losing his own job had he lost. Austin hurt his back prior to the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily <b>medicated,</b> so the match was cancelled. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on Raw that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. Batista substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with Vader and Goldust. The stipulation was dropped due to Austin not competing.|$|E
25|$|Freddie worries over Effy's {{psychological}} {{state in}} his centric episode, {{as she is}} developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate. JJ's episode sees him {{fall in love with}} a single mother called Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he really needed to be so highly <b>medicated</b> his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists Dr Foster cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in freeze-frame leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.|$|E
