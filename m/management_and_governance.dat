25|$|The {{community}} of Benedictine nuns at Black Ladies was very small. At dissolution in 1538, {{there were only}} three nuns and the prioress to receive pensions. A canonical visitation in 1521 had also found only four nuns living in the priory. It seems that the community never numbered more than a handful. They were, however, supported by a number of lay servants and officials. A chaplain and seven other employees had to be paid off at the dissolution. As well as the financial problems associated with small and scattered endowments, the community seems to have struggled with <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Hexter's contribution, puckishly titled [...] "The Storm {{over the}} Gentry" [...] and {{originally}} published in a popular magazine, contends that both theses are undermined by their authors' social determinism which causes them to overlook the ordinary business of the House of Commons. [...] Hexter maintained that the overlooked group, the rural magnates, the wealthier of the country gentry, wielded the most influence in the House of Commons and had brought no real interest in revolution. [...] To the contrary, their experience was in practical <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance,</b> {{and for the most}} part they did not act out of simple self-interest.

This editorial provides {{an introduction to the}} special issue of the journal on “Risk <b>Management,</b> Corporate <b>Governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>Management</b> Accounting”. It argues that, like management accounting, the potential of risk <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> concepts to be made managerially actionable rests on their capacity to be interpreted in technical, analytical and calculable terms. It is these dimensions also which lend risk <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> concerns prescriptive appeal that is continually being reassessed in the light of economic changes. The argument is further made that enterprises seek not only to adopt risk controls but also to make the deployment of such controls transparent and visible to engender greater organisational legitimacy.
