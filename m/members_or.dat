5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs.

The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop <b>members</b> <b>or</b> followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
5|$|Many {{art objects}} were {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family <b>members</b> <b>or</b> wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E
