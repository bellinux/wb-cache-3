The site of charge substitution in the octahedral layer {{or in the}} tetrahedral ayer affects the band frequencies also. Band displacements are the same in di-and trioctahedral micas when charge increases in the tetrahedral ayer. Substitution of ions of the same charge in the tetrahedral site does not change vibration frequencies {{as a function of}} the electronegativity of the ion substituted but there is a correlation between unit cell size and frequency shift. This is attributed to hydrogen-oxygen repulsion between ions in octahedral and tetrahedral ayers. Electronic configuration of the ions bonded and involved in the bonding of the oxygen of the OH units seems to be the major factor in determining the OH-stretch band frequency...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study was}} to compare the changes in soil minerals and the consequences on K+ release. Soil samples (depth of 0 – 10 cm) were collected over eleven years from areas with and without K fertilization and from a nearby natural grassy vegetation site on the Campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria. The K fertilizer treatments were 0 kg ha- 1 year- 1 of K 2 O (K 0) and 90 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O year- 1 of K 2 O (K 90). The total K+, non exchangeable K+ and exchangeable K+ were determined in the soil samples. Feldspats, illite and interstratified illite-smetite minerals were identified in X ray diagrams of Ca 2 +-saturated soil and clay fractions. The K 90 treatment appeared to preserve the illite and illite-smectite interstratified minerals in the clay fraction.

Therefore processes to obtain K-nutrient sources from sea bittern {{were developed by}} our Institute. The present investigation evaluated the fertilizer potential of three different sea bittern-derived (SBD) potassium forms developed viz., potassium schoenite, potassium nitrate and potassium ammonium sulfate on maize productivity in two cropping seasons. Methods: The pot and field experiments consisted of four treatments, wherein the three K forms were applied at the recommended rate of 40 kg K 2 O ha− 1 and were compared with commercially used sulfate of potash. The effect of these fertilizers on different parameters of plant and soil were evaluated. Results: The application of SBD-potassic fertilizers led to enhancement in growth, productivity and quality of maize which related well with higher photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and soil quality parameters. On an average all the three forms of sea bittern-derived potash enhanced yield of maize over control by 22. 3 and 23. 8 %, respectively, in pot and field trials. The best performance was under SBD-KNO 3, which also recorded the highest benefit: cost ratio of 1. 76. Conclusion: The K-fertilizers derived from sea-bittern—a waste product of salt industry—can thus be economically used to improve crop production sustainably...|$|R

Other than sugar, products derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, cachaça (a traditional spirit from Brazil), bagasse, and ethanol. Several workers throughout the world have characterized these bio-resources {{from the point of}} their utilization in agriculture, and reported that these bio-resources could be used in agriculture for improving the soil fertility and productivity, growth, and yield of crops. Under the present trend of exploitative agriculture, inherent soil fertility can no longer be maintained on a sustainable basis. The nutrient supplying capacity of soil declines steadily under continuous and intensive cropping (Shukla et al. 2016). The use of optimum levels of N, P, and K has failed to maintain yield levels, probably due to increasing secondary and micronutrient deficiencies and also unfavorable alterations in the physical and chemical properties of soil. Apart from the fertility and productivity issues, the use of chemical fertilizers is also becoming increasingly difficult due to their high costs and scarcity during peak season. Alternative means of providing nutrients needs to be explored. In this context, the utilization of by-products and industries wastes serves as sources of macro-, secondary, and micro-nutrients. Sugarcane is a heavy feeder; it required higher amount of nitrogenous, phosphatic, and <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> for a better healthy crop. For healthier food products, people using organic fertilizer are heaving negligible amount of chemical fertilizers. It is gaining more attention, nowadays, than chemical fertilizers. It enhanced the soil organic matter and supply plant nutrient in a long way, by the significant improvement in soil physio-chemical properties.|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the response of first and second sugarcane ratoon cultivated in conservative management system, the potassium levels, in Red-yellow latosol (Hapludox) (LVAD) and Red-yellow Argisol Eutrophic (PVAe). Two experiments, one in LVAD (variety SP 81 - 3250) and another in PVAe (variety RB 855453) were developed. The treatments consisted of doses of 32, 5; 65; 130 and 195 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O, {{in the form of}} potassium chloride, besides the control (without <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizer),</b> arranged in a randomized block design with five replications. The plots that received the treatments in the first ratoon were once again treated with the same doses in the second ratoon. The plots that received the treatments in the first ratoon were once again treated with the same doses in the second ratoon. Were applied 100 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen in the form of urea and 30 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 in the form of triple superphosphate. The fertilizers were applied {{to the side of the}} line of ratoon from sugarcane, without incorporation in each year of cultivation. Were evaluated the biometric variables (height, tiller number and diameter); potassium contents in soil, straw and plant, production and quality of the culms in two seasons (2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012). Potassium fertilization resulted in higher contents of nutrients in the soil and the plant, reflecting gains in the production of culms, both the first as the second sugarcane ratoon in both soils evaluated.

Additional geological material, beach sands (n = 30) and outcrop rock samples (n = 28) was collected from Carriacou, Petite Martinique, Grenada, and Barbados for comparison. Thin sections inade from the sherd, and geological samples (n = 138) were stained for calcium and potassium feldspar recognition. Selected representative samples (sherds n = 36, sands n = 9, and rocks n = 2) were point-counted using the Gazzi-Dickinson method with maximum counts of 300 grains (temper/sand) per thin section. Matrix, porosity, and cement categories were tallied separately. The percentage of temper in the sherd samples ranges from 16 - 41 %. Petrographic analysis of the sherd samples reveals at least four temper groups: Igneous (n = 69), Placer (n = 3), Potassic Volcanic (n = 5), and Quartzose (n = 1) based upon composition and texture. Group 1 (Igneous) temper shows a continuum from more feldspathic-rich (QFL%Q = ~ 80 %) to more volcanic lithic-rich (QFL%Q = ~ 40 %) end members. Major components include plagioclase, opaque minerals, pyroxene, and volcanic lithic fragments exhibiting microlitic and lathwork textures.

40|$|The {{virulence}} of 300 monosporous field isolates of Ophiobolus graminis {{was compared}} on wheat. All were strongly pathogenic when first Isolated, but some became weakly pathogenic when maintained in culture. Symptom expression was studied in wheat infected {{with one of}} the isolates. Infections affected root length and numbers, plant height, fresh weight, had development and yield. : The so-called empty "deadhead" was only one of several head symptoms which ranged from complete suppression to empty and poorly-filled heads. Overall symptoms were increased in severity by reducing light intensity, days length and soil moisture; by restricting root development, and by earlier inoculations. Symptoms were also influenced by temperature in the test range 20 - 28 C, being more severe at the lower temperatures when plants were inoculated within eight weeks of seeding. Lower temperatures and shorter day lengths also retarded plant maturity, thus indirectly increasing severity of final symptoms. Symptom expression was unaffected by nitrogenous, phosphatic, <b>potassic</b> and complete <b>fertilizers,</b> although nitrogenous dressings increased yield. Symptoms caused by the isolate in wheat were compared with those by Fusarium graminearum, HeIminthosporium sativum and Pythium ultimum under spring glasshouse conditions. Swelling of root tips was caused by P. ultimum and root discolouration by the remainder, but only O. graminis significantly reduced plant height, fresh weight, numbers of functional roots and yield. Nuclear distribution in hyphae of the isolate was compared with that of Curvularia ramosa, C. spicifera, Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, Helminthosporium sativum and Wojnowicia graminis. Tip cells of O. graminis were predominantly uni-nucleate whilst those of other fungi were generally multi-nucleate. When opposed to other fungi in culture, O. graminis was slightly antagonistic towards Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum. Helminthosporium satiyum and Wojnowicia graminis, whereas Pythium ultimum exhibited antagonism towards O. graminis. The combination of O. graminis with Curyularia ramosa was mutually antagonistic, but no antagonism was evident in combination with either C. spicifera or Fusarium graminearum. The saprophytic survival of the isolate was examined on artificially-infected wheat straw buried in unsterilized soil. Survival was prolonged by nitrogenous soil amendments, unaffected. by superphosphate dressings and reduced by growing various plant species over infected straw. O. graminis was isolated from all species, including dicotyledons, sown over straw. Three methods for estimating survival on various hosts were compared, viz., those involving artificially-infected straws previously sterilized by either propylene oxide or autoclaving and inverted sods of infected hosts. The use of sods was the most satisfactory and indicated O. graminis survived better on barley than wheat if inoculated at seeding and inverted after four weeks. Delaying inversion further increased survival on barley but not on wheat. Survival was also increased by increasing plant density, the effect being relatively greater with barley than wheat. However, survival was greater on wheat than barley when inoculation was delayed until eight weeks after seeding. O. graminis also survived better on Lolium perenne, Bromus mollis and B. sterilis than on Avena fatua and Vulpia myuros; and on Bromus gussonii and Hordeum hystrix than on PhalarIs minor, Avena sterilis, Ehrharta erecta and linseed when inoculated at seeding and inverted eight weeks later.

The Yao'an monzonite and quartz monzonite porphyry intrusions are alkaline and potassic with high K₂O/ Na₂O ratios (1. 1 - 1. 5). They have Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes similar to coeval lamprophyres and {{are characterized by}} uniform zircon ℇHf (- 6. 4 to - 8. 7) and δ¹⁸O values (6. 6 - 7. 0 ‰). They are interpreted as products of fractional crystallization of lamprophyre-like potassic mafic magma derived from ancient metasomatized lithospheric mantle, a scenario similar to the mid-Cretaceous postcollisonal Scheelite Dome gold system in Yukon, Canada. The Machangqing granitic intrusions are high K calc-alkaline and show high Sr, Sr/Y, and La/Yb, but low Y and Yb geochemical signatures. They have Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions similar to amphibolite xenoliths hosted by potassic felsic intrusions in western Yunnan. The zircon ℇHf values of the Machangqing granitic intrusions are positive (0. 3 - 4. 7), and the zircon-depleted Hf mantle model ages are 1. 1 to 0. 8 Ga. They also have mantle-like zircon δ¹⁸O values (5. 5 - 6. 4 ‰). The Machangqing granites were most likely derived from partial melting of Neoproterozoic lower crust. The Beiya granitic intrusions are alkaline, with high K₂O/ Na₂O (1. 9 - 2. 7), Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios, high Sr contents, and low Y and Yb contents. They contain abundant zircon inheritance and have variable magmatic zircon ℇHf (- 4 to + 4) and the highest magmatic zircon δ¹⁸O values (6. 6 - 7. 8 ‰). The Beiya felsic intrusions are interpreted {{to be derived from}} partial melting of a K-rich mafic source mixed with a metasedimentary component. The Eocene-Oligocene intracontinental potassic intrusions and associated mineralization in western Yunnan are located proximal to the Mesozoic Jinsha suture, suggesting that this Mesozoic lithospheric boundary may have provided a first-order control on localization of Cenozoic <b>mineral</b> systems. These <b>potassic</b> felsic intrusions are coeval with regional potassic mafic magmatism in western Yunnan and were emplaced between 37 to 33 Ma, after the collision between India and Asia at ca. 60 to 55 Ma. It is therefore postulated that continental collision may have preferentially thickened the continental lithospheric mantle (CLM) adjacent to the Jinsha suture, in which overthickened lower continental lithospheric mantle was subsequently removed during 37 to 33 Ma, inducing melting of residual metasomatized lithospheric mantle as well as lower crust. The gold-rich Yao'an and Beiya intrusions are alkaline and potassic, characterized by high zircon δ¹⁸O values (> 6. 5 ‰), which is consistent with supracrustal contributions. In contrast, the Cu-Mo-rich Machangqing intrusions are high K calc-alkaline with mantle-like zircon δ¹⁸O values (< 6. 5 ‰) and juvenile ℇHf signatures, indicating negligible supracrustal recycling. Empirically, source compositions {{played an important role in}} determing the metal endowment among intrusions formed under the same tectonic setting with similar ages in western Yunnan. In western Yunnan, gold tends to be associated with alkaline and potassic melts with a supracrustal contribution, whereas Cu-Mo mineralization seems to be more related with juvenile crustal sources with little supracrustal influence. 36 page(s...|$|R
