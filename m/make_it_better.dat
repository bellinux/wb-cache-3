5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better</b> suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E

25|$|During the 1660s, Shrew {{was adapted}} by John Lacy as Sauny the Scot, to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better</b> match with Fletcher's sequel. Originally {{performed}} under the Taming of the Shrew title, {{the play was}} published in 1698 as Sauny the Scot: or, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comedy. This version inconsistently anglicised the character names and recast the play in prose. Lacy also expanded the part of Grumio into the title role Sauny (who speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue), which he played himself. Sauny is an irreverent, cynical companion to Petruchio, and is comically terrified of his master's new bride. Lucentio was renamed Winlove, Baptista became Lord Beaufoy and Katherina was renamed Meg. In Sauny, Petruchio is much more vicious, threatening to whip Meg if she doesn't marry him, then telling everyone she is dead, and tying her to a bier. The play ends with her thoroughly tamed. Lacy's work premiered at Drury Lane in 1667, starring Susanna Verbruggen and George Powell. Samuel Pepys saw it on 9 April and again on 1 November, enjoying it on both occasions. The play was popular enough that it was still being performed as late as 1732, when it was staged at Goodman's Fields Theatre, {{and it seems to}} have supplanted Shrews place on the English stage {{for the rest of the}} seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks about {{worshiping}} cunnilingus, with Madonna comparing oral sex to holy water, and {{as noted by}} Billboard [...] Vanessa Grigoriadis, it was named after her lifelong obsessions, since it features [...] "church-baiting innuendos," [...] "juxtaposing Christian imagery with frank sexuality". During the spoken chorus, she sings: [...] "Kiss it better, kiss it better/ <b>Make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better,</b> make it wetter", and later she speaks, [...] "If you like it please confess / Bless yourself and genuflect". In the hook, she claims: [...] "Don't it taste like holy water?", before clarifying: [...] "Yeezus loves my pussy best". Adam R. Holz of Plugged In noted that the song [...] "finds Madonna returning to her longstanding habit of sexing up spiritual imagery".|$|E

500|$|SFX Magazine Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Beast Below" [...] {{four out}} of five stars, calling it [...] "immensely satisfying". He {{particularly}} praised the two lead performances and Amy's characterisation as companion, as well as the writing and dialogue. Dan Martin, also of The Guardian, praised the story for testing the characters' relationships rather than being just a visit to the Starship UK to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better,</b> though he commented that the [...] "anti-vivisection message" [...] seemed to be lost along the way. He praised the way the Doctor was portrayed in terms of his more inhumane instincts in contrast to the Tenth Doctor and rated the episode as [...] "{{four out of}} five". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern said that the episode [...] "neither moved [...] to wave a Save the Starwhale banner nor reach for the nearest harpoon" [...] and made him feel [...] "out of the loop" [...] as it seemed more directed at children than adults. However, he praised the acting of Smith, Gillan, and Sophie Okonedo, as well as the creation of the Smilers.|$|E

[...] Giving the episode a B+, Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict described the episode as having [...] "nicely gooey family moments." [...] She called the [...] "gay pride parade's 'Salute to Safer Sex' float" [...] the episode's [...] "highlight". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com gave the episode a positive review as well, calling it [...] "a welcome {{return to a}} more old school Simpsons storytelling style, capable of being both comical, and, in its own bizarro way, touching." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "While Season 13 doesn’t threaten to approach the high standards of the series’ strongest years, episodes like “Shut” help <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better</b> than expected. Sure, it follows fairly predictable patterns, but it develops them in a satisfying comedic manner." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the episode's overall [...] "entertaining," [...] even though its ending [...] "falters." ...|$|E

500|$|Linkin Park had professed {{that they}} have been fans of James Jean's art for a while, {{describing}} discussions between the band and Jean as having [...] "started naturally". Joe Hahn served as a creative director for the artwork of The Hunting Party, instructing Jean to [...] "create a universe inhabited by powerful characters and defined by strange landscapes", with a general concept of having a unique [...] "character" [...] for each track on the album. Delson also contributed ideas of [...] "internal and external struggles", metaphorically depicted on a battlefield, where images such as [...] "flesh tearing and transforming into different forms and brittle shards of crystal erupting from organic matter" [...] would recur. Shinoda explained: [...] "We try to approach our art—packaging, merchandise, tour visuals, videos, anything—in a holistic way. All the parts are interconnected, and by creating great imagery {{that can be used in}} multiple contexts, we can immerse the fans in a universe that is consistent and unique to each release.

500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx brimmed with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can I <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better</b> with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. [...] "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.|$|E
