40|$|This paper presents, entirely {{within the}} scope of the GUM Supplement 1, a {{rigorous}} treatment of the comparison loss in the <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> calibration problem. The treatment is made for especially selected cases with feasible uncertainty values for the instruments. The resulting modelling function, without any simplification, is treated with the GUM Supplement 1 proposed propagation of distributions approach and with the law of propagation of uncertainties approach. Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs), performed with one billion trials, make possible a precise determination of the output statistical values. As expected for actual physical problems, output PDFs are continuous for all cases with meaningful physical parameters. Results show that the estimates provided by the law of propagation of uncertainties are shifted by a positive amount in relation to the estimates provided by MCS. The standard uncertainty values obtained with the law of propagation of uncertainties with terms up to second order are coincident with the values provided by MCS within 3 parts in 105. The law of distribution of uncertainties is not validated for the treatment of this problem...|$|E

50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} <b>power</b> at <b>microwave</b> frequencies. In this application, a resistive element is exposed to <b>microwave</b> <b>power.</b> A dc bias current is applied to the resistor to raise its temperature via Joule heating, such that the resistance is matched to the waveguide characteristic impedance. After applying <b>microwave</b> <b>power,</b> the bias current is reduced to return the bolometer to its resistance in the absence of <b>microwave</b> <b>power.</b> The change in the dc power is then equal to the absorbed <b>microwave</b> <b>power.</b> To reject the effect of ambient temperature changes, the active (measuring) element is in a bridge circuit with an identical element not exposed to microwaves; variations in temperature common to both elements do not affect the accuracy of the reading. The average response time of the bolometer allows convenient measurement of the power of a pulsed source.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{approach}} for {{the measurement of}} microwave frequency in the optical domain with adjustable mea-surement range and resolution. In the proposed approach, two optical wavelengths with a large wavelength spacing are modulated by an unknown microwave signal in a Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM). The optical output from the MZM is sent to a dispersive fiber to introduce different chromatic dispersions, leading to dif-ferent <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> penalties. The two wavelengths are then separated, with the <b>microwave</b> <b>powers</b> measured by two photode-tectors. A fixed relationship between the <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> ratio and the microwave frequency is established. The microwave fre-quency is estimated by measuring the two <b>microwave</b> <b>powers.</b> The frequency measurement range and resolution can be adjusted by tuning the wavelength spacing. Different frequency measurement ranges and resolutions are demonstrated experimentally. Index Terms—Fiber, microwave frequency measurement, mi-crowave photonics, optical microwave signal processing.
