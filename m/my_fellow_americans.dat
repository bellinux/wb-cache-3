5000|$|After OMGUS ended, Clay {{served the}} United States in other capacities. He had {{previous}} experience in 1933 with managing and organizing projects under the New Deal, {{and later became}} one of Dwight Eisenhower's closest advisers, assisting him in securing the 1952 Republican nomination and helping him select members of his cabinet upon ascension to the Presidency. When Eisenhower was in office, Clay served as his unofficial emissary in Europe. One of his first duties as President Eisenhower's emissary, and as the national chairman of the Crusade for Freedom, was to dedicate the city of Berlin's Liberty Bell. [...] In 1954, he was called upon by President Eisenhower to help forge a plan for financing the proposed Interstate highway system. During the Berlin Wall crisis in 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked him to be an adviser and to go to Berlin and report on the situation. Two years later Clay accompanied Kennedy on his trip to Berlin. During his famous Ich bin ein Berliner-speech Kennedy said: [...] "I am proud (...) to come here {{in the company of}} <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>American,</b> General Clay, who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed." ...|$|R

I also have a dream that tomorrow the sun will rise on {{a new generation of}} prosperous young black people will emerge from the shadows that once consumed our future and rise up against the stereotype. We fail to realize that the foundation laid down for us by the great freedom fighters in our past is crumbling right below our feet {{and will continue to do}} so until we see that we are a part of the problem. As a race, we struggle with the concept of our own fight for freedom and equality; and I am not referring to freedom from “the Man” as is usually presumed. I am, however, referring to freedom from the mental blocks that we and society have put in place and that our youth grow up believing. In the year 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. whilst giving his I Have a Dream speech said, “We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. ” These are noble words that seem simple to follow and live by, but yet we fail to do so; and it is not because we are unable, but because we are unwilling. We are willing to accept that we are not good enough to achieve the same goals as the White community due to the color of our skin and while this may not necessarily encompass every racial situation, this is one prominent problem that needs to be addressed. 2 ̆...|$|R
