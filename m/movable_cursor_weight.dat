40|$|Range {{and range}} rate are crucial {{parameters}} {{which must be}} available to the operator during remote controlled orbital docking operations. A method was developed for the estimation of both these parameters using an aided television system. An experiment was performed to determine the human operator's capability to measure displayed image size using a fixed reticle or <b>movable</b> <b>cursor</b> as the television aid. The <b>movable</b> <b>cursor</b> was found to yield mean image size estimation errors on the order of 2. 3 per cent of the correct value. This error rate was significantly lower than that for the fixed reticle. Performance using the <b>movable</b> <b>cursor</b> was found to be less sensitive to signal-to-noise ratio variation than was that for the fixed reticle. The mean image size estimation errors for the <b>movable</b> <b>cursor</b> correspond to an error of approximately 2. 25 per cent in range suggesting that the system has some merit. Determining the accuracy of range rate estimation using a rate controlled cursor will require further experimentation...|$|R
50|$|The Intellivision version {{features}} two gun turrets with a <b>movable</b> <b>cursor</b> {{that can}} be aimed onto enemy ships. There is also a deploy-able ship to take on enemies one-on-one. The game features day, dusk, and night settings, with the night setting limiting visibility to two moving searchlights.|$|R
50|$|MicroAngelo also {{supported}} a light pen, connected through input terminals {{on the top}} of the card. The Screenware software automatically converted the coordinates into the card's coordinates. Screenware also included routines for drawing <b>movable</b> <b>cursors</b> in hardware (as opposed to bit bliting), and the cursor could be made to follow the light pen simply by reading the pen coordinates and feeding them into the cursor.|$|R
40|$|A fully automated, {{interactive}} system {{for determining the}} wavelengths of features in extracted IUE spectra is described. Wavelengths are recorded from video displays of expanded plots of individual orders using a <b>movable</b> <b>cursor,</b> and then corrected for IUE wavelength scale errors. The estimated accuracy of an individual wavelength in the final tabulation is 0. 050 A. Such lists are ideally suited for line identification work using the method of wavelength coincidence statistics (WCS). The results of WCS studies of the ultraviolet spectra of the chemically peculiar (CP) stars iota Coronae Borealis and kappa Camcri. Aside from confirming a number of previously reported aspects of the abundance patterns in these stars, the searches produced some interesting, new discoveries, notably the presence of Hf in the spectrum of kappa Camcri. The implications of this work for theories designed to account for anomalous abundances in chemically peculiar stars are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{system is}} {{designed}} for manipulation, analysis, interpretation, and processing {{of a wide variety}} of image data. LANDSAT (ERTS) and other data in digital form can be input directly into the system. Photographic prints and transparencies are first converted to digital form with an on-line high-resolution microdensitometer. The system is implemented on a Hewlett-Packard 3000 computer with 128 K bytes of core memory and a 47. 5 megabyte disk. It includes a true color display monitor, with processing memories, graphics overlays, and a <b>movable</b> <b>cursor.</b> Image data formats are flexible so that there is no restriction to a given set of remote sensors. Conversion between data types is available to provide a basis for comparison of the various data. Multispectral data is fully supported, and there is no restriction on the number of dimensions. In this way multispectral data collected at more than one point in time may simply be treated as a data collected with twice (three times, etc.) the number of sensors. There are various libraries of functions available to the user: processing functions, display functions, system functions, and earth resources applications functions...|$|R
25|$|Some {{oscilloscopes}} have cursors, {{which are}} lines {{that can be}} moved about the screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at <b>movable</b> locations. These <b>cursors</b> are more accurate than visual estimates referring to graticule lines.|$|R
500|$|As a {{tactical}} first-person shooter, Terra Nova focuses on combat and takes place from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The protagonist wears powered battle armor (PBA) that features lock-on targeting, jumpjets for limited flight, infrared and zoomed vision, and a rechargeable energy shield that protects against attacks. The player uses a freely <b>movable</b> mouse <b>cursor</b> to aim weapons and manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. As with Looking Glass Technologies' earlier game System Shock, the HUD contains three [...] "Multi-Function Displays" [...] (MFDs). These screens may be configured to display tactical information, such as squad command menus, maps and weapon statistics.|$|R
500|$|System Shock {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The game is set inside a large, multi-level space station, in which players explore, combat enemies and solve puzzles. Progress is largely non-linear {{and the game}} is designed to allow for emergent gameplay. As in , the player uses a freely <b>movable</b> mouse <b>cursor</b> to aim weapons, to interact with objects and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. View and posture controls on the HUD allow the player to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, and crawl. Practical uses for these actions include taking cover, retrieving items from beneath the player character and navigating small passages, respectively. The HUD also features three [...] "Multi-Function Displays", which may be configured to display information such as weapon readouts, an automap and an inventory.|$|R
5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely <b>movable</b> mouse <b>cursor</b> {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|R
5|$|Ultima Underworld is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) {{that takes place}} from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, multi-level dungeon, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a freely <b>movable</b> mouse <b>cursor</b> {{to interact with the}} game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the heads-up display (HUD). Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An automatically filling map, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include looking up and down, jumping, and swimming.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper derives a {{class of}} equalizer-based symbolrate timing {{recovery}} algorithms, which are to be employed in digital subscriber line (DSL) systems. These algorithms are intended to break the coupling of the adaptive decision-directed timing recovery and the baud-spaced equalizer in tracking mode, once acquisition has been reached. As the derivation {{is based on a}} generalized complex-valued system model, the results can be applied for all common DSL systems employing baseband and passband modulation schemes, like PAM, QAM, and CAP. Exemplarily, an algorithm based on the ratio of the largest precursor tap <b>weight</b> and the <b>cursor</b> tap <b>weight</b> is derived for very high data-rate DSL (VDSL) based on QAM transmission. It is shown by means of simulations, that destructive coupling is prevented. A simple modification of the complex-valued equalizer structure with cursor-normalized tap weights allows an easy implementation of the derived timing recovery algorithm. I...|$|R
