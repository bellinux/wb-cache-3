We collected 149 juvenile O. mykiss across 72 sites and identified locations used by anadromous females by assigning maternal origin (anadromous versus non-anadromous) to each juvenile. These assignments used comparisons of strontium to calcium ratios in otolith primordia and freshwater growth regions to indicate maternal origin. We used logistic regression to predict probability of anadromy {{in relation to}} <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> stream <b>runoff</b> using data from a subset of individuals.

Exploring the impact of climate change on the runoff of TP rivers is critical to improve water resources management. However, thorough studies on the runoff response to climate change are seldom conducted on large TP river systems. To complement the current body of work, this study uses two rainfall-runoff models (SIMHYD and GR 4 J) to simulate the monthly and <b>annual</b> <b>runoff</b> across the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) basin in the southeastern TP (i. e., upstream of the Brahmaputra) under historical (1962 - 2002) and future (up to approximately 2030) climate conditions. The future climate series are obtained by using 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) outputs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) to reflect a 1 degrees C increase in the global average surface air temperature. The two rainfall-runoff models successfully simulate the historical runoff for the eight catchments in the YTR basins with median monthly runoff Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSE) of 0. 86 for SIMHYD and 0. 83 for GR 4 J. The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> future precipitation and runoff across the region are projected to increase {{by most of the}} modeling results. The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation changes obtained from the 20 GCMs are - 15 %, 7 % and 16 % for the 10 th percentile, median and 90 th percentile of GCM outputs, respectively, and the corresponding changes in the simulated <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>runoffs</b> are - 24 %, 13 % and 29 % for the SIMHYD model outputs and - 22 %, 11 % and 26 % for the GR 4 J model outputs. The projected increase in the runoff at the median percentile mainly occurs in the middle reaches of the YTR and its two tributaries, the Lhasa River and the Nyangqu River, with a 12 % increase in <b>annual</b> <b>runoff</b> that mainly occurs in the wet season from May to September. The present work is the first comprehensive study on the hydrological response to climate change covering the entire upstream area of the Brahmaputra, and the results found in this study are not only helpful for local water resource management but also for the lower reaches of the Brahmaputra.

The model uses a double exponential equation to represent the rainfall profile and uses the Green-Ampt-Mein-Larson equation to estimate the soil water infiltration rate. To evaluate the model, monthly and yearly rainfall and runoff data were obtained from four experimental plots located at the State University of Santa Catarina, UDESC, in the period from 2003 to 2008. The four treatments were bare soil (BS), conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT).

A GIS-NPS model, with long-term hydrologic impact assessment (L-THIA), was used to evaluate long-term implications of land-use change impacts on non-point source (NPS) pollution. The land-use patterns of 1995 and 2005 were analysed to determine the changes in Lugu Lake watershed.

Advancements in remote sensing which took place {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century have led to the rise of a new research area focused on analyses of land use changes and their impact on hydrological processes. This study deals with an analysis of the changes in land use over a period of almost three centuries in the Myjava River catchment, which has an outlet at Šaštín-Stráže. In order to obtain information about the way the land was used in the past, three historical mappings representing various periods were used: the first (1 st) military mapping (1764 - 1787), second (2 nd) military mapping (1807 - 1869), and a military topographic mapping (1953 - 1957). The historical mappings have been manually vectorised in an ArcGIS environment to identify various land use categories. The historical evolution of land use was further compared with a concurrent land use mapping, which was undertaken in 2010 and exploited remote sensing techniques. The study also quantifies the impact of these changes on the long-term catchment runoff as well as their impact on flows induced by extreme precipitation events. This analysis was performed using the WetSpa distributed hydrological model, which enables the simulation of catchment runoff in a daily time step. The analysis showed that the selected catchment has undergone significant changes in land use, mainly characterized by massive deforestation at the end of the 18 th century and land consolidation in the middle of the 20 th century induced by communist collectivisation.

We modeled the effects of these interventions on surface runoff in the basin for both current and future (2025) basin conditions, using the runoff coefficient method in a spatially explicit approach. Under current conditions, we observed high spatial variability of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>runoff.</b> The northeastern Blue Nile- 1 subbasin produces the highest <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>runoff</b> (391 mm or 10 9 109 m 3), whereas the northwestern Blue Nile- 2 subbasin produces the lowest <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>runoff</b> (178 mm or 0. 2 9 109 m 3). The basin generates a total annual runoff volume of 47. 7 9 109 m 3, of which about 54 % comes from cultivated land. The strong association between land use and topography masked the direct effect of rainfall on runoff. By 2025, total annual runoff yield could decrease by up to 38 % if appropriate basin-wide soil and water conservation interventions and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam are implemented.

In the 1990 s runoff of Tangnaihai Hydrologic Station of the Huanghe River experienced a serious decrease, which had attracted considerable attention. Climate changes have important impact on the water resources availability. From the view of water cycling, runoff coefficients are important indexes of water resources in a particular catchment. Kalinin baseflow separation technique was improved based {{on the characteristics of}} precipitation and strearnflow. After the separation of runoff coefficient (RIP), baseflow coefficient (Br/P) and direct runoff coefficient (Dr/P) were estimated. Statistic analyses were applied to assessing the impact of precipitation and temperature on runoff coefficients (including Dr/P, Br/P and RIP). The results show that in the source regions of the Huanghe River, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> baseflow coefficient was higher than <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> direct <b>runoff</b> coefficient. <b>Annual</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficients were in direct proportion to annual precipitation and in inverse proportion to <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> temperature. The decrease of runoff coefficients in the 1990 s was closely related to the decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature in the same period. Over different sub-basins of the source regions of the Huanghe River, runoff coefficients responded differently to precipitation and temperature. In the area above Jimai Hydrologic Station where <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> temperature is - 3. 9 degrees C, temperature is the main factor influencing the runoff coefficients. Runoff coefficients were in inverse relation to temperature, and precipitation had nearly no impact on runoff coefficients. In subbasin between Jimai and Maqu Hydrologic Station Dr/P was mainly affected by precipitation while RIP and Br/P were both significantly influenced by precipitation and temperature. In the area between Maqu and Tangnaihai hydrologic stations all the three runoff coefficients increased with the rising of annual precipitation, while direct runoff coefficient was inversely proportional to temperature. In the source regions of the Huanghe River with the increase of average annual temperature, the impacts of temperature on runoff coefficients become insignificant...|$|R
