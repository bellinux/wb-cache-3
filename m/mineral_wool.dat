5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E

2500|$|The chamber {{where the}} body is placed is called a retort and is lined with {{heat-resistant}} refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, e.g., <b>mineral</b> <b>wool.</b> Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer.

[...] The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the retort as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss through the top door. The container may be mounted on a charger (motorised trolley) that can quickly insert it, or on a fixed or movable hopper that allows the container to slide into the cremator.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the intense {{activity}} of the building sector has generated large quantities of construction and demolition waste (CDW).

50|$|However, thermal {{resistance}} per unit price {{is much less}} than conventional materials. VIPs {{are more difficult to}} manufacture than polyurethane foams or <b>mineral</b> <b>wools,</b> and strict quality control of manufacture of the membranes and sealing joins is important if a panel is to maintain its vacuum {{over a long period of}} time. Air will gradually enter the panel, and as the pressure of the panel normalizes with its surrounding air its R-value deteriorates. Conventional insulation does not depend on the evacuation of air for its thermal performance, and is therefore not susceptible to this form of deterioration. However, materials like polyurethane foam are susceptible to water absorption and performance degradation as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissolution}} {{of a range}} of glass fibers including commercial glass and <b>mineral</b> <b>wools</b> has been studied using a modification of Gamble's solution in a flow system at pH 7. 4 and 37 °C. Dissolution has been followed by weight loss, effluent analysis, and morphology change of fibers and bulk glass. Flow per glass surface area can strongly affect both dissolution rate and morphology due to the effect of the dissolution process on the fluid. Effluent pH is shown to be a guide for choice of optimum flow/area conditions. These conditions provide measurable concentrations of dissolved glass in the effluent while maintaining their concentrations below the point at which they significantly affect the dissolution process.

30|$|The overall {{waterway}} transport (sea, river, lake) and its organization, combined {{particularly with the}} location of the relating activities, have a strong impact, perhaps more than other modes of transport, in the location patterns of the productive activities and the evolution of spatial organization. Before the great advances in the field of transport, production activities were characterized by dispersion in space, which dominated until about the mid- 19 th century [1]. During this period, key location factor was the existence of raw materials such as <b>minerals,</b> <b>wool,</b> etc., energy resources such as wood, wind, water, etc. and natural ways of communication, such as natural ports, waterways etc. [2]. Although transport has not yet developed largely in conjunction with the physical characteristics of regions, it {{play an important role in}} the location of activities and the distribution of settlements, particularly through the opportunities provided by the waterways and the relevant means [3]. The production units which rely upon specialized local manpower and the needs for the organization of the relevant activities combined with the morphological characteristics of the regions, determined the socioeconomic organization, the every day life, the form of residence, models of exchange and communication [4].|$|R
40|$|Convection {{phenomenon}} {{inside the}} insulation {{materials that are}} representing porous media {{may be responsible for}} important increase of the heat flow density through the building element, when the climatic conditions are very cold. A numerical study based on CFD software simulations is performed in order to find out the conditions for which the convection onsets and furthermore to quantify its influence on the U-value of the building element – that is a loose-fill attic. The geometry of the grid is very close to a 2 D cut in a real attic. The most significant heat transfer phenomena present in the attic – conduction in solid elements, convection in porous medium, convection in air spaces are taken into account. This is done exclusively by using the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations.

40|$|In this {{multidisciplinary}} project lime-hemp is {{studied as}} a {{thermal insulating material}} for the renovation of historic timber and brick buildings*). Focus is on buildings in the historic city of Visby on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic sea. Many historic buildings in Visby have over the past decades been thermally insulated with materials such as <b>mineral</b> <b>wools</b> and polystyrene. Due to this, damage caused by moisture and microbial growth has increased. As a consequence, cultural and historical values have been damaged. Lime-hemp is a sustainable building material that consists of hemp shiv and building limes. It works differently than conventional insulating materials; in addition to good thermal insulation properties, it also has good thermal mass and moisture buffering capacity. This project will study the durability of the lime-hemp, especially microbial growth and moisture problems, and opportunities for renovation of historic buildings, while creating a good indoor climate and preserving historical values. Lab-studies as well as full-scale studies are conducted. The aim of the project is to sustainably improve energy efficiency while preserving historical values, without durability problems. *) The project started in September 2016 and results are not expected until earliest autumn 2017.

40|$|A large {{class of}} {{industrial}} composite materials, such as metal foams, fibrous glass materials, <b>mineral</b> <b>wools,</b> and the like, {{are widely used}} in insulation and advanced heat exchangers. These materials are characterized by a substantial difference between the thermal properties of the highly conductive materials (glass or metal) and the insulator (air) as well as low volume fractions and complex network-like structures of the highly conductive components. In this paper we address the important issue for the engineering practice of developing fast, reliable, and accurate methods for computing the macroscopic (upscaled) thermal conductivities of such materials. We assume that the materials have constant macroscopic thermal conductivity tensors, which {{can be obtained by}} upscaling techniques based on the postprocessing of a number of linearly independent solutions of the steady-state heat equation on representative elementary volumes (REVs). We propose, theoretically justify, and computationally study a numerical method for computing the effective conductivities of materials for which the ratio delta of low and high conductivities satisfies delta << 1. We show that in this case one needs to solve the heat equation in the region occupied by the highly conductive media only. Further, we prove that under certain conditions on the microscale geometry the proposed method gives an approximation that is O(delta) -close to the upscaled conductivity. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and the limitations of the method on a number of numerical examples...|$|R
