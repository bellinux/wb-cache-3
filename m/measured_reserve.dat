DESIGN: Evaluation of a clinical assessment tool. SETTING: A Cardiac Rehabilitation Department in France. SUBJECTS: A total of 148 patients (133 men), mean age of 59 +/- 9 years, {{at the end of an}} outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme. MAIN MEASURES: Patients successively performed a 6 -minute walk test, a 200 m fast-walk test (200 mFWT), and a cardiopulmonary exercise test, with measure of heart rate at the end of each test. An all-possible regression procedure was used to determine the best predictive regression models of maximal heart rate. The best model was compared with the Fox equation in term of predictive error of maximal heart rate using the paired t-test. RESULTS: Results of the two walking tests correlated significantly with maximal heart rate determined during the cardiopulmonary exercise test, whereas anthropometric parameters and resting heart rate did not. The simplified predictive model with the most acceptable mean error was: maximal heart rate = 130 - 0. 6 x age + 0. 3 x HR 200 mFWT (R(2) = 0. 24). This model was superior to the Fox formula (R(2) = 0. 138). The relationship between training target heart rate calculated from <b>measured</b> <b>reserve</b> heart rate and that established using this predictive model was statistically significant (r = 0. 528, p 10 (- 6)). CONCLUSIONS: A formula combining heart rate measured during a safe simple fast walk test and age is more efficient than an equation only including age to predict maximal heart rate and training target heart rate...|$|E

40|$|Motivation. As use of {{economic}} capital models expands, {{the need for}} a robust approach to the measurement of reserving and pricing risk becomes increasingly important. The paper describes a stochastic simulation model developed by the authors that has some attractive advantages over other published approaches to risk measurement. A particular issue is the need to <b>measure</b> <b>reserving</b> and pricing risk over a one-year time horizon; the model does both one-year and run-off risk measurement. Method. The Structural Model separates overall insurance risk into systematic and non-systematic risk elements, using an Economic Scenario Generator to simulate the former and the Practical method to simulate the latter. In addition, it combines stochastic chain ladder projections of past years with a stochastic ARMA loss ratio model for recent and future years, facilitating the measurement of reserving and pricing risk in an integrated way. Results. The Structural Model offers several benefits, described in the paper and illustrated using an empirical dataset. Illustrative validation results are also presented. These include some useful ideas about validation that may be applied to other approaches, as well. Conclusions. The Structural Model is a practical approach to <b>measuring</b> <b>reserve</b> and pricing risk in an integrated way, over either a one-year or run-off risk horizon. Its ability to separate systematic economic risks from general claim misestimation risk is particularly relevant, given the concerns about a resurgence of inflation. It can be successfully validated using historical data on past reserve and pricing errors. Availability. No software is being made available with the paper...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Marine Corps Reserve has the depot maintenance {{portion of the}} O&M, MCR appropriation derived by inflating last years budget figure. The appropriation is then billed for depot maintenance on a "fair share" basis, with no system to identify whether the costs of work performed by the depot maintenance activities were actually incurred in work performed on Marine Corps Reserve equipment. The focus of this thesis is the breakdown in the current process of linking costs charged to the Reserve appropriation to actual Reserve generated depot maintenance requirements. Two alternative proposals are presented that allow for a link between actual measures of depot maintenance attributable to the Reserves, and the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes. The study recommends a change from the current methods of managing depot maintenance for the Reserves to an alternative method which <b>measures</b> <b>Reserve</b> depot maintenance in terms of equipment issued to Reserve units from the supply system.

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{correlation}} analysis are summed up by the correlation map presented in Fig.  10, which represents the reserve capacity of the links of the reduced BWFL model plotted against their WFEBC values. It emerges from the analysis of BWFL that the criticality <b>measure</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity is biased; it sometimes falls short of identifying pipe failures leading to significant head losses if the supply of the critical node is not affected. As a result, reserve capacity fails to assess the global impact of pipe failures on the network. On the other hand, WFEBC better reflects the relative contribution of alternative supply paths both to the global and local topological and energy redundancy of the network. The properties of the surrogate measure also make it an adequate pre-selection tool of critical links for further analysis, {{as illustrated by the}} flowchart in Fig.  11. Figure  10 shows that a fraction of pipes with reserve capacity greater than 1 can be filtered out prior to the hydraulic CLA based on their WFEBC values (smaller than 1.17 approximately) with low chances of eliminating critical pipes in the process, as lower WFEBC values are systematically associated with high reserve capacity values.|$|R

Although myocardial contrast echocardiogrephy has been used to accurately quantify coronary flow reserve in animals, validation for its use in humans to <b>measure</b> flow <b>reserve</b> is lacking. Methods. We analyzed the time-intensity curve from the anteroseptal region of the left ventricular short axis produced after a left main coronary artery injection of sonicated albumin before and after intracoronary administration of papaverine in 16 patients without angiographically significant coronary artery disease. The ratio of half-time of video intensity disappearance from peak intensity, variable of curve width, area under the timeintensity curve and corrected peak contrast intensity after papaverine compared with baseline were correlated with coronary flow <b>reserve</b> <b>measured</b> simultaneously with an intracoronary Doppler probe in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Results. There was a strong inverse correlation with half-time of contrast washout and coronary flow reserve (r = − 0. 76, p = 0. 0007) and a strong positive correlation between the variable of curve width (which is inversely proportional to curve width) and coronary flow reserve (r = 0. 71, p = O. 002). There was a weak but significant inverse correlation between area under the timeintensity curve and coronary flow reserve (r = − 0. 54, p = 0. 03) but no correlation between corrected peak contrast inteasity and coronary flow reserve (r = − 036, p = NS), Despite the strong correlation for the ratios for half-time of contrast washout and variable of curve width and actual coronary flow <b>reserve</b> <b>measured</b> with intracoronary Doppler probe, the transit time ratios consistently underestimated coronary flow reserve. Conclusions. Myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with left main coronary artery injections of sonicated albumin can be utilized to <b>measure</b> coronary flow <b>reserve</b> in humans.

The results of research conducted indicate reserves receive sufficient training to perform their duties, and a majority of agencies believe that Reserves handle routine functions as well as full-time officers, but experience and aptitude play the most significant role during incidents. Almost all agencies surveyed assign reserves to patrol, special events, and DUI checkpoints, while about half assign them to traffic enforcement, traffic control, and crime scene security. There are a variety of other specialized units that reserves work in (detectives, bike unit, search and rescue, etc.), but smaller percentages of agencies assign their reserves to these areas.
