5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier <b>multi-shot</b> films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with <b>multi-shot</b> repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|When skirmishing, light {{infantry}} {{fought in}} pairs, {{so that one}} soldier could cover the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets. While some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, the expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry musket being issued to most troops. The accuracy of the musket decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, {{it is likely that}} skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided the accuracy of point-blank range. Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used <b>multi-shot</b> and grapeshot in their muskets, the British light infantry used only standard ball ammunition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Solving {{the problem}} of {{matching}} people across non-overlapping multi-camera views, known as person re-identification (re-id), has received increasing interests in com-puter vision. In a real-world application scenario, a watch-list (gallery set) {{of a handful of}} known target people are provided with very few (in many cases only a single) image(s) (shots) per target. Existing re-id methods are largely unsuitable to address this open-world re-id challenge because they are designed for (1) a closed-world scenario where the gallery and probe sets are assumed to contain exactly the same people, (2) person-wise identification whereby the model attempts to verify exhaustively against each individual in the gallery set, and (3) learning a matching model using <b>multi-shots.</b> In this paper, a novel transfer local relative distance comparison (t-LRDC) model is formulated to address the open-world person re-identification problem by one-shot group-based verification. The model is designed to mine and transfer useful information from a labelled open-world non-target dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms both non-transfer learning and existing transfer learning based re-id methods.

40|$|Compliant {{mechanism}} {{design has}} been applied to more and more areas and has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. Its relative flexibility instead of rigid joints excels in simplicity of manufacturing and assembly, as well as reduction in cost, backlash, noise, lubrication and so on. Most compliant linkages are made by sole material, resulting in thin and small joints. To improve the endurance of compliant mechanisms, multi-material design is employed. Multi-material design is developed with the advantages of improved function and appearance of a product. In TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) molding process, <b>multi-shots</b> or over molding provides variances in geometry and topology for multi-material combination. However, it is difficult to define the geometry and topology, and the users' preferences vary a lot, a typical design example is illustrated in this paper. Also, compliant product modelling and a real-time haptic function evaluation are presented. The intuitive experience of hatpic evaluation gives the designer or user a quick impression of the stiffness of the mechanism in order to evaluate the product function. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a case study: the redesign of a daily-used gripper and its haptic evaluation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Focus {{stacking}} is {{a digital}} image processing technique which combines multiple images taken at different focus distances to give a resulting image with a greater depth of field {{than any of the}} individual source images. Available programs for <b>multi-shot</b> DOF enhancement include Adobe Photoshop, Syncroscopy AutoMontage, PhotoAcute Studio, Helicon Focus and CombineZ. Getting sufficient depth of field can be particularly challenging in macro photography. The images to the right illustrate the extended DOF that can be achieved by combining multiple images.|$|E
500|$|Two-shot or <b>multi-shot</b> moulds are {{designed}} to [...] "overmould" [...] within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines with two or more injection units. This process is actually an injection moulding process performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a different colour, is injection-moulded into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys, for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and remain legible with heavy use.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structure) {{formation}} on copper {{thin films}} induced by a picosecond laser beam (Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm, 42 ps and 10 Hz) was studied experimentally. Copper thin films were deposited on glass and silicon substrates by magnetron sputtering. The surface modifications of irradiated zones {{were analyzed by}} scanning electron microscopy. Two distinct types of LIPSS were identified {{with respect to the}} laser fluence (F), number of laser shots (N) and substrate material. Namely, with a number of laser shots (1000 < N < 10, 000) and a fluence of (200 mJ/cm 2 < F < 500 mJ/cm 2), Low Spatial Frequency LIPSS (LSFL with a spatial period of Λ ∼ 260 nm and an orientation perpendicular to polarization) and High Spatial Frequency LIPSS (HSFL with a spatial period of Λ ∼ 130 nm and an orientation parallel to the polarization) were observed. The regime of regular spikes formation was determined for N ≥ 1000. Moreover, the 2 D-map of the relationship among LIPSS formation, laser fluence and number of laser shots on copper thin film with two different substrates was established. A physics interpretation of regular spikes and LIPSS formation on copper thin film induced by ps laser with overlapping <b>multi-shots</b> is proposed based on experimental data and the theory of Plateau-Rayleigh instability...|$|R
40|$|This work reports an {{investigation}} of the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with a graphite surface. Time-of-flight experiments were conducted with a 100 fs laser system, then 13 fs laser pulses at 800 nm wavelength were used for photoelectron spectroscopy studies. <b>Multi-shots</b> and single-shot laser pulse regimes have shown the existence of two mechanisms involved in the ablation of graphite: at low laser fluence, a non-thermal physical process known as Coulomb explosion (CE) is responsible for the ultrafast removal of particles. At high laser fluence, a thermal process, called plasma generation and characterized by a liquid-carbon phase initiated by the laser pulse, takes place and is believed to be at the origin of the ejection of particles. On the other hand, results from 13 fs laser pulses give rise to unusual high kinetic energy photoelectron around 20 eV that cannot be explained by the multiphoton ionization process but by tunnel and/or above barrier ionization (ABI). This unexpected result at such low intensities (10 ¹⁰ < I(W/cm²) < 10 ¹²) is interpreted as a roughening of the surface by the laser pulse that leads to photon-plasmon coupling, then an enhancement of the local electric surface field enough to make possible electrons tunneling through the potential barrier or even to escape directly (ABI) into the vacuum.

2500|$|While most improvised {{firearms}} are single-shot, multiple-shot {{versions are}} also encountered. The simplest <b>multi-shot</b> zip guns are derringer-like, and {{consist of a}} number of single-shot zip guns attached together. The Pepper-box design is also used in home made guns because it is relatively easy to make out of a bundle of pipes or a steel cylinder. In late 2000, British police encountered a four-shot [...]22 LR zip gun disguised as a mobile phone, where different keys on the keypad fire different barrels. Because of this discovery, mobile phones are now X-rayed by airport screeners worldwide. They are believed to be manufactured in Croatia, and were still being found in Europe as late as 2004, {{according to a report by}} Time magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Rifles and {{shotguns}} containing multiple barrels {{are some}} of the oldest types of <b>multi-shot</b> firearms, and their use continues to this day. These guns are traditionally used for hunting fast-moving or dangerous game, as the simplicity of the design makes a rapid second shot quick and certain; double rifles are known as express rifles or when combined shotgun with rifle, are known as drilling or more accurately combination gun (the term [...] "drilling" [...] is German), the original [...] "combination" [...] guns manufactured in Europe had three bores overposed, but could be fashioned in more or less. The double-barreled shotgun is still the primary choice for most shotgun sporting events, as well as hunting of game birds. The double rifle, due to the difficulty involved in regulating the two barrels to impact at the same point of aim, is prohibitively expensive; for example, a Purdey, Parker or Holland & Holland double rifle sells between US$40,000 - 150,000. Combination guns, containing two, three, or four barrels, most often a mix of rifle and shotgun barrels, are popular choices for hunting in Europe. A typical three barrel drilling mix of a rimfire rifle, a powerful centerfire rifle, and a shotgun barrel allows the taking of a very wide range of game with a single gun. Multi-barrel designs in hunting guns are generally restricted to rifles, shotguns, and combination guns.|$|E

50|$|<b>Multi-shot</b> {{exposes the}} sensor {{to the image}} in a {{sequence}} of three or more openings of the lens aperture.
