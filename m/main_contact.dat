5|$|The loyalists {{reached the}} home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese {{business}} district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who {{was reported to be}} Nhu's <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night.|$|E

50|$|Thyristor-assisted {{tap changers}} use {{thyristors}} {{to take the}} on load current while the <b>main</b> <b>contacts</b> change over from one tap to the next. This prevents arcing on the <b>main</b> <b>contacts</b> {{and can lead to}} a longer service life between maintenance activities. The disadvantage is that these tap changers are more complex and require a low voltage power supply for the thyristor circuitry. They are often more costly but this method is used in some modern transformers.|$|R

25|$|In 1979 the Soviet Union {{intervened in}} the Afghan Civil War. The ISI and the CIA worked {{together}} to recruit Muslims throughout the world {{to take part in}} Jihad against the Soviet forces. However the CIA had little direct contact with the Mujahideen as the ISI was the <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> and handler and they favored the most radical of the groups, namely the Hezb-e Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Orthodox Church and the non-Chalcedonians {{were among}} the first peoples to have contact with Islam, which conquered Roman/Byzantine Syria-Palestine and Egypt in the 7th century, and fought many battles against Islamic conquests. The Qur'an itself records its {{concurrent}} observations regarding the Roman world in Surah al-Rum. The <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> with Islam however, came after the conquest of the Seljuk Turks of Roman/Byzantine Anatolia in the 13th century. Until the turn of the 20th century, the Orthodox Church was under the authority of various Islamic Sultanates and Caliphates until the anti-Colonialist surge that began in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Several African American {{health workers}} and {{educators}} associated with Tuskegee Institute helped the PHS {{to carry out}} its experimentation and {{played a critical role in}} the progress of the study. The extent to which they knew about the full scope of the study is not clear in all cases. Dr. Robert Russa Moton, then president of Tuskegee Institute, and Dr. Eugene Dibble, head of the Institute's John Andrews Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study. Registered Nurse Eunice Rivers, who had trained at Tuskegee Institute and worked at its affiliated John Andrew Hospital, was recruited at the start of the study to be the <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> with the participants in the study.|$|E

25|$|Lingnan {{culture is}} {{considered}} to be a commercial, oceanic culture that embodies the history of the region: Its foundation consists of a mix of Nanyue and Han Chinese (especially Tang dynasty's and Song dynasty's) influences, having preserved a considerable amount of Tang and Song cultural heritages not preserved in other branches of modern Han Chinese cultures. Lingnan later became the Ming Empire's <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> point with Western Europeans via commerce, and thus came to include European ideas in its arts and philosophy. Also, with such a long history of being prominent merchants and craftsmen, the Cantonese people, amongst all the Han Chinese, are said to be marked by their pragmatism, fierce rebelliousness, and general openness to new and foreign ideas.|$|E

25|$|While in office, the {{appointment}} of Mariano Villaronga {{to the office of}} Commissioner of Instruction of Puerto Rico. This took place while the pro-statehood factions argued that the public education should be in English in order to facilitate a future admission. However, Villaronga supported the use of the established Spanish language. Understanding the implications that this had on the status of Puerto Rico, Fernós sided with Villaronga, noting that conserving the Spanish language {{played a key role in}} conserving the Puerto Rican cultural identity. His arrival also coincided with the proposal of Public Law 362, which amended the Jones Law to allow Puerto Ricans the right to elect their own governor. Fernós firmly supported these initiatives, believing that it was instrumental towards establishing a sovereign constitution in the near future and played a key role in its approval, turning Puerto Rico into the first territory to democratically elect a governor. While remaining Muñoz's <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> in Washington, Fernós also developed an interest in the process that created an Organic Act for Guam, a long-standing military possession with parallels to his own case. He pushed status language that would later be used as precedent when attending Puerto Rico's status. Between 1945 and 1950, Fernós modified his status proposal a total of 28 times. His efforts were supported by a parallel initiative undertaken by the DOI that tried to harmonize the public policy on territories with the anti-colonialism treaties that the United States reached with the United Nations.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{there were}} several changes at EastWest, and Dream Theater's <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> within the label was fired. As a result, the new team at the company were unaccustomed to the {{relationship}} Dream Theater had with former EastWest personnel, and they pressured them to write an album that was more accessible. In mid-1997, they entered the studio to write their next album. In addition to pressuring the band to adopt a more mainstream sound, EastWest recruited writer/producer Desmond Child to work with Petrucci on polishing the lyrics to his song [...] "You or Me". The whole band substantially reworked the song, and it appeared on the album as [...] "You Not Me" [...] with a chorus that bore {{little resemblance to the}} original. Child also had a noticeable impact on the album, with a shift towards less complex and more radio-friendly compositions.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>contact</b> {{point for}} the Nazis in those plans was Carl Maria Splett, bishop of Danzig {{and a member of}} the Polish conference of bishops before 1939, who held close {{relations}} to the Nazi Albert Forster, and pursued plans to replace Polish clergy with German ones. Another notable German member of the clergy was archbishop Adolf Bertram who personally contacted the Vatican with the request to Germanise the Catholic Polish church organisation. With the position of the Catholic Church in Germany threatened itself since 1933 Bertram called for freedom of faith. Their work was helped by the fact that as German terror grew and became widely known many high-ranking members of Catholic Polish clergy sought refuge abroad to save themselves (Germans were murdering elites of Polish nation as part of their plans) and their deputies were prevented from taking office. The earliest victim was the Pomeranian Voivodeship where almost every Catholic Polish church was closed down, robbed and turned ever into some kind of warehouse, stable or depot. Catholic Polish priests faced three waves of arrests after initial massacres. Those who were arrested ended in concentration camps of Dachau and Stutthof. Monasteries were closed, their collection of arts and books stolen or destroyed by Germans. Splett cooperated with Forster and introduced 200 Catholic German priests into Chełmno diocese where he had been appointed as diocesan administrator from December 1939 on. Under his reign Polish priesthood was oppressed, and prayers and masses under his direction praised Hitler. He also issued a ban against use of Polish language in churches. When he banned confessions in Polish in May 1940 the Vatican intervened and ordered that the ban be lifted. Not only did Splett defend his ban, he argued it was to [...] "protect" [...] people making the confessions. After this argument he tried to claim that confessions in Polish are used for [...] "nationalistic means". Eventually Vatican accepted his explanation. Besides banning Polish language, Splett ordered removal of Polish signs and names in graveyards from monuments and graves and in all churches under his jurisdiction. Albert Forster praised Splett's work for Germany.|$|E
