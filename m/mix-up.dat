40|$|Motivation: Sample <b>mix-ups</b> {{can arise}} during sample collection, handling, {{genotyping}} or data management. It {{is unclear how}} often sample <b>mix-ups</b> occur in genome-wide studies, as there currently are no post hoc methods that can identify these <b>mix-ups</b> in unrelated samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm (MixupMapper) that can both detect and correct sample <b>mix-ups</b> in genome-wide studies that study gene expression levels. Results: We applied MixupMapper to five publicly available human genetical genomics datasets. On average, 3 % of all analyzed samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes: {{in one of the}} datasets 23 % of the samples had incorrect expression phenotypes. The consequences of sample <b>mix-ups</b> are substantial: when we corrected these sample <b>mix-ups,</b> we identified on average 15 % more significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). In one dataset, we identified three times as many significant cis-eQTLs after correction. Furthermore, we show through simulations that sample <b>mix-ups</b> can lead to an underestimation of the explained heritability of complex traits in genome-wide association datasets. ...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the second round, {{as one of the}} 22 teams from the Football League First Division. They were drawn against Doncaster Rovers; the first leg was staged at Belle Vue on 23 September 1987. Arsenal eased to a 3–0 win, with goals from Perry Groves, Alan Smith and Steve Williams. A fortnight later, midfielder David Rocastle scored the only goal in the second leg to give Arsenal a 4–0 aggregate scoreline win. Bournemouth were Arsenal's opponents in the third round. The match was played at Highbury on 27 October 1987. Arsenal needed 33 minutes to open the scoring, when Michael Thomas converted a penalty kick. Smith extended their lead and in the second half, Kevin Richardson scored Arsenal's third, profiting from a <b>mix-up</b> between the Bournemouth defenders. The win was Arsenal's tenth in succession at Highbury, setting a new club record in the process.|$|E

They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a <b>mix-up</b> between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a <b>mix-up</b> on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first half hour of play.|$|E

5|$|Having {{scored a}} century for Waverley against Petersham the week before, Fingleton made his {{first-class}} debut in 1928–29, playing in two matches and having two innings. On debut against Victoria, Fingleton {{was allowed to}} bat no higher than No. 8 by captain Tommy Andrews, despite being a specialist batsman. More than 600 runs had been scored {{by the time the}} sixth wicket had fallen, bringing him to the wicket to join Don Bradman, who had already brought up his double century. The pair put on an unbroken stand of 111 before Andrews declared at 7/613, of which Fingleton made 25 not out. During the partnership, Bradman farmed most of the strike, much to Fingleton's chagrin. The pair's first meeting had been prickly and Bradman glared angrily at Fingleton after a <b>mix-up</b> almost ended in a run out. The match was drawn, and Fingleton then made a duck against Tasmania in an innings victory. The following summer, with no Test matches, New South Wales' international representatives were available for the entire season, and Fingleton missed selection for every match.|$|E

Liverpool's poor play in front of goal {{continued}} after the restart; Josemi {{had a chance to}} score, but his shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area went over the crossbar. After the attack, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match; Florent Sinama Pongolle replaced Finnan. After just over an hour's play, a <b>mix-up</b> between Reina and Sami Hyypiä nearly contrived to present a goal to CSKA, before Hyypiä intervened to clear the ball. CSKA made their first substitution in the 66th minute with Deividas Šemberas replacing Yuri Zhirkov. Liverpool followed this by replacing Xabi Alonso with Mohamed Sissoko. Vágner Love had a chance to extend CSKA's lead in the 77th minute, but he was unable to control the ball after a high pass and lost possession. Despite their lead CSKA were negative in their play; they were punished when Liverpool replaced John Arne Riise with striker Djibril Cissé. Cissé made an immediate impact; he ran onto to a pass from García. The pass was cleared by CSKA defender Sergei Ignashevich but it ricocheted off Cissé and left him with an open goal after Akinfeev had come off his line in an attempt to clear the ball. Cissé's goal meant the match was now drawn at 1–1 and with no further goals the match went into extra-time.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} this, Morris started {{the new season}} consistently, scoring four fifties in his first five innings, {{including}} 55 and 39 in his state's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests. The on-field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris' Test fortunes. He made only one half-century {{and a total of}} 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2–1. In the Second Test, he had progressed to 42 when he drove Hugh Tayfield into a close fielder. The ball ballooned to mid-off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball's trajectory and caught it. By the standards of the era, the catch was regarded as miraculous. He ended the series strongly, with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in Melbourne in the Fifth Test, which Australia lost by six wickets. Morris' 99 occurred when he was involved in a <b>mix-up</b> while batting with debutant Ian Craig, Australia's youngest ever Test cricketer. Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig's in a run out. His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years, and would have to wait another two years to reach the milestone again. Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new teammate. He ended the series with 370 runs at 41.11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide, that of John Watkins. The series ended 2–2, the first Test series in Morris' career that Australia had not won. Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm-up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45.65 for the summer.|$|E
5|$|The Test started amid {{controversy}} {{following the}} omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failedapart from brief periodsto challenge Australia {{in the first two}} Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with Denis Compton forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon. England could have been in an even stronger position, but Compton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a <b>mix-up,</b> resulting in the latter being run out and ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 {{by the end of the}} second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.|$|E

40|$|In a mouse intercross {{with more}} than 500 animals and {{genome-wide}} gene expression data on six tissues, we identified a high proportion (18 %) of sample <b>mix-ups</b> in the genotype data. Local expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL; genetic loci influencing gene expression) with extremely large effect were used to form a classifier to predict an individual's eQTL genotype based on expression data alone. By considering multiple eQTL and their related transcripts, we identified numerous individuals whose predicted eQTL genotypes (based on their expression data) did not match their observed genotypes, {{and then went on}} to identify other individuals whose genotypes did match the predicted eQTL genotypes. The concordance of predictions across six tissues indicated that the problem was due to <b>mix-ups</b> in the genotypes (though we further identified a small number of sample <b>mix-ups</b> in each of the six panels of gene expression microarrays). Consideration of the plate positions of the DNA samples indicated a number of off-by-one and off-by-two errors, likely the result of pipetting errors. Such sample <b>mix-ups</b> can be a problem in any genetic study, but eQTL data allow us to identify, and even correct, such problems. Our methods have been implemented in an R package, R/lineup. Comment: 63 pages, 9 figures, 20 supplemental figures, and 5 supplemental tables.

40|$|Background: Accidental sample <b>mix-ups</b> and {{the need}} for their swift {{resolution}} is a challenge faced by every analytical laboratory. To this end, we developed a simple immunoblot-based method, making use of a patient's characteristic plasma antibody profile to Escherichia coli (E. coli) proteins. Methods: Nitrocellulose strips of size-separated proteins from E. coli whole-cell lysates were incubated with patient plasma and visualised with an enzyme-coupled secondary antibody and substrate. Plasma samples of 20 random patients as well as five longitudinal samples of three patients were analysed for antibody band patterns, to evaluate uniqueness and consistency over time, respectively. For sample <b>mix-ups,</b> antibody band patterns of questionable samples were compared with samples of known identity. Results: Comparison of anti-E. coli antibody patterns of 20 randompatients showed a unique antibody profile for each patient. Antibody profiles remained consistent over time, as shown for three patients over several years. Three example cases demonstrate the use of this methodology in mis-labelling or -pipetting incidences. Conclusion: Our simple method for resolving plasma sample <b>mix-ups</b> between non-related individuals can be performed with basic laboratory equipment and thus can easily be adopted by analytical laboratories...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} {{issues of}} sample <b>mix-ups,</b> various molecular techniques are currently used. These techniques, however, are time consuming and require experience and/or DNA sequencing equipment {{or have a}} relatively high risk of errors because of contamination. Therefore, a quick and straightforward single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiling assay was developed to link human tissues to a source. SNPs are common sequence variations in the human genome, and each individual has a unique combination of these nucleotide variations. Using potentially mislabeled paraffin-embedded tissues, DNA was extracted and SNP profiles were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the purified DNA using a selection of 10 commercially available SNP amplification assays. These profiles were compared with profiles of the supposed owners. All issues (34 in total) of potential sample <b>mix-ups</b> during the last 3 years were adequately solved, with six cases described here. The SNP profiling assay provides a quick (within 24 hours), easy, and reliable way to link human samples to a source, without polymerase chain reaction postprocessing.
