5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|Like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores {{have two}} main layers of cells that {{sandwich}} a <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> of jelly-like material, {{which is called}} the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer, {{and as a result}} some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.|$|E

5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> of {{the heart}} wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers {{of the heart}}, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
50|$|Despite its appearance, the Super Square One is not {{significantly}} {{more difficult to}} solve than the original Square-1. The <b>middle</b> <b>layers</b> are nearly identical {{to the top and}} bottom layers of the Square-1, and may be solved independently using the same methods as the Square-1. The corners of the <b>middle</b> <b>layers</b> are distinguishable because the corners with the same two colors are mirror images of each other, but the middle edges of each face are interchangeable since they show only one color each.|$|R

5|$|At {{least in}} North America, Calostoma cinnabarinum is {{distinctive}} and easily recognizable. Two {{other species of}} Calostoma also occur in the eastern United States. C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous layer and a predominately yellow <b>middle</b> <b>layer,</b> or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. It also has a reddish peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} domed, {{though it may}} lack a roof in {{enclosed}} sites. It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> of dead grass and leaves, and a lining of feathers, {{as well as of}} paper and other soft materials. Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30cm (8 × 12in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E

50|$|The map {{is divided}} into four {{vertical}} sections, with the uppermost being at ground level, and the lowest containing the titular fortress. The two <b>middle</b> <b>layers,</b> Draconis and the Crystalline Caves, both contain a landing pad that saves the game's progress and allows the player to re-animate at that point if they are destroyed. Eight hostages can be picked up on both of these <b>middle</b> <b>layers.</b> The map is further divided into sections by special walls that can be broken open by firing or dropping bombs on them.|$|R

25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: the quilt top, the <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> of batting, and the fabric backing. The quilt top is the design layer. The cotton or polyester batting in the <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> is what determines {{the warmth of}} the quilt. Batting comes in different thicknesses depending on the purpose of the final quilt, and multiple layers of batting can be combined to increase {{the warmth of the}} final product. The bottom layer is often a simple layer of solid fabric, in a neutral or complimentary color and design scheme, though some quilters use the extra or spare fabric from the quilt top to make a secondary design for the backing.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{microscopic}} model, we study {{the interplay between}} superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in a multi-layered system, where two superconductors are separated by an antiferromagnetic region. Within a self-consistent mean-field theory, this system is solved numerically. We find that the antiferromagnetism in the <b>middle</b> <b>layers</b> profoundly affects the supercurrent flowing across the junction, while the phase difference across the junction influences the development of antiferromagnetism in the <b>middle</b> <b>layers.</b> This study may not only shed {{new light on the}} mechanism for high-$T_{c}$ superconductors, but also bring important insights to building Josephson-junction-based quantum devices, such as SQUID and superconducting qubit.

40|$|Keywords—CT sequence; {{segmentation}} {{of medical}} image; snakes algorithm; contour interpolation Abstract—An algorithm of sequence medical images segmen- tation is proposed {{based on the}} combination of snakes algorithm and contour interpolation algorithm. Firstly, this algorithm uses snakes algorithm to segment the key layers in which target area change drastically. Then the algorithm calculates the position of reference points in the <b>middle</b> <b>layers</b> with the contour interpolation algorithm. Finally, snakes algorithm is applied again to segment the <b>middle</b> <b>layers.</b> Thus the segmentation of the sequence medical images are accomplished automatically. The experiments showed that the algorithm can obtain the boundary of the desired object from a sequence of medical images quickly and reliably...|$|R

25|$|Secretion is {{one method}} of {{transferring}} substances across the bacterial outer membrane. Gram-negative bacteria {{have very different}} cell wall structures in comparison to Gram-positive bactera. Gram-negative bacteria have three layers: The innermost layer is named the inner membrane; the <b>middle</b> <b>layer,</b> named the periplasmic space, is a space containing {{a thin layer of}} peptidoglycan; and the third layer is named the outer membrane, which contains lipopolysaccharides.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of a DH laser is that the region where free electrons and holes exist simultaneously—the active region—is confined to the thin <b>middle</b> <b>layer.</b> This means that many more of the electron-hole pairs can contribute to amplification—not so many are {{left out in the}} poorly amplifying periphery. In addition, light is reflected from the heterojunction; hence, the light is confined to the region where the amplification takes place.|$|E

25|$|Shuangpin, {{literally}} dual spell, is a stenographical phonetic {{input method}} based on hanyu pinyin {{that reduces the}} number of keystrokes for one Chinese character to two by distributing every vowel and consonant composed {{of more than one}} letter to a specific key. In most Shuangpin layout schemes such as Xiaohe, Microsoft 2003 and Ziranma, the most frequently used vowels are placed on the <b>middle</b> <b>layer,</b> reducing the risk of Repetitive strain injury.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> is made thin enough, {{it acts as}} {{a quantum}} well. This means that the {{vertical}} variation of the electron's wavefunction, and thus a component of its energy, is quantized. The efficiency of a quantum well laser is {{greater than that of}} a bulk laser because the density of states function of electrons in the quantum well system has an abrupt edge that concentrates electrons in energy states that contribute to laser action.|$|E
25|$|The shell {{has three}} layers. In the pearly mussels {{there is an}} inner {{iridescent}} layer of nacre (mother-of-pearl) composed of calcium carbonate, which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a <b>middle</b> <b>layer</b> of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the periostracum, an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called conchin, and its function {{is to protect the}} prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).|$|E
