The is of the giant cell tumor. A coexistence with hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis</b> with expression of EXT- 1 is very rare. The correlation between giant cell tumor in hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis</b> is still not clearly determined. Presentation of caseA 31 -years-old female presented with pain and lump on her left wrist and a coexistence of non tender multiple lump in {{the right and left}} knee. A wide excision of the tumor and reconstruction using non vascularized fibular graft was performed, followed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry of EXT- 1 and BCL- 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thirty-five {{patients}} who had <b>multiple</b> cartilaginous <b>exostosis</b> and deformities of the wrist and forearm were evaluated to determine the natural his-tory and prognostic factors for the deformities. Radial and ulnar shortening were correlated linearly (r = 0. 86), showing that both bones of the forearm were symmetrically involved. The angular growth abnormal-ity of the distal aspect of the radius was correlated with radial shortening (r = 0. 53) and ulnar shortening (r = 0. 61), but it had no correlation with negative variance of the ulna (r 2 = 0. 30).

40|$|Aim: To observe {{growth and}} related {{biological}} characters by culturing chondrocytes of hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis</b> in vitro from human {{and to establish}} bases for further research on the etiology of hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis.</b> Methods: Chondrocytes were culture primarily from exostosis and passaged. The morphology of chondrocytes was observed by microscope. Meanwhile the abilities of cell proliferation and adhesive rates were detected and were compared with control cartilage chondrocytes. Results: The living chondrocytes still were 95 % after complete digestion. After passaged, exostosis chondrocytes grew in mololayer culture had a stellate appearance with more sticklike structures in the cytoplasm and had many obvious granules. Proliferation of exostosis chondrocytes turned slowly with passaged incresed, and the obvious difference existed between the 2 th passaged and the primary exostosis chondrocytes(P < 0. 01, t = 3. 203) Most of the primary exostosis chondrocytes could adhere dishes within 24 hours. But with passaged incresed, the adhesive abilities turned down. The obvious difference existed between the 4 th passaged and the primary exostosis chondrocytes. (P < 0. 01, t = 4. 611).

40|$|A {{rare disease}} afflicts less than 200, 000 individuals, {{according}} to the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) of the United States. Over 6, 000 rare disorders affect approximately 1 in 10 Americans. Rare genetic bone disorders remain the major causes of disability in US patients. These rare bone disorders also represent a therapeutic challenge for clinicians, {{due to lack of}} understanding of underlying mechanisms. This systematic review explored current literature on therapeutic directions for the following rare genetic bone disorders: fibrous dysplasia, Gorham-Stout syndrome, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, melorheostosis, <b>multiple</b> hereditary <b>exostosis,</b> osteogenesis imperfecta, craniometaphyseal dysplasia, achondroplasia, and hypophosphatasia.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that osteochondromas of the {{cervical}} vertebrae can cause myelopathy and neck pain. The reported etiology, diagnosis, treatment and differential diagnosis were reviewed. Osteochondromas may present as a solitary lesion with no genetic component or as multiple lesions as a part of a genetic disorder known as hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis.</b> Osteochondromas of the spine are rarely encountered in clinical practice. These lesions are reported more commonly with neural compression in cases associated with hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis.</b> The authors describe a unusual clinical manifestation of a solitary osteochondroma located in the right posterior arch of the atlas. Complete removal of the tumor was performed resulting in the relief of neck pain and spastic quadriparesis. Although unusual, osteochondromas of the cervical spine must be considered in patients with persistent neck pain and progressive symptoms of myelopathy. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with plain radiograms is the neuroradiological modality of choice.

40|$|Multiple Osteochondromas (MO; {{previously}} {{known as}} <b>multiple</b> hereditary <b>exostosis)</b> is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that {{is characterized by}} the formation of cartilaginous bone tumours (osteochondromas) at multiple sites in the skeleton, secondary bursa formation and impingement of nerves, tendons and vessels, bone curving, and short stature. MO is also known to be associated with arthritis, general pain, scarring and occasional malignant transformation of osteochondroma into secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. MO patients present additional complains but the relevance of those in relation to the syndromal background needs validation. Mutations in two enzymes that are required during heparan sulphate synthesis (EXT 1 or EXT 2) are known to cause MO. Previously, we have used zebrafish which harbour mutations in ext 2 as a model for MO and shown that ext 2 ⁻/⁻ fish have skeletal defects that resemble those seen in osteochondromas. Here we analyse dental defects present in ext 2 ⁻/⁻ fish. Histological analysis reveals that ext 2 ⁻/⁻ fish have very severe defects associated with the formation and the morphology of teeth. At 5 days post fertilization 100 % of ext 2 ⁻/⁻ fish have a single tooth {{at the end of the}} 5 (th) pharyngeal arch, whereas wild-type fish develop three teeth, located in the middle of the pharyngeal arch. ext 2 ⁻/⁻ teeth have abnormal morphology (they were shorter and thicker than in the WT) and patchy ossification at the tooth base.

40|$|Background: Multiple osteochondromas is a {{hereditary}} syndrome that {{is characterized}} by the formation of cartilagecapped bony neoplasms (osteochondromas), for which <b>exostosis</b> (<b>multiple)</b> - 1 (EXT 1) has been identified as a causative gene. However, 85 % of all osteochondromas present as solitary (nonhereditary) lesions in which somatic mutations in EXT 1 are extremely rare, but loss of heterozygosity and clonal rearrangement of 8 q 24 (the chromosomal locus of EXT 1) are common. We examined whether EXT 1 might act as a classical tumor suppressor gene for nonhereditary osteochondromas. Methods: Eight nonhereditary osteochondromas were subjected to high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis for chromosome 8 q. The array-CGH results were validated by subjecting tumor DNA to multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis for EXT 1. EXT 1 locus-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on nuclei isolated from the three tissue components of osteochondroma (cartilage cap, perichondrium, bony stalk) to examine which parts of the tumor are of clonal origin. Results: Array-CGH analysis of tumor DNA revealed that all eight osteochondromas had a large deletion of 8 q; five tumors had an additional small deletion of the other allele of 8 q that contained the EXT 1 gene. MLPA analysis of tumor DNA confirmed these findings and identified two additional deletions that were smaller than the limit of resolution of array-CGH. FISH analysis of the cartilage cap, perichondrium, and bony stalk showed that these homozygous EXT 1 deletions were present only in the cartilage cap of osteochondroma.

40|$|Abstract. Hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis</b> (HME) is an auto-somal {{inherited}} skeletal disease whose etiology is {{not fully}} understood. To further understand the genetic spectrum of the disease, we analyzed a five-generation Chinese family with HME that have observable inheritance. Exome sequencing was performed on three HME individuals and three unaffected individuals from the family. A downstream study confirmed a new C deletion at codon 442 on exon 5 of the exostosin- 1 (EXT 1) gene as the only pathogenic site which generated a stop codon and caused the truncation of the protein. We redis-covered the deletion in other affected individuals {{but not in the}} unaffected individuals from the family. Upon immunohis-tochemistry assay, we found that the EXT 1 protein level of the patients with the novel mutation in our study was less than the level in the patients without the EXT 1 mutation from another unrelated family.

40|$|Hereditary <b>multiple</b> <b>exostosis</b> (HME) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterized {{by two or}} more benign growing, cartilage capped tumors of long bones called osteochondromas. If abnormal growth and clinical symptoms of osteochondromas newly appear in adults, malignant transformation of the usually benign growing tumors should be suspected and diagnostic testing should be initiated. Against the background of hypothesized higher malignant transformation of osteochondromas into chondrosarcoma in individuals with shoulder exostoses, we report a case of bilateral scapulothoracic osteochondromas in a patient suffering from HME.
