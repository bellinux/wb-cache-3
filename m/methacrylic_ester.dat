A specific objective was to obtain suitable macromolecular chains, to which the organotin moieties could be attached at {{some distance from the}} main backbone. The new organotin monomers which were synthesised are: m-acrylamidotri-n-butyltin benzoate (m-AATBTB), p-acrylamidotri-n-butyltin benzoate (p-AATBTB), m-methacrylamidotri-n-butyltin benzoate (mMAATBTB), p-methacrylamidotri-n-butyltin benzoate (p-MAATBTB), 0 - acryloyloxytri-n-butyltin benzoate (o-AOTBTB) and o-methacryloyloxytri-nbutyltin benzoate (o-MAOTBTBO). These were prepared by the reaction of bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) with the corresponding acrylamide or acryloyloxy benzoic acid which were prepared by the reaction of aminobenzoic acid derivatives or salicylic acid with either acryloyl chloride or acrylic anhydride. These organotin monomers were polymerised in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. Binary copolymerisation experiments were performed by solution polymerisation in DMF solution with AIBN as initiator. The copolymer composition in each case was determined from tin analysis. Since the properties of these organotin polymers are related to the distribution of monomer units, it is of great interest to determine the actual monomer reactivity ratios which control the sequence length distribution.

TMP was functionalized as 70 - 80 % selectivity of mono-methacrylate with 70 % conversion was achieved, and the reaction rate was evaluated using various acyl donors such as <b>methacrylic</b> acid, methacrylate-methyl <b>ester,</b> -ethyl ester and -vinyl ester. As a new observation, the fastest rate obtained was for the transesterfication reaction using methacrylate methyl ester. By-products resulted from leaving groups were adsorbed on the molecular sieves (4 Å) to minimize the effect of leaving group on the equilibrium. The difference of reaction rate was explained by molecular dynamic simulations on interactions between carbonyl oxygen and amino acid residues (Thr(40) and Gln(157)) in the active site of lipase. Our docking studies revealed that as acyl donor, methyl ester was preferred for the initial conformation of the 1 (st) tetrahederal intermediate with hydrogen bonding interactions. TMP-monomethacrylate (TMP-mMA) cyclic carbonate was obtained in 63 % yield (74. 1 % calculated in 85 % conversion) from the lipase-catalyzed carbonation reaction of TMP-mMA with dimethylcarbonate, and followed by thermal cyclization of the monocarbonate at 90 °C.

The catalytic efficiency of this complex was almost identical towards <b>ester</b> <b>methacrylic</b> monomers. The yield of polybenzylmethacrylate (84 – 86 %) was not influenced by the bulkiness of the substituent directly attached to the sp 3 oxygen, and in the meantime, it gave {{a small amount of}} oligomers (3 – 16 %). The molecular weights of polybenzylmethacrylate obtained by this catalytic system were relatively high (				M¯n= 1. 3 – 						 4. 3 × 104) and were not practically influenced by the temperature. The polymerization of methylvinylketone (MVK) gave a low polymer yield (8 – 25 %), with low molecular weights (				M¯n= 2. 1 – 						 4. 4 × 103) and a higher quantity of oligomers (53 – 67 %). This result indicated that the ketone-enol equilibrium of the momoner perturbed highly the polymerization process, which was due to the presence of a methyl group in α position of the carbonyl. The polymerization of vinylacetate using the same catalytic system was also investigated in this work. However, the polymerization process was unsuccessful. Ni(acac) 2 –MAO catalyst system was able to initiate the polymerization of various monomers, such as those containing conjugated double bonds CC–CC or CC–CO, but those containing a donor group in α-position, such as methylvinylketone appeared to give essentially the oligomers. 13 C and 1 H NMR analyses of the polymer revealed that the catalytic system gave a mixture of mr (27. 4 – 46 %) and rr (43. 8 – 55. 5 %) triads in the main chain preferentially.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the problem of}} paraffin deposition during production, transportation and processing of crude oil and gas condensate. The troublesome paraffin stands for normal hydrocarbons ranging from approximately C 18 -C 38, mixed with small amounts of branched paraffin, monocyclic paraffin, polycyclic paraffin, and aromatics. The amount of paraffin found in crude oils {{as described in the}} literature, varies from less than 1 to more than 50 percent. The solubility of paraffin depends on chemical composition, temperature and pressure. Paraffin precipitates at an equilibrium temperature and pressure defined as the cloud point. The paraffin deposits often begin on surfaces cooler than the liquid. The viscosity is increased by the presence of paraffin crystals and if the temperature is reduced sufficiently, the crude oil/gas condensate will become very viscous(pour point). The crude oil/gas condensate viscosity behaves in a Newtonian manner until wax crystals begin to form and, after lowering the temperature, behaves in a non-Newtonian manner. Many options are available to counter the problems caused by paraffin wax deposition. These include various mechanical, thermal and chemical means (for example, steam heating, blending with lighter cutter stocks and treating with chemical additives). A preferred option would be to use wax modifier additives, commonly known as pour point depressants. Crystal modifiers are copolymers from these groups: copolymers of ethylene vinyl acetate, poly alpha-olefins, alkyl fumarate- vinyl acetate copolymers of C 18 -through C 22 methacrylates and copolymers of maleic anhydride esters. The mechanism of paraffin deposition and prevention is described. The additives modify {{the size and shape of}} the crystal and inhibit the formation of large wax crystal lattices. With efficient additives, crude oil/gas condensate behaves in a Newtonian manner at low temperature.

It is an affordable medicine and its use is beneficial in resource limited settings. However D 4 T exhibits dose dependent side effects that may lead to non-adherence in patients. This study was undertaken to formulate, develop and manufacture a dosage form that could reduce dose dependent side effects by decreasing the dose of D 4 T but still exhibit antiretroviral (ARV) activity. The use of sustained release (SR) formulations of D 4 T that ensure constant levels of the D 4 T in the body would not only optimize therapy but also reduce the incidence of side effects thereby increasing patient adherence. SR microparticles containing 30 mg D 4 T were manufactured and loaded into size 3 hard gelatine capsules prior to analysis. The D 4 T microparticles were manufactured by microencapsulation using non-aqueous oil-in-oil solvent evaporation approach. D 4 T-excipient, excipient-excipient interactions and D 4 T purity were assessed using Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Copolymers synthesized from acrylic and <b>methacrylic</b> acid <b>esters</b> viz., Eudragit® RSPO and S 100 were used as rate retardant materials and the effect of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH 102) on the microparticles was also investigated. Magnesium stearate was used as a droplet stabilizer and n-hexane was added to harden the microspheres formed in a liquid paraffin continuous phase. The microparticles were optimized using a Box Behnken design and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The microparticles were characterized in terms of their flow properties and encapsulation efficiency (% EE), in addition to visualization of the surface morphology with Scanning Electron Microscopy. In vitro D 4 T release studies were performed using USP Apparatus III in media of different pH and the samples were analysed using a validated High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection that had been developed and optimized using a Central Composite Design (CCD). The method was validated according to ICH guidelines. The IR spectra and DSC thermographs revealed that D 4 T exhibited thermal stability and {{there was no evidence of}} D 4 T-excipient and excipient-excipient interactions. The microparticles that were produced were white, free flowing and were obtained in a high yield with high encapsulation efficiency. Scanning Electron Microscopy studies revealed that the microparticles were spherical and porous in nature. In vitro D 4 T release extended to 12 hours and the mechanism of release was established using model dependent methods by fitting the data to a Zero order, First order, Higuchi and Hixson Crowell model. It was observed that the mechanism of D 4 T release was diffusion-controlled and that the data was best fitted to the Higuchi model with correlation coefficients > 0. 9. The release mechanism was confirmed using the Korsmeyer-Peppas model that revealed that most of the formulations exhibited anomalous transport kinetics with the release exponent, n, ranging from 0. 5 <n< 1. 0. These data suggest that diffusion was not the only mechanism controlling D 4 T release and that swelling and/or polymer relaxation may contribute to the release. Model-independent analysis for comparison of dissolution profiles was undertaken and the f 1 and f 2 difference and similarity factor were calculated. The optimized formulation, Batch BB- 018 was found to be similar to two batches (BB- 005 and BB- 016).

Opisane su temeljne vrste polimera koji se u te svrhe primjenjuju: polimeri na osnovi olefina, posebice etilena, kopolimeri vinil-acetata i alkil-fumarata, esteri akrilne i metakrilne kiseline te polimeri na osnovi anhidrida maleinske kiseline. Prikazan je mehanizam djelovanja aditiva i metode za utvrđivanje njihove djelotvornosti. Dio pregleda obuhvaća rezultate sinteze i primjene vlastitih aditiva za naftu i plinski kondenzat. Posebno je opisan utjecaj kemijske strukture i molekulske mase polimernih aditiva te njihove koncentracije na tecivost i viskoznost. Ispitivanja su provedena na uzorcima nafte s naftnih polja u INI, Števkovica, Obod i Đeletovci i plinsko-kondenzatnih polja Molve, Kalinovac, Stari Gradac i Gola te mađarskog polja Barcs. Rezultati pokazuju da na djelotvornost u primjeni bitno utječu vrste aditiva i nafte, odnosno plinskog kondenzata. Optimalni su rezultati postignuti primjenom aditiva na osnovi kopolimera dugolančanih estera metakrilne kiseline s vinil-karboksilnim kiselinama. This paper {{describes}} {{the problem of}} paraffin deposition during production, transportation and processing of crude oil and gas condensate. The troublesome paraffin stands for normal hydrocarbons ranging from approximately C 18 -C 38, mixed with small amounts of branched paraffin, monocyclic paraffin, polycyclic paraffin, and aromatics. The amount of paraffin found in crude oils {{as described in the}} literature, varies from less than 1 to more than 50 percent. The solubility of paraffin depends on chemical composition, temperature and pressure. Paraffin precipitates at an equilibrium temperature and pressure defined as the cloud point. The paraffin deposits often begin on surfaces cooler than the liquid. The viscosity is increased by the presence of paraffin crystals and if the temperature is reduced sufficiently, the crude oil/gas condensate will become very viscous (pour point). The crude oil/gas condensate viscosity behaves in a Newtonian manner until wax crystals begin to form and, after lowering the temperature, behaves in a non-Newtonian manner. Many options are available to counter the problems caused by paraffin wax deposition. These include various mechanical, thermal and chemical means (for example, steam heating, blending with lighter cutter stocks and treating with chemical additives). A preferred option would be to use wax modifier additives, commonly known as pour point depressants. Crystal modifiers are copolymers from these groups: copolymers of ethylene vinyl acetate, poly alpha-olefins, alkyl fumarate- vinyl acetate copolymers of C 18 -through C 22 methacrylates and copolymers of maleic anhydride esters. The mechanism of paraffin deposition and prevention is described. The additives modify {{the size and shape of}} the crystal and inhibit the formation of large wax crystal lattices. With efficient additives, crude oil/gas condensate behaves in a Newtonian manner at low temperature. A section of the paper {{describes the}} influence of chemical structure and molecular weight of the flow improver additives for crude oils and gas condensates prepared by the authors of this review article. The additives are based on methacrylic long chain alkyl ester homopolymers or copolymers with vinyl carboxylic acids or vinyl aromatic monomers. The quality of the prepared additives as pour point depressants and rheology improvers was proved by applying them to crude oil from INA fields Števkovica, Obod and Deletovci as well as gas condensate fields Molve, Kalinovac, Stari Gradac, Gola, and Hungarian gas condensate field Barcs. The best results were obtained with the copolymers of <b>methacrylic</b> long-chain alkyl <b>esters</b> with functional monomers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} synthesis, {{characterization}} and applications of (biohybrid) nanogels based on (water-soluble) poly(N-vinyl lactams) copolymers functionalized with reactive side groups. RAFT (Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer) copolymerizations of <b>methacrylic</b> acid N-hydroxysuccinimide <b>ester</b> and cyclic N-vinylamides derivatives (N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylpiperidone and N-vinylcaprolactam) were successfully performed with methyl 2 -(ethoxycarbonothioylthio) -propanoate as chain transfer agent (CTA). Biohybrid nanogels were constructed via chemical crosslinking of water soluble reactive copolymers poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone-co-N-methacryloxysuccinimide) with proteins such as enhanced {{green fluorescent protein}} (EGFP) and cellulase via water-in-oil emulsion. Biofluorescent nanogels crosslinked with varying amounts of EGFP were obtained. The biocatalytic activity of cellulase-conjugated nanogels (CNG) can be tunable via crosslinking density. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based study disclosed the mechanism how the crosslinking density influence upon the catalytic activity of the biohybrid colloids. The biohybrid nanogels displayed enhanced stability compared with free cellulase after storing {{at room temperature for}} three weeks. Thermo and redox dual sensitive nanogels based on N-vinylcaprolactam (VCL) and N-succinimidyl methacrylate (Suma) crosslinked with diallyl disulfide were synthesized via a facile and straightforward method, with tunable size from 200 nm to 1. 1 μm. Doxorubicin (DOX) was covalently bound to the nanogel network via coupling with succinimide groups at mild conditions to obtain prodrug nanogels. The drug delivery system exhibited a sustainable delivery profile in the intracellular release study and high antitumor activity. A series of novel pyridyldisulfide (PDS) -functionalized poly(N-vinyl lactams) statistical copolymers were developed via RAFT polymerization. The PDS-functionalized reactive polymers were amenable to a variety of thiol-containing molecules under mild conditions. The contact angle measurements results and fluorescence microscopy study indicated that the reactive films based on the PDS-functionalized copolymers allowed facile, direct, and environmental-friendly surface engineering in aqueous solution, which can control cell attachment and growth on the surface to meet demands of a particular application. Redox-responsive polymeric nanogels were synthesized via in situ crosslinking of PDS-functionalized poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone). Cellulase as a representative protein was encapsulated in the nanogels (PNG 1 and PNG 2). The enzymatic activity was greatly deactivated when encapsulated in the nanogels while rapidly recovered in 10 mM DTT solution. The FRET based experiments were performed and revealed that the recovered enzymatic activity was mainly ascribed to reduction inducing degradation of the disulfide crosslinking network, ultimately causing protein release. A series of well-defined primary amine-functionalized statistical copolymers based on cyclic N-vinyl lactam monomers and N-vinylformamide (VFA) were successfully synthesized via RAFT polymerization. Water soluble primary amine-based reactive copolymers were obtained by controlled hydrolysis of the VFA components in alkaline condition. Functional nanogels were prepared in W/O emulsions utilizing the coupling between the reactive amine side-groups of polymer chains and diacrylate functionalities of poly(ethylene glycol) crosslinker via Michael addition reaction. Biodegradable nanogels based on primary amine-functionalized poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) copolymers were prepared in water-in-oil emulsion via Michael addition reaction with a redox-responsive cross-linker. DOX-loaded nanogels demonstrated decreased drug release rate with increased crosslinking density in presence of 10 mM GSH at 37 ℃. The in vitro release studies revealed that maximum 85 % DOX was released in 24 h under a reductive environment whereas only maximum 13 % DOX was released in 24 h under nonreductive conditions. Intracellular drug release experiment indicated that the DOX delivery rate is tunable via varying crosslinking densities of the nanogels. Cell viability assay demonstrated that the free nanogels were biocompatible in wide concentrations while the DOX-loaded nanogels displayed medium antitumor activity...|$|R
