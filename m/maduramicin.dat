40|$|<b>Maduramicin,</b> a {{polyether}} ionophore antibiotic {{derived from}} the bacterium Actinomadura yumaensis, is currently used as a feed additive against coccidiosis in poultry worldwide. It has been clinically observed that <b>maduramicin</b> can cause skeletal muscle and heart cell damage, resulting in skeletal muscle degeneration, heart failure, and even death in animals and humans, if improperly used. However, the mechanism of its toxic action in myoblasts is not well understood. Using mouse myoblasts (C 2 C 12) and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD and Rh 30) cells as an experimental model for myoblasts, here we found that <b>maduramicin</b> inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that <b>maduramicin</b> induced accumulation of the cells at G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in the cells. Concurrently, <b>maduramicin</b> downregulated protein expression of cyclin D 1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK 4 and CDK 6), and CDC 25 A, and upregulated expression of the CDK inhibitors (p 21 Cip 1 and p 27 Kip 1), resulting in decreased phosphorylation of Rb. <b>Maduramicin</b> also induced expression of BAK, BAD, DR 4, TRADD and TRAIL, leading to activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3 as well as cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Taken together, our results suggest that <b>maduramicin</b> executes its toxicity in myoblasts at least by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptotic cell death...|$|E

One group of 212 calves aged five to eight months suffered a mortality of 51 per cent in eight days and a total mortality of 56 per cent dur-ing the 40 days in which mortality was recorded.

In cattle, monensin and lasalocid are approved for use as growth promotants and have been incorporated into cattle feedstuffs on a large scale for many years. These iono-phores have been the cause of many toxicoses in growing cattle (Wardrope and others 1983, Schweitzer and others 1984, Blanchard and others 1993), usually involving acute toxicoses, but occasionally inducing chronic intoxications (Shlosberg and others 1986). Madu-ramicin is approved only as a coccidiostat in broiler chickens and turkeys, at a concentration of 5 g/tonne of feed. It was suspected (Perl and others 1991) and later shown to be the cause of chronic (Shlosberg and others 1992) or subacute (Fourie and others 1991) cardiomyopathy syndromes in cattle fed poultry litter from madu-ramicin-treated broilers. In cattle in Israel, the toxicoses were usually associated with feeding poultry litter containing residues of up to 12 ppm of <b>maduramicin,</b> or with the ingestion of large amounts of poul-try litter containing as little as 2 ppm.

40|$|The epidemiological, {{clinical}} and clinical pathological findings in 20 cattle and 4 sheep from 15 outbreaks of poultry litter toxicity in South Africa {{over the past}} 6 years are documented. In 6 outbreaks, the litter emanated from batteries where <b>maduramicin</b> had been incorporated into rations of broilers. According to circumstantial evidence the litter involved in the 9 other outbreaks was also derived from broilers which had been fed on rations containing an ionophore. The litter was fed ad libitum to the affected stock or constituted 30 - 80 % by volume of their rations. The principal sign manifested was sudden mortality of up to 70 % of the herd or flock, usually within 20 - 40 days of commencement of feeding of poultry litter. A few cattle developed signs of congestive heart failure, and stiffness was commonly seen in sheep. In a dosing trial with poultry litter involving 1 steer and 6 sheep, the steer and a sheep died suddenly and a second sheep was destroyed in extremis. Tachycardia and/or cardiac arrythmia were recorded in 5 sheep, and the activity of aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or lactate dehydrogenase (LD) in the sera of 4 was elevated.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{an account of}} the gross and histopathological lesions of 20 cattle and four sheep in 15 field outbreaks of poultry litter toxicity, one steer fed ad lib. and six sheep dosed with toxic poultry litter, and ten sheep fed experimental rations containing c 2, 5 ppm and 5 ppm <b>maduramicin.</b> The principle macroscopic lesions in most cattle that died in field outbreaks were indicative of congestive heart failure. The lesions in sheep were similar, but generally milder. Cardiac dilatation was observed in both sheep and cattle. Microscopically, the cardiac lesions were more pronounced in cattle and comprised varying degrees of atrophy, hypertrophy, degeneration, necrosis of myocardial fibres, and interstitial fibrosis. Skeletal muscle lesions were usually more severe in sheep, particularly in the muscles of the hindquarters which appeared pale, oedematous and mottled. One of the sheep in the poultry litter dosing trial developed signs of congestive heart failure and the hearts of two others were dilated. Extensive hypertrophy and atrophy of myocardial fibres were evident in the steer fed ad lib. with this material. As in field cases, the myocardial lesions of the sheep were less severe than those of the steer. Mild cardiac dilatation was present in four of the seven sheep in the <b>maduramicin</b> feeding trial. Diffuse hypertrophy of myocardial nuclei was present in all seven cases, myocardial fibre atrophy in six, multifocal fibrosis and necrosis in six and two cases, respectively, and focal endocardial thickening in two. The skeletal muscles revealed granular degeneration and foci of necrosis and regeneration. The cardiac and skeletal lesions in the field outbreaks, poultry litter feeding trials and <b>maduramicin</b> feeding trials, were highly comparable. This suggests that this form of poultry litter intoxication is a chronic form of ionophore toxicity, the pathology of which is characterized by a dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure and mild (cattle) to severe (sheep) skeletal muscle lesions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of anticoccidial agents on production and reproduction of broiler breeders. In Experiment 1, nicarbazin (NCZ) was fed at 20, 50, and 100 ppm. There was no depression in egg production, egg weight, or fertility from feeding these levels. As level of NCZ increased, there was a linear decrease in hatchability. The amount of 4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) in the egg yolks increased linearly as the levels of NCZ went up; the degree of egg-shell depigmentation was directly related to the level of NCZ fed starting at 50 ppm. Experiment 2 utilized a different strain of broiler breeders. Halofuginone (3 ppm), <b>maduramicin</b> (5 ppm), monensin (100 ppm), narasin (70 ppm), NCZ (125 ppm), robenidine (33 ppm), and salinomycin (60 ppm) were fed to broiler breeders at the levels listed. Only NCZ reduced egg production. Narasin induced a reduction in egg weight. Both narasin and salinomycin caused a significant drop in hatchability. Feeding NCZ also induced a rapid and more severe decrease in hatchability. Monensin was the only anticoccidial agent that reduced fertility. Halofuginone, <b>maduramicin,</b> and robenidine had no biologically significant effect on hen-day production, egg weight, hatch of fertile eggs, or shell depigmentation.

The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For calf feed an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for <b>maduramicin</b> ammonium alpha and semduramicin sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix.

In Experiment 1, nicarbazin (NCZ) was fed at 0, 20, 50, and 100 ppm. Hen-day egg production, egg weight, the egg-yolk DNC (4 - 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide) level, and egg-yolk mottling were affected by the treatments. When response was evidenced, the relationship between those variables and the level of NCZ was basically linear. Decreased egg production occurred from Days 5 and 6 of the treatment through Days 1 and 2 of withdrawal. On Days 9 and 10 of treatment, the control hens peaked at 92 % hen-day production, while hens fed 20, 50, and 100 ppm of NCZ peaked late-at 90, 82, and 80 %, respectively. Compared to the controls, egg weight was reduced linearly as the level of dietary NCZ increased. The egg-yolk DNC level increased from Days 3 and 4 of treatment through Days 9 and i 0 of withdrawal. Egg yolk mottling generally increased along with the level and duration of feeding NCZ.

Properly grinded and homogenized feed sample was spiked with internal standard (monesin methyl ester) and extracted with methanol. The extract was analysed with reversed phase HPLC without any further purification. The separation of the analytes with conventional C 18 and core-shell columns was compared. Lasalocid was analysed with fluorescence detection, whereas other ionophores were detected with UV-Vis detector after derivatisation with vanillin in the presence of sulfuric acid. Fortified samples and targeted feeds at authorized levels were used for method validation. Recovery was in the range of 85 – 110 %, depending on the analyte. The within-laboratory reproducibility did not exceed the target value from Horwitz equation. The results of the proficiency tests (z-scores in the range of − 1. 0 to 1. 9) confirmed the reliability of the developed protocol. 1...|$|E
40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, lasalocid sodium, salinomycin, narasin, <b>maduramicin</b> and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (robenidine, decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|E
40|$|A new and fit {{to purpose}} multi-analyte method for the {{determination}} of six coccidiostats (monensin A, salinomycin, narasin, composed of its principle components narasin A and its minor component narasin I, lasalocid, semduramicin and <b>maduramicin)</b> in poultry and cattle compound feed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed and in-house validated. The concentration level of the target analytes at which the validation experiments {{have been carried out}} varied between 1 and 9 mg kg. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by a clean-up by solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified either by matrix matched standards or by the standard addition technique, obtaining the following performance profile of the method for the various analyte/matrix combinations. When quantifying against matrix matched standards, the concentration independent intermediate precision expressed in terms of relative percentage standard deviation varied between 4 and 10 % and the relative percentage recovery rates ranged from 87 to 120 % depending on the target analyte and matrix. When using the standard addition technique, the corresponding values for the intermediate precision varied between 2 and 8 % and the relative percentage recovery rate ranged from 73 to 115 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix combinations but were in all cases below 0. 014 mg kg and 0. 046 mg kg respectively. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for {{the determination of}} ionophore coccidiostats in target feed. The main field of application of the validated method is to enforce European legislation regarding the authorisation of coccidiostats, focusing on the measurement at the authorised levels and at low level in feed during the withdrawal period at which the coccidiostats must not be added to the feed. Overall, the method proposed appears to be appropriate as a confirmatory method for the monitoring of these six ionophore coccidiostats and can therefore be considered as complimentary to the official PHLC-UV methods.

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistant}} {{strains of}} bacteria are increasingly prevalent {{all over the}} world. Better understanding of the resistance occurrence and spread is needed to stop this development. A narasin (Nar) resistance gene was recently discovered on the same plasmid as a vancomycin (Van) resistant gene (Nar/vanA plasmid). This study sought {{to examine the relationship}} between the ionophore coccidiostat Nar used in rearing of broiler chicken and the clinically important antibiotic vancomycin and initiate the characterization of the molecular mechanism of Nar resistance. Strains of Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) isolated from Norwegian poultry production had previously been examined for the presence of the Nar resistance genes (encoding an ATPase and ABC transporter) of the Nar operon). The Nar operons from a subset of these strains were sequenced and analysed for differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Strains with varying Nar resistance were also screened for resistance of four ionophores currently authorised for use in Norway. Nine different Nar operons were also introduced into separate cells of Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH 5 and the drug-hypersensitive E. coli DH 5 acrAB and cross-resistance were determined by screening a panel of antibiotics. Lastly, an experiment was designed to determine if a selective pressure of Nar could enhance conjugational transfer of the Nar/vanA plasmid between strains of E. faecium. Translated ATPase and ABC transporter differed only at three and one amino acid positions, respectively, when compared to the consensus sequence. These differences did not seem to explain the variation in Nar resistance. No cross-resistance was found between the antimicrobials for E. coli DH 5 nor the E. coli DH 5 acrAB carrying their individual Nar operons. Results indicate that there is a correlation between resistance to Nar, and the ionophores Salinomycin and <b>Maduramicin,</b> but not Monensin and Lasolacid. Findings also suggest that a reduced Nar susceptibility can be co-transferred with the vanA resistance gene without the selective pressure of Nar. Indeed, use of Nar may have taken part, and may still take part in the persistence of Van resistance in enterococci if introduced back into rearing practices. Yet, further research is necessary...|$|E
