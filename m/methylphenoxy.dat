25|$|Both enantiomers of {{fluoxetine}} bind to the extracellular vestibule on the LeuT {{protein is}} {{such a way that}} the three fluorine atoms of the <b>methylphenoxy</b> ring bind into the HBP that is formed by Leu25, Gly26, Leu29, Arg30 and Tyr108. The halogens additionally make Van der Waals interaction with Leu29 and Tyr108, where the (S)-enantiomer additionally binds to Phe253 and makes Van der Waals contact with it among with previously mentioned amino acids. Because of the (S)-enantiomers opposite chirality to the (R)-enantiomer the rest of the molecule is reversed in the HBP, where the amine tail points towards the extracellular space and interacts with the N-terminal of Leu400, Asp401 and Ala319 (amino acids which are a part of the TM10). In this LeuT bound form the complex is rather rigid. The <b>methylphenoxy</b> ring rotates about the O5-C6 bond by 46 degrees for the (R)-enantiomer and 16 degrees for the (S)-enantiomer, but rigidity in the molecular structure indicates that the drug maintains its low-energy configuration upon binding to its protein target.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT {{rainfall}} intensity, and {{the timing}} and method of applica-Macropore flow is a key factor determining pesticide fate, but models accounting for this process need parameters that cannot be easily measured. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the use of tion of the solute (Coles and Trudgill, 1985; Flury et al., 1994; Magesan et al., 1995; Kätterer et al., 2001). This knowledge and understanding has underpinned the de-inverse techniques to estimate parameters controlling macropore flow velopment {{of a large number of}} models that include and pesticide fate in the dual-permeability model MACRO. Undisturbed columns were sampled at three landscape positions (hilltop, slope, hollow) with contrasting texture and organic carbon content. Transient leaching experiments were performed for an anionic tracer and the herbicide MCPA (4 -chloro- 2 <b>methylphenoxy</b> acetic acid) dur-ing a 4 -mo period, first under natural rainfall, and then under controlled irrigation in the laboratory.

40|$|Changes {{in farming}} {{practices}} over long times {{can affect the}} sorption behaviour of MCPA ((4 -chloro- 2 - <b>methylphenoxy)</b> acetic acid). We studied the adsorption±desorption mechanisms of MCPA on soil with varied amounts and origins of soil organic matter obtained from a long-term field experiment with various organic amendments. The origin of the soil organic matter seems to be crucial for the sorption behaviour of MCPA. Samples of soil amended with sewage sludge sorbed MCPA more strongly than the soil under any other treatment. Peat-amended soil was second followed by soil receiving animal manure, green manure, mineral fertilizer without N and the fallowed soil. Both the carbon content and {{the origin of the}} organic matter are important for the sorption. A decrease of carbon content of a soil does not necessarily imply a reduction of sorption capacity for polar organic acids such as MCPA. Nevertheless, our adsorption±desorption experiments suggest that with decreasing carbon content the role of mineral sorption mechanisms could become more pronounced. Our results showed that interactions of soil organic matter and soil minerals distinctly influence adsorption properties for MCPA...|$|E
40|$|Addition of ATP to {{a highly}} {{purified}} fraction of rat liver nuclei incubated with submicromolar concentrations of Ca 2 + and trace amounts of 45 Ca 2 + resulted in the rapid accumulation of 45 Ca 2 + in the nuclei. This was associated {{with an increase in}} intranuclear free Ca 2 + concentration as measured with the fluorescent dye 1 -[2 -(5 -carboxyoxazol- 2 -yl) - 6 -aminobenzofuran- 5 -oxy]- 2 -(2 '-a mino- 5 '- <b>methylphenoxy)</b> ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (fura- 2). Inhibitors of microsomal and mitochondrial Ca 2 + translocases had no effect on nuclear Ca 2 + sequestration, indicating that it was distinct from previously known intracellular Ca 2 +-transporting systems. Ca 2 + uptake and the associated increase in intranuclear free Ca 2 + concentration were prevented by calmidazolium, a potent calmodulin antagonist. Partial characterization of the ATP-stimulated nuclear Ca 2 + uptake showed that maximal rates of Ca 2 + uptake and increase in intranuclear free Ca 2 + level occurred at concentrations of Ca 2 + normally present in the cytosol of mammalian cells. Together, these results show that a distinct, ATP- and calmodulin-dependent Ca 2 + uptake system exists in liver nuclei. This system may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of intranuclear Ca 2 +-dependent processes...|$|E
40|$|Tricresylphosphate (TCP) [(CH 3 C 6 H 4 O) 3 PO] is {{the most}} {{commonly}} tested vapor phase lubricant and is readily available as a mixture containing all three isomers (ortho-, meta-, and para-) of the cresyl groups. The surface chemistry of ortho-, meta- and para-TCP on Fe foil was studied {{in order to examine}} the possible differences in decomposition mechanisms among the isomers. All three TCP isomers decomposed by the same reaction mechanisms and with roughly the same kinetics on Fe. Upon heating, they decomposed on the Fe surface to deposit carbon and phosphorous and produce gas phase H 2, CO, toluene and cresol. The amounts of carbon and phosphorous deposited onto the Fe surface by TCP (arylphosphate) decomposition were compared to those deposited by decomposition of tributylphosphate (TBP), an alkylphosphate. Thermal decomposition of all three TCP isomers deposits sub-stantial amounts of carbon ono the Fe surface while TBP decomposition does not. We suggest that it is the lack of -CH bonds in the <b>methylphenoxy</b> intermediates and the high reactivity of the tolyl intermediates generated during TCP decomposition are the primary reasons for the differences in behavior of TCP and TBP and the root cause of the differences in behavior of arylphosphates and alkyphosphates as vapor phase lubricants...|$|E
