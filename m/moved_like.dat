5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be <b>moved.</b> <b>Like</b> other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E
25|$|At the contest, the Tolmachevy Sisters {{were joined}} on stage by four backing vocalists: Anna Nilsson, Jenny Tärneberg, Anna Strandberg and Rui Andrade. The Russian {{performance}} featured the Tolmachevy Sisters performing with long translucent sticks and interacting with a platform that <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> a balance and eventually opened {{into a white}} sun-like canvas.|$|E
25|$|Zwicky also {{considered}} the possibility of rearranging the universe to our own liking. In a lecture in 1948 he spoke of changing planets, or relocating them within the solar system. In the 1960s he even considered how the whole solar system might be <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> a giant spaceship to travel to other stars. He considered this might be achieved by firing pellets into the Sun to produce asymmetrical fusion explosions, and by this means {{he thought that the}} star Alpha Centauri might be reached within 2500 years.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} space battle, Bill George {{redesigned}} the photon torpedoes {{to have a}} hotter core and larger flare, because {{he felt that the}} weapons in earlier films looked [...] "too pretty". The torpedoes also <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> guided missiles rather than cannonballs. George told Farrar that he had always wanted to see something penetrate the thin saucer section of the Enterprise, so a replica of the saucer was recreated and blown up; the model was hung upside down so that the explosion could be flipped to approximate the zero gravity effects. Rather than destroy the Bird of Prey model in the climax, pyrotechnic footage was reduced and placed in the appropriate locations to simulate rippling explosions throughout the vessel.|$|E
500|$|Midway {{through their}} unbeaten run, City faced Tottenham Hotspur {{at home in}} snowy conditions, in a match {{televised}} on Match of the Day. As the teams came out onto the frozen pitch, commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme called the Manchester City team as [...] "the most exciting team in England". Aided by a modification to the studs on their boots suggested by Tony Book, City produced one of their best footballing performances in their history. One Spurs player was quoted as saying, [...] "It was extraordinary. City <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> Olympic speed skaters while we were falling around like clowns on a skid patch." [...] Tottenham took an early lead through Jimmy Greaves, but Bell equalised before half-time, {{and in the second}} half City besieged Tottenham, scoring three more times to win 4–1. After the match City trailed the league leaders by only a single point.|$|E
500|$|Pascal's supervising {{animator}} Lino DiSalvo {{told the}} Los Angeles Times {{that at one}} point the animators [...] "weren't getting enough entertainment out of Pascal." [...] DiSalvo elaborated, [...] "originally, he was very realistic. He <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> a real chameleon," [...] which in turn depicted him as very [...] "cold." [...] By exaggerating the character's shape and face, the animators eventually [...] "amped [...] up" [...] in order to make him funnier. The name [...] "Pascal" [...] was borrowed from a pet chameleon owned by Tangled animator Kellie Lewis. During production, Lewis' other pet chameleon and Pascal's mate hatched six eggs, in turn making Pascal a father. In tribute to Pascal, the directors included a [...] "Chameleon Babies" [...] credit in the film's closing credits, parodying the more traditional [...] "Production babies" [...] credit, while Lewis herself received a [...] "Chameleon Wrangler" [...] credit.|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. In The New York Times Book Review, author Stephen King stated the Goblet of Fire was [...] "every bit {{as good as}} Potters1 through 3" [...] and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that [...] "there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing". Kirkus Reviews called it [...] "another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two [...] "bad guys" [...] stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave [...] "many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable". For The Horn Book Magazine, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying [...] "some will find [...] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs". A Publishers Weekly review praised the book's [...] "red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience" [...] and saying it [...] "might be her most thrilling yet." [...] Writing for The New Yorker, Joan Acocella noted that [...] "where the prior volumes <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{gameplay}} garnered a mixed reception from critics, though the game's control scheme {{received the most}} criticism. A reviewer from GamePro criticized the control configuration and felt that the game was a mediocre example of a pinball game, but admitted {{that it had a}} similar feel to previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles. Jeuxvideo.com's reviewer enjoyed how Sonic himself acted as a pinball, but noticed that the controls were less precise and responsive when compared to other platformers. Whitehead asserted that the game's controls were [...] "muddled by the half-and-half approach" [...] and criticized its [...] "clunky" [...] game engine, saying that the game's control scheme ruined the pinball environments. Thomas stated [...] "there are aspects of the control that could have been tighter, and its difficulty level may be a bit too extreme for new players." [...] Damien McFarren from NintendoLife said that the game comes across as both a poor platformer and a poor pinball game due to its unconvincing ball physics and frustrating platform elements. Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly felt the game initially boasted a [...] "terrific" [...] concept but had an ultimately flawed execution—saying that Sonic, acting as a pinball, often <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "leaden marble". Rich Leadbetter from Mean Machines also expressed concern over the game's lack of replay value, saying that despite its addictive gameplay the game's four levels were not enough, especially given its high price.|$|E

The family real name was Hajdari but since his father played in Yugoslav league they {{switched}} it to [...] "Ajdarević". His father Agim Ajdarević {{was a member of}} FK Spartak Subotica in the Yugoslav First League in the 1980s and 1990s, and later when Agim moved to Sweden in 1992, he signed with Falkenbergs FF. His elder brother Astrit was also part of Falkenbergs FF such as their father and also started youth career at Rinia IF. His other elder brother, Arben is also a footballer.|$|E
2500|$|While {{disc-shaped}} {{flying objects}} have been interpreted as being sporadically recorded since the Middle Ages, the first recorded {{use of the}} term [...] "flying saucer" [...] for an unidentified flying object was to describe a probable meteor that fell over Texas and Oklahoma on June 17, 1930. [...] "Some who saw the weird light described it as a huge comet, a flaming flying saucer, a great red glow, a ball of fire." [...] The highly publicized sighting by Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947, resulted in the popularity of the term [...] "flying saucer" [...] by U.S. newspapers. [...] Although Arnold never specifically used the term [...] "flying saucer", he was quoted at the time saying the shape of the objects he saw was like a [...] "saucer", [...] "disc", or [...] "pie-plate", and several years later added he had also said [...] "the objects <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> saucers skipping across the water." [...] Both the terms flying saucer and flying disc were used commonly and interchangeably in the media until the early 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Cherubim feature at {{some length}} in the Book of Ezekiel. While they first appear in chapter one, {{in which they are}} {{transporting}} the throne of Yahweh by the river Chebar, they are not called cherubim until chapter 10. In Ezekiel 1:5-11 they are described as having the likeness of a man, and having four faces: that of a man, a lion (on the right side), and ox (on the left side), and an eagle. The four faces represent the four domains of God's rule: the man represents humanity; the lion, wild animals; the ox, domestic animals; and the eagle, birds. These faces peer out from the center of an array of four wings; these wings are joined to each other, two of these are stretched upward, and the other two cover their bodies. Under their wings are human hands; their legs are described as straight, and their feet like those of a calf, shining like polished brass. Between the creatures glowing coals that moved between them could be seen, their fire [...] "went up and down", and lightning burst forth from it. The cherubs also <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> flashes of lightning.|$|E

2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody <b>moved</b> <b>like</b> Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour. In some instances, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wore T-shirts depicting Jackson during the performances.|$|E
