5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E

5|$|Amanita bisporigera {{belongs to}} section Phalloideae {{of the genus}} Amanita, which {{contains}} some of the deadliest Amanita species, including A.phalloides and A.virosa. This classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section Phalloideae form a clade—that is, they derive from a common ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.exitialis, and A.virosa. The Guangzhou destroying angel (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored basidia, like A.bisporigera.|$|E
