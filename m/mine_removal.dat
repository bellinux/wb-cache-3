25|$|In {{times of}} {{relative}} peace, {{the process of}} <b>mine</b> <b>removal</b> {{is referred to as}} demining. This is a thorough, time-intensive process that seeks to locate all mines so that the land or sea area may be safely returned to normal use. It is vital that this process be exhaustive. Even if only a small handful of mines remain undiscovered, incomplete demining can actually lead to an increase in civilian mine casualties as local people re-occupy an area they previously avoided in the belief that it has been made safe. In this context demining is one of the tools of mine action. Coordinated by Mine Action Coordination Centers run by the United Nations or a host government, civilian mine clearance agencies are tasked with the demining. In post-conflict areas, minefields are often contaminated with a mixture of explosive remnants of war (ERW) that includes unexploded ordnance as well as landmines. In that context, the humanitarian clearance effort {{is often referred to as}} battle area clearance.|$|E
25|$|German forces {{held the}} Dunkirk Pocket through the Siege of Dunkirk {{to the end}} of the war, when they surrendered. 10,000 Germans were taken {{prisoner}} on 9 May 1945. 3,700 Germans were kept in the Dunkirk area, with many at the Fort des Dunes. The prisoners were engaged in cleanup and <b>mine</b> <b>removal.</b> After the departure of the prisoners the fort was transferred to the customs service, who used it as a storage centre for seized goods. A customs officer and his family lived at the fort. The fort went back to the army in 1955, which began excavations to recover the remains of those killed in 1940. A ceremony of re-interment was held in August 1955, attended by the widow of General Janssen. The fort was then abandoned for twenty years. In 1978 a local organization was formed to preserve the fort as a center for military reserve functions. By 1990 the fort had been made habitable.|$|E

Two work arms were mounted on the robot, one was a horizontal multi-joint SCARA type with motorized 2 -link arm, while the other was a vertical multi-joint manipulator with 6 degrees of freedom. Also, domestic evaluation tests were carried out from February to March, 2005, followed by overseas validation tests in Croatia from February to March, 2006. These tests were conducted with a mine detecting senor mounted on the Robot, and the detection performance was evaluated by its mine detection rate...|$|E
