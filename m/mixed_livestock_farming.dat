A mathematical programming model is built to simulate various intensification levels characterizing different technical pathways within the different farm activities (cattle breeding, forage fields, arboriculture).

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and compare the most significant sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soils within a typical <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farm</b> in Scotland. The farm area can be considered as representative of agricultural soils in this region where outdoor grazing forms an important part of the animal husbandry. A high temporal resolution dynamic chamber method was used to measure N 2 O fluxes from the featureless, general areas of the arable and pasture fields (general) and from those areas where large nitrogen additions are highly likely, such as animal feeding areas, manure heaps, animal barns (features). Individual N 2 O flux measurements varied by four orders of magnitude, with values ranging from − 5. 5 to 80, 000 μg N 2 O-N m− 2 h− 1. The log-normal distribution of the fluxes required the use of more complex statistics to quantify uncertainty, including a Bayesian approach which provided a robust and transparent method for “upscaling” i. e. translating small-scale observations to larger scales, with appropriate propagation of uncertainty. Mean N 2 O fluxes associated with the features were typically one to four orders of magnitude larger than those measured on the general areas of the arable and pasture fields. During warmer months, when widespread grazing takes place across the farm, the smaller N 2 O fluxes of the largest area source – the general field (99. 7 % of total area) – dominated the overall N 2 O emissions. The contribution from the features should still be considered important, given that up to 91 % of the fluxes may come from only 0. 3 % of the area under certain conditions, especially in the colder winter months when manure heaps and animal barns continue to produce emissions while soils reach temperatures unfavourable for microbial activity (< 5 °C) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to invest in}} pasture improvement raises various questions for the livestock grazier, with the most pertinent being about the potential returns and risks. In the high rainfall zone of south-west Victoria, researchers have trialled novel perennial pasture systems {{with the aim of}} substantially increasing on-farm profits whilst simultaneously improving environmental outcomes. Results from the Hamilton EverGraze® proof site have shown potential to greatly improve livestock production. Promotion of the pasture technology is the next step. Key to this process is developing information about profitability and risk regarding the {{decision to}} invest in the new pasture. To help meet this need a model of a representative <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farm</b> system for the region has been developed to generate information about profit, cash wealth and risk to aid extension and help inform decisions. The farm is comprised of a wool and meat producing sheep system and a beef enterprise. Using the model, the performance of two of the novel pasture systems can be evaluated against current practice, and compared to determine which of the two is the most beneficial EverGraze® option for the future. The risk associated with the pasture decision is assessed by considering different price structures and seasonal outcomes, and evaluating these effects on net benefits. Discounted cash flows, net present values and internal rates of return are estimated for the alternative systems, which include the effects of this price and seasonal variability. Preliminary results have been calculated, however further work is needed to confirm these. The method and results of the analysis provide information that is valuable for farm decisions about investing in a new pasture system and provide a basis for future economic analyses at the case study site and elsewhere.
