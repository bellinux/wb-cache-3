40|$|Abstract- Phishing is a {{new type}} of network attack where the {{attacker}} creates a replica of an existing web page to fool users in to submitting personal, financial, or password data to what they think is their service provider‟s website. The concept is an end-host based anti-phishing algorithm, called the Link Guard, by utilizing the generic characteristics of the hyperlinks in phishing attacks. The link Guard algorithm is the concept for finding the phishing emails sent by the phisher to grasp the information of the end user. Link Guard is based on the careful analysis of the characteristics of phishing hyperlinks. Each end user is implemented with Link Guard algorithm. After doing so the end user recognizes the phishing emails and can avoid responding to such <b>mails.</b> Since Link <b>Guard</b> is characteristics based it can detect and prevent not only known phishing attacks but also unknown ones.
