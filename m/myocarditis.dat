5|$|On August 22, {{three months}} after the bombing, fourth-grader Beatrice Gibbs died {{following}} hip surgery. Hers was the 45th and final death directly attributable to the Bath School disaster, which made it the most deadly attack ever to occur in an American school. Richard Fritz, brother of Marjorie Fritz, was injured in the explosion and died almost one year later of <b>myocarditis.</b> Though Fritz is not included on many lists of the victims, his death from <b>myocarditis</b> is thought to have been brought on by an infection because of his injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1865 {{he married}} Julia Elisabeth, {{the sister of}} his close friend, the banker and philanthropist A.C. Wertheim. They had two children. He was an ardent swimmer, and wrote poetry under several pseudonyms. He spoke several languages. He died in Amsterdam shortly after {{returning}} from a holiday in Ireland, from what {{was thought to be}} <b>myocarditis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (<b>myocarditis)</b> or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute <b>myocarditis</b> at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|White never {{remarried}} {{following his}} wife's death in 1915. In addition to White's church activities, {{he served as}} a master of the Masonic Lodge, and was affiliated with the Odd Fellows. Beginning in 1934, White endured 18 months of illness, and on August 14, 1935, his physician Dr. R. W. Dailey reported to the Cumberland Evening Times that he was in critical condition and was unlikely to recover. White succumbed to his illness and died at his residence in Romney on August 15, 1935 at the age of 59 as a result of arteriosclerosis. <b>Myocarditis</b> also contributed to his prolonged illness but was not the cause of his death. White was interred with Masonic rites on Saturday afternoon, August 17, 1935 at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. A number of state officials attended his funeral.|$|E
25|$|Other rare {{complications}} of acute hepatitis include pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and <b>myocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrocardiogram {{may show}} {{evidence}} of ventricular dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia due to <b>myocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 25, 1918 Miraglia died at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County of <b>myocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carditis: Inflammation of {{the heart}} muscle (<b>myocarditis)</b> which can {{manifest}} as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac MRI is {{complementary}} {{to other}} imaging techniques, such as echocardiography, cardiac CT, and nuclear medicine. Its applications include assessment of myocardial ischemia and viability, cardiomyopathies, <b>myocarditis,</b> iron overload, vascular diseases, and congenital heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Nuvolari {{was married}} to Carolina Perina, and {{together}} they had two children: Giorgio (born 4 September 1918), who died in 1937 aged 19 from <b>myocarditis,</b> and Alberto, who died in 1946 aged 18 from nephritis.|$|E
25|$|Diphtheria is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe. They usually start two to five days after exposure. Symptoms often come on fairly gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, a grey or white patch develops in the throat. This can block the airway and create a barking cough as in croup. The neck may swell {{in part due to}} large lymph nodes. A form of diphtheria that involves the skin, eyes, or genitals also exists. Complications may include <b>myocarditis,</b> inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding problems due to low blood platelets. <b>Myocarditis</b> may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myocarditis</b> is a {{sometimes}} fatal {{side effect of}} clozapine, which usually develops within {{the first month of}} commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced <b>myocarditis</b> is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas, {{is the most}} common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include <b>myocarditis,</b> hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.|$|E
25|$|SLE {{may cause}} {{pericarditis}} - {{inflammation of the}} outer lining surrounding the heart, <b>myocarditis</b> - inflammation of the heart muscle, and/or endocarditis - inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. The endocarditis of SLE is non-infectious, and is also called (Libman–Sacks endocarditis). It involves either the mitral valve or the tricuspid valve. Atherosclerosis also occurs more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{apparently}} contracted chronic malaria {{while in}} Nicaragua in 1870 and 1871 on the surveying expedition. Repeated bouts of malaria took {{a toll on}} his health, which became poor enough in 1904 {{to force him to}} relinquish command of the Asiatic Fleet and retire. He returned to the United States but never completely recovered, and died at Morristown, New Jersey, on 29 December 1912 of interstitial <b>myocarditis</b> and general arteriosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Hana, age 54, died in Wellington Hospital at 3:35 p.m. on 15 January 2012 of {{suspected}} viral <b>myocarditis.</b> However, {{he was suffering}} medical problems stemming from heavy alcohol use and malnutrition. A temporary shrine was created outside the ANZ Bank on Courtenay Place, a location where Hana could often be found. Messages were written on the building's facade, and flowers, candles, food and other items were left in tribute.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{also carries}} five black box warnings, {{including}} warnings for agranulocytosis, {{central nervous system}} depression, leukopenia, neutropenia, seizure disorder, bone marrow suppression, dementia, hypotension, <b>myocarditis,</b> orthostatic hypotension (with or without syncope) and seizures. Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} {{most commonly}} occurs within diseased hearts, and, {{in the vast}} majority of cases, is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease. Ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy, <b>myocarditis,</b> and other heart pathologies. In addition, it is seen with electrolyte imbalance, overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs, and following near drowning or major trauma. It is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause, the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|In up to 25% of patients, no {{focus of}} {{infection}} is found and {{the diagnosis is}} usually made on blood cultures or throat swab. Melioidosis {{is said to be}} able to affect any organ in the body except the heart valves (endocarditis). Although meningitis has been described secondary to ruptured brain abscesses, primary meningitis has not been described. Less common manifestations include intravascular infection, lymph node abscesses (1.22.2%), pyopericardium and <b>myocarditis,</b> mediastinal infection, and thyroid and scrotal abscesses and ocular infection.|$|E
25|$|If a {{word came}} from a {{language}} using the Latin script, they are only respelled if they have become an integral, widely known part of Hungarian language (e.g. laser > lézer, manager > menedzser). If they are less widely used they retain their original spelling, e.g. bestseller, <b>myocarditis,</b> rinascimento. There is no hard and consistent rule and many widely used terms are written in the original spelling, e.g. musical or show. Certain Phrases from foreign languages are always written in their original form, even if the individual words would be respelled in isolation, e.g. tuberkulózis cf. tuberculosis bronchialis.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, <b>myocarditis,</b> nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making {{it very hard to}} breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, <b>myocarditis,</b> and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|Clara married Leonard in 1872 {{and they}} removed to Beatrice, Nebraska. Although {{they never had}} {{children}} of their own, they adopted a boy, Clarence (born ca. 1882), in 1885 from an Orphan Train. In 1891, Leonard returned home from the Battle of Wounded Knee with a Sioux baby, Zintkala Nuni (Lost Bird) and adopted her; Clara was away at this time, lecturing on suffrage issues. Leonard left with Lost Bird's nursemaid, and the Colbys divorced in 1906. The child was raised by Clara. A lifelong Congregationalist, Colby nonetheless {{had an interest in}} the New Thought spiritual movement; she served as an honorary leadership role in the International New Thought Alliance. Her health faded in her final years, and Colby died at her sister's home in Palo Alto in 1916 of pneumonia and <b>myocarditis.</b> Her ashes were buried in her childhood hometown of Windsor.|$|E
25|$|Five {{more cases}} were {{confirmed}} on 14 August. A two-month-old baby {{who was born}} prematurely {{was admitted to the}} hospital after suffering from fever, coughing, sneezing and difficulty in breathing. His condition deteriorate and was later put on mechanical ventilation. Antiviral drugs were given but he died on 12 August due to pneumonia. Another two-month-old baby {{was rushed to the hospital}} when he was found unconscious. His condition was critical and was sent to ICU. He tested positive for the flu on 8 August, bue died on 10 August due to <b>myocarditis,</b> hepatitis and renal impairment due to H1N1. A 49-year-old diabetic woman, who was also obese and having tuberculosis was confirmed to have the virus on 11 August. A 57-year-old diabetic man sought for treatment on 2 August after showing symptoms of the flu. On 3 August, he returned to the clinic after experiencing fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. He was then sent to hospital and given antiviral drugs. Despite given antiviral drugs, he died on 12 August due to sepsis. A 19-year-old teenager was admitted to the hospital after complaining having fever and coughing. He was then suffocated and died on 11 August due to pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|A 4-month-old {{baby who}} had an {{extremely}} low immunity was hospitalised on 8 August 2009 after he showed symptoms of fever, breathing difficulty, vomiting, coughing and diarrhoea. Throat swab was conducted, but he died on 10 August due to severe pneumonia. Lab result confirmed he had Influenza A(H1N1) on the next day, making {{him one of the}} victims of the flu. A 37-year-old diabetic woman was hospitalised after showing symptoms. She was later given antiviral drugs but died on 10 August. A 69-year-old woman who had history of hypertension was found to have been coughing. Throat swab was conducted after she was transferred to ICU due to suffocation. On 11 August 2009, she died due to acute <b>myocarditis.</b> A woman in her 20s, who also had a history of congenital disease, started to have fever and coughing on 6 August. She was later admitted and given antiviral drugs on 8 August. However, she died on 10 August due to severe bronchopneumonia. A 4-year-old boy who had congenital disease was treated on 2 August after exhibiting symptoms of the flu. He was later confirmed to have the flu after throat swab was taken, however, he died before the confirmation. A 92-year-old lady who had asthma and a 43-year-old man who had diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases died on 11 August 2009 due to severe pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|When a {{newspaper}} interviewer {{asked her how}} {{she would like to}} be remembered, she said, [...] "In a museum, when male supremacy is dead. I'd like my work to be an anthropological artifact from an extinct, primitive society". She died in her sleep on the morning of April 9, 2005, at her home in Washington, D.C. The cause of death was later determined to be acute <b>myocarditis.</b> She was 58 years old.|$|E
500|$|The 2004–05 Rockets were 51–31 under Van Gundy {{and lost}} {{in the first round}} of the 2005 NBA Playoffs to the , four games to three. [...] Although the Rockets made the playoffs, Howard's season ended on March 14, when he left a game with a sprained medial {{collateral}} ligament (MCL) in his right knee. Initially, the injury was supposed to sideline Howard for four weeks. The injury coincided with a period in which he developed symptoms of viral <b>myocarditis,</b> including heart palpitations, mild chest pains and fever and was diagnosed with a viral infection in his heart. His limited physical activity impaired his MCL rehabilitation. Over the course of the 2004–05 season, Howard achieved seven double-doubles in 61games (47starts), while averaging 9.6points and 5.7rebounds. [...] His 26.6minutes per game marked the first season that he played less than 32minutes per game.|$|E
500|$|The cardiac {{pathologist}} {{who studied}} Schiavo's heart found {{it and the}} coronary vessels to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse {{was the result of}} myocardial infarction, although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of <b>myocarditis).</b> Thogmartin found that [...] "there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia." [...] Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo's initial collapse, the report states: [...] "No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, radiographic examination of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission. Autopsy examination of her neck structures 15 years after her initial collapse did not detect any signs of remote trauma, but, with such a delay, the exam was unlikely to show any residual neck findings." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Cherepanov's death, there were many conflicting reports and accusations. [...] Early reports indicated that Cherepanov suffered from chronic myocardial ischemia, and many reports questioned Avangard Omsk's medical staff and why they were unaware of his heart condition. Other reports claimed that Cherepanov's autopsy showed evidence of <b>myocarditis.</b> Outside doctors, particularly in North America were skeptical of this early explanation, believing it unlikely that a young, elite athlete would suffer from an undiagnosed form of ischemia, particularly when considering the medical testing he underwent prior to the NHL draft. [...] Further reports out of Russia suggested a hypertrophic heart, which would be more in line with other cases of sudden death in athletes. [...] In addition to issues with {{the immediate}} cause of death for Cherepanov, Russian officials immediately launched an investigation into the emergency response by the team, facilities and paramedics on site. Initial concerns were raised as to why Cherepanov had been allowed to play, if he had a heart condition that should have been picked up by routine medical tests that he was believed to have undergone. [...] The ambulance that is required to be on duty at all KHL games had already left, as there were only five minutes left in the game, and the defibrillator in the arena was non-functional.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, <b>myocarditis</b> and cor pulmonale.|$|E

2500|$|Chadwick died {{suddenly}} at age 42 {{of a heart}} attack in 1996. Although they declared no proof, pathologists suggested a link between her heart attack and a viral infection causing a <b>myocarditis</b> [...] — an inflammation of the heart muscle that could have been triggered anywhere between the last few years of her life and the last weeks.|$|E
2500|$|At around 8:30 am on 10 March 1988, Gibb's {{doctor told}} Andy that more tests were needed. But later that day, he slumped into {{unconsciousness}} and {{died as a}} result of <b>myocarditis,</b> an inflammation of the heart muscle caused by a recent viral infection (a diagnosis supported by William Shell, a cardiologist who had previously treated Gibb), which was exacerbated by his years of cocaine abuse. Robin Gibb said [...] "he was also not eating properly and the lack of nutrition also damaged his heart," [...] adding that the paranoia associated with cocaine abuse [...] "shattered his confidence and he became scared of people." ...|$|E
