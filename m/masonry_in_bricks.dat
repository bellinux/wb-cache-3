50|$|Repointing is {{the process}} of {{renewing}} the pointing, which is the external part of mortar joints, <b>in</b> <b>masonry</b> construction. Over time, weathering and decay cause voids in the joints between <b>masonry</b> units, usually <b>in</b> <b>bricks,</b> allowing the undesirable entrance of water. Water entering through these voids can cause significant damage through frost weathering and from salt dissolution and deposition. Repointing is also called pointing, or pointing up, although these terms more properly refer to the finishing step in new construction.|$|R

The measurements are made at the <b>masonry</b> <b>brick</b> corner built <b>in</b> the laboratory equipment. The laboratory equipment was designed at Faculty of Civil Engineering VŠB – TU Ostrava for measurement tri-axial stress-strain conditions <b>in</b> <b>masonry.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>brick</b> corner one pre-stressing bar is placed. And on the pre-stressing bar is anchored to the anchor plate which transfer pre-stressing forces to the masonry. The thickness of brick corner is 440 mm and anchor plate will be used about thickness 10, 20 and 30 mm. Mathematical modelling of brick corner is based on finite element method using software ANSYS and then the results are compared with results of laboratory tests. On {{the basis of these}} results {{it should be possible to}} improve the models and to approach closer to the accurate and at the same time simple procedure for design of pre-stressed masonry...|$|R

Because of the extreme shortage of money when the railway was being built, Brunel designed timber trestle viaducts; these were much cheaper but they incurred heavy maintenance costs and were eventually reconstructed <b>in</b> <b>masonry</b> or <b>brick,</b> or <b>in</b> a few cases made into embankments. The spindly appearance of these high viaducts made passengers nervous, but they provided a marked impression associated with the line (although Brunel did use the form of construction elsewhere).

40|$|Confined masonry (CM) is {{a viable}} housing {{typology}} that is resilient and economical for developing countries in seismic regions. Given its suitability for low-tech environments, multiple authors have published instructions on CM construction {{that do not require}} engineering knowledge. As a result these guidelines impose constrictive design requirements. Analysis methods exist for calculating the stress demand on shear walls of a CM building under earthquake loads which may be applied to any design, but they require technical expertise to perform. A procedure for designing confined masonry buildings is presented that employs a combination of seismic analysis techniques to take into account torsional effects and allow for complex designs while requiring low computational effort. Parametric studies are performed on this procedure which show reliable, conservative structural design outputs. Confined masonry is a structural wall system, therefore its seismic resilience depends on the wall shear strength, which is related to the compressive strength of the <b>masonry.</b> <b>In</b> India <b>bricks</b> used to build homes are often of poor compressive strength, even lower than the minimum allowed by the Indian masonry code, which is lower than that prescribed in other international standards. Experimentation was conducted on the strength of <b>masonry</b> <b>in</b> Gujarat, India to investigate the effect of varying mortar qualities when low strength bricks are used. With average brick strengths below 2. 5 MPa a mud mortar with no cement and a 1 : 8 cement:sand ratio mortar resulted in approximately 41 % and 21 % higher prism strengths, respectively, than a 1 : 6 cement:sand ratio mortar. This shows that a mortar with less cement would save cost and result in a more resilient structure when building with bricks of this strength. Observations and hypotheses are presented for this behavior, but larger scale testing is recommended to better understand this outcome and inform better building practices that can save lives and money. by Christopher F.

40|$|The use of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wraps {{has become}} common in {{practical}} applications to retrofit existing columns with poor structural features. Wrapping the member {{with one or}} more FRP sheets makes it possible to induce confinement action and enhance strength and ductility. This application has been widely studied and adopted in reinforced concrete members for about twenty years, while its suitability to masonry columns and piers has been investigated during the last decade. The results of several studies were summarized in different design expressions for calculating effective confinement pressure, ultimate compressive stress and strain, and the overall trend of the stress-strain curve. Despite this huge amount of research, some results seem actually to be in contrast with the experimental results available in the literature, due to the different key variables arising in this application. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the main existing theoretical models to predict the stress-strain curve of FRP confined <b>masonry</b> <b>in</b> compression. Clay <b>brick</b> <b>masonry</b> is studied and criteria to obtain the strength increase are initially analyzed and compared with experimental results, evaluating the reliability of each expression. In the second part, models to calculate the overall constitutive law in compression are examined and the average error and coefficient of variation are calculated for each model...|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> general, <b>bricks</b> {{frequently}} show different densities {{and therefore}} different resistances because the compaction energy {{is not considered}} in their production. Expansive soils represent a problem for light buildings over them because of volumetric instability. A generalized solution has been to extract them and substitute them by inert soil; thus they become construction trash. So, in this work the compaction energy aspect {{and the use of}} construction trash soils in the elaboration of resistant masonry bricks of homogeneous and controlled density are a new contribution in the production of bricks of better quality. First, the soil was stabilized with CaOH which leads to a decrease in its volumetric changes. Then, they were compacted with a specific energy for obtaining an optimal and maximum controlled density to ensure an increase in strength. Our results show that two optimal compaction energies can be considered with respect to the variation of optimum moisture <b>in</b> <b>masonry</b> <b>bricks</b> of expansive soil stabilized with lime. The first is when the optimal humidity reaches its smallest value (integrated soil lumps) and the second is when humidity increases (disintegrated soil lumps), after reaching its lowest value. We also conclude that high compaction energy does not improve density values...|$|R
