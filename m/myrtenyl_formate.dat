In FGE. 208 Rev 1, the CEF Panel evaluated genotoxicity studies on p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117], the representative substance for FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2. The Comet assay performed in liver showed a positive result, and therefore, the Panel concluded that p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is genotoxic in vivo and that, accordingly, there is a safety concern for its use as flavouring substance. Since p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is representative for the nine remaining substances of subgroup 2. 2 (p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], 2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>formate</b> [FL-no: 09. 272], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278], myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]), the Panel concluded in the previous revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 1) {{that there is a}} potential safety concern for these substances. Subsequently, the industry has submitted genotoxicity studies on five substances of FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2 : p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], which are evaluated in the present revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). The Panel concluded that the concern for genotoxicity could be ruled out for p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FLno: 09. 278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], which will be evaluated through the Procedure. Genotoxicity data on myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106] were considered equivocal, therefore, it cannot be evaluated through the Procedure, presently. p-Mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] and four substances not supported by industry (2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 -carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], <b>myrtenyl</b> <b>formate</b> [FL-no: 09. 272], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]) have been deleted from the Union List...|$|E
