5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology.

In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, {{and leading}} {{figure of the}} early women's rights movement.

5|$|Historian Carter Lindberg of Boston University {{has drawn}} {{parallels}} between contemporary prosperity {{theology and the}} medieval indulgence trade.

5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured a {{proliferation}} of new religious <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. In {{the latter half of}} the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School of Christianity and (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|The icon of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1920s and 1930s.

5|$|With {{the rise}} of Afrikaner {{nationalism}} in South Africa during {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Scouting was viewed with suspicion by many Afrikaners because of its English roots, and rival Afrikaans organisations including the Voortrekkers were established.

5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six <b>movements.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> typical {{format of}} Bach's chorale cantatas, {{the first and}} last movement on the first and stanza of the hymn are set for choir, as a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale. They frame alternating arias and recitatives with the librettist's text. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 22 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn are {{retained in the}} outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sets of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. This {{is one of three}} Bach cantatas to use four different trombone parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), the others being Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 and Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21. The instruments play colla parte with the voices in the outer <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Bach's motets.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. (the {{so-called}} Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating {{new opportunities for}} criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted that at one point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E
5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces.

This ensured a balance between the two <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E
