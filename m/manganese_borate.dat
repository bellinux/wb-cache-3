5000|$|Chambersite is a <b>manganese</b> <b>borate</b> mineral with formula: Mn3B7O13Cl. It is {{a member}} of the borate mineral series that {{includes}} other minerals such as ericacite, Fe3B7O13Cl, and boracite Mg3B7O13Cl. When chambersite was first discovered, it was the second chemical analogue of boracite to be found in nature. It was discovered as a mineral at Barber's Hill salt dome in Texas in 1957 and in 1971 at the Dongshuichang deposit in Jixian, Tianjin, China. [...] Chambersite occurs associated with the evaporite minerals halite, anhydrite, and gypsum.|$|E
40|$|The atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) {{of films}} with the approximate compositions Mn 3 (BO 3) 2 and CoB 2 O 4 is described using MnTp 2 or CoTp 2 [Tp ¼ tris(pyrazolyl) borate] with ozone. The solid state decomposition temperatures of MnTp 2 and CoTp 2 are 370 and 340 C, respectively. Preparative-scale sublimations of MnTp 2 and CoTp 2 at 210 C/ 0. 05 Torr afforded > 99 % recoveries with < 0. 1 % nonvolatile residues. Self-limited ALD growth was demonstrated at 325 C for MnTp 2 or CoTp 2 with ozone as the coreactant. The growth rate for the <b>manganese</b> <b>borate</b> process was 0. 19 A˚ /cycle within the ALD window of 300 – 350 C. The growth rate for the cobalt borate process was 0. 39 – 0. 42 A˚ /cycle at 325 C. X-ray diffraction of the as-deposited films {{indicated that they were}} amorphous. Atomic force microscopy of 35 – 36 nm thick <b>manganese</b> <b>borate</b> films grown within the 300 – 350 C ALD window showed root mean square surface roughnesses of 0. 4 – 0. 6 nm. Film stoichiometries were assessed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight-elastic recoil detection analysis. The differing film stoichiometries obtained from the very similar precursors MnTp 2 and CoTp 2 are proposed to arise from the oxidizing ability of the intermediate high valent manganese oxide layers and lack thereof for cobalt...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, biodiesel, a {{substitute}} for fossil fuels, {{has led to the}} excessive production of crude glycerol. The resulting crude glycerol can possess a high concentration of salts and an alkaline pH. Moreover, current crude glycerol purification methods are expensive, rendering this former commodity a waste product. However, Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans, a haloalkaliphilic bacterium, possesses the metabolic capability to convert glycerol into 1, 3 -propanediol, a valuable commodity compound, without the need for salt dilution or adjusting pH when grown on this waste. Experiments were performed with different combinations of 24 medium components to determine their impact on the production of 1, 3 -propanediol by using a fractional factorial design. Tested medium components were selected based on data from the organism’s genome. Analysis of HPLC data revealed enhanced production of 1, 3 -propanediol with additional glycerol, pH, vitamin B 12, ammonium ions, sodium sulfide, cysteine, iron, and cobalt. However, other selected components; nitrate ions, phosphate ions, sulfate ions, sodium:potassium ratio, chloride, calcium, magnesium, silicon, <b>manganese,</b> zinc, <b>borate,</b> nickel, molybdenum, tungstate, copper and aluminum, did not enhance 1, 3 -propanediol production. The use of a fractional factorial design enabled the quick and efficient assessment of the impact of 24 different medium components on 1, 3 -propanediol production from glycerol from a haloalkaliphilic bacterium...|$|R
40|$|Thin films {{containing}} first-row {{transition metals}} {{are widely used}} in microelectronic, photovoltaic, catalytic, and surface-coating applications. In particular, metallic films are essential for interconnects and seed, barrier, and capping layers in integrated circuitry. Traditional vapor deposition methods for film growth include PVD, CVD, {{or the use of}} plasma. However, these techniques lack the requisite precision for film growth at the nanoscale, and thus, are increasingly inadequate for many current and future applications. By contrast, ALD is the favored approach for depositing films with absolute surface conformality and thickness control on 3 D architectures and in high aspect ratio features. However, the low-temperature chemical reduction of most first-row transition metal cations to their zero-valent state is very challenging due to their negative electrochemical potentials. A lack of strongly-reducing coreagents has rendered the thermal ALD of metallic films an intractable problem for many elements. Additionally, several established ALD processes for metal films are plagued by low growth rates, impurity incorporation, poor nucleation, high surface roughness, or the need for hazardous coreagents. Finally, stoichiometric control of ternary films grown by ALD is rare, but increasingly important, with emerging applications for metal borate films in catalysis and lithium ion batteries. The research herein is focused toward the development of new ALD processes for the broader application of metal, metal oxide, and metal borate thin films to future nanoscale technologies. These processes display self-limited growth and support the facile nucleation of smooth, continuous, high-purity films. Bis(trimethylsilyl) six-membered rings are employed as strongly-reducing organic coreagents for the ALD of titanium and antimony metal films. Additionally, new processes are developed for the growth of high-purity, low-resistivity cobalt and nickel metal films by exploiting the redox non-innocent nature of a series of recently-reported 1, 4 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 3 -diazabutadienyl complexes. Other metal complexes using the same ligand system are subsequently evaluated for use as ALD precursors. Finally, a novel approach is described for the stoichiometric control of first-row transition metal <b>manganese</b> and cobalt <b>borate</b> films, whereby the film composition is governed by the elements present in a single precursor. Computational techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) using nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) are used to determine the electronic structure and predict the relative reducing power of organic coreagents. Potential ALD precursors are analyzed by 1 H and 13 C NMR, IR, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA), melting point and solid state decomposition measurements, magnetic susceptibility measurements, preparative sublimation studies, and solution-screening reactions. Deposition parameters are optimized for successful ALD processes. The composition and surface morphology of the resultant films are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and four-point probe resistivity measurements...|$|R

40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} {{for large-scale}} applications demand a strict safety standard from a cathode material during operating cycles. Lithium <b>manganese</b> <b>borate</b> (LiMnBO₃) that crystallizes into a hexagonal or monoclinic framework is one prominent polyanionic compound {{to cope with}} such requirement since it can possess high safety and high energy density simultaneously, without trading one for the other, theoretically. However, the hexagonal phase {{was nothing but a}} disregarded composition due to its negligible Li intercalation capacity. In contrast, the monoclinic LiMnBO₃ compound exhibited much more electrochemical activity than the hexagonal polymorph. In this thesis work, the discharge capacity of 100 mAh g 1 with acceptable capacity retention was achieved by simple optimization. The different electrochemical behaviors between them were understood in relation to their structural difference as it affects the Li migration barrier, structural stability of Li-deficient states, and even particle morphology. However, although promising, monoclinic LiMnBO₃ needed further improvement in terms of the achievable capacity and cyclability. Electrochemical analysis showed that the limited capacity of LiMnBO₃ mostly originated from transport limitation, a hindered Li migration through the one-dimensional diffusion channel. It also struggled from the phase decomposition and Mn dissolution due to the instability of the delithiated state, which led to gradual capacity fading in prolonged cycles. As an effective materials design strategy to overcome such limitations, systematic substitution of transition metal elements was proposed. To increase achievable capacity, Mn was partially substituted by Fe. Also, to fortify the structural integrity, Mg replaced Mn. In order to obtain both improved capacity and cyclability, Fe and Mg are co-doping led to an optimized composition. Prepared by cold-isostatic pressing, LiMg₀. ₁Mn₀. ₅Fe₀. ₄ 4 BO₃ showed near theoretical capacity of 200 mAh g-¹ with much improved capacity retention. These newly established materials outperformed most of the polyanionic cathode compounds. Therefore, it can be concluded a new promising candidate as a Li storage material has been developed through this thesis research. by Jae Chul Kim. Thesis: Ph.
