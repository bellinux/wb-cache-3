5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare in Australia is {{provided}} by both private and government institutions. <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> the publicly funded universal health care venture in Australia. It was instituted in 1984 and coexists with a private health system. <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> funded partly by a 2% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> a {{publicly}} funded {{universal health care}} system in Australia. Operated by the Department of Human Services, <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> the primary funder of health care in Australia, funding primary health care for Australian citizens and permanent residents including Norfolk Island. Residents are entitled to subsidised treatment from medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a Medicare provider number, and can also obtain free treatment in public hospitals. The plan was introduced in 1975 by the Whitlam Government as Medibank, and was limited to paying customers only in 1976 by the Fraser Government. Hawke reintroduced universal health care in 1984 as Medicare.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{contracts}} with regional {{insurance companies to}} process over one billion fee-for-service claims per year. In 2008, Medicare accounted for 13% ($386 billion) of the federal budget. In 2016 it is projected to account for close to 15% ($683 billion) of the total expenditures. For the decade 2010â€“2019 <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> projected to cost 6.4 trillion dollars.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} various {{state and local}} {{programs}} for the poor. In 2007, Medicaid provided health care coverage for 39.6million low-income Americans (although Medicaid covers approximately 40% of America's poor), and Medicare provided health care coverage for 41.4million elderly and disabled Americans. Enrollment in <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> expected to reach 77million by 2031, when {{the baby boom generation}} is fully enrolled.|$|E
25|$|Medicare and Medicaid {{are the two}} {{government}} sponsored {{medical insurance}} schemes in the United States. <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> further divided into parts A and B - Medicare Part A covers hospital and hospice services; Part B covers outpatient services. Part D covers self-administered prescription drugs. Part C is alternative to the other parts intended to allow experimentation with differently structured plans {{in an effort to}} reduce costs to government and allow patients to choose plans with more benefits.|$|E
25|$|The {{funding of}} {{healthcare}} in Australia by <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> {{referred to as}} a rebate or benefit. The difference between the cost of healthcare and the rebate is called an out-of-pocket cost. The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.|$|E
5000|$|Social Security and <b>Medicare</b> {{expenditures}} <b>are</b> {{funded by}} permanent appropriations {{and so are}} considered mandatory spending according to the 1997 Budget Enforcement Act (BEA). Social Security and <b>Medicare</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called [...] "entitlements," [...] because people meeting relevant eligibility requirements are legally entitled to benefits, although most pay taxes into these programs throughout their working lives.|$|R

25|$|Medicare {{differs from}} private {{insurance}} available to working Americans {{in that it}} is a social insurance program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to guarantee health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the enormous, unpredictable cost of health care. In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.|$|E
25|$|Medicare Part A {{provides}} {{payments for}} in-patient hospital, hospice, and skilled nursing services, excluding those {{of physicians and}} surgeons. Part B provides payments to physicians and surgeons in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, {{as well as for}} medically-necessary outpatient hospital services such as ER, laboratory, X-rays and diagnostic tests, certain preventative medical services, and certain durable medical equipment and supplies. Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, not only cover the same medical services as Parts A and B but also typically include an annual physical exam and vision and/or dental coverage of some sort not covered under Original Medicare. Less often, hearing and wellness benefits not found in Original Medicare are included in a Medicare Advantage plan. The most important difference between a Part C health plan and FFS Original <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> that all Part C plans, including capitated-fee Medicare Advantage plans, include a limit on how much a beneficiary will have to spend annually out of pocket; that amount is unlimited in Original Medicare.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and {{that the cost of}} the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications. <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor's prescription and that the meter and supplies are obtained from a Medicare approved Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Medicare</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1965 and expanded thereafter. In 2009, the program covered an estimated 45 million persons (38 million aged and 7 million disabled). It {{consists of four}} distinct parts which are funded differently: ...|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} primary levels of care; routine home care, {{continuous}} care, general inpatient and respite/respite inpatient. All hospices in the United States certified by <b>Medicare</b> <b>are</b> required to offer {{each of these}} levels of care.|$|R
25|$|Medicare was {{established}} in 1965 and expanded thereafter. Spending for Medicare during 2016 was $692 billion, versus $634 billion in 2014, an increase of $58 billion or 9%. In 2013, the program covered an estimated 52.3 million persons. It consists of four distinct parts which are funded differently: Hospital Insurance, mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers; Supplementary Medical Insurance, funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%); Medicare Advantage, a private plan option for beneficiaries, funded through the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds; and the Part D prescription drug benefits, for which funding {{is included in the}} Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums (about 25%) and general revenues (about 75%). Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow dramatically in coming decades. The number of persons enrolled in <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> expected to increase from 47 million in 2010 to 80 million by 2030. While the same demographic trends that affect Social Security also affect Medicare, rapidly rising medical prices appear to be a more important cause of projected spending increases. CBO expects Medicare and Medicaid to continue growing, rising from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082. CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long-term fiscal challenge. Various reform strategies were proposed for healthcare, and in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted as a means of health care reform. CBO reduced its per capita Medicare spending assumptions by $1,000 for 2014 and $2,300 for 2019, relative to its 2010 estimate for those years. If this trend continues, it will significantly improve the long-term budget outlook.|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{does not}} believe {{government}} subsidized {{health care is a}} right or privilege. In 2012, The New York Times said Ryan was [...] "his partyâ€™s most forceful spokesman for cutting entitlement spending." [...] On March 17, 2017, Ryan said [...] "Medicaid, sending it back to the states, capping its growth rate" [...] was a long-time dream of his. Though he voted for the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, nearly a decade later Ryan said <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> on an [...] "unsustainable path".|$|E
500|$|Nursing Homes: A second {{aspect to}} {{reimbursement}} {{pertains to the}} nursing home. In many cases, patients who are transferred {{to a nursing home}} from a hospital will have a portion of their nursing home stay reimbursed by Medicare. In these cases, <b>Medicare</b> <b>is</b> paying for some kind of rehabilitative care. Medicare will not reimburse any room and board coverage in the nursing home for patients on hospice. Occasionally, patients who would be better served receiving hospice care will be [...] "rehabilitated" [...] in the nursing home so as to defray the costs of the room and board.|$|E
50|$|The American Heart Association {{concluded}} that the <b>Medicare</b> caps <b>are</b> costing the government {{more money in the}} long run, especially to stroke patients. According to their study, arbitrary caps on rehabilitation therapies punish stroke patients who often undergo needed extensive rehabilitation programs. More than 5.4 million Americans, including 4.4 million people with <b>Medicare,</b> <b>are</b> living with the consequences of stroke. The failure to properly treat and rehabilitate stroke patients costs $21.8 billion annually in lost productivity and disability expenses.|$|R
