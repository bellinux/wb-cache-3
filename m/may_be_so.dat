5|$|In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, {{the change}} in {{vegetation}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> great due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more nomadic and change territories more than other fairywrens. They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} needs to make amends with Lisa, but she is too hurt to even talk with him. Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows that he still only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E
5|$|Social insects, such as termites, ants {{and many}} bees and wasps, {{are the most}} {{familiar}} species of eusocial animal. They live together in large well-organized colonies that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms. It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates (and indeed {{one of the few}} non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment. In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown. Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors. Bombus terrestris, for example, exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar, yet rewarding flowers, when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species.|$|E

25|$|Tetanus, {{also known}} as lockjaw, is an {{infection}} characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress {{to the rest of}} the body. These spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks. Spasms <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> severe that bone fractures may occur. Other symptoms may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection. It may take months to recover. About 10% of those infected die.|$|E
25|$|Young {{saltwater}} crocodiles are {{pale yellow}} in colour with black stripes and spots {{on their bodies}} and tails.

Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain fairly pale skin, whereas others <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> dark as to appear blackish. The ventral surface is white or yellow in colour on saltwater crocodiles of all ages. Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies, but do not extend onto their bellies.

25|$|A {{particular}} concern in design of electrical substations is earth potential rise. When very large fault currents are {{injected into the}} earth, {{the area around the}} point of injection may rise to a high potential with respect to distant points. This is due to the limited finite conductivity of the layers of soil in the earth. The gradient of the voltage (changing voltage within a distance) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> high that two points on the ground may be at significantly different potentials, creating a hazard to anyone standing {{on the ground in the}} area. Pipes, rails, or communication wires entering a substation may see different ground potentials inside and outside the substation, creating a dangerous touch voltage.|$|E
25|$|However, {{sometimes}} the resource <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> prized that potentially fatal confrontations can occur to acquire them. Male elephant seals, Mirounga augustirostris, engage in fierce competitive displays {{in an attempt}} to control a large harem of females with which to mate. The distribution of females and subsequent reproductive success is very uneven between males. The reproductive success of most males is zero; they die before breeding age or are prevented from mating by higher ranked males. In addition, just a few dominant males account for the majority of copulations. The potential reproductive success for males is so great that many are killed before breeding age as they attempt to move up the hierarchy in their population.|$|E

But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|E
