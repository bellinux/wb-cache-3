Its purpose was to assist Haitians in developing sustainable paradigms for <b>medium-term</b> and long-term economic growth as well as creating jobs that stabilize its domestic economy. The Fund raised $54 million, and during its term, the Fund estimated that its programs sustained or created 7,350 jobs, trained 20,050 individuals, and had an additional positive impact on the conditions of more than 311,000 Haitians.|$|E

The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the <b>medium-term</b> outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance. Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.|$|E
5|$|The Act also {{extended}} the franchise. In county constituencies, {{in addition to}} forty-shilling freeholders, franchise rights were extended to owners of land in copyhold worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (more than sixty years) on land worth £10 and holders of <b>medium-term</b> leases (between twenty and sixty years) on land worth £50 and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. In borough constituencies all male householders living in properties worth at least £10 a year were given {{the right to vote}} – a measure which introduced to all boroughs a standardised form of franchise for the first time. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{the federal}} {{government}} charged KTMB to work alongside SSR to undertake short- and <b>medium-term</b> work on the railway to enhance its safety. This included rehabilitating the track and signalling and also overhauling the rolling stock to ensure continuation of service. As already stated, at present the railway is currently undergoing rehabilitation. This is both a short-term measure to ensure continued operation, and a <b>medium-term</b> one to improve operational safety and to somewhat modernise the system. A possible reinstatement of the Tanjung Aru to Kota Kinabalu part of the route has been considered, {{although it is not}} yet known whether or not this will be given approval.|$|E
25|$|The chart {{shows that}} the {{long-term}} equinox drift of the Revised Julian calendar is quite satisfactory, at least until 4400AD. The <b>medium-term</b> wobble spans about two days because, like the Gregorian calendar, the leap years of the Revised Julian calendar are not smoothly spread: they occur mostly at intervals of four years but there are occasional eight-year gaps (at 7 out of 9 century years). Evidently each of the authorities responsible for the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars, respectively, accepted a modest amount of <b>medium-term</b> equinox wobble {{for the sake of}} traditionally perceived leap rule mental arithmetic simplicity. Therefore, the wobble is essentially a curiosity that is of no practical or ritual concern.|$|E

25|$|The 500 {{square meter}} {{facility}} of ABS-CBN Film Archives {{is covered with}} insulated walls. It has two film vaults: the <b>medium-term</b> vault and the long-term vault. The medium term vault holds betacam tapes, U-matic, 16mm negatives and prints, and some 35mm negatives and prints while the long-term vault holds the 35mm negatives and master prints. The facility is protected by a special fire suppression system. Acclimatization rooms are located between the vaults and the exit. Before a film could be taken out from the vault, it has {{to stay in the}} first acclimatization room for 24 hours and in the second acclimatization room for another 24 hours to prevent damage caused by condensation due to rapid temperature change. The temperature in the long-term vault is maintained between 8 and 10°C with 31 to 35 percent relative humidity while in the <b>medium-term</b> vault, the temperature is maintained between 15 and 20°C with 35 to 50 percent relative humidity. The air-conditioning system of the facility operates 24 hours a day. The facility is accessible to visitors for academic and research purposes.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 2015, {{it was reported that}} Fremantle Volunteer Sea Rescue would likely become based in the signal station. This drew criticism from members of the Cantonment Hill Working Group who had developed the master plan for the site which the City of Fremantle had previously given assurances to implement. In late March 2015 draft plans were presented at a council meeting detailing the creation of a convention center and restaurant for the site, with the FSR suggested as being a <b>medium-term</b> occupant while this larger plan came to fruition.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of access}} to {{financial}} services {{is a serious problem}} {{for the majority of the}} population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. Microfinance, however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to <b>medium-term</b> credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.|$|E
25|$|More broadly, the Moroccan {{insurance}} {{sector is}} already consolidated, with five large players controlling the market. The sector {{is set to}} be opened up to foreign competition from 2010 onward, and the consolidation of insurance companies into larger entities should strengthen the local players to better compete with eventual competition from foreign insurers. There is also the possibility that new insurance niches such as takaful (Islamic insurance) and microinsurance products will {{become part of the}} Moroccan market in the <b>medium-term,</b> but they are unlikely to appear in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal policy {{decisions}} {{so far have}} been mostly discretionary, as there is no explicit goal for fiscal policy. Looking forward, the question of a possible anchor for <b>medium-term</b> fiscal policy is worth exploring. Morocco's low social indicators and large infrastructure needs could justify an increase in social spending and public investment. Further, some nominal tax rates remain high by international standards, possibly warranting a lowering of some rates. At the same time, the relatively high level of public debt remains a constraining factor, particularly as heightened attractiveness to investors is a key component of Morocco's strategy of deepening its integration in the global economy.|$|E
25|$|Monetarism {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} down inflation, {{but at the}} cost of unemployment rates in excess of 10%, causing the deepest recession seen in the developed countries {{since the end of the}} Great Depression and severe debt crises in the developing world. Contrary to monetarist predictions, the relationship between the money supply and the price level proved unreliable in the short- to <b>medium-term.</b> Another monetarist prediction not borne out in practice was that the velocity of money did not remain constant, in fact it dropped sharply. The US Federal Reserve began increasing the money supply above monetarist-advised thresholds with no effect on inflation, and discarded monetarism in 1984. The Bank of England likewise abandoned its sterling M3 money targeting in October 1985.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the United States Congress {{approved}} $500million for the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative (TSCTI) {{over six}} years to support countries involved in counterterrorism against threats of Al Qaeda operating in African countries, primarily Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria, and Morocco. This program builds upon the former Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI), which concluded in December 2004 and focused on weapon and drug trafficking, as well as counterterrorism. Previous U.S. military activities in Sub-Saharan Africa have included Special Forces associated Joint Combined Exchange Training. Letitia Lawson, writing in 2007 for a Center for Contemporary Conflict journal at the Naval Postgraduate School, noted that U.S. policy towards Africa, {{at least in the}} <b>medium-term,</b> looks to be largely defined by international terrorism, the increasing importance of African oil to American energy needs, and the dramatic expansion and improvement of Sino-African relations since 2000.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{investment}} levels There are no {{recent data}} {{on the level of}} investments in the sector. In the five years between 1997 and 2001 Venezuela invested US$ 637million in water and sanitation, or about US$ 127million annually on average. Investment in the sector has historically been volatile. For example, annual investments fluctuated in the 1986-1998 period between less than US$100million (in 1989) and US$400million (in 1992). To a large extent investment levels mirror fluctuation in oil prices. Investment levels declined from 1986-1989 when oil prices were very low. Investments skyrocketed in 1992 after oil prices had increased. Then they plummeted again when oil prices decreased during the remainder of the 1990s. The volatility in sector financing has made it difficult to initiate a sustainable <b>medium-term</b> investment program needed to rehabilitate infrastructure and extend access to services.|$|E
25|$|The 1969 Employment Promotion Act, {{which was}} based largely on a {{proposal}} prepared by the SPD in 1966, established active labour market intervention measures such as employment research, and offered “substantial state assistance to employees with educational aspirations.” Under {{the direction of the}} SPD Minister of Economics Karl Schiller, the federal government adopted Keynesian demand management for the first time ever. Schiller called for legislation that would provide both his ministry and the federal government with greater authority to guide economic policy. In 1967, Schiller introduced the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth, which was subsequently passed by the Bundestag. Regarded as the Magna Carta of <b>medium-term</b> economic management, the legislation provided for coordination of federal, Lander, and local budget plans in order to give fiscal policy a stronger impact. It also set a number of optimistic targets for four basic standards by which West German economic success would henceforth be measured, which included trade balance, employment levels, economic growth, and currency stability.|$|E
25|$|Experimental warming {{has been}} shown to start {{flowering}} substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and the cushions produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a latitudinal gradient in North America showed that southern populations of moss campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they turned negative on <b>medium-term,</b> suggestion that moss campion may be at risk in future global warming.|$|E
25|$|The Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was {{established}} {{by the government in}} 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended {{in the absence of an}} alternative way to deal with the issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the perverse incentives built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted subsidy scheme have jeopardized the <b>medium-term</b> sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is part of a more comprehensive approach to solve the problems of the power sector.|$|E
25|$|A {{public meeting}} {{was held in}} December 2011 to discuss the future goals and designs of Union Station, with ideas being {{exchanged}} on how the station can accommodate the expected 40 percent growth in passengers by 2040. The results of this dialogue were incorporated into the May 2012 Chicago Union Station Master Plan Study. The study, led by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), in collaboration of Amtrak (station owner), Metra (station’s primary tenant), and other local and federal organizations, calls for increasing the station’s capacity and quality of service. According to the City of Chicago’s website on the study, short-term improvements call for improving station entrances and expanding waiting rooms, as well as enhancing bus lanes on Clinton and Canal Streets and creating a bus terminal on Jackson Boulevard between Canal and Clinton. For the <b>medium-term</b> (5- to 10-year horizon), ideas include widening commuter platforms, using unutilized mail platforms (including an extra-long through platform) for intercity passenger trains, adding more through tracks and platforms, reorganizing facilities for better capacity and flow, increasing height clearances of the tracks, and improving street access {{to and from the}} station. Long-term, proposals include increasing capacity and improving the ambiance of the station by significantly expanding or replacing station facilities in the 200 or 300 blocks of South Canal Street. Adding track and platform capacity along Clinton Street or Canal Street are also analyzed.|$|E

500|$|On 20 October 2011, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research {{published}} an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which could provide governments with fixed interest rate Eurobonds at a rate slightly below <b>medium-term</b> economic growth (in nominal terms). These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time. Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB, [...] "the EMU would achieve a similarly strong position vis-à-vis financial investors as the US where the Fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent". To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would operate according to strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria.|$|E
500|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed {{discourse on the}} architecture of the {{global financial}} system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of global governance, and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization. Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank's mandates. The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities. French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum's Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a [...] "global central bank or a world financial authority" [...] have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of <b>medium-term</b> efforts to improve transparency and disclosure, strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources.|$|E
500|$|On 1 October 1941, Dangić and {{two other}} east Bosnian Chetnik commanders, Pero Đukanović and Sergije Mihailović, met with the Partisan General Staff for Bosnia-Hercegovina at the village of Drinjača south of Zvornik. The Partisans were Svetozar Vukmanović (known as [...] "Tempo"), Rodoljub Čolaković and Princip-Seljo. The meeting agreed on the {{creation}} of a joint Chetnik-Partisan Staff, the [...] "Command of the Bosnian Military and Partisan Detachments", to consist of six members, three Chetniks and three Partisans. The meeting also agreed that joint Chetnik-Partisan administration would be imposed on liberated areas, using the Partisan model of people's liberation committees. The resulting declaration was a compromise, and called on the patriotism of both Serbs and Bosnians, although Dangić opposed the inclusion of any call for the unity of Muslims or Croats with the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as he stated that all Muslims were responsible for the Ustaše crimes against Serbs. According to Hoare, the Drinjača agreement represented the pinnacle of co-operation between Partisans and Chetniks in east Bosnia, but effectively sidelined the Provincial Committee. On 6 October, a further meeting was held at Milići near Vlasenica, and the composition of the joint staff was decided. Dangić, Babić and Sergije Mihailović became the Chetnik representatives, and Vukmanović, Čolaković and Princip-Seljo represented the Partisans, with Sergije Mihailović appointed as chief of staff. After the war, the Drinjača agreement was the subject of much heated debate between Vukmanović and Čolaković, with Vukmanović blaming Čolaković for the negative <b>medium-term</b> consequences of the agreement for the Partisan movement in east Bosnia. According to Vukmanović, these consequences included the virtual disappearance of an independent Partisan General Staff for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the domination of the joint staff by Sergije Mihailović, including his appointment of officers hostile to the Partisans as commanders of Partisan units, the diversion of weapons from the Partisan controlled arms factory at Užice to Chetnik troops, and the alienation of the Muslim and Croat population of the region. When Vukmanović raised his concerns with Tito, the Bosnian Communists were forced to insist that the joint staff could have no contact with Chetnik units except during operations against Axis forces, and no joint Chetnik-Partisan operations would be permitted in Muslim areas.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{long-term}} compliance with the SGP deficit and debt criteria, the member states have since the SGP-reform in March 2005 striven towards achieving their country-specific <b>Medium-Term</b> budgetary Objective (MTO). The MTO is the set limit, that the structural balance relative to GDP needs to equal or be above for {{each year in the}} <b>medium-term.</b> Each state select its own MTO, but it needs to equal or be better than a calculated minimum requirement (Minimum MTO) ensuring sustainability of the government accounts throughout the long-term (calculated on basis of both future potential GDP growth, future cost of government debt, and future increases in age-related costs). The structural balance is calculated by the European Commission as the cyclically-adjusted balance minus [...] "one-off measures" [...] (i.e. one-off payments due to reforming a pension scheme). The cyclically-adjusted balance is calculated by adjusting the achieved general government balance (in % of GDP) compared to each years relative economic growth position in the business cycle (referred to as the [...] "output gap"), which is found by subtraction of the achieved GDP growth with the potential GDP growth. So if a year is recorded with average GDP growth in the business cycle (equal to the potential GDP growth rate), the output gap will then be zero, meaning that the [...] "cyclically-adjusted balance" [...] then will be equal to the [...] "government budget balance". In this way, because it is resistant to GDP growth changes, the structural balance is considered to be neutral and comparable across an entire business cycle (including both recession years and [...] "overheated years"), making it perfect to be used consistently as a <b>medium-term</b> budgetary objective.|$|E
