2500|$|During the Clinton administration, the faux white <b>marble</b> <b>finish</b> {{painted on}} the mantels and baseboards in the 1960s was removed to reveal the {{original}} [...] "rouge antique" [...] (reddish) marble from Vermont installed during the White House's renovation in 1951. Although the East Room's oak floors had been bare since 1903, three matching $259,330 wool carpets were installed in February 1995. These carpets, ordered in 1990, were designed to reflect the plaster ceiling moldings created during the John Quincy Adams administration in the late 1820s. Woven by Edward Fields Inc. of New York and paid for with private donations raised by the White House Endowment Fund, the carpets were designed to cover most of the floor {{to protect it from}} dirt and the occasional pebble stuck in the tread of a shoe.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1784 and 1787 the {{original}} building was redesigned and rebuilt by Russian architect Matvey Kazakov.

Productivity {{is a very important}} element in the process of construction project management especially with regard to the estimation of the duration of the construction activities, this study aims at developing construction productivity estimat-ing model for <b>marble</b> <b>finishing</b> works of floors using Multivariable Linear Regression technique (MLR). The model was developed based on 100 set of data collected in Iraq for different types of projects such as residential, commercial and educational projects. Which these are used in developing the model and evaluating its performance. Ten influencing factors are utilized for productivity forecasting by MLR model, and they include age, experience, number of the assist labor, height of the floor, size of the marbles tiles, security conditions, health status for the work team, weather condi-tions, site condition, and availability of construction materials. One model was built for the prediction of the productiv-ity of <b>marble</b> <b>finishing</b> works for floors. It was found that MLR have the ability to predict the productivity for finishing works with excellent degree of accuracy of the coefficient of correlation (R) 90. 6 %, and average accuracy percentage of 96. 3 %.

40|$|Ornamental stone {{products}} are commercially classified {{on the market}} according to several factors related both to intrinsic lythologic characteristics and to their pictorial attributes. Such attributes are influenced by working actions performed to realize the final product. This latter aspect is quite critical because stone surface finishing can contribute to enhance certain aesthetic features of the stone itself. The study was addressed to develop an innovative set of imaging based procedures able to quantify the aesthetic quality of travertine marble products taking into account both physical and aesthetical stone characteristics. Results showed as, adopting the developed procedures, a correct quality labelling of the travertine <b>marble</b> <b>finished</b> products can be achieved in an automatic way...|$|R

50|$|Thrupp's first {{exhibit at}} the Royal Academy {{was a piece of}} sculpture, The Prodigal Returned, 1832. This was {{followed}} by a bust of J. H. Pope, 1833, a bust of B. E. Hall, and Mother bending over her Sleeping Infant, 1835, and Contemplation, 1836. The Young Hunter and Mother and Children were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1837, but he did not exhibit again till 1841. He then sent a small Magdalen in <b>marble,</b> <b>finished</b> in December 1840, after working on his technique for modelling drapery. While in Rome he finished Arethusa, a life-sized recumbent nymph, exhibited in 1843, which went to John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge; Hebe with the Eagle, and Boys with a Basket of Fruit, both exhibited in 1844, and several other works in marble.|$|R
2500|$|Ross {{eventually}} {{sold the}} Forks-of-the-River quarry to the Baltimore-based W.H. Evans Company, which had opened a large <b>marble</b> <b>finishing</b> mill in Knoxville. [...] Ross then purchased a quarry in the Island Home area of South Knoxville. [...] In 1898, he sold this quarry (later {{known as the}} [...] "Mead Quarry") to the Republic Marble Company, which had been operating quarries near Concord and Luttrell throughout the previous decade. Republic had been founded by Knoxville Iron Company executive William S. Mead (18331908), {{and at the time}} was managed by his son, Frank S. Mead (18641936). Though Republic purchased Ross's business interests and was subsequently known as [...] "Ross-Republic," [...] John M. Ross continued operating independently, opening a quarry (the [...] "Ross Quarry") on land adjacent to the Mead Quarry. [...] The Ross Quarry supplied marble for the J.P.

5000|$|In architecture, we find [...] "Pavaratty Finish". It is the <b>marble</b> (mirror) <b>finish</b> {{work done}} with verily {{coloured}} cement coatings that brought this term. The workers of Pavaratty {{are very much}} skilled in this art and it was done throughout Kerala by the workers from here. Again, we may find a name in the past, related to pavaratty-Kavalapara. It denotes the present ‘Pavaratty Centre’. There was a police post here and hence the name came to be used.|$|R
40|$|During 2010 Crick Smith {{researched}} the accumulated historic painted decoration and archaeological development within the principal interiors of the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford. This focused on identifying the {{detail of the}} original Sir Christopher Wren scheme of 1668. This research included the cross-sectional analysis of paint samples in association with archival research, including transcripts of the original decorators bill, historic watercolours and early photographs. Analysis of the samples was undertaken by optical microscopy {{using a variety of}} different lighting techniques to reveal the chemical make up within the build up of individual paint layers. Due to the unique nature of original paint layers from this period further in-depth material analysis using FTIR, RAMAN, GC, SEM & EDX was undertaken. Once identified, the nature of the original complex faux <b>marble</b> <b>finishes</b> was confirmed by removal of later overpaints on site and comparison to known examples of Wren’s decorative work from this period. The surviving examples were recreated on sample boards for comparison to the finishes within the Sheldonian interiors. Following extensive consultation with the client, Crick Smith provided the expertise to recreate the more specialist decorative paint finishes of the original schem...|$|R
