5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a <b>myeloperoxidase</b> or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The <b>myeloperoxidase</b> or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myeloperoxidase</b> (MPO) – The {{levels of}} {{circulating}} MPO, a leukocyte enzyme, elevate early after ACS {{and can be}} used as an early marker for the condition.|$|E
25|$|The c-ANCA antigen is {{specifically}} proteinase 3 (PR3). p-ANCA antigens include <b>myeloperoxidase</b> (MPO) and bacterial permeability increasing factor (BPI). Other antigens exist for c-ANCA (atypical), however many are as yet unknown. Classical p-ANCA occurs with antibodies directed to MPO. p-ANCA without nuclear extension occurs with antibodies to BPI, cathepsin G, elastase, lactoferrin and lysozyme. GS-ANA are antibodies directed to granulocyte specific nuclear antigens. Atypical ANCA {{are thought to}} be antigens {{similar to that of the}} p-ANCAs, however may occur due to differences in neutrophil processing.|$|E
500|$|The {{second type}} {{involves}} the use of the enzyme <b>myeloperoxidase</b> [...] from neutrophil granules. When granules fuse with a phagosome, <b>myeloperoxidase</b> is released into the phagolysosome, and this enzyme uses hydrogen peroxide and chlorine to create hypochlorite, a substance used in domestic bleach. Hypochlorite is extremely toxic to bacteria. <b>Myeloperoxidase</b> contains a heme pigment, which accounts for the green color of secretions rich in neutrophils, such as pus and infected sputum.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "white blood cell" [...] {{derives from}} the {{physical}} appearance of a blood sample after centrifugation. White cells {{are found in the}} buff, a thin, typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented red blood cells and the blood plasma. The scientific term leukocyte directly reflects its description. It is derived from the Greek roots leuk- meaning [...] "white" [...] and cyt- meaning [...] "cell". The buffy coat may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of neutrophils in the sample, due to the heme-containing enzyme <b>myeloperoxidase</b> that they produce.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic polymorphisms {{in these}} enzymes may induce loss of {{function}} or gain of function. [...] For example, mutations in CYP2E1 increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites. [...] NQ01 mutations result in {{loss of function}} and may result in decreased detoxification. [...] <b>Myeloperoxidase</b> mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites. [...] GSH mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification. [...] These genes may be targets for genetic screening for susceptibility to benzene toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Heme m is the {{derivative}} of heme B covalently bound at the active site of peroxide. Heme m contains the two ester bonds at the heme 1- and 5-methyls as in heme l {{found in other}} mammalian peroxides. In addition, a unique sulfonamides ion linkage between the sulfur of a methionyl amino-acid residue and the heme 2-vinyl group is formed, giving this enzyme the unique capability of easily oxidizing chloride and bromide ions. [...] <b>Myeloperoxidase</b> is present in mammalian neutrophils and {{is responsible for the}} destruction of invading bacteria and viruse. It also synthesizes hypobromite by [...] "mistake" [...] which is a known mutagenic compound.|$|E
2500|$|The pathway for the {{metabolism}} of benzene {{is complex}} and begins in the liver. [...] Several enzymes are involved. [...] These include cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01), GSH, and <b>myeloperoxidase</b> (MPO). [...] CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to oxepin (benzene oxide), phenol to hydroquinone, and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and catechol. [...] Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols. [...] In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones. [...] These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) {{that may lead to}} point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression). [...] NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity. [...] NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO). [...] GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid.|$|E
2500|$|While {{they fight}} pathogens, {{neutrophils}} also release inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that damage cells. [...] One of their important jobs {{is to produce}} Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) to kill bacteria, for which they use an enzyme called <b>myeloperoxidase.</b> [...] The enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging DNA, lipids, proteins, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cytokines that speed healing. [...] Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds for longer {{than they do in}} acute wounds, and contribute to the fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS. [...] Since wound fluid from chronic wounds has an excess of proteases and ROS, the fluid itself can inhibit healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the ECM. This impaired healing response is considered uncoordinated. However, soluble mediators of the immune system (growth factors), cell-based therapies and therapeutic chemicals can propagate coordinated healing.|$|E
2500|$|Neutrophils {{and other}} phagocytes use {{peroxide}} to kill bacteria. The enzyme NADPH oxidase generates superoxide within the phagosome, which is converted via hydrogen peroxide to other oxidising substances like hypochlorous acid which kill phagocytosed pathogens. In individuals with {{chronic granulomatous disease}} (CGD) there is a defect in producing peroxide via mutations in phagocyte oxidases such as <b>myeloperoxidase.</b> Normal cellular metabolism will still produce {{a small amount of}} peroxide and this peroxide can be used to produce hypochlorous acid to eradicate the bacterial infection. However, if individuals with CGD are infected with catalase-positive bacteria, the bacterial catalase can destroy the excess peroxide before {{it can be used to}} produce other oxidising substances. In these individuals the pathogen survives and becomes a chronic infection. This chronic infection is typically surrounded by macrophages in an attempt to isolate the infection. This wall of macrophages surrounding a pathogen is called a granuloma. Many bacteria are catalase positive, but some are better catalase-producers than others. The mnemonic [...] "cats Need PLACESS to Belch their Hairballs" [...] can be used to memorise the catalase-positive bacteria: nocardia, pseudomonas, listeria, aspergillus, candida, E. coli, staphylococcus, serratia, B. cepacia and H. pylori.|$|E
5000|$|As an anti-inflammatory, dapsone {{inhibits}} {{the enzyme}} <b>myeloperoxidase.</b> As {{part of the}} respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, <b>myeloperoxidase</b> converts hydrogen peroxide (...) into hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage during inflammation. Dapsone arrests <b>myeloperoxidase</b> in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme. This prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage during inflammation. <b>Myeloperoxidase</b> inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{deficiency}} of eosinophil peroxidase without concomitant {{deficiency of}} <b>myeloperoxidase</b> is rare. In a clinical setting, deficiencies of leukocyte enzymes are conveniently studied by optical flow cytometry. Specific deficiencies of <b>myeloperoxidase</b> were known since the 1970s. <b>Myeloperoxidase</b> deficiency {{resulted in an}} absence of peroxidase staining in neutrophils but not eosinophils. Early studies on <b>myeloperoxidase</b> deficiency revealed that the most common disease variants were missense mutations, including that of the heme-linked methionine residue. This deficiency was often not inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait {{but rather as a}} compound heterozygous mutation. It is thought that patients suffering from <b>myeloperoxidase</b> deficiency have an increased incidence of malignant tumours. However, {{they do not have a}} significantly increased rate of infection, owing to redundancy in peroxidase-mediated immune mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Myeloperoxidase</b> {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder featuring deficiency, either in quantity or of function, of <b>myeloperoxidase,</b> an enzyme found in certain phagocytic immune cells, especially polymorphonuclear leukocytes.|$|E

50|$|The {{superoxide}} {{generated by}} these enzymes complexes dismutates into hydrogen peroxide {{which in turn}} is used by <b>myeloperoxidase</b> to produce bactericidal hypochlorous acid. In addition, the submucosal glands of the respiratory tract secrete <b>myeloperoxidase</b> and lactoperoxidase (LPO) that catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate and detoxify hydrogen peroxide or ROS to the antimicrobial hypothiocyanite.|$|E
50|$|In acute {{myeloblastic leukemia}} (M0), the blasts are agranular and nonreactive when stained for <b>myeloperoxidase</b> activity, and Auer rods are not seen. The blasts react with {{antibodies}} to <b>myeloperoxidase</b> and antibodies to CD13, CD33, and CD34. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR is positive in most patients. Occasional cases require {{in situ hybridization}} to identify the <b>myeloperoxidase</b> gene315 or genomic profiling for early myeloid-associated genes. Abnormal and unfavorable karyotypes (e.g., loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-) and 7q-) and higher expression of the multidrug resistance glycoprotein (p170) are frequent. In general, minimally differentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia has a poor prognosis.|$|E
50|$|Having diverged from <b>myeloperoxidase</b> and lactoperoxidase, {{these three}} enzymes now perform {{distinct}} but not non-overlapping roles; lactoperoxidase helps maintain the sterility of mammalian milk; <b>myeloperoxidase</b> and eosinophil peroxidase inhabit granules and play roles in host defense—an interesting {{example of how}} the concept of a single chemical function can be harnessed in myriad ways in Nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myeloperoxidase</b> {{deficiency}} is a {{hereditary deficiency}} of the enzyme, which predisposes to immune deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} an association between elevated <b>myeloperoxidase</b> levels and the severity of coronary artery disease. [...] And Heslop et al. reported that elevated MPO levels more than doubled the risk for cardiovascular mortality over a 13-year period. It has also been suggested that <b>myeloperoxidase</b> {{plays a significant role}} in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion and rendering plaques unstable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myeloperoxidase</b> {{released}} from neutrophils converts thiocyanate to cyanate which carbamylates lysine residues to form homocitrulline. Thiocyanate (SCN−) is a naturally occurring pseudohalide found in dietary sources. <b>Myeloperoxidase</b> can use SCN− as a cosubstrate together with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form cyanate. In patients with kidney dysfunction urea is elevated. Urea is in equilibrium with cyanate and isocyanate. Carbamylation of nucleophilic amino groups, for example lysine residues, can modify protein structures and ultimately cause metabolic dysfunctions.|$|E

In the case of screening patients for vasculitis, flow cytometric assays have demonstrated comparable sensitivity to immunofluorescence tests, with the additional benefit of simultaneous detection of multiple autoantibodies relevant to vasculitis. Nonetheless, this method still requires further testing.|$|E
