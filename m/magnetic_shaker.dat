40|$|Understanding {{the modes}} of {{communication}} used by a species is essential to understanding their ecology, behavior, and evolution. Substrate-borne vibrations {{have been reported to}} be produced by the veiled chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus), possibly implemented by use of a gular pouch. We found that veiled chameleons produced vibrations under dominance and mating behavioral contexts. We tested the sensitivity of veiled chameleons to vibrations by placing chameleons, one at a time, on a wooden dowel attached to a permanent <b>magnetic</b> <b>shaker</b> and recording each chameleon’s behavior before, during, and after a three-pulse vibrational stimulus of 25, 50, 150, 300, or 600 Hz. Vibrations were measured via an accelerometer attached to the dowel. The chameleons exhibited a stop-behavioral response (i. e., lack of movement) when exposed to stimulus of 50 and 150 Hz. Further experiments testing behavioral responses at lower (25 Hz) and higher (300 and 600 Hz) frequencies showed little to no reduction in movement. For induced sounds produced by chameleons, there was no significant correlation between size of the chameleon and average dominant vibrational frequency or duration of a vibrational pulse and dominant frequency. Chameleon vibrational response was also studied under various behavioral contexts by pairing chameleons on a dowel and recording the natural vibrational responses of chameleons under these conditions via an accelerometer. The pairing of chameleons in various behavioral contexts, including male-male, male-female, and interspecific interactions resulted in natural vibrational responses that were much shorter in duration and more pulse-like than the induced low-frequency tonal vibrations previously studied in C. calyptratus, suggesting the possibility of different types of vibrational responses. These findings improve the understanding of vi behavioral responses between chameleons, and can be utilized as a basis for further research into the morphology and physiology of chameleons...|$|E
40|$|The key {{contribution}} of the paper is in the modification of the well-known delayed resonator concept for vibration suppression using both delayed and non-delayed acceleration feedback control laws together. We further improve the classical resonator setting with lumped delay introducing a distributed delay structure into the control law. It is known that the operable frequency ranges for the delayed resonators are relatively narrow, taking into account both the stability and implementation constraints. As the key result of this paper, in order to widen the operable frequency range, the resonator's feedback is extended by including a non-delayed part to adjust virtually the mass and thus the natural frequency of the active absorber. The proposed extension takes into consideration also the existence of feedback delay and filters to reduce the measurement noise, and retain the simplicity of active controlled resonator tuning against excitations with time varying frequencies. The properties and performance of the resulting algorithms are compared with the delay free PI (proportional and integral) feedback control law. It is shown that the delay-based resonators are easier to implement and can better deal with the measurement noise compared to PI. Spectral theory of retarded and neutral time delay systems are applied to perform a thorough analysis of the resonators. The key theoretical results are validated on a laboratory set-up with voice-coil <b>magnetic</b> <b>shakers.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to produce a system for powering medical implants to increase the lifetime of the implanted devices and reduce the battery size. The system consists of a number of elements – the piezoelectric material for generating power, the device design, the circuit for rectification and energy storage. The piezoelectric material is analysed and a process for producing a repeatable high quality piezoelectric material is described. A full width half maximum (FWHM) of the rocking curve X-Ray diffraction (XRD) scan of between ~ 1. 5 ° to ~ 1. 7 ° for test wafers was achieved. This is state of the art for AlN on silicon and means devices with good piezoelectric constants can be fabricated. Finite element modelling FEM) was used to design the structures for energy harvesting. The models developed in this work were established to have an accuracy better than 5 % in terms of the difference between measured and modelled results. Devices made from this material were analysed for power harvesting ability as well as the effect that they have on the flow of liquid which is an important consideration for implantable devices. The FEM results are compared to experimental results from laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), <b>magnetic</b> <b>shaker</b> and perfusion machine tests. The rectifying circuitry for the energy harvester was also investigated. The final solution uses multiple devices to provide the power to augment the battery and so this was a key feature to be considered. Many circuits were examined and a solution based on a fully autonomous circuit was advanced. This circuit was analysed for use with multiple low power inputs similar to the results from previous investigations into the energy harvesting devices. Polymer materials were also studied for use as a substitute for the piezoelectric material as well as the substrate because silicon is more brittle...|$|E
40|$|Vários trabalhos na {{literatura}} têm discutido a importância dos polimorfismos enzimáticos em relação ao estado de ser adaptado dos organismos. Nesse trabalho foram estudadas algumas propriedades bioquímicas das aloenzimas EST- 5 S e EST- 5 F de Drosophila mulleri, que poderiam estar relacionadas às diferenças em valores adaptativos em indivíduos que apresentam essas variantes enzimáticas. Os resultados sugerem que a aloenzima EST- 5 S apresenta maior resistência à desnaturação térmica e a agentes caotrópicos, bem como maior atividade em altas concentrações salinas. Os resultados do experimento de produtividade a 29 º C mostram que os indivíduos homozigotos para o alelo Est- 5 S deixam mais descendentes que os indivíduos homozigotos para o alelo Est- 5 F. Quanto as caractetísticas cinéticas, essas aloenzimas não diferem de forma significante. Os valores de Vmax e Km obtidos para as enzimas não purificadas foram, respectivamente, para a EST- 5 S: 32, 54 µM/min e 1, 43 mM, e para a EST- 5 F: 33, 34 µM/min e 1, 54 mM. A purificação das aloenzimas foi obtida pela separação em SDS-PAGE seguida da remoção dos géis, eluição em agitador magnético para a difusão das enzimas e posterior concentração desse material em membrana filtrante de 50 kDa (Millipore). O concentrado foi então analisado quanto à atividade esterásica e quanto à pureza (SDS-PAGE). Ambas as aleloenzimas apresentaram uma massa molecular entre 66 e 68 kDa para a subunidade, em SDS-PAGE. Os resultados do presente estudo não são concordantes com a hipótese de neutralidade para a manutenção dos polimorfismos, tanto em populações naturais como de laboratório, indicando a atuação da seleção natural sobre as aleloenzimas estudadas. Several {{works in}} literature {{have discussed the}} importance of the enzymatic polymorphisms in respect to the state of being adapted of the organisms. In this work, some biochemical properties of Drosophila mulleri of the allozymes EST- 5 S and EST- 5 F, which could be related to the differences in fitness values in individuals that present those enzymatic variants, were studied. The results suggest that the EST- 5 S allozyme presents larger resistance on the thermic denaturation and the chaotropics agents, as well as higher activity in elevated salt concentrations. The results of the productivity experiment at 29 °C show that the homozygous individuals to the Est- 5 S allele let more offspring than the homozygous individuals to the Est - 5 F allele. Regarding the kinetic characteristics, those allozymes do not differ in a significant way. The Km and Vmax values obtained for crude extracts allozymes were, respectively, to the EST- 5 S: 32, 54 µM/min and 1, 43 mM, and to the EST- 5 F: 33, 34 µM/min and 1, 54 mM.

40|$|Milling is a {{processing}} technology massively {{applied in}} the metal manufacturing industry. The continuous demand for higher productivity and product quality asks for better understanding {{and control of the}} machining process. A better understanding can be achieved through experimental measurement and theoretical simulations and modelling of the process and its resulting product. In particular process monitoring and control is desirable for automated control and optimization of the process and in turn of productivity and product quality. However, due to the high complexity of the process, in particular of the interaction system/process/product, the above goals have only partially been achieved today, to a limited, unsatisfactory extent. The here presented research addresses the above needs and their progress by developing and starting to implement and study a highly sophisticated sensor and analysis platform for machining with the objectives of (i) advanced measurement and analysis of the milling process and (ii) advanced process monitoring and control. For a certain highly advanced high speed machining centre a comprehensive concept has been developed for the integration different kinds of sensors to the system. In particular the complex concept takes into account sophisticated analysis, research and development through the cooperation between different experimental and theoretical methods. The present thesis presents the developed platform concept. Due to the complexity of this sensor and analysis platform and its early stage of development, the here presented research work focuses on the implementation and investigation of selected sensors and analysis methods. Paper I screens and discusses the possibilities of the applied machining centre for sensor integration, particularly aiming at process monitoring. From the large variety of relevant sensors, particularly promising turned out to be acoustic emission sensors, force sensors, accelerometers, temperature sensors and optical sensors. Their potential and limitations are discussed. The specific concept developed for the addressed high speed machining centre is described in Paper II. Force sensors measuring the spindle force components, flexible accelerometers measuring the vibrations at almost any desired spindle or product location and Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) for non-contact measurement of vibrations {{turned out to be the}} most promising sensors, to be implemented and studied in more detail in the following. Moreover, the concept recommends the cooperation of the sensors with modelling, simulation and analysis at different levels. Experimentally, the simulation of a static load to the spindle or even oscillating load through a <b>magnetic</b> <b>shaker</b> was realised in order to simulate the processing conditions for measuring and characterizing the spindle behaviour. The LDV- measurement enables precise identification of spindle oscillations at different locations. A particular challenge is the identification of stable operating points at high rotational speeds through stability lobes. For this purpose the vibrations of a certain complex, thin walled aerospace structure were measured by LDV and in good agreement simulated by FEA for different machining process stages in order to derive stable lobe areas. Beside implementation and first testing of the above mentioned methods, the paper describes and discusses possible concepts for a closed loop control of the process. In Paper III the LDV method is for the first time and successfully applied for measuring the fee-running rotating spindle of a high speed machining centre. In particular the roundness of the dummy tool applied was measured at high accuracy during rotation, as verified by mechanical measurement. Moreover, the LDV permits the measurement of misalignment of other geometrical and kinematical imperfections of the spindle rotation. Paper IV describes in more detail the verification of FEA through LDV for the complex aerospace structure, presented in Paper II. Both, vibrations of the unconstrained and of the clamped workpiece are studied. Moreover, the workpiece vibration characteristics was studied at four different machining stages, starting from aluminium stock and ending in a thin walled structure after removal of 97 % of the material. In particular the corresponding stability lobes were predicted by the aid of the FEA, compared with modal analysis and with selected milling experiments. When machining a monolithic structure that reduces it's volume to such an extent gives several problem: Clamping of a thin walled structure is hard due to its flexibility, The changing dynamics of the workpiece has the affect that prediction of the vibrational properties is very hard to realise and finally the milling is hard because of the fact that the walls of the structure bends when a force is applied from the milling tool. Paper V discusses the suitability of different sensors for process monitoring, by applying them on-line during machining experiments for steel and aluminium, each at three different feed rates. The signals of force sensors in three dimensions arranged below the workpiece, of accelerometers in two directions mounted at the spindle housings and of LDV spotting the tool fixture ring were acquired on-line. The six signals were analysed, extracting mean values that were compared to the achieved surface roughness for the six different milling conditions. From evaluation of the stability of the signal and its coherence with the surface roughness trends the suitability of each sensor was discussed. While the sensors lateral and vertical to the feeding direction were not suitable, the sensors measuring in feeding direction were most promising, in particular the accelerometer and the corresponding LDV. The context between the roughness, process and sensor signals is discussed. Summarizing, a sophisticated sensor and analysis platform concept was developed. Selective sensors and methods have been implemented and studied with the purpose of system characterization, process understanding and process monitoring. The promising results encourage for continuation of this research programme. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E
