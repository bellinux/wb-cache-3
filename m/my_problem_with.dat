Homosexuality here is shameful and is only possible when it is secret, hidden, anonymous. <b>My</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> queer theory and activism is not the theory itself. Indeed queer theory’s most important contribution is to disclose how the gay movement of the 1970 s and 1980 s only dealt with white gay male experience, thus centralising some identities and marginalising others. However my problem (or, to be more exact, my concern or maybe my own ignorance) is how to translate queer theory into the practice of everyday politics, especially in the postwar areas of the former Yugoslavia. As yet, {{it seems that the}} (radical) US queer model does not translate well into those societies on the doorstep of the European Union (EU). Even so, as someone at the Queer Zagreb conference mentioned, New York and San Francisco are not the USA, which means that ‘queering’ in some {{other parts of the country}} would provoke similar hostile reactions, or, to put it differently, one can find Bosnia in many parts of the USA.

40|$|Professor Seitz is {{perfectly}} correct {{to draw attention}} to a possible link between colorectal cancer and alcohol consump-tion.

I was also unable to find evidence to support a genetic link between alcoholism and colorectal cancer similar to the link between oesophageal cancer and alcoholism, though I accept that a different attri-bution is possible. To further muddy the water, I can say that the alcoholic doctor with colonic cancer was an avid spirit drinker and eschewed beer. I read with great interest the article by Lloyd (2002) entitled ‘One hundred alcoholic doctors: a 21 -year follow-up ’ in the July/August 2002 issue of Alcohol and Alcoholism. I was wondering, however, why, in Table 7, colonic cancer was listed among deaths due to non-alcohol causes. Although colonic cancer is less frequently associated with chronic alcohol misuse, as compared with rectal cancer, more and more data appear underlining the association between colorectal cancer and alcohol. A recent consensus panel by the WHO stated: ‘Epidemi-ological data indicate that the consumption of alcoholic beverages, even at low intake, results in an increased risk of colorectal adenomas and cancer.

40|$|I {{doubt that}} anyone could help but be im-pressed {{with the quality of}} James B. Jordan's article in the April' 78 Guardian en-titled "Post-millenialism Revised". Both Mr. Jordan's ability to write well and his ad-mirably irenic spirit will benefit us all. Perhaps I speak for some members of the church, however, when I say that I believe the millenial {{question}} is now beyond the point of the traditional discussion and for-mulation. It simply is no longer adequate to talk about eschatology as that doctrine which concentrates on the future history and its culmination. What we desperately need is eschatological living in the present as pro-claimed and demonstrated by Jesus in the Gospels and imitated by Paul in the Acts and the Epistles. At issue is what we have now in Christ in relation to what we yet expect (the "already " and the "not yet"). <b>My</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the futuristic visions is that they fail to grasp what we presently possess and thus misread our hope. Because of this, the saints have best developed the spirit of frustration and impatience rather than the spirit of adoption; because of this, our expectation is short-circuited by an earthly short-sighted-ness. Maybe Mr. Jordan and the "reconstruc-tionists " could address themselves to theo-logians with the deepest of insights into the matters at hand. What is their response to Geerhardus Vos, Herman Ridderbos, and Richard Gaffin, Jr. ? At this juncture the lev-el of the discussion could be raised for the benefit of God's people everywhere. In conclusion, could I recommend to ev-eryone the delightful article by Leslie W. Sloat in the February ' 78 Guardian, "The Task of Biblical Theology.

40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Karmaus et al. that was published recently in the American Journal of Epidemiology (1). Their finding that sibship size can influence allergic phenotype in children via prebirth factors is intriguing and actually can help explain earlier results which show that asthma is inversely related {{to the presence of}} older siblings, while early respiratory infections increase rather than decrease the risk of developing asthma (2). Karmaus et al. suggest that intrauterine factors can program the pattern of T helper 2 (Th 2) and T helper 1 (Th 1) cell response, with increased cord blood immunoglobulin E being a marker, and subsequently the number of infections and the risk of atopy (1). Thus, according to Karmaus et al., the negative associa-tion between infection and atopic manifestation is not causal but {{is more likely to be}} spurious (1). <b>My</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> such an interpretation is that it is coun-terintuitive. According to the Th 1 -Th 2 model, Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine profiles have cross-regulating abilities; that is, interferon-γ can down-regulate Th 2 responses, and inter-leukin- 4 can down-regulate Th 1 responses (3). For example, if we take a newborn with a Th 2 -Th 1 pattern that is biased at birth towards Th 2 responses, with increased cord immu-noglobulin E as one of its early manifestations, this child will theoretically be more prone to allergy and to infection (his Th 2 cytokines will suppress his Th 1 responses to infection), and subsequently Karmaus et al. ’s interpretation cannot provide an underlying mechanism by which one can explain both the effect of birth order on allergy and the negative association between infection and atopic manifestation...|$|E

He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share <b>my</b> marital <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away?
