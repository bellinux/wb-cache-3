40|$|Stata 3. 1 is {{a program}} for data <b>management,</b> <b>graphics,</b> and {{statistical}} analysis. Since Version 2. 1 was reviewed by Pederson (1991), Stata has added several platforms, third-party products, supporting services, and many features of interest to econometricians. The result is that Stata 3. 1 integrates fast and reliable manipulation of data with high-powered statistical analysis. For users who {{do no more than}} run regressions, the new features do not detract from the feel of ease and control Stata gives the researcher working with any data set, large or small. A unique system to disseminate user-written programs lets Stata grow continuously without becoming unwieldy, ensuring that Stata will become a standard package in several branches of applied statistics. This review summarizes the hardware requirements of Stata, demonstrates a short but typical Stata session, and discusses some of the unique elements of Stata.

40|$|Abstract Genetic {{data are}} now widely available. There is, however, an {{apparent}} lack of concerted effort to produce software systems for statistical analysis of genetic data compared with other fields of statistics. It is often a tremendous task for end-users to tailor them for particular data, especially when genetic data are analysed {{in conjunction with a}} large number of covariates. Here, R [URL], a free, flexible and platform-independent environment for statistical modelling and graphics is explored as an integrated system for genetic data analysis. An overview of some packages currently available for analysis of genetic data is given. This is followed by examples of package development and practical applications. With clear advantages in data <b>management,</b> <b>graphics,</b> statistical analysis, programming, internet capability and use of available codes, it is a feasible, although challenging, task to develop it into an integrated platform for genetic analysis; this will require the joint efforts of many researchers. </p...|$|E
