In addition to accommodation, mess and dayroom for the crew of nine, it initially housed two bridges at different levels. The lower bridge on the third deck was originally intended to be used when the pusher is operating on its own without a barge, allowing more comfortable conditions for the crew — the chairs in the upper bridge on the seventh deck were equipped with seatbelts due to the large motions of the vessel when operating independently. However, the lower bridge was rarely used and the space was converted to other uses when Steel was rebuilt. The upper bridge, with bridge wings extending beyond the pusher's breadth, is equipped to allow one <b>man</b> <b>bridge</b> operation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story is}} set in the fictitious {{community}} of Inisfree. This {{is not the same as}} the Lake Isle of Innisfree, a place in Lough Gill on the Sligo-Leitrim border made famous by poet William Butler Yeats, which is a tiny island. Many scenes for the film were actually shot in and around the village of Cong, County Mayo, on the grounds of Cong's Ashford Castle. Cong is now a wealthy small town and the castle a 5-star luxury hotel. The connections with the film have led to the area becoming a tourist attraction. In 2008, a pub opened in the building used as the pub in the film (it had actually been a shop at the time when the movie was shot); the pub hosts daily re-runs of the film on DVD. The Quiet Man Fan Club holds its annual general meeting in Ashford Castle. Other locations in the film include Thoor Ballylee, Co. Galway, home of poet W.B. Yeats for a period, Ballyglunin railway station near Tuam Co. Galway, which was filmed as Castletown station, and various places in Connemara Co. Galway and Co. Mayo. Among those are Lettergesh beach, where the horse race scene was filmed, the Quiet <b>Man</b> <b>Bridge,</b> signposted off the N59 road between Maam Cross and Oughterard and the [...] "White O'Morn" [...] cottage. The latter is located on R336 south of Maam, but has long ago fallen into ruin.|$|E

3000|$|... [...]. In this article, these {{parameters}} are estimated by optimizing the algorithm's performance {{for a set}} of training images and degradations. We have chosen eight gray-scale images from USC-SIPI Image Database that represent natural scenes: Couple, <b>Man,</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Elaine, MoonSurface, ChemicalPlant, Pentagon and Aerial 5.2. 09; and two spatially variant blurring kernels: BLUR 1 and BLUR 2 (PSF support size is smaller than BLUR 3 and faster to compute in spatial domain). Some of the reference images have a higher resolution than our test images, so in the training set we only have used the central portion of 256 × 256 pixels, without any scaling. As figure of merit to be maximized we have used the average ISNR (increment in Signal-to-Noise Ratio), in decibels, of all the considered deblurring tests (two blurs, eight images), independently {{for each of the three}} noise levels considered. Whereas it may be argued that this is not an ideal quality measurement (for several reasons), it is nevertheless quite simple, and it seems to behave robustly enough for this purpose. We believe that in this case the overlapping of BLUR 1 and BLUR 2 in the training and test stages, though not being ideal, it is a justified decision in the context of achieving a reasonable tradeoff among computational cost, quality and generality. Note that the test images are different from the training images, and that the test blurs include a case not used in the training set (BLUR 3).|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1924 during British colonial rule. The bridge was named Lady <b>Manning</b> <b>Bridge</b> in honour of the wife of William Manning, the British Governor of Ceylon.

50|$|Mansbridge is {{a suburb}} on the {{northern}} perimeter of Southampton, England. The area is named after the <b>Mans</b> <b>Bridge</b> which spans the River Itchen. For a considerable time, this was the southern-most crossing point of the river, before the construction of Woodmill in Swaythling. The bridge itself still stands and is a Grade II listed structure but is closed to road traffic (pedestrians and cyclists may still use it), having {{been replaced by a}} larger and more modern road bridge to carry the A27.|$|R

Stirling encouraged the young man to continue his studies of it. By 1865, Bridges had completed a manuscript of an English-Yahgan dictionary. He noted in a preface that he was using the Ellis Phonetic System established by Alexander Ellis.|$|R

50|$|As a young <b>man,</b> <b>Bridges</b> {{had learned}} the {{indigenous}} language of Yamana and closely studied the culture over his lifetime. Over more than a decade, he compiled a grammar and dictionary in Yamana-English of more than 30,000 words. His son Lucas Bridges donated the work to the British Library of London in 1930. Part of the dictionary was published in 1933, then consisting only of the Yamana-English portion. That was edited and published commercially in 1987, since reprinted in 2011. An English-Yamana manuscript, dated 1865, was discovered in the British Library by Alfredo Prieto. The two portions have been published together online at the Patagonian Bookshelf website to provide free access.|$|R
