25|$|Many of the {{elements}} that form volatile high-valence fluorides will also form volatile high-valence chlorides. Chlorination and distillation is another possible method for separation. The sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides; for example, zirconium tetrachloride and tin tetrachloride have relatively low boiling points of 331°C and 114.1°C. Chlorination has even been proposed as a method for removing zirconium fuel cladding, instead of <b>mechanical</b> <b>decladding.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{character}} and magnitude of hazards involved in processing liquid metal bonded fuels was made and the scope of a preliminary experimental program outlined. Processing of SRE and CPPD fuels by <b>mechanical</b> <b>decladding</b> followed by controlled reaction of the collected methods. Simdlarly, shearing of PRDC fuel and controlled exposure of the Na in the severed portions to water appears more desfrable than chethical dissolution of the metallic cladding. (auth...|$|E
