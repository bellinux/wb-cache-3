However, laboratory studies have demonstrated decreased bromsulpha-lein excretion (1), decreased hippuric acid syn-thesis (2), and diminished concentration of serum proteins particularly with reduction in serum al-bumen (3). Needle biopsy of the liver in a series of patients with usual degrees of thyrotoxicosis failed to demonstrate significant hepatic lesions (4). On the other hand, pathological study of the livers of subjects with fatal hyperthyroidism has quite regularly shown simple atrophy, con-gestion of sinusoids, and fatty metamorphosis (5 - 8). In many instances, necrosis of hepatic cells of a focal or centro-lobular distribution and even a moderate degree of cirrhosis as evidenced by fibrosis, lymphoid infiltration, and bile duct pro-liferation, have been found. An extensive centro-lobular necrosis of the liver has been seen in some fatal cases. This lesion is comparable to the cen-tral necrosis produced in animals by a combina-tion of excessive thyroid feeding together with anoxia (9), carbon tetrachloride intoxication (10), or infection (11, 12).

40|$|Glaucoma is {{associated}} with excitotoxicity in which increased glutamate release leads to apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Acetylcholine (ACh) has shown neuroprotection of RGCs through the stimulation of RGCs’ nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The cholinergic amacrine cells are the only cells in retina which synthesize and release ACh. They get excitatory inputs from bipolar cells. The presence of α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α 7 nAChRs) on the cholinergic amacrines, bipolar cells and RGCs is documented. Recently, stimulation of presynaptic nAChRs of cholinergic cells was shown to enhance ACh release in the rat superior cervical ganglion. Therefore, we hypothesized that α 7 nAChRs stimulation by tropisetron and PNU 282987 (α 7 nAChR agonists) could induce ACh release through either direct stimulation of cholinergic amacrine α 7 nAChRs or indirect stimulation of bipolar α 7 nAChRs. For ACh release studies, pig eyes were dissected and cholinergic amacrine cells were labeled with 40 μCi of 3 H-choline in which the retina was flashed with light (3 Hz) for 30 minutes to maximize 3 H-choline uptake. Then, the eyecup was transferred to a perfusion chamber, washed for 20 minutes. 1 <b>minute</b> <b>output</b> fractions were collected into vials and prepared for liquid scintillation counting. To assess {{the viability of the}} preparation, light and kainate were applied. Light (2 - 3 fold increase), kainate (3 - 4 fold; 10 - 100 μM), α 7 nAChR agonists (2 - 4 fold; 0. 01 - 100 nM) evoked ACh release greater than the baseline in the absence of DNQX (a glutamate receptor antagonist). In the presence of DNQX, which blocked bipolar input to cholinergic cells, α 7 nAChRs stimulation did not increase ACh release from baseline. Hence, the possibility of indirect input of bipolar α 7 nAChRs for ACh release was supported. Our results indicate that ACh release through α 7 nAChRs stimulation is possible and specifically the bipolar α 7 nAChRs release of ACh via an indirect positive feedback mechanism. During excitotoxicity, ACh released by amacrine cells, might feedback on bipolar nAChRs to increase ACh release. The neuroprotective effect of tropisetron on α 7 nAChRs on isolated RGCs is documented. Our study suggests that tropisetron might also protect RGCs through increased ACh release by possible indirect modulation. This study indicates the possibility of dual therapeutic targets of α 7 nAChRs in the retina for neuroprotection against RGC excitotoxicity...|$|E

We did not estimate the oxygen consumption because of the reaction of untrained unan-esthetized animals to the procedures used in measuring it. We did not wish to anesthetize the animals because of the secondary changes that accompany anesthesia. Because of the undesirable effect of morphine on the respiration and in slowing the heart rate we decided against its use. We have also performed a few experiments on trained unanes-thetized dogs.

The real-time models are validated against ground-based measurements of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in a temporal range varying from 15 -min to monthly means, while a sensitivity analysis of the cloud and aerosol effects on SSR is performed to ensure reliability under different sky and climatological conditions. The simulated outputs, compared to their common training dataset created by the radiative transfer model (RTM) libRadtran, showed median error values in the range − 15 to 15  % for the NN that produces spectral irradiances (NNS), 5 – 6  % underestimation for the integrated NN and close to zero errors for the MRF technique.

This results in an increase in cardiac output to ensure that blood flow to the muscle is matched to the metabolic needs”.
