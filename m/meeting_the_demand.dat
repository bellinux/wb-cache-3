About 4,666 men who previously commuted daily across the border from Spain were now cut off.

Police received thousands of tips based on references in the publicized portions of the letter, all of which proved useless.

Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was curcumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates {{the first and second}} stages by a low-pressure hose, and releases exhaled gas at the second stage.

25|$|The Labour Party {{originated}} in the late 19th century, <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for a new political party to represent the interests {{and needs of the}} urban working class, a demographic which had increased in number, and many of whom only gained suffrage {{with the passage of the}} Representation of the People Act 1884. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the Independent Labour Party, the intellectual and largely middle-class Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and the Scottish Labour Party.|$|E
25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral. A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply. This involves <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities, or other financial instruments. Monetary targets, such as inflation, interest rates, or exchange rates, are used to guide this implementation.|$|E

2500|$|Because only 4 {{percent of}} the nation's {{secondary}} education graduates are admitted to universities, China has {{found it necessary to}} develop other ways of <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for education. Adult education has become increasingly important in helping China meet its modernization goals. Adult, or [...] "nonformal," [...] education is an alternative form of higher education that encompasses radio, television, and correspondence universities, spare-time and part-time universities, factory-run universities for staff and workers, and county-run universities for peasants, many operating primarily during students' off-work hours. These alternative forms of education are economical. They had sought to educate both the [...] "delayed generation" [...] - those who lost educational opportunities during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) - and to raise the cultural, scientific, and general education levels of workers on the job.|$|E

When a demonstration resulted in a diver passing out, he began to develop the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates {{the first and second}} stages by a low-pressure hose, and releases exhaled gas at the second stage. This avoided the Cousteau-Gagnan patent, which protected the twin-hose scuba regulator. In the process, Eldred also improved performance of the regulator.
