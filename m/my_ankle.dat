5|$|The abscess in <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> {{was painful}} and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot. Garland was unable to walk for nearly a week after Gunslinger finished shooting, writing that [...] "I had screwed up <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> so bad!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Amos {{formed a}} musical group called Y Kant Tori Read, named for her {{difficulty}} sight reading. In addition to Amos, {{the group was}} composed of Steve Caton (who would later play guitars on all of her albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. The band went through several iterations of songwriting and recording; Amos has said interference from record executives caused the band to lose its musical edge and direction during this time. Finally, in July 1988, the band's self-titled debut album, Y Kant Tori Read, was released. Although its producer, Joe Chiccarelli, stated that Amos was {{very happy with the}} album at the time, Amos has since criticized it, once remarking: [...] "The only good thing about that album is <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> high boots." ...|$|E
2500|$|On fight night, {{in front}} of a 6,513 crowd, Hopkins lost to Smith via TKO when he was knocked out of the ring in the 8th round and failed to make it back into the ring as referee Jack Reiss made a 20 count. Smith Jr. seemed to {{struggle}} through the first seven rounds with the boxing skills of Hopkins, although he was ahead on two judges' scorecards at the time of stoppage. In the 8th round, Smith caught Hopkins in the corner and landed five shots to the head that knocked him out of the ring. Hopkins said he was hurt and couldn't get back in the ring. He insisted that he had been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it was not a push. Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, [...] "He shoved me out of the ring. <b>My</b> <b>ankle</b> got twist when I fell out of the ring. I couldn't stand on my feet. If I wouldn't have been pushed out of the ring, I believe he was starting to fade... I can't believe they gave him a TKO. They can call it a no contest but not a loss. The momentum from his body pushed me. I went out like a soldier. I'm not in a denial." [...] Hopkins sat down with HBO's Max Kellerman in the locker room after the fight and confirmed this would be his final fight. Smith Jr. retained his WBC International light heavyweight title. Hopkins' reported purse was $800,000, compared to Smith's $140,000. According to RingTV, the fight averaged 934,000 viewers, peaking at 1.035m on HBO.|$|E

30|$|Co-reference {{resolution}} The coreference or {{anaphoric reference}} resolution is {{the replacement of}} anaphoric references with their corresponding antecedent. For example, the text: “By use of Glucophage I felt stomach pain. It’s severe and also <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> are swelling badly.” Contains anaphoric reference. After anaphora resolution, we g,” “By use of Glucophage I felt stomach pain. <Stomach pain> is severe and also <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> are swelling badly”. We used JavaRAP (Qiu et al. 2004) for coreference resolution, which replaces anaphoric references with their corresponding antecedent and thus anaphora free text is obtained.|$|R

60|$|Here {{they threw}} me upon the ground, binding <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> {{together}} and trussing {{them up to}} my wrists behind. There they left me, lying upon my stomach--a most uncomfortable and strained position, to which was added the pain where the cords cut into my flesh.|$|R

60|$|I {{was still}} {{thinking}} {{it over and}} straining with my wrists and <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> when their chief came out from his grotto, and after some talk with his lieutenant, who lay groaning near the fire, they both nodded their heads and looked across at me. He then said some few words to the band, who clapped their hands and laughed uproariously. Things looked ominous, and I was delighted to feel that my hands were so far free that I could easily slip them through the cords if I wished. But with <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> I feared that I could do nothing, for when I strained it brought such pain into my lance-wound that I had to gnaw my moustache to keep from crying out. I could only lie still, half-free and half-bound, and see what turn things were likely to take.|$|R
