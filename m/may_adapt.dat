5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|With this {{widespread}} appeal, {{the myth}} appears in more ancient texts {{than any other}} myth and in an exceptionally broad range of Egyptian literary styles. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, different versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most Egyptian myths.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{many species}} of Crepidotus have been {{described}} {{due to differences in}} single morphological character traits. Phylogenetic analysis is showing that these morphological differences are often due to phenotypic plasticity — species <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> to different environments by assuming variations in growth forms. Recent taxonomic revisions have shown that several species formerly considered unique are conspecific. Further study is required to more accurately delineate infrageneric relationships in this taxa.|$|E
25|$|The African rock python {{is still}} {{relatively}} common {{in many regions}} across Africa, and <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> to disturbed habitats, provided that food is available. It is not currently considered at risk of extinction, but is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, meaning international trade in African rock pythons should be carefully monitored and controlled, giving wild populations some protection from overcollection for pets and skins. The species {{is also likely to}} occur in a number of protected areas, such as the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, a World Heritage site.|$|E

The IUCN notes that the gopher is common in its range; studies indicate that populations can recover rapidly after traps are removed from an area, and the species <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> well to environmental changes.|$|E

2500|$|While Reform rabbis in 19th-century Germany had to {{accommodate}} conservative elements in their communities, {{at the height}} of [...] "Classical Reform" [...] in the United States, halakhic considerations could be virtually ignored and Holdheim's approach embraced. In the 1930s and onwards, Rabbi Solomon Freehof and his supporters reintroduced such elements, but they too regarded Jewish Law as too rigid a system. Instead, they recommended that selected features will be readopted and new observances established in a piecemeal fashion, as spontaneous minhag (custom) emerging by trial and error and becoming widespread if it appealed to the masses. The advocates of this approach also stress that their responsa are of non-binding nature, and their recipients <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> them as they see fit. Freehof's successors, such as Rabbis Walter Jacob and Moshe Zemer, further elaborated the notion of [...] "Progressive Halakha" [...] along the same lines.|$|E

60|$|Unquestionably, Western man {{though he}} be, and Kentuckian by birth, President Lincoln is the {{essential}} representative of all Yankees, and the veritable specimen, physically, of what the world seems determined to regard as our characteristic qualities. It is the strangest and yet the fittest thing in the jumble of human vicissitudes, that he, out of so many millions, unlooked for, unselected by any intelligible process that could be based upon his genuine qualities, unknown to those who chose him, and unsuspected of what endowments <b>may</b> <b>adapt</b> him for his tremendous responsibility, should have found the way open for him to fling his lank personality into the chair of state,--where, I presume, {{it was his first}} impulse to throw his legs on the council-table, and tell the Cabinet Ministers a story. There is no describing his lengthy awkwardness, nor the uncouthness of his movement; and yet it seemed as if I had been in the habit of seeing him daily, and had shaken hands with him a thousand times in some village street; so true was he to the aspect of the pattern American, though with a certain extravagance which, possibly, I exaggerated still further by the delighted eagerness with which I took it in. If put to guess his calling and livelihood, I should have taken him for a country schoolmaster as soon as anything else. He was dressed in a rusty black frock-coat and pantaloons, unbrushed, and worn so faithfully that the suit had adapted itself to the curves and angularities of his figure, and had grown to be an outer skin of the man. He had shabby slippers on his feet. His hair was black, still unmixed with gray, stiff, somewhat bushy, and had apparently been acquainted with neither brush nor comb that morning, after the disarrangement of the pillow; and as to a night-cap, Uncle Abe probably knows nothing of such effeminacies. His complexion is dark and sallow, betokening, I fear, an insalubrious atmosphere around the White House; he has thick black eyebrows and an impending brow; his nose is large, and the lines about his mouth are very strongly defined.|$|E
