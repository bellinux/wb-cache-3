40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of wealth distribution in an economy where dynasties with different wealth have constant <b>marginal</b> <b>saving</b> <b>rates,</b> firms’ productivities are subject to idiosyncratic shocks and factors’ returns are determined in competitive markets. Government imposes taxes on capital and labour incomes and redistributes the collected resources to individuals. The equilibrium distribution of wealth is explicitly calculated and it follows a Paretian law in the top tail. The Pareto exponent depends on the <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> in a nonmonotonic fashion, on the net return on capital, on {{the growth rate of}} population and on the degree of portfolio diversification. On the contrary, the bottom tail of the wealth distribution mostly depends on the characteristics of the labour market. The resulting theoretical predictions find a corroboration in the empirical experiences of Italy and United States in the period 1987 - 2004. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{implemented}} {{within a}} favourable legislative framework, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can produce domestic growth-enhancing spillovers in host countries. Other potential positive effects include {{the provision of}} investment capital, the creation of local employment and the transfer of sophisticated technology or advanced knowledge. African nations in particular have been historically reliant on externally-provided funds. Prevailing low income levels, <b>marginal</b> <b>savings</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the absence of}} functioning financial markets necessary to provide local start-up capital continue to keep Africa reliant on foreign inflows. Considering China’s increasing financial commitments to Sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) over the last decade, this study examines the state of current Sino-African investment relationships. Specific attention is paid to the outcomes of this strategic bilateral alliance in order {{to determine whether or not}} a mutually beneficial investment relationship has evolved. The distinct nature and structure of, the motivation behind and the most significant determinants of Chinese FDI to SSA are all analysed in accordance with traditional FDI theories. A case study approach is used to establish whether China’s contemporary interest in SSA differs from historical investments and to also investigate country-specific commonalities and differences. Of particular relevance to SSA are resource-backed Chinese loans that finance major infrastructure projects in host nations. Interestingly, a lot of the Sino-African investment packages resemble similar deals struck between China and Japan in the 1970 s. The results of this study indicate that China’s investment motives seem more diverse than initially expected. Resource-seeking, profit-seeking and market access-seeking reasons appear to be the most important motives. After establishing the Top- Ten recipients of Chinese FDI in SSA, these nations are then classified into three major categories: resource-, oil- or agricultural-rich nations. Undiversified resource- or oil-rich economies are found to have secured the largest shares of Chinese FDI. This study suggests that China’s contemporary “African Safari” is an unconventional way of providing financial assistance. Rather than solely supplying FDI, China finances a diverse mix of instruments, the most important being concessional loans, export credits, zero-interest loans and the establishment of Special Economic Zones. A profound difference to traditional Western investment packages is China’s non-interference approach. Accordingly, Beijing not only refrains from intervening in host countries’ domestic affairs but also refuses to attach formal conditionalties to its loans. China’s “financial safari” into Africa has produced many positive as well as negative effects in host countries. Nevertheless, it would seem that the positive effects outweigh the negative and China’s FDI could contribute to sustainable development in SS...|$|R

In this study, we investigate {{the determinants of}} the private <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> in Turkey, with a special focus {{on the role of}} mortgage debt.

40|$|The {{adjusted}} net <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> initially {{known as}} the genuine <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> was first published by the World Bank in the late 1990 s as a more comprehensive measure of national saving and one more indicative of sustainable development. The adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> incorporated not just physical capital depreciation, but natural capital depletion and environmental damage, as well as including some human capital formation. In this paper, using a cross‐section of developing economies for 2001 – 2006, determinants of the adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> are estimated. For comparison, the same determinants for the gross national <b>saving</b> <b>rate</b> are estimated. Also, a basic Solow growth model is extended to incorporate natural resources and to justify a more comprehensive measure of savings, such as the adjusted net <b>saving</b> <b>rate,</b> for modeling economic growth. The two measures of savings are then compared as determinants in estimations of economic growth.
