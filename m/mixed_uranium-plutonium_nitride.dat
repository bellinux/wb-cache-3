40|$|Understanding of the {{behaviour}} {{of nuclear}} material in extreme conditions {{is essential for}} the analyses of the operation limits of nuclear fuels, and prediction of possible nuclear reaction accidents. In this context, the high temperature behaviour of uranium <b>nitride</b> and <b>mixed</b> <b>uranium–plutonium</b> <b>nitrides</b> has been studied in the present work by laser heating under controlled atmosphere coupled with fast multi-wavelength pyrometry. Such an approach has allowed performing a thermal arrest analysis and establishing the solid–liquid phase boundaries in the investigated compositions, whereby non-congruent vaporisation was avoided by setting a suitable nitrogen overpressure. In addition, the normal spectral emissivities of the current samples were determined by radiance spectroscopy. Besides revealing a slightly more metallic optical behaviour in plutonium-containing compositions, this latter characterisation led to the determination of the real melting/solidification temperatures of the investigated nitrides. It is confirmed that UN melts congruently at (3120 ± 30) K in a nitrogen pressure of 0. 25 MPa (2. 5 bar). The melting/solidification temperatures decrease in plutonium containing samples, reaching (3045 ± 25) K for x(PuN) = 0. 2, a composition of interest for potential applications of this material as a nuclear fuel. Besides their fundamental importance, the current results are useful for {{a deeper understanding of the}} nitride fuel behaviour under accidental conditions, whereby uncontrolled thermal excursions might occur in the nuclear reactor core.

However, {{a substantial increase in}} breeding achieved thanks to the use of this fuel instead of oxide fuel is not enough to meet new requirements the major of which, minimization of the burn-up reactivity margin, is defined by the reactor core breeding. This paper presents the results of computational studies aimed at choosing the best possible layout for the core of a large fast-neutron sodium-cooled reactor meeting modern requirements. Metallic fuel has been considered as the fuel for fast-neutron reactors since their early designs due to high density and heat conductivity and the smallest possible number of the diluent nuclei which provides for the highest possible breeding efficiency. The paper presents the features of the fuel under consideration and the results of computational studies into its application in large fast-neutron sodium-cooled reactors as compared to nitride fuel.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{defects in}} the fluorite structure are anion vacancies and interstitials. Cation defects occur {{at a much}} smaller rate {{and are therefore more}} difficult to study. They are, however, of crucial interest since they are rate-determining for many high temperature matter transport processes. Cation diffusion was therefore investigated in the temperature range ~ 1 400 to 2 200 °C. In stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric oxides, MO 2 and MO 2 +x (M = U or U + Pu), a vacancy mechanism is indicated with diffusion rates increasing roughly proportional to x 2. In MO 2 -x, a decrease in diffusion rates with x is observed for small values of x until a minimum is indicated. On further reduction, diffusion rates increase again. It is argued that this increase reflects a mechanism involving metal interstitials, hence most probably an interstitialcy mechanism of diffusion, though the alternative of a predominant transport via Schottky trios cannot be excluded. The relevant formation energies of point defects in the UO 2 fluorite structure, as deduced from the diffusion data, compare favorably with theoretical predictions and measured values for the isostructural earth alkali halides, CaF 2 and BaF 2.

Thus, the oxygen partial pressure, p(O 2), of the sintering gas has to be precisely controlled, otherwise a large dispersion in various parameters, critical for the manufacturing of ceramics such as nuclear oxides fuels, is likely to occur. In the present work, the densification behaviour and the solid solution formation of a <b>mixed</b> <b>uranium-plutonium</b> oxide (MOX) were investigated.

They {{provide the basis for}} a strong verification and detection system to safeguard nuclear activities. Worldwide needs for continued and improved Isotopic Reference Materials (IRM) are the main reason for developments of new nuclear reference materials at IRMM. Measurement capabilities of laboratories have evolved considerably over the years hand in hand with progress in modern analytical techniques. But some plutonium reference materials are already on the market for decades. The availability of new reference materials with appropriate small uncertainties of the certified values is essential for measurement laboratories striving to meet the International Target Values for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITVs). The preparation and the certification of such materials are demanding and challenging tasks that require state-of-the-art measurement procedures and equipment. The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) has repeatedly demonstrated its capabilities in plutonium analysis and represents one of the few institutes that supplies plutonium IRMs worldwide. IRMM has recently performed an inter-calibration campaign inter-linking selected plutonium spike IRMs on a metrological basis, applying state-of-the art measurement procedures. In the scope of this compatibility study new reference materials have been prepared for Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) in nuclear fuel cycle measurements. A new series of large-sized dried (LSD) spikes IRMM- 1027 n has been prepared and certified for plutonium and uranium amount content and isotopic composition. These mixed spikes are applied to measure the uranium and plutonium content of dissolved fuel solutions using isotope dilution mass spectrometry.

IRMM- 049 d was prepared from the same stock solution as its predecessor IRMM- 049 c, dating from 1996, but this 242 Pu spike has certified values with smaller combined uncertainties. These reference materials were prepared by dissolving the base materials in nitric acid and are certified for the amount content by gravimetry or isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS).

In August 2002, LLNL began to also use DOE-STD- 3013 - 2000 containers for HEU oxide and mixed U-Pu oxide. These DOE-STD- 3013 - 2000 containers are comprised of a stainless steel convenience can enclosed in welded stainless steel primary and secondary containers. Compared to the double thin-walled containers, the DOE-STD- 3013 - 2000 containers have substantially thicker walls, and the density of materials in these containers was found to extend over a greater range (1. 35 g/cm{sup 3 } to 4. 62 g/cm{sup 3 }) than foreseen for the double thin-walled containers. Further, the DOE-STD- 3013 - 2000 Standard allows for oxides containing at least 30 wt% Pu plus U whereas the calibration algorithms for thin-walled containers were derived for virtually pure HEU or mixed U-Pu oxides.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the room temperature ductility behavior of irradiated Zircaloy- 4 nuclear fuel cladding has been developed and applied to evaluate tensile hoop strength of material irradiated to different levels. The test utilizes a polyurethane plug fitted within a tubular cladding specimen. A cylindrical punch is used to compress the plug axially, which generates a radial displacement that acts upon the inner diameter of the specimen. Position sensors track the radial displacement of the specimen outer diameter as the compression proceeds. These measurements coupled with ram force data provide a load-displacement characterization of the cladding response to internal pressurization. The development of this simple, cost-effective, highly reproducible test for evaluating tensile hoop strain {{as a function of}} internal pressure for irradiated specimens represents a significant advance in the mechanical characterization of irradiated cladding. In this project, nuclear fuel rod assemblies using Zircaloy- 4 cladding and two types of <b>mixed</b> <b>uranium-plutonium</b> oxide (MOX) fuel pellets were irradiated to varying levels of burnup.

Fuel pellets manufactured by both methods were contained in fuel rod assemblies and irradiated to burnup levels of 9, 21, 30, 40, and 50 GWd/MT. These levels of fuel burnup correspond to fast (E > 1 MeV) fluences of 0. 27, 0. 68, 0. 98, 1. 4 and 1. 7 1021 neutrons/cm 2, respectively.

The fission product 148 Nd is an ideal burnup indicator, when appropriate correction factors are applied. In the ATR test environment, the spectrum-dependent and burnup-dependent correction factors (see Section 5 for detailed discussion) can be substantial in high fuel burnup. The validated Monte Carlo depletion tool (MCWO) used in this study can provide a burnup-dependent correction factor for the reactor parameters, such as capture-to-fission ratios, isotopic concentrations and compositions, fission power, and spectrum in a straightforward fashion. Furthermore, the correlation curve generated by MCWO can be coupled with the 239 Pu/Pu ratio measured by a Mass Spectrometer (in the new MCWO-MS method) to obtain a best-estimate MOX fuel burnup. A Monte Carlo - MCWO method can eliminate the generation of few-group cross sections. The MCWO depletion tool can analyze the detailed spatial and spectral self-shielding effects in UO 2, WG-MOX, and reactor-grade mixed oxide (RG-MOX) fuel pins. The MCWO-MS tool only needs the MS-measured 239 Pu/Pu ratio, without the measured isotope 148 Nd concentration data, to determine the burnup accurately. MCWO-MS not only provided linear heat generation rate, Pu isotopic composition versus burnup, and burnup distributions within the WG-MOX fuel capsules, but also correctly pointed out the inconsistency in the large difference in burnups obtained by the 148 Nd method...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe ternary {{thermodynamic}} U–Pu–O {{system has}} been studied for decades for MOX fuel applications but the phase diagram is still not precisely described mostly in the UO 2 –PuO 2 –Pu 2 O 3 sub-system. Furthermore, <b>uranium–plutonium</b> <b>mixed</b> oxides containing high amounts of plutonium are now being considered {{within the scope of}} future nuclear reactors. Within this framework, obtaining homogeneous mixed oxides by powder metallurgy is paramount. The studied process is based on UO 2 and PuO 2 co-milling and applied to compounds with high Pu content. The objective of this study is obtaining microstructures free of local heterogeneities in the U–Pu distribution which are not suitable for research studies. Furthermore, in case of prospective irradiation application, local high Pu concentrations lead to “hot spots” in the material influencing the fission. ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of fresh}} <b>uranium-plutonium</b> <b>mixed</b> oxide (MOX) fuel in light-water {{reactors}} (LWR) is increasing in Europe and Japan {{and it is}} necessary to verify the plutonium content in the fuel for international safeguards purposes. The UWCC is a new instrument that has been designed to operate underwater and nondestructively measure the plutonium in unirradiated MOX fuel assemblies. The UWCC can be quickly configured to measure either boiling-water reactor (BWR) or pressurized-water reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies. The plutonium loading per unit length is measured using the UWCC to precisions of less than 1 % in a measurement time of 2 to 3 minutes. Initial calibrations of the UWCC were completed on measurements of MOX fuel in Mol, Belgium. The MCNP-REN Monte Carlo simulation code is being benchmarked to the calibration measurements to allow accurate simulations for extended calibrations of the UWCC...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUranium–plutonium mixed oxides {{incorporating}} high {{amounts of}} plutonium are considered for future nuclear reactors. For plutonium content above 20 %, a phase separation occurs, {{depending on the}} temperature and on the oxygen stoichiometry. Here, using an in situ fast X-ray diffraction device dedicated to radioactive materials, we evidenced a phase separation occurring during rapid cooling from 1773 K to room temperature at the rates of 0. 05 and 2 K s− 1 for two (U 1 −yPuy) O 2 −x compounds, with y = 0. 28 and 0. 45, under a reducing atmosphere. Optical microscopy reveals that the cooling rate impacts the microstructure of the fuel pellet by inducing severe macroscopic cracks. These results are important for using <b>uranium–plutonium</b> <b>mixed</b> oxides with high plutonium content as nuclear fuels. Considering the associated issues, they dictate a cautious attitude when defining their conditions of fabrication...|$|R
40|$|The oxides of the {{transuranic}} elements {{have been the}} subject of numerous investigations since the discovery of neptunium (Np) and plutonium (Pu) in 1940 – 1941. Similar to uranium oxides, they are stable under atmospheric conditions and do not require complicated synthesis. Once they were produced in substantial quantities they became available for experiments. Early research included their structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic characterization, mainly at ambient and cryogenic temperatures. Only in the 1960 s were systematic studies undertaken on the (very) high-temperature properties of the oxides of the {{transuranic elements}}. This was in part because the <b>uranium-plutonium</b> <b>mixed</b> dioxide was becoming the prevailing fuel choice for fast reactors, and because the well-studied metal fuel exhibited dimensional instability during irradiation for which solutions were not easily found. Oxide fuel operates at a much higher temperature, only a few hundreds of kelvins below melting, resulting in an almost complete fission gas release, and, hence, a remarkable stability up to high burnup.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the time-dependent dynamics of transitioning from a once-through fuel cycle to a closed fuel cycle. The once-through system involves only Light Water Reactors (LWRs) operating on uranium oxide fuel UOX), while the closed cycle includes both LWRs and fast spectrum reactors (FRs) {{in either a}} single-tier system or two-tier fuel system. The single-tier system includes full transuranic recycle in FRs while the two-tier system adds one pass of <b>mixed</b> oxide <b>uranium-plutonium</b> (MOX U-Pu) fuel in the LWR. While the analysis primarily focuses on burner fast reactors, transuranic conversion ratios up to 1. 0 are assessed {{and many of the}} findings apply to any fuel cycle transitioning from a thermal once-through system to a synergistic thermal-fast recycle system. These findings include uranium requirements for a range of nuclear electricity growth rates, the importance of back end fuel cycle facility timing and magnitude, the impact of employing a range of fast reactor conversion ratios, system sensitivity to used fuel cooling time prior to recycle, impacts on a range of waste management indicators, and projected electricity cost ranges for once-through, single-tier and two-tier systems. The study confirmed that significant waste management benefits can be realized as soon as recycling is initiated, but natural uranium savings are minimal in this century. The use of MOX in LWRs decouples the development of recycle facilities from fast reactor fielding, but also significantly delays and limits fast reactor deployment. In all cases, fast reactor deployment was significantly below than predicted by static equilibrium analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} bias of criticality safety computer codes must {{be established}} through the validation of the codes to critical experiments. A large collection of suitable experiments has been vetted by the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiment Program (ICSBEP) and made available in the International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments (IHECSBE). A {{total of more than}} 350 cases from this reference have been prepared and reviewed within the Verified, Archived Library of Inputs and Data (VALID) maintained by the Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The performance of the KENO V. a and KENO-VI Monte Carlo codes within the Scale 6. 1 code system with ENDF/B-VII. 0 cross-section data in 238 -group and continuous energy is assessed using the VALID models of benchmark experiments. The TSUNAMI tools for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are utilized to examine some systems further in an attempt to identify potential causes of unexpected results. The critical experiments available for validation of the KENO V. a code cover eight different broad categories of systems. These systems use a range of fissile materials including a range of uranium enrichments, various plutonium isotopic vectors, and <b>mixed</b> <b>uranium-plutonium</b> oxides. The physical form of the fissile material also varies and is represented as metal, solutions, or arrays of rods or plates in a water moderator. The neutron energy spectra of the systems also vary and cover both fast and thermal spectra. Over 300 of the total cases used utilize the KENO V. a code. The critical experiments available for the validation of the KENO-VI code cover three broad categories of systems. The fissile materials in the systems vary and include high and intermediate-enrichment uranium and mixed uranium/plutonium oxides. The physical form of the fissile material is either metal or rod arrays in water. As with KENO V. a, both fast and thermal neutron energy spectra are represented in the systems considered. The results indicate generally good performance of both the KENO V. a and KENO-VI codes across the range of systems analyzed. The bias of calculated k{sub eff} from expected values is less than 0. 9 % {Delta}k in all cases. All eight categories of experiments show biases of less than 0. 5 % {Delta}k in KENO V. a with the exception of intermediate enrichment metal systems using the 238 -group library. The continuous energy library generally manifests lower biases than the multi-group data. The KENO-VI results show slightly larger biases, though this may primarily be the result of modeling systems with more geometric complexity, which are more difficult to describe accurately, even with a generalized geometry code like KENO-VI. Several additional conclusions can be drawn from the results of this validation effort. These conclusions include that the TSUNAMI tools can be used successfully to explain the cause of aberrant results, that some evaluations in the IHECSBE should be updated to provide more rigorous expected k{sub eff} values and uncertainties, and that potential cross-section errors can be identified by detailed review of the results of this validation. It also appears that the overall cross-section uncertainty as quantified through the Scale covariance library is overestimated. Overall, the KENO V. a and KENO-VI codes are shown to provide consistent, low bias results {{for a wide range of}} physical systems of potential interest in criticality safety applications...|$|R
