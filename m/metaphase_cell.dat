40|$|Fusing human HeLa <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> with HeLa {{interphase}} cells resulted within 30 min {{in either}} of two phenomena in the resultant binucleate cell: either prophasing of the interphase nucleus or formation of a normal-appearing nuclear envelope around the metaphase chromosomes. The frequency of either occurrence was strongly dependent on environmental pH. At pH's of 6. 6 8. 0, prophasing predominated; at pH 8. 5 nuclear envelope formation predominated. Additionally, the frequencies of the two events in multinucleate cells depended on the metaphase/interphase ratio. When the ratio was 0. 33 nuclear envelope formation predominated; when it was 2. 0 prophasing predominated. In their general features, the results with fused HeLa cells resembled those reported earlier with fused Chinese hamster Don cells. However, the results provided an indication that between pH 6. 6 and 8. 0 the HeLa <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> possessed a much greater capacity than the Don <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> to induce prophasing. Fusion of Don <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> with HeLa interphase cells or of Don interphase <b>cells</b> with HeLa <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> at pH 8. 0 resulted in nuclear envelope formation or prophasing in each kind of heterokaryon. As in the homokaryons, the frequencies of the two events in the heterokaryons depended on the metaphase/interphase ratio. The statistics of prophasing and nuclear envelope formation in the homo- and heterokaryon populations {{were consistent with the}} notion that disruption or formation of the nuclear envelope depends on the balance attained between disruptive and formative processes...|$|R
40|$|Two-wavelength Feulgen microspectrophotometry {{was used}} to {{determine}} the DNA content of mitotically-active ganglionic cells of first-and thirdinstar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. The measurements revealed that the DNA values differ, on the average, by a factor of approximately two, with the <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> of the first-instar larvae having about four times the haploid amount of the spermatozoon, and the <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> of the third-instar larvae having about eight times the haploid amount. The increase from 4 C to 8 C in the course of development without any pronounced modification of the heterochromatic—euchromatic ratio is interpreted as evidence of {{an increase in the number}} of chromosomal strands.

40|$|Primitive erythroblasts in the {{circulating}} {{blood of the}} chick embryo continue to divide while synthesizing hemoglobin (Hb). Hb measurements on successive generations of erythroblasts {{show that there is}} a progressive increase in the Hb content of both interphase and <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, for any given embryo the Hb content of <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> is always significantly greater than that of interphase cells. The distribution of Hb values for <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> suggests that there are six Hb classes corresponding to the number of cell cycles in the proliferative phase. The location of erythroblasts in the cell cycle was determined by combining Feulgen cytophotometry with thymidine radioautography on the same cells. Measurements of the Hb content for erythroblasts in different compartments of the cell cycle (G 1, S, G 2, and M) show a progressive increase through the cycle. Thus, the amount of Hb per cell {{is a function of the}} number of cell divisions since the initiation of Hb synthesis and, to a lesser degree, the stage of the cell cycle. Earlier generations of erythroblasts synthesize Hb at a faster rate than the terminal generation. Several models have been proposed to explain these findings...|$|R

The scientific commons awaits further validation of this method and its efficacy in isolating and amplifying analyzable amounts of DNA. While this method does streamline the process of chromosome isolation, certain parts in the process - such as the initial isolation of a <b>metaphase</b> <b>cell</b> - remain difficult and labour intensive. Other automated techniques for <b>metaphase</b> <b>cell</b> separation would improve throughput. In addition, this method {{is only applicable to}} cells in metaphase, which inherently limits the technique to cell types and tissues that undergo mitosis. Single cell analysis does not account for the possibility of mosaicism; therefore, applications in cancer diagnosis and research would necessarily require processing of multiple cells. Finally, since this entire process is based on amplification from a single cell, the accuracy of any genetic analysis is limited to the ability of commercially available platforms to produce sufficient amounts of unbiased and error free amplicon.|$|E

50|$|Before {{experimental}} samples are imaged, fluorescent reference beads are imaged {{in order to}} ensure the proper set-up of the camera and fluorescent microscope. In addition, these reference beads will be imaged prior to every acquisition session. This will ensure that the differences between samples are not due to errors in the lamp or camera. A <b>metaphase</b> <b>cell</b> is then manually selected and centered for the camera. Two types of images are taken: pictures of the stained chromosomes in their metaphase state and fluorescent images of the telomeres. The two images can then be superimposed to generate a combined image. This image can then be karyotyped or assigned nomenclature. Furthermore, the intra-chromosomal distribution of telomere length in p-arms versus q-arms can be measured.|$|E

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has overcome the hurdles of unavailability of abnormal and/or lack of <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells,</b> and detection of cryptic, submicroscopic rearrangements. In the present study, besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements, deletion variants and unknown RARA translocation variants by application of D-FISH and RARA break-apart probe strategy on interphase and <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> in a large series of 200 cases of APL. Forty cases (20 %) had atypical PML-RARA and/or RARA variants. D-FISH with PML/RARA probe helped identification of RARA insertion to PML. By application of D-FISH on <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells,</b> we documented that translocation of 15 to 17 leads to 17 q deletion which results in loss of reciprocal fusion and/or residual RARA on der(17). Among the complex variants of t(15; 17), PML-RARA fusion followed by residual RARA insertion closed to PML-RARA on der(15) was unique and unusual. FISH with break-apart RARA probe on <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> was found to be a very efficient strategy to detect unknown RARA variant translocations like t(11; 17) (q 23;q 21), t(11; 17) (q 13;q 21) and t(2; 17) (p 21;q 21). These findings proved that D-FISH and break-apart probe strategy has potential to detect primary as well as secondary additional aberrations of PML, RARA and other additional loci. The long-term clinical follow-up is essential to evaluate the clinical importance of these findings...|$|R

The present study presents cytogenetics/cytology of haploidization in the origin of a new, fast growing diploid, small cell-type (F-dPCs). The sequence of events was haploid groupings of the chromosomes in normal, human <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells,</b> followed by genomic doubling to homozygousdiploidy. These events were responses to DNA rep-lication stress fromamino acid glutamine deprivation. Importantly, these homozygous cells outgrew normal fi-broblasts in 2 - 3 passages—they had gained proliferative advantage (GPA), presumably from loss (LOH) of tu-mor suppressor genes. They were morphologically changed cells with rounded nuclei that grew in a “streaming” growth pattern and with changed form and size of mitosis, similar to some hyperplasias. The grouping of the chromosomes in <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> was asymmetric with a narrow range around the median (23) (no micro-nuclei), suggesting genetic control.

50|$|A single <b>metaphase</b> <b>cell</b> is {{isolated}} from solution. The chromosomes are then {{released from the}} nucleus, and the cytoplasm is digested enzymatically. Next, the chromosome suspension is directed towards multiple partitioning channels. The chromosomes are physically directed into the partitioning channels using a series of valves. In the first description of this technique, Fan et al. designed a custom-made program (MatLab) to control this process. Once separated, the chromosomes are prepared for amplification by sequential addition and washout of trypsin, denaturation buffer and neutralization solution. The DNA is then ready for further processing. Because of {{the small amount of}} DNA, amplification needs to be performed using kits specialized for very small initial DNA quantities. The amplified DNA is flushed out of the microfluidic device and solubilized by the addition of a buffer. The amplified DNA can now be analyzed by various methods.|$|E

DNA in <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> denatured at lower temperatures (8 ~ 176 lower) than DNA in interphase cells.

The first peak was observed at seven hours after sunrise (1 : 00 pm) and the second at 19 hours after sunrise (1 : 00 am). In the roots of the seedlings obtained from vine cuttings, the first peak of frequency of <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells</b> appeared at four hours after sunrise (10 : 00 am) in both cultivars and the second peak at 16 hours (10 : 00 pm) in TDa 98 / 01183, but at 13 hours in TDr 95 / 18544 (7 : 00 pm). Based on the results obtained, a cycle of cell division {{is considered}} to exhibit a periodicity of about 12 hours. The present investigation enabled to identify the optimum times for collecting root tip samples from rooted vine cuttings and seed tuber sets. The findings may facilitate cytogenetic studies in yams.

40|$|During {{metaphase}} and anaphase in newt lung cells, tubulin subunits {{within the}} kinetochore microtubule (kMT) lattice flux slowly poleward as kMTs depolymerize at their minus-ends within in the pole. Very {{little is known}} about how and where the force that moves the tubulin subunits poleward is generated and what function it serves during mitosis. We found that treatment with the drug taxol (10 microM) caused separated centrosomes in <b>metaphase</b> newt lung <b>cells</b> to move toward one another with an average velocity of 0. 89 microns/min, until the interpolar distance was reduced by 22 - 62 %. This taxol-induced spindle shortening occurred as kMTs between the chromosomes and the poles shortened. Photoactivation of fluorescent marks on kMTs revealed that taxol inhibited kinetochore microtubule assembly/disassembly at kinetochores, whereas minus-end MT disassembly continued at a rate typical of poleward flux in untreated <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells.</b> This poleward flux was strong enough to stretch the centromeric chromatin between sister kinetochores {{as much as it is}} stretched in control <b>metaphase</b> <b>cells.</b> In anaphase, taxol blocked kMT disassembly/assembly at the kinetochore whereas minus-end disassembly continued at a rate similar to flux in control cells (approximately 0. 2 microns/min). These results reveal that the mechanism for kMT poleward flux 1) is not dependent on kMT plus-end dynamics and 2) produces pulling forces capable of generating tension across the centromeres of bioriented chromosomes...|$|R
