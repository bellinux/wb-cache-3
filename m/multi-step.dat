5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a <b>multi-step</b> {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using <b>multi-step</b> chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Ice growth {{calculations}} {{are generally}} {{limited to a}} single step covering the entire icing exposure, with all relevant parameters taken as constant and calculated on the clean body. For large ice accretions, it can be necessary to recalculate the flow and icing parameters as their value vary when ice accretes. This procedure is known as <b>multi-stepping</b> and appears reasonable under rime and glaze ice type regimes. A manual <b>multi-stepping</b> ice calculation is generally possible. However, an automatic <b>multi-stepping</b> ice prediction {{is often difficult to}} obtain. The present paper describes the automatic <b>multi-stepping</b> procedure implemented in the ice prediction code ICECREMO. Results obtained on a three-dimensional airfoil are discussed and compared with experimental shapes from the literature. Limitations of the code have been identified and are being addressed within the ICECREMO 2 project...|$|R

For the 25 Mpc volume, we show strong scaling on up to 128 K cores of Blue Waters. We also demonstrate scaling up to 128 K cores of a <b>multi-stepping</b> run of the 2 billion particle simulation.

Reference was made to both Brunner's and Aratani's work, however the design of the ligands was also largely based on his earlier work with various macrocycles.

25|$|The {{method of}} {{recombination}} detailed above is advantageous as {{it provides an}} alternative to the low-efficiency, laborious, and <b>multi-step</b> recombination processes using endonucleases and ligases. Therefore, λ-red recombination is more specific in terms of possible genomic alterations that are not governed by locations of restriction enzyme recognition sites. However, it also has many limitations. Multiple rounds of transformations can increase the risk of error and increase recombination time. Therefore, efficiency can be low (0.1–10% for point mutations; 10−5–10−6 for insertions, deletions, or replacements) and requires long growth into workable colonies between transformations and recombinant selections. All together, this contributes to a lengthy and inefficient mutagenesis procedure for even single mutations. This technique can also leave scars that can contribute to destabilization of the chromosome and impact the success of the manipulation.|$|E

25|$|An assay (analysis) {{is never}} an {{isolated}} process {{and must be}} combined with pre- and post-analytic procedures. The information communication (e.g. request to perform an assay and further information processing) or specimen handling (e.g. collection, transport and processing) that are done {{until the beginning of}} an assay are the preanalytic steps. Similarly, after the assay, the result may be documented, verified and transmitted/communicated in steps that are called post-analytic steps. Like any <b>multi-step</b> information handling and transmission systems, variation and errors in the communicated final results of an assay involve corresponding parts in every such step; i.e. not only analytic variations and errors intrinsic to the assay itself but also variations and errors involved in preanalytic and post analytic steps. Since the assay itself (the analytic step) gets much attention, steps that get less attention by the chain of users, i.e. the preanalytic and the post analytic steps, are often less stringently regulated and generally more prone to errors – e.g. preanalytic steps in medical laboratory assays may contribute to 32–75% of all lab errors.|$|E

Different factors were at the origin of the plateau of CrI observed: (i) the hydrolysis rate decreased after consumption of easily accessible amorphous parts, (ii) crystals of the anhydrous polymorph resulting from the reaction hindered the access of reagents to the remaining amorphous parts.
