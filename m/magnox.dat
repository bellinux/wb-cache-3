5|$|By 1983, Kennedy Martin {{had written}} {{the first draft of}} what would {{eventually}} become Edge of Darkness – at this stage it was called <b>Magnox</b> (a reference to the <b>Magnox</b> type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in the nuclear industry. The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development. The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point A {{nuclear power}} station was a <b>Magnox</b> power station {{constructed}} between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) {{which was designed to}} generate 1250MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) reactor known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016.|$|E
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on <b>Magnox</b> and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 the UK's eight most {{advanced}} nuclear plants, seven advanced gas-cooled reactors and one pressurized water reactor, were privatised as British Energy, raising £2.1 billion. The remaining <b>Magnox</b> reactors remained in public ownership as <b>Magnox</b> Electric. On 30 January 1998 <b>Magnox</b> Electric was merged into BNFL as BNFL <b>Magnox</b> Generation.|$|E
25|$|Ownership {{of all of}} the site’s {{assets and}} {{liabilities}} was transferred to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a new regulatory body created as a result of The Energy Act of 2004. The site was then operated under the two-tier Site Management Company/Site License Company (SMC/SLC) model by British Nuclear Group’s Reactor Sites business as SMC and <b>Magnox</b> Electric Ltd as the SLC. In June 2007, EnergySolutions LLC bought the Reactor Sites Management Company Ltd (consisting of two operational divisions, <b>Magnox</b> North and <b>Magnox</b> South) from British Nuclear Group.|$|E
25|$|The AGR was {{developed}} from the <b>Magnox</b> reactor, the UK's first-generation reactor design. The first <b>Magnox</b> reactors had been optimised for generating plutonium, {{and for this reason}} it incorporated a number of features that are not necessarily the best for economic performance. Primary among these requirements was the Magnox's ability to run on natural uranium, which demanded the use of a coolant with a low neutron cross section, in this case CO2, and efficient neutron moderator, graphite. <b>Magnox</b> also ran relatively cool compared to other power-producing designs, which made it less efficient extracting power from the reactor core.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} reprocessing plant {{was built to}} extract the plutonium from spent fuel to provide fissile material for the UK's atomic weapons programme, and for exchange with the United States through the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It operated from 1951 until 1964, with an annual capacity of 300 tonnes (295 L/T) of fuel, or 750 tonnes (738 L/T) of low burn-up fuel. It was first used to reprocess fuel from the Windscale Piles, and was later repurposed to process fuel from UK <b>Magnox</b> reactors, however following the commissioning of the dedicated <b>Magnox</b> Reprocessing Plant, it was itself recycled to become a pre-handling plant to allow oxide fuel to be reprocessed in the <b>Magnox</b> plant, and was closed in 1973.|$|E
25|$|British Energy was {{established}} and registered in Scotland in 1995 {{to operate the}} eight most modern nuclear power plants in the UK. It took the two AGR plants from Scottish Nuclear and five AGR and a sole PWR plant from Nuclear Electric. The residual <b>Magnox</b> power stations from these two companies were transferred to <b>Magnox</b> Electric which later became the generation division of British Nuclear Fuels. The company was privatised in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Chapelcross {{had four}} <b>Magnox</b> {{reactors}} capable of generating 60 MWe of power each. The reactors were {{supplied by the}} UKAEA and the turbines by C.A. Parsons & Company.|$|E
25|$|Highly Active Liquor Evaporation and Storage (HALES) is a {{department}} at Sellafield. It conditions nuclear waste streams from the <b>Magnox</b> and Thorp reprocessing plants, prior {{to transfer to}} the Waste Vitrification Plant.|$|E
25|$|Chapelcross was a <b>Magnox</b> {{nuclear power}} plant located near Annan in Dumfries and Galloway in south west Scotland. It was the sister plant to the Calder Hall plant in Cumbria, England - both were {{commissioned}} and originally operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.|$|E
25|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), {{formed in}} April 2005 under the Energy Act 2004, oversees and manages the {{decommissioning}} and clean-up of the UK's older <b>Magnox</b> {{power plants and}} the reprocessing facilities at Sellafield, which were transferred to its ownership from BNFL, and the former nuclear research and development facilities previously run by the UKAEA.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{reactors}} {{need to be}} {{shut down}} for refueling; for example, pebble bed reactors, RBMK reactors, molten salt reactors, <b>Magnox,</b> AGR and CANDU reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnox</b> fuel {{incorporated}} {{cooling fins}} to provide maximum heat transfer despite low operating temperatures, making it expensive to produce. While {{the use of}} uranium metal rather than oxide made reprocessing more straightforward and therefore cheaper, the need to reprocess fuel a short time after removal from the reactor meant that the fission product hazard was severe. Expensive remote handling facilities were required to address this danger.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>Magnox</b> {{reactors}} (50MWe and 200MWe), {{under construction}} at Yongbyon and Taechon. If completed, 50MWe reactor would {{be capable of}} producing 60kg of plutonium per year, enough for approximately 10 weapons and 200MWe reactor 220kg of plutonium annually, enough for approximately 40 weapons. Construction was halted in 1994 about a year from completion in accord with the Agreed Framework, and by 2004 the structures and pipework had deteriorated badly.|$|E
25|$|Both {{stations}} were originally built, owned, {{and operated by}} the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). Following privatisation of the electricity supply industry and the later part-privatisation of the nuclear power generating industry they are now owned by two different bodies: the original <b>Magnox</b> plant Dungeness A by the non-departmental government body the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and newer AGR Dungeness B by EDF through British subsidiary EDF Energy.|$|E
25|$|Cladding is {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} fuel rods, {{standing}} between the coolant and the nuclear fuel. It is made of a corrosion-resistant material with low absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, usually Zircaloy or steel in modern constructions, or magnesium with small amount of aluminium and other metals for the now-obsolete <b>Magnox</b> reactors. Cladding prevents radioactive fission fragments from escaping the fuel into the coolant and contaminating it.|$|E
25|$|Britain's {{fleet of}} {{operational}} reactors consists of 14 advanced gas-cooled reactors on six discrete sites, {{along with two}} <b>Magnox</b> units at Wylfa, and one PWR unit at Sizewell B. Overall, the installed nuclear capacity in the United Kingdom is between 10 and 11 GW. In addition, the UK experimented with Fast Breeder reactor technologies at Dounreay in Scotland, however the last fast breeder (with 250MWe of capacity) was shut down in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Dungeness A is {{a legacy}} <b>Magnox</b> power station that was {{connected}} to the National Grid in 1965 and has reached the end of its life. It possessed two nuclear reactors producing 219 MW of electricity each, with a total capacity of 438 MW. The construction was undertaken by a consortium known as the Nuclear Power Group ('TNPG'). The reactors were supplied by TNPG and the turbines by C. A. Parsons & Co.|$|E
25|$|The south part of {{the site}} {{consists}} of a modular administration building, four reactor buildings, turbine hall, maintenance workshops, stores, fuel element cooling pond building, tritium processing plant (CXPP) and new flask handling facility (FHB). The {{part of the}} site referred to as north site consists of legacy buildings including aircraft hangars, a graphite handling laboratory and a large building that originally housed some 10,000 drums of yellow <b>Magnox</b> Depleted Uranium (MDU) trioxide arising from reprocessing at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|Fuel in {{a single}} channel in Reactor 2 that was loaded with fuel {{elements}} under evaluation for the commercial reactor programme experienced a partial blockage, attributed {{to the presence of}} graphite debris (see fuel element failure). The fuel overheated and the <b>Magnox</b> cladding failed, causing contamination to be deposited in one region of the core. The reactor was restarted in 1969 after successful clean-out operations and was the final reactor to cease operation in February 2004.|$|E
25|$|The Windscale Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (WAGR) was a {{prototype}} for the UK's {{second generation of}} reactors, the advanced gas-cooled reactor or AGR, which followed on from the <b>Magnox</b> stations. The WAGR golfball is, along with the pile chimneys, one of the iconic buildings on the Windscale site (Windscale being an independent site within the Sellafield complex). Construction {{was carried out by}} Mitchell Construction and completed in 1962. This reactor was shut down in 1981, and is now part of a pilot project to demonstrate techniques for safely decommissioning a nuclear reactor.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} nuclear energy {{economics}} in the UK is complex. The first <b>Magnox</b> reactors were not built for purely commercial purposes, and later reactors faced delays which inflated costs (culminating in Sizewell B taking seven years from start of construction to entering service, after a lengthy public inquiry). Costs have also been complicated {{by the lack of}} national strategy or policy for spent nuclear fuel, so that a mixed use of reprocessing and short-term storage have been employed, with little regard for long-term considerations (although a national repository has been proposed).|$|E
25|$|These are {{generally}} graphite moderated and CO2 cooled. They {{can have a}} high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There {{are a number of}} operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. <b>Magnox</b> stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGCRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.|$|E
25|$|During routine {{defuelling}} {{activities on}} Reactor 3, a basket containing twenty-four low rated irradiated <b>Magnox</b> fuel elements fell {{a few feet}} within the discharge machine onto {{the door at the}} top of the fuel discharge well. Remote TV camera inspections revealed that twelve of the elements had fallen just over 80ft (24.4m) down the discharge well into a water filled transport flask at the bottom. The NII initiated an investigation because dropping irradiated fuel elements is a serious issue even when, as in this event, BNFL had advised NII that there had been no release of radiological activity.|$|E
25|$|A {{small amount}} of <b>Magnox</b> Depleted Uranium leaked from some {{corroded}} mild steel drums due to rainwater ingress and leaching. MDU is a dense yellow powder that is less radiologically toxic than naturally occurring uranium but chemotoxic {{in a similar manner}} to lead. Owing to its high density and low solubility, it does not tend to disperse far and dry spills are easy to clean up. This material was stored at the larger sites, including Capenhurst in mild steel drums. BNFL has upgraded the fabric of the building and the original drums are being overpacked into stainless steel drums and dispatched to Capenhurst for long-term storage.|$|E
25|$|The AGR was {{intended}} to be a superior British alternative to American light water reactor designs. It was promoted as a development of the operationally (if not economically) successful <b>Magnox</b> design, and was chosen from a multitude of competing British alternatives - the helium cooled High Temperature Reactor, the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor and the Fast Breeder Reactor - as well as the American light water pressurised and boiling water reactors (PWR and BWR) and Canadian CANDU designs. The CEGB conducted a detailed economic appraisal of the competing designs and concluded that the AGR proposed for Dungeness B would generate the cheapest electricity, cheaper than any of the rival designs and the best coal-fired stations.|$|E
25|$|Hinkley Point A {{nuclear power}} station was a <b>Magnox</b> power station {{constructed}} between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) {{which was designed to}} generate 1250MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) reactor known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016. In 1989 the Berkeley {{nuclear power station}} was the first in the UK to be decommissioned. The steam-generating heavy water reactor was developed at Winfrith in Dorset.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF), Risley, was the site chosen for the design offices and {{headquarters}} of the Department of ATomic ENergy (DATEN) after the Second World War. Later to become the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), the offices were charged with the manufacture of the Nuclear Reactors and process plants at Windscale to help build the UKs atomic defence. Following on from the weapons program, the Risley offices were responsible for the building of the <b>Magnox</b> and AGR designs of reactor in the UK. In 1971 BNFL was set up from the production division of the (UKAEA), and until 2003 its headquarters were at Risley, near Warrington. BNFLs headquarters are now at Daresbury Park industrial estate, also near to Warrington.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the AGR was such that the final steam {{conditions}} at the boiler stop valve were identical to that of conventional coal-fired power stations, thus the same design of turbo-generator plant could be used. The mean temperature of the hot coolant leaving the reactor core {{was designed to be}} 648°C. In order to obtain these high temperatures, yet ensure useful graphite core life (graphite oxidises readily in CO2 at high temperature) a re-entrant flow of coolant at the lower boiler outlet temperature of 278°C is utilised to cool the graphite, ensuring that the graphite core temperatures do not vary too much from those seen in a <b>Magnox</b> station. The superheater outlet temperature and pressure were designed to be 2,485psi (170 bar) and 543°C.|$|E
25|$|Calder Hall was the world's first {{nuclear power}} station in 1956. There are {{approximately}} 430 {{nuclear power station}}s around the world, and the UK is the third most experienced operator of nuclear reactors after the USA and France, and is the world's ninth largest producer of nuclear-generated electricity, with nine stations operating in the UK producing around 10GW. New-build nuclear power stations will either be the AP1000 (Toshiba Westinghouse NuGeneration) or EPR design (developed by Areva). BNFL bought Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Company in 1999; it was sold in October 2006 for £5.4bn to Toshiba. British Energy was sold in 2009 for £12.5bn to EDF; Centrica (British Gas) had also wanted to buy it; 26 <b>Magnox</b> reactors {{were built in the}} UK, followed by 14 AGR reactors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 2000s, {{concerns}} grew over the prospect of an 'energy gap' in United Kingdom generating capacity. This was forecast to arise because it was expected that a number of coal fired power stations would close due to being unable to meet the clean air requirements of the European Large Combustion Plant Directive (directive 2001/80/EC). In addition, the United Kingdom's remaining <b>Magnox</b> nuclear stations were to have closed by 2015. The oldest AGR nuclear power station has had its life extended by ten years, and it was likely many of the others could be life-extended, reducing the potential gap suggested by the current accounting closure dates of between 2014 and 2023 for the AGR power stations.|$|E
25|$|A newer {{nuclear reactor}} with a {{capacity}} of 5MWe. This gas-graphite moderated <b>Magnox</b> type reactor is North Korea's main reactor, where practically all of its plutonium has been produced. A full core consists of 8,000 fuel rods and can yield a maximum of 27–29kg of plutonium if left in the reactor for optimal burnup. The North Korean Plutonium Stock, Mid-2006, {{is estimated to be}} able to produce 0.9 grams of plutonium per thermal megawatt every day of its operation. The material required to make a single bomb is approximately four to eight kilograms. Often, North Korea has unloaded the reactor before reaching the maximum burnup level. There are three known cores which were unloaded in 1994 (under IAEA supervision in accordance with the Agreed Framework), 2005, and 2007.|$|E
25|$|With the {{creation}} of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four <b>Magnox</b> reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, adjacent to Windscale and across the River Calder, and the site became Windscale and Calder Works. Following the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a production division, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) in 1971, the major part of the site was transferred to BNFL. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site – up to that time there was a General Manager of Windscale Works and a General Manager of Calder Works, but afterwards there was one Head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site – as well as to possibly attempt to disassociate the site from press reports about its safety. The remainder of the site remained {{in the hands of the}} UKAEA and was still called Windscale.|$|E
25|$|The CEGB {{took over}} project management, imposed light {{penalties}} {{in order not}} to cripple Fairey and International Combustion, and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. In 1971, problems with corrosion of mild steel components in the first generation <b>Magnox</b> reactors gave the designers cause for concern. The Dungeness B restraint couplings - mechanical linkages that held the graphite core in place whilst allowing it to expand and contract in response to temperature changes - were made of mild steel and could be subject to the same corrosion. It was decided to replace them with components made from a new material. In 1972, problems were found with the galvanised wire that was used to attach thermocouples to stainless steel boiler tubes. During heat treatment of the tubes at temperatures up to 1,050°C, the galvanising zinc diffused into the tubes and made them brittle. The cost had by then risen to £170million. By 1975, the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and that its cost had risen to £280 million. By 1979 the cost had risen further to £410 million. Reactor 1 first generated power on 3 April 1983, some 13 years behind schedule and at a cost of £685 million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v <b>Magnox</b> Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E
