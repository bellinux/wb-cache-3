50|$|A power {{tower is}} a type of {{mechanical}} <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> (or pto) which resides on an auxiliary transmission. It is mounted to the top of an auxiliary transmission (also known as a brownie or joey box) and its vertical housing has earned it the name power tower. Unlike traditional transmission or engine mounted <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> the <b>power</b> tower can provide the engine's full rated power output. It is commonly used to drive large winches or hydraulic pumps. Unlike the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> of an agricultural tractor, the attachment of any device to the power tower is usually permanent.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To ensure maximum {{production}} of electric power by photovoltaic vacilities, {{in addition to}} using highly efficient photovoltaic modules equipped with solar radiation concentrators must use a highly effective <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system. This paper is inscribed to solving the problem of a highly efficient and economic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system development. Methodology. To solving the problem, we implemented three stages. On the first stage examines the dependence of electrical power from {{the intensity of the}} incident solar radiation. Based on this, the second stage is calculated the DC-DC converter resonant circuit and its working parameters, and developed circuit diagram of DC-DC converter. On the third stage, we carry out an analysis of <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system with step up DC-DC converter working. Results. In this paper, we carry out the analysis of working efficiency for photovoltaic facility <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system with step-up boost converter. The result of such analysis show that the efficiency of such system {{in a wide range of}} photovoltaic energy module illumination power is at 0. 92, whereas the efficiency of classic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> systems does not exceed 0. 70. Achieved results allow designing a circuit scheme of a controlled bridge resonant step-up converter with digital control. Proposed scheme will ensure reliable operation, fast and accurate location point of maximum power and conversion efficiency up to 0. 96. Originality. Novelty of proposed <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system solution constitute in implementation of circuit with DC-DC converters, which as it shown by results of carrying out modeling is the most effective. Practical value. Practical implementation of proposed <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system design will allow reducing losses in connective wires and increasing the efficiency of such a system up to 92. 5 % in wide range of photovoltaic energy modules illumination...|$|R

40|$|The {{optimisation}} of a {{wave energy}} converter hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> for sea states of varying wave amplitude, direction and frequency is a significant problem. Sub-optimal configuration can result in very inefficient energy conversion, so understanding the design trade-offs {{is key to the}} success of the technology. This work focuses on a generic point absorber type wave energy converter. Previous work by the authors has considered the optimisation of this device for regular waves to gain an understanding of the fundamental issues. This work extends the analysis to the more realistic case of irregular waves. Simulations are performed using an irregular wave input to predict how the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> will operate in real sea conditions. Work is also presented on a motor speed control strategy to maintain the maximum flow of electrical power to the grid, assuming the use of a doubly fed induction generator. Finally, the sizing of key components in the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> is considered in an attempt to maximise <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> efficiency and generated power...|$|R

A set of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system, which suits for the floating wave energy devices, includes hydraulic system and power generation system.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} at author's request, from January 11, 2017 - January 11, 2019 Recently, {{there has}} been peaked interest in developing high energy producing and optimized <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> topologies for Wave Energy Converters (WEC). As large as {{the potential of the}} oceans may seem, harnessing that energy and effectively converting it to electricity in significant amounts is a challenge. Currently, there are no single devices that satisfy this sufficiently. In this thesis we compare two promising <b>Power</b> <b>Take-Off</b> (PTO) units; the Dual-Stator Spoke Array Vernier Permanent Magnet machine (DSSA VPM) and the Direct Drive Hydraulic <b>Power</b> <b>Take-Off</b> (DDHPTO). A steady state and transient analysis is done to compare the efficiencies of the two machines.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model that will integrate multiple buoys to a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> hub. The model will be derived using a time domain analysis and will consider the hydraulic coupling of the buoys and the <b>power</b> <b>take-off.</b> The derived model is reproduced in MATLAB in order to run simulations. This will give possibility to conduct a parameter study and evaluate the performance of the system. The buoy simulation model is provided by Wave 4 Power (W 4 P). It consists of a floater that is rigidly connected to a fully submerged vertical (acceleration) tube open at both ends. The tube contains a piston whose motion relative to the floater-tube system drives a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> mechanism. The <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> model is provided by Ocean Harvesting Technologies AB (OHT). It comprises a mechanical gearbox and a gravity accumulator. The system is utilized to transform the irregular wave energy into a smooth electrical power output. OHT's simulation model needs to be extended with a hydraulic motor at the input shaft. There are control features in both systems, that need to be connected and synchronized with each other. Another major goal within the thesis is to test different online control techniques. A simple control strategy to optimize power capture is called sea-state tuning and it can be achieved by using a mechanical gearbox with several discrete gear ratios or with a variable displacement pump. The gear ratio of the gear box can be regulated according to a 2 D look up table based on the average wave amplitude and frequency over a defined time frame. The OHT <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> utilizes a control strategy, called spill function, to limit the excess power capture and keep the weight accumulator within a span by disengaging the input shaft from the <b>power</b> <b>take-off.</b> This is to be modified to implement power limitation with regulation of the gear ratio of the gearbox. + 4673629078...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the total power {{converted}} by a wave energy farm is influenced by the hydrodynamic interactions between wave energy converters, especially when they are close to each other. Therefore, to improve the performance of a wave energy farm, the hydrodynamic interaction between converters must be considered, which can be influenced by the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> damping of individual converters. In this paper, the performance of arrays of wave energy converters under optimal hydrodynamic interaction and <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> damping is investigated. This is achieved by coordinating the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> damping of individual converters, resulting in optimal hydrodynamic interaction as well as higher production of time-averaged power converted by the farm. Physical constraints on motion amplitudes are considered in the solution, which is required for the practical implementation of wave energy converters. Results indicate that the natural frequency of a wave energy converter under optimal damping will not vary with sea states, but the production performance of a wave energy farm can be improved significantly while satisfying the motion constraints.
