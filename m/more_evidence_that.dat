5|$|The {{historian}} Robinson M. Yost {{explains that}} Darwinism went into eclipse during the 1890s. At that time, most zoologists felt that natural selection {{could not be}} {{the main cause of}} biological adaptation, and sought alternative explanations. As a result, many zoologists rejected both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry. Beddard, writes Yost, explained some problems in the theory of mimicry including that, given how many insect species there are, resemblances between species could arise by chance, and that mimicry was sometimes either useless or actually harmful. In Yost's view, Beddard wanted <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> natural selection really was responsible. Yost cites the staunch Darwinist Poulton's hostile review of 1892, which asserts the pre-eminence of Darwin's theory. But, writes Yost, Beddard was not alone in being wary of natural selection.|$|E

The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be very hard for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey Dean has {{suggested}} that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.|$|E

He later clarified his comments by stating that they [...] "were fuelled from frustration and aimed at motivating other members of the group to commit to a proper touring schedule", and pointed out that if the band was unable to tour regularly then he would seek another band which could.

500|$|In 1978, a US Geological Survey {{research}} ship collected dredge samples and photographed Lōʻihi's summit {{with the goal}} of studying whether Lōʻihi is active. Analysis of the photos and testing of pillow lava rock samples appeared to show that the material was [...] "fresh", yielding <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Lōʻihi is still active. An expedition from October 1980 to January 1981 collected further dredge samples and photographs, providing additional confirmation. Studies indicated that the eruptions came from {{the southern part of the}} rift crater. This area is closest to the Hawaiʻi hotspot, which supplies Lōʻihi with magma. Following a 1986 seismic event, a network of five ocean bottom observatories (OBOs) were deployed on Lōʻihi for a month. Lōʻihi's frequent seismicity makes it an ideal candidate for seismic study through OBOs. In 1987, the submersible DSV Alvin was used to survey Lōʻihi.|$|E

Sandra Gonzalez particularly praised the [...] "murinal" [...] jokes about Jerry's mural, as well as Ron's claim that he ran a sheet metal factory when he was nine, and that [...] "Child labor laws are ruining this country."

Appel found that the scene [...] "wrote itself", as every other man in Springfield is essentially a loser compared to Apu. The scene acted as the episode's opening set piece, a concept that Scully liked to use in every episode. The montage of Apu getting several different hair styles originally included three more, but they ended up being cut for time. The shot in which Apu's mother falls to the ground, a joke that the staff love, was inspired by an incident when Moore saw a man fall {{in much the same}} way. The joke was only inserted to buy Apu and Homer more time {{to come up with a}} lie. Homer writing [...] "Where are the sticky buns" [...] on a sheet of paper after Apu asks him for advice is one of Mike Scully's favorite jokes. Before the wedding, Bart fuels a [...] "sacred fire" [...] with pages from a hymn book.

500|$|In later seasons, it is {{revealed}} {{that he is a}} member of a group known as the Syndicate, a shadowy organization within the United States government. The episode [...] "Two Fathers" [...] reveals his birthname or alias as C.G.B. Spender, and that he was formerly married to Cassandra Spender, with whom he had a son, Jeffrey Spender. He recruits FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley to be a subordinate of his because she has a close relationship with Mulder. In [...] "One Son", Jeffrey finds out that his father, the Smoking Man, forced his mother Cassandra to undergo medical treatments that led to several nervous breakdowns during his childhood years. When the Smoking Man finds out, he seemingly kills Jeffrey. Knowing of the colonization plan, the Alien rebels return to Earth to try to persuade the Syndicate to join their side against their war with the Colonists. Not believing in the strength of the Alien rebels, the Syndicate members meet at El Rico Air Base to be transported to a spaceship to survive the colonization. However, the rebels appear instead of the Colonists and kill all remaining chief members of the Syndicate. Together with Fowley, the Smoking Man escapes the destruction of the Syndicate. Later in the sixth season, there is <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> suggested that the Smoking Man is Mulder's biological father. Eventually in [...] "", Fowley comes in disagreement with him. Because of his plans to kill Mulder, Fowley helps Scully in her investigation to locate Mulder, which leads to her death. After the destruction of the Syndicate, the Smoking Man starts to operate as he wishes. However, his cancer resurfaces, and he begins using a wheelchair and has a tracheotomy.

Chemical analysis of the paper showed that it contained a chemically constituted wood pulp, a process that was not used in England before 1874.In addition the typeface in minor respects indicated a late 19th Century use and via some sterling detective work Carter and Pollard traced the publishing source to Richard Clay and Sons.

2500|$|The series {{opens with}} the Freemans {{settling}} into the fictional, peaceful, and mostly white suburb of Woodcrest. Evidence for the real-world {{location of the}} fictional Woodcrest is mixed. Proponents of the Chicago's South Side theory cite the real-life suburb of Crestwood, Illinois and the similarity of the two names. The first season features several Chicago Landmarks: a skyline shot showing the Willis Tower, Grant Park, buildings of the Michigan Avenue Historic District, and Lake Michigan; as well as elevated rapid transit endemic to the city, resembling the Chicago [...] "L". More conclusive evidence is presented in [...] "The Trial of Robert Kelly", in which Riley asks Grandad, [...] "Can you take us into the City tomorrow to watch the R. Kelly Trial?". Grandad denies his request and tells him to walk, and Riley replies [...] "But it's 40 miles!" [...] In reality, R.

Another conclusive reference to Chicago is Martin Luther King Drive, a major street running through South Chicago, being referenced for its violent activity in the 9th episode of season 1, [...] "Return of the King".

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{some aspects of}} the play are unique to Holinshed rather than Hall.

In Holinshed, the Admiral is referred to as [...] "Lord Bourbon", as he is in the play (and as he was in reality), whereas in Hall the Admiral is erroneously called [...] "Lord Burgundy". Another aspect of the play found only in Holinshed is Edward's offer of peace to Warwick prior to the Battle of Barnet; [...] "Now Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,/Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee?/Call Edward king, and at his hands beg mercy,/And he shall pardon thee these outrages" [...] (5.1.21–24).
