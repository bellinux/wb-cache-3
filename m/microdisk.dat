40|$|The fabrication, {{characterization}} {{and application}} of the plane-recessed <b>microdisk</b> array electrodes for selective detection are demonstrated. The electrodes, fabricated by lithographic microfabrication technology, are composed of a planar film electrode and a 32 x 32 recessed <b>microdisk</b> array electrode. Different from commonly used redox cycling operating mode for array configurations such as interdigitated array electrodes, a novel strategy based {{on a combination of}} interferent depleting and redox cycling is proposed for the electrodes with an appropriate configuration. The planar film electrode (the plane electrode) is used to deplete the interferent in the diffusion layer. The recessed <b>microdisk</b> array electrode (the <b>microdisk</b> array), locating within the diffusion layer of the plane electrode, works for detecting the target analyte in the interferent-depleted diffusion layer. In addition, the <b>microdisk</b> array overcomes the disadvantage of low current signal for a single microelectrode. Moreover, the current signal of the target analyte that undergoes reversible electron transfer can be enhanced due to the redox cycling between the plane electrode and the <b>microdisk</b> array. Based on the above working principle, the plane-recessed <b>microdisk</b> array electrodes break up the restriction of selectively detecting a species that exhibits reversible reaction in a mixture with one that exhibits an irreversible reaction, which is a limitation of single redox cycling operating mode. The advantages of the plane-recessed <b>microdisk</b> array electrodes are verified by detecting dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid and detecting pyrocatechol in the presence of hydroquinone, i. e., the electrodes can work regardless of the reversibility of interfering species.
