5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{basic income}} (or {{negative}} income tax) {{is a system}} of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as {{there would be no}} risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{editions of}} a book as popular and {{enduring}} as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit inevitably attract the attention and money of both book collectors and fans. Because a publisher cannot predict accurately how the public will receive a new author, they usually print a small first run and follow it with reprints as needed. Often this first run is called a [...] "first edition". Technically, however, the first edition spans not only the first printing but all printings until the type is reset. In the collectibles market, normally {{it is the first}} printing that commands the bulk of attention and <b>money.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> because it was printed in small quantity and under risk of failure in the market. The people who bought the first copies pioneered the book's popularity, and those copies are considered precious.

2500|$|A {{guaranteed}} minimum income {{ensures that}} every citizen {{will be able to}} purchase a desired level of basic needs. A basic income (or negative income tax) is a system of social security, that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sufficient to live on. Studies of large cash-transfer programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi show that the programs can be effective in increasing consumption, schooling, and nutrition, whether they are tied to such conditions or not. Proponents argue that a basic income is more economically efficient than a minimum wage and unemployment benefits, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing losses in efficiency. In 1968, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce a system of income guarantees. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, with often diverse political convictions, who support a basic income include Herbert A. Simon, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Solow, Milton Friedman, Jan Tinbergen, James Tobin ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{authors have}} used the terms organ gifting and [...] "tissue gifting" [...] to {{describe}} processes behind organ and tissue transfers that are not captured by more traditional terms such as donation and transplantation. [...] The concept of [...] "gift of life" [...] in the U.S. refers {{to the fact that}} [...] "transplantable organs must be given willingly, unselfishly, and anonymously, and any <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> exchanged is to be perceived as solely for operational costs, but never for the organs themselves". [...] "Organ gifting" [...] is proposed to contrast with organ commodification. The maintenance of a spirit of altruism in this context has been interpreted by some as a mechanism through which the economic relations behind organ/tissue production, distribution, and consumption can be disguised. [...] Organ/tissue gifting differs from commodification in the sense that anonymity and social trust are emphasized to reduce the offer and request of monetary compensation. [...] It is reasoned that the implementation of the gift-giving analogy to organ transactions shows greater respect for the diseased body, honors the donor, and transforms the transaction into a morally acceptable and desirable act that is borne out of voluntarism and altruism.|$|E

As with Mama's Boy, the film received a limited release only, resulting in a gross of US$1.8million worldwide. Critical reaction to the film was generally unfavorable, and once again Keaton was dismissed for her role choices, with Sandra Hall of the New York Post writing, [...] "Diane's career is dyin' [...] this time, sadly, she's gone too far. She's turned herself into a mother-in-law joke." [...] Also in 2008, Keaton appeared alongside Katie Holmes and Queen Latifah in the crime-comedy film Mad Money, directed by Callie Khouri. Based on the British television drama Hot Money (2001), the film revolves around three female employees of the Federal Reserve who scheme to steal <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> about to be destroyed. As with Keaton's previous projects, the film bombed at the box offices with a gross total of US$26.4million, and was universally panned by critics, ranking third in the New York Post Top 10 Worst Movies of 2008 overview.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{possibility}} of having a [...] "retirement" [...] became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly {{should not have to}} work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintain an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public social security created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s. Unions usually bargained to have employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by collective agreement became known as [...] "Taft-Hartley plans" [...] after the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 required joint management of funds by employees and employers. Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called TIAA, was established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918 with express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. These could be collective and defined benefit schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual [...] "401(k)" [...] plans. These are named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same tax deferral rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a [...] "defined benefit" [...] plan, a 401(k) only contains whatever the employer and employee contribute. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have to rely only on minimum social security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 §902 codified a model for employers to automatically enroll their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out. There is no right to an occupational pension, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other [...] "employee benefit" [...] plan.|$|E
2500|$|He noted {{further that}} Hamas had removed {{significant}} sections of their constitution {{which called for}} Israel's destruction, though the basic idea remains the same: Israel cannot be allowed to remain as a Jewish state in the Middle East. [...] "In the past," [...] he said, [...] "it was said that we don't understand politics, only force, but we are a broad, well-grounded movement that is active {{in all areas of}} life. Now we are proving that we also understand politics better than the others." [...] Abu Tir's final thought on Israeli negotiation was to leave it to the new parliament [...] "as with every matter, to be discussed and decided upon in a rational manner". After Hamas's landslide victory in January 2006 many countries decided to back Israel's decision to cut foreign aid to The Palestinian Authority. After being asked what Hamas planned to do in light of this Abu Tir stated that Hamas [...] "would not go to foreign donors on [...] bended knee". In a 6 February 2006 open letter to Newsweek International Tir stated that [...] "The European Union and America should cooperate with us. We have ways of creating understanding among our people. We are facilitators, helpers, aides. The presence of Hamas is a guarantee of safety and stability in the region. Any <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> given to us will be channelled to the correct path." [...] As he tried to address Western fears that donations would go to buy arms Tir told the West to [...] "... be afraid...we can always find arms on the black market. It is obvious that we have built our military infrastructure in that way. Our weapons are the only guarantee of our existence. If a proper Palestinian state were established, then all the militias would melt inside the Palestinian Army." [...] Summing up his letter Tir attempted to ease western anxiety about Hamas by stating that [...] "The West has nothing to fear from Hamas. We're not going to force people to do anything. We will not impose Sharia. Hamas is contained. Hamas deals only with the Israeli occupation. We are not Al Qaeda." ...|$|E

2500|$|GPO policy {{proposes a}} concept known as green tax shifting, which it classifies under {{the broad context}} of {{ecological}} fiscal reform. In general, the party proposes gradual but significant reductions in all income and corporate taxes (or taxes on so-called [...] "earned income"), funded {{by the introduction of}} new resource-based taxes applied at the point of entry into the economy (for example, carbon taxes). The Green Party also proposes introduction of a system of land value taxation, which would replace the current value assessment-based property tax system and would be meant to discourage urban sprawl and increase land use efficiency. Central to the GPO's tax policies is the concept of revenue neutrality, in which any new taxes (i.e., those on resources and consumption) are complemented by a reduction in other forms of taxation (generally income and corporate taxes). This mixture of libertarian and free-market income tax policies with a shift towards consumption/resource taxation is one of the clear differences between the Ontario Greens and the three main provincial parties. For example, while the NDP {{and to a lesser extent}} the Liberals aim to create social equity through progressive taxation of already-earned income, and the Conservatives do not necessarily view social equity to be the role of government, the Greens prefer allowing individuals/businesses to contribute by paying more for what they use (resources, energy) and the pollution/side-effects that they create. The GPO claims that this system is more fair and more economically desirable, because it only punishes individuals and businesses who operate without regard for society and the environment, while accentuating the ability of truly efficient and responsible businesses to prosper without hindrance. Critics of these policies, however, oppose these taxation methods because they view them as examples of regressive taxation (rather than progressive taxation)due to the fact that they would have a bigger economic impact that would be felt in the everyday lives of lower-income groups. They point out that since these policies don't take into account the person's income/ability to pay, they would naturally create greater economic hardship the lower down the income ladder one is (as in any amount of <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> set to a flat rate would represent a greater portion of one's income the less money they make, hence placing the tax burden on the shoulders of the poorest in society because although everyone would be paying the same amount, [...] "x" [...] amount of dollars is far more significant to a lower-income person than a higher-income person).|$|E
