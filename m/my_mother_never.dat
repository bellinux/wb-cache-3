We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E

60|$|ARETHUSA. I understand--I can see; you brood on trifles, misunderstandings, unkindnesses {{you think}} them; though <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> knew of them, or never {{gave them a}} second thought. It is natural when death has come between.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! you laryer devil," [...] he said, {{alluding}} to Mr. Quest. [...] "If I don't make Boisingham, yes, and all England, {{too hot to}} hold you, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> christened me and my name ain't George. I'll give you what for, my cuckoo, that I will!" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was half}} an hour or more before she came down, and at once we left the house, letting {{ourselves}} out. All the way home <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> once spoke, but walked as one in a dream with eyes that saw not. With her hand upon the lock of our gate she came back to life.|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{burst out}} proudly: [...] "Neither towers nor swords shall make me cowardly enough {{to deny the}} right I hold from my father and from God. He was your elder brother, now before the Saviour of men. England, Touraine, Anjou, Guienne, are mine in his right, and Brittany through <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Never</b> will I renounce them, but by death." ...|$|E

"Besides all, {{he had an}} overseer,--great, tall, slab-sided, two-fisted renegade son of Vermont--(begging your pardon),--who {{had gone}} through a regular {{apprenticeship}} in hardness and brutality and taken his degree {{to be admitted to}} practice. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> could endure him, nor I; but he obtained an entire ascendency over my father; and this man was the absolute despot of the estate.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, you said," [...] I began again, [...] "that {{they have}} a God, {{and that they are}} so simple He hasn't a name. What did you mean by that? There can't be one God for the common-sized, and one for--for me; now, can there? <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> taught me that; and I have thought for myself." [...] Indeed I had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, ma'am," [...] said she, [...] "but I'm awful fearful about it. Davy may {{say what he}} pleases, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> will let me marry him if the vicar's agen it; and Davy wouldn't have been here to-day if she hadn't gone to town; and the vicar's a hard man and a strong Tory, and he'll always be agen it, I fear." ...|$|E

'Ay! <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> blamed either, and I'm afraid, if {{the truth}} were told, my father was hot enough too, though it would all have been bygones with him long ago, {{if they would have}} let it.

60|$|That night <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> slept, but sat {{all through}} {{it in her}} nursing chair, {{brooding}} over I know not what. As I left her when I went to my bed, so I found her when I came from it at dawn. I can remember well pushing the door ajar to see her face glimmering white in the twilight of the May morning, as she sat, her large eyes fixed upon the lattice.|$|E
6000|$|She {{put down}} her aunt's card on the table near her, while Mela gurgled, {{as if it were}} the best joke: [...] "Oh, <b>my!</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>never</b> goes anywhere; you couldn't get her out for love or money." [...] But she was herself {{overwhelmed}} with a simple joy at Margaret's politeness, and showed it in a sensuous way, like a child, as if she had been tickled. She came closer to Margaret and seemed about to fawn physically upon her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why--let {{me think}} it over. Oh, I would like to. I've {{always wanted to}} do just that--think of it, the Palisades just opposite, and I never see them except for a walk of half a mile or so when I stay with a friend of mine, Laura Needham, at Winklehurst, up on the Palisades. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> {{approved}} of a wilder wilderness than Central Park and the habit----I've never been able to get Olive to explore. But it isn't conventional to go on long tramps with even the nicest new Johnnies, is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got him!" [...] muttered the boy. He {{continued}} to himself, looking after the shadowy form: [...] "Good-by--good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you called <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> a--well, <b>never</b> mind what; it's all right, now; you're taking your last walk, friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|He pushed on. [...] "I did not, and, furthermore, Altair {{never came}} till you sat with <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> She <b>never</b> {{attained}} such power--so your aunt agrees--till I {{came into the}} circle. She represented my conception of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and you. I loved <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and I admired you--and out of my love and admiration Altair was created." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> could {{endure the}} name of M. Darpent, {{because she did not}} like my brother's {{friendship}} with any one not noble, but she was as glad to see him then {{as if he had been}} a Montmorency or a Coucy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} he is--he is the most {{extraordinary}} person I have ever known. Just {{to talk to him}} gives one such a queer feeling of--of dissatisfaction with one's self, and seeing him once more seems to have half revived in me a whole series of dead memories. And I have been trying to think, but it is all so tantalizing. There is some mystery about him," [...] she insisted. [...] "He disappeared suddenly, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> mentioned him but once afterward, but other persons have spoken of him since--I forget who. He was so well known, and he used to go to St. John's." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{few days}} ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham. As <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>never</b> goes out she {{entrusted}} me {{to the care of}} Lady Greville who did me the honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to sit forwards, which is a favour about which I am very indifferent especially as I know it is considered as confering a great obligation on me [...] "So Miss Maria (said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing {{to the door of the}} Carriage) you seem very smart to night--MY poor Girls will appear quite to disadvantage by YOU--I only hope your Mother may not have distressed herself to set YOU off. Have you got a new Gown on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{my father}} died, Vernon {{took charge of}} the ranch, at my mother's request--I was rather young and she meant to launch me in some profession. Vernon had no ambition--he loved the bush--and he tried to give me enough to finish my {{education}} while he ran both ranches with a hired man. I think <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> suspected that he handed her over more than she was entitled to, but I found it out and I've been glad ever since that I firmly prevented his continuing the sacrifice. For all that, I owe him in many ways more than I could ever have repaid." [...] He clenched one hand tight as he concluded: [...] "I can at least clear his memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Merely {{myself and}} <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> As {{to me it}} is all very natural: nothing, I suppose, can be fairer game than the young bourgeois doctor; but <b>my</b> <b>mother!</b> I <b>never</b> saw her {{ridiculed}} before.

6000|$|At {{this the}} girl's lip curled proudly. [...] "I do not {{thank you for}} your offer, Mr. Crabtree. The whole {{difficulty}} is just here--I do not like you; and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> shall <b>never</b> marry you so long as I can prevent it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed, count. Certainly, when I {{crossed the}} seas to take service here, I little thought how terrible was the {{struggle}} that was approaching. If we had known it, I {{am sure that}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>never</b> have let me leave home." ...|$|R
