5|$|Spruyt {{was the son}} of Jacobus Spuyt (1796–1839), a Dutch medical doctor, and Antje Landskroon. Both the Spruyt and Landskroon {{families}} {{stood in}} a tradition of medical practice, and three of the four brothers Spruyt had were doctors in the Netherlands. Spruyt himself trained as a lawyer at Leiden University, but probably did not finish his studies. He went on to work as a schoolteacher in the village of Oosterwolde in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that professor U.G. Lauts recruited him for South Africa in 1851. Lauts was {{one of a group of}} Dutchmen, interested in the development of good education in the new Boer settlements in South Africa. As such, Spruyt was one of the many Dutch immigrants that settled in the new Boer republics around the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Gjirokastër {{became part}} of the Pashalik of Yanina, then led by the Albanian-born Ali Pasha of Ioannina and was {{transformed}} into a semi-autonomous fiefdom in the southwestern Balkans until his death in 1822. After the fall of the pashalik in 1868, the city was the capital of the sanjak of Ergiri. On 23 July 1880, southern Albanian committees of the League of Prizren held a congress in the city, in which was decided that if Albanian-populated areas of the Ottoman Empire were ceded to neighbouring countries, they would revolt. During the Albanian National Awakening (1831–1912), the city was a major centre of the movement, and some groups in the city were reported to carry portraits of Skanderbeg, the national hero of the Albanians during this period. Gjirokastër from the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century also prominently contributed to the wider Ottoman Empire through individuals that served as Kadıs (civil servants) and was an important centre of Islamic culture. The pro-Albanianists of the city during 1909-1912 were split between two groups: the urban liberals who wanted to cooperate with the Greeks and Albanian nationalists who formed guerilla bands operating in the countryside. During the 19th and early 20th century, Albanian speaking Muslims were the majority population of Gjirokastër, while only a few Greek-speaking families lived there.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} for congregations {{also led to}} changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture. The Church of Scotland {{was among the first}} European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in seating arrangements, abandoning box pews for open benches. From the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century some of its churches, like Greyfriars in Edinburgh, began installing organs and stained glass windows, reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century. At Duns the church was rebuilt (opened 1888) in a plan used in the Middle Ages, with a separate chancel, communion table at the far end, and the pulpit under the chancel arch. The influence of the ecclesiological movement can be seen in churches built at Crathie (opened 1893), which had an apsidal chancel raised above the level of the nave, a stone pulpit and a brass lectern, and St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh (rebuilt 1894), with a marble communion table in a chancel decorated with marble and mosaic.|$|E
50|$|The corn mill {{was burned}} down during <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century but was rebuilt as a factory for making spades and shovels. The lint mill was later adapted as an {{auxiliary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shovel works.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} at Seahouses and North Sunderland was small, and dependent on fishing. In <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century <b>the</b> small harbour was of little commercial use {{except as a}} refuge for coastal vessels in bad weather.|$|R
50|$|The Studabaker-Scott House and Beehive School are two {{historic}} buildings near <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Greenville in Darke County, Ohio, United States.

25|$|There is {{a variety}} of kinds of {{temperature}} scale. It may be convenient to classify them as empirically and theoretically based.

25|$|Hymnody became {{acceptable}} for Presbyterians around the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, though the Reformed Presbyterians continue {{to insist on}} exclusive a capella psalmody. The use of organs and choirs also became acceptable in Reformed churches during the nineteenth century, even in Zurich.|$|E

50|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> {{century to}} <b>the</b> latter part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth, the River Aire was devoid of fish life {{downstream}} of Shipley {{due to its}} pollution.

50|$|Boucherett's {{activities}} for women's causes {{were inspired by}} reading the English Woman's Journal, which reflected her own aims, and by {{an article in the}} Edinburgh Review about <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many 'superfluous' women in England during <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, a time when there were far more women than men in the population.|$|R
25|$|The modern use of {{the term}} Scandinavia has been {{influenced}} by Scandinavism (the Scandinavist political movement), which was active in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, mainly between the First Schleswig War (1848–1850), in which Sweden and Norway contributed with considerable military force, and the Second Schleswig War (1864).|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{language}} was affected by {{a decline in the}} number of immigrants. By the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century the Irish-born numbered around 109,000 individuals (4.5% of Londoners). By 1861 their number had fallen to 107,000, in 1871 to 91,000, and in 1901 to 60,000.|$|E
25|$|Given this controversy, {{the best}} one {{can say is that}} the idea that {{habitual}} alcohol drinking was a disease had become more acceptable by the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, although many writers still argued it was a vice, a sin, and not the purview of medicine but of religion.|$|E
50|$|Music halls were {{originally}} tavern rooms which provided entertainment, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> music and speciality acts, for their patrons. By <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, <b>the</b> first purpose-built music halls were {{being built in}} London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that {{could no longer be}} met from the traditional folk song repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> schemes <b>of</b> {{assisted}} emigration {{which were}} adopted by private owners of landed estates in Ireland in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century {{grew out of}} a discourse of political economy which was heavily influenced by the ideas on overpopulation of Thomas Malthus and his disciples. Many of their arguments which were rehearsed in the 1820 s debates on emigration, echo through the correspondence on estate emigration in <b>the</b> mid <b>nineteenth</b> century...|$|R
60|$|I suppose I publish {{and leave}} the whole gathering, first, from that eternal {{tendency}} to perpetuate and preserve which is behind all Nature, authors included; second, to symbolize two or three specimen interiors, personal and other, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myriads <b>of</b> my time, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nineteenth</b> century in <b>the</b> New World; a strange, unloosen'd, wondrous time. But the book is probably without any definite purpose that can be told in a statement.|$|R
25|$|During the 5th century BCE, mental disorders, {{especially}} those with psychotic traits, were considered supernatural in origin, a view which existed throughout ancient Greece and Rome. The beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, although one may trace its germination to the late eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Boxing Day is {{a holiday}} celebrated in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other Commonwealth countries. Boxing Day {{originated}} in England in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century under Queen Victoria. For {{years in which}} the holiday falls on a weekend, the celebration is moved to make sure workers still get a day off (except in Canada, where it remains 26 Dec.) In the UK it is classed as a Bank Holiday.|$|E
25|$|Boston was {{the center}} of the American {{publishing}} industry for some years, largely on the strength of its local writers and before it was overtaken by New York in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. Boston remains the home of publishers Houghton Mifflin and Pearson Education, and it was the longtime home of literary magazine The Atlantic Monthly. Merriam-Webster is based in Springfield, Massachusetts. Yankee is a magazine for New Englanders based in Dublin, New Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|Cymmer (Cymer) is {{a village}} and {{community}} in the Rhondda Valley, Wales. It is so named because of being located at <b>the</b> 'confluence' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda Fawr and Rhondda Fach river valleys. Several collieries were opened here in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. A serious mine accident in 1856 resulted in 114 casualties, and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> payment of any compensation to the miners' families caused bitter feelings in the community.|$|R
40|$|Any {{attempt to}} descry <b>the</b> {{existence}} <b>of</b> a significant colonial bourgeoisie in Java during <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century might appear futile. An old, and apparently still lingering, orthodoxy postulates a colonial state uniquely in thrall to a powerful bureaucracy: one that exercised so extensive a control over resources as to largely preclude bourgeois capital formation. On this reading, colonial proprietorship, notably in sugar, was seignorial in nature rather than bourgeois...|$|R
50|$|Joseph Stirling Coyne's {{everyday}} {{characters and}} realistic situations and language appealed to working-class theatergoers, and his plays enjoyed long runs during <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, when stage. Coyne is remembered for his humor and puns {{and for his}} satire of Victorian social and artistic conventions. His work is a significant link between the stylized French and English comedies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century and the witty, intellectual plays of Wilde and George Bernard Shaw.|$|R
25|$|The Talmud Torah at Nikolsburg, Moravia, from 1724 to 1744, gave poor boys an {{education}} {{equal to that}} which was offered their more fortunate companions. The studies consisted of Siddur, Chumash (Pentateuch), and Talmud (Moritz Güdemann, Quellenschriften zur Gesch. des Unterrichts und der Erziehung bei den Deutschen Juden, p.275). The schools in eastern Europe retained the ancient type and methods of the Ashkenazic schools up to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, when a movement for improvement and better management {{took place in the}} larger cities.|$|E
25|$|From the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century {{however, the}} term Turk {{and from the}} late nineteenth century onwards, {{derivative}} terms such as Turkalvanoi have been used as a pejorative term, phrase and or expression for Muslim Albanian populations by non-Muslim Balkan Peoples. Amongst the wider Greek-speaking population until the interwar period, the term Arvanitis (plural: Arvanites) was used to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of their religious affiliations. In Epirus today, the term Arvanitis is still used for an Albanian speaker regardless of their citizenship and religion.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{description is}} found in the De Aedificiis ("On Buildings") by Procopius, who described the fortress in the 6th century CE. Upon archaeological investigation of the site, Procopius’ description turned out to be highly accurate, suggesting that he knew the site from personal observation. Halabiye has drawn the attention of European travelers and scholars since the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. The English explorer Gertrude Bell passed the site on her travels in northern Mesopotamia and it was photographed by the French aerial archaeology pioneer Antoine Poidebard in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish musical tradition, for instance, was far {{older than}} anyone else's in Europe. Music {{remained}} {{an element in}} Jewish services, and the cantor was almost as pivotal a figure in local Jewish society as the rabbi. But Jewish musicians, except as converts, had played no part in European musical development. Hence the entry, in considerable numbers, of Jewish composers and performers on the musical scene in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century was a phenomenon, and a closely observed one.|$|R
5000|$|In 1888, William Kincaid {{published}} his Indian Antiquary which {{makes no mention}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term Bhojshala, but does mention a Akl ka kua or [...] "Well of Wisdom" [...] in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb <b>of</b> Kamal al-Din. According to Michael Willis, Kincaid was not a sympathetic ethnographer, but <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term Bhojshala in his text may be because there was [...] "no living tradition about Bhojshala in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century" [...] among those who he interacted with in Dhar.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} to <b>middle</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, chess tournaments were few and far between, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top players were limited to playing matches against each other, usually for a {{substantial}} purse, which was either staked by themselves or by their patrons. From the 1840s to the 1860s, Dubois took part in many matches against <b>the</b> top players <b>of</b> Europe, and it was rare for him to lose, even when he gave odds of pawn and move to his opponents.|$|R
25|$|Brazil did not settle {{disputes}} with Argentina over its precise national boundaries {{until the early}} twentieth century. It had settled with Uruguay in 1851, with Peru in 1851 and 1874, with Colombia in 1853, with Venezuela in 1859, with Bolivia in 1867 and with Paraguay in 1872, but not with Argentina, Guyana, French Guyana and Suriname. However, it had consolidated most of its vast territory under a single authority by the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, achieved {{as the result of}} the work of the empire's political elite.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, {{the game}} of {{baseball}} began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, {{in much the same way}} that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E
25|$|By the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, the Marriott brothers, {{who owned}} a wharf at Narborough, and whose {{business}} included malting and selling coal and corn, also controlled the navigation. They formed an association, with some local landowners, to resist {{the construction of the}} Lynn and Dereham Railway line from King's Lynn to Dereham. Their cause was not successful, and the line opened from King's Lynn to Narborough on 1846, and onwards to Dereham in 1848, after which trade on the river declined. An Act of Parliament for the Nar Valley Drainage scheme, obtained in 1881, included a clause to remove the need to maintain the river for navigation, and navigation to Narborough ceased in 1884, when construction of the Old Nar Tidal Sluice prevented boats from accessing the river at King's Lynn.|$|E
5000|$|However, historians {{continue}} to dispute when exactly such a [...] "revolution" [...] took place {{and of what}} it consisted. Rather than a single event, G.E.

This has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements about [...] "the Agricultural Revolution" [...] are difficult to sustain.|$|R
50|$|At Damme {{the canal}} crosses the Leopold Canal and the Schipdonk Canal, {{both of which}} were dug in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century in order to reduce <b>the</b> {{vulnerability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian canal network to Dutch interference, after the achievement in 1830 of Belgian independence.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the fashion for the Primitives in Britain in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century.

However, since interest extended to earlier Netherlandish and German painters, some mention will be made of attitudes to them also. In my analysis of this fashion I have chosen to treat as self-contained units its various manifestations. Therefore, a short sketch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fashion might be useful here...|$|R
