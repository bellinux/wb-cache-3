5|$|In May German forces {{attacked}} the Netherlands and Belgium which fell quickly. In June France collapsed. Fighter Command now needed {{an influx of}} pilots after losses in Western Europe. Finucane had improved and on 27 June 1940 he was posted to 7 Operational Training Unit (7 OTU) in Hawarden near Chester, to undergo conversion training onto Supermarine Spitfires while awaiting a fighter squadron posting. Finucane made his first flight in a Spitfire on 3 July 1940 and made 26 such flights in nine days. The pilots were tested on radio transmission, handling, formation flying and aerobatics. On 11 July 1940 he was permitted just one firing practice. At {{the end of his}} stay at 7 OTU he had logged 2 hours 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Magister, 2 hours 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Fairey Battle, 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hawker Hurricane and 22 hours and 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Culver Line extension, the BRT's fare was cut from 10 cents to 5 cents, and Coney Island became a much more {{affordable}} vacation area compared to in previous years. In 1923, these lines came {{under the control of the}} Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the BRT's successor company. Riders at the new station were promised trains that ran every three minutes during rush hours, but this quickly proved not to be true. In 1923, a reporter for the Brooklyn Standard Union observed that rush hour trains had headways of eight <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sea Beach Line and fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West End Line, and that no direct Manhattan service was being run on either the Brighton or Culver Lines during rush hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{night before}} the start of the operations, the Soviet night bombers {{attacked}} the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions to disrupt the German command and control. The bombers also attacked German airfields and communication centres to disrupt the flow of reinforcements. Operation Iskra began at 9:30 on January 12, when the two Soviet fronts began their artillery preparation, which lasted for 2 hours 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western side and 1 hour 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of the bottleneck. The Soviet attack started five minutes before the artillery preparation finished with a Katyusha barrage, to fully exploit its effects.|$|E

Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E

5|$|After five <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final morning, Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting {{into the}} final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin. The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers. However, Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by England’s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances. Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.|$|E
5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up.

He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E
