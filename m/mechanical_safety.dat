50|$|The fully {{interlocking}} McKenzie and Holland 20-lever {{mechanical signal}} frame in the signal cabin at the Charters Towers Railway Station {{is a rare}} surviving example of an operational <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> system for managing railway traffic.

50|$|A major {{incident}} on the Six Flags Great America version of Demon occurred on Saturday, April 18, 1998.

Firefighters used a cherry picker to bring the passengers to safety. Some riders were stuck for nearly three hours.

50|$|Failure in an {{autoclave}} differs materially {{from ordinary}} machinery defects {{only when it}} involves the pressure containment. Since compressed air, gas, or steam can store considerable energy, strict measures are mandated by law to prevent such incidents. Generally, pressure vessel failure takes one of two forms. One is rupture of the vessel, normally by crack propagation. Cracks in steel under stress can spread at speeds of {{up to more than}} a mile per second. This results in the release of stored energy, one effect of which is the acceleration of the rupture itself. Such releases are effectively explosions. The other form is the failure of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> device, such as the interlock that disables the door opening mechanism as long as vessel pressure exceeds a conservative value, such as ¼ or ½ psi.|$|E
50|$|The KS-23K is a {{redesigned}} KS-23 {{that features}} a bullpup layout. The KS-23K was accepted in 1998 {{for the use of}} the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). Development and adoption of this carbine was motivated by the fact that in the earlier accepted configurations of the KS-23 and KS-23M a major noted deficiency was that the tubular magazine did not make it possible to rapidly reload or change the type of ammunition being used, because of this a major design change for the KS-23K is that it has an extended box magazine that holds seven shells instead of the three shells seen on the other models. The gun has a <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> located on the left side, above the pistol handle and open non adjustable sights. The gun's effective range is 100 m.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1910 {{differed}} {{in many ways}} from the previous M1909 design, that had been rejected by the War Department. The grip was changed from an 84 degree angle to 74 degree angle, which created a more natural grip when being fired from an outstretched hand. The M1910 was not manufactured with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> mechanism by Colt, which was one problem the War Department saw in the design. Browning developed a type of relatively simple safety that could be retrofitted {{on the outside of}} the pistol, that would keep the slide locked in the forward position, and could be easily disengaged with a movement of the thumb. Another improvement was that the extractor mechanism was redesigned to fit on the inside of the slide, unlike the exterior extractor from the M1909 and other early Browning automatics.|$|E

50|$|The Deer gun {{was made}} of cast aluminium, with the {{receiver}} formed into a cylinder {{at the top of}} the weapon. The striker protruded from the rear of the receiver and was cocked in order to fire, and a plastic clip was placed there to prevent an accidental discharge, as the Deer gun had no <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety.</b> The grip had raised checkering, was hollow, and had space for three 9 mm rounds and a rod for clearing the barrel of spent cases. The Deer gun lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user, in order to prevent tracing of the weapons, and all were delivered in unmarked polystyrene boxes with three 9 mm rounds and a series of pictures depicting the operation of the gun. A groove ran down a ramp on top for sighting. The barrel unscrewed for loading and removing the empty casing. A cocking knob was pulled until cocked. The aluminium trigger had no trigger guard.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2011, the {{findings}} of a 10-month-long study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), aimed to identify the main cause of sudden acceleration in Toyota and Lexus models. The study was requested by the U.S. Congress and [...] "enlisted NASA engineers with expertise in areas such as computer controlled electronic systems, electromagnetic interference and software integrity". The most common problem was drivers hitting the accelerator pedal when they thought they were hitting the brake, which the NHTSA called [...] "pedal misapplication.” Of the 58 cases reported, 18 were dismissed out of hand. Of the remaining 40, 39 of them were found to have no cause; the remainder being an instance of “pedal entrapment.” One investigator says most of the cases involved “pedal misapplication” - that is, “the driver stepped on the gas rather than the brake or in addition to the brake.” The report concluded that the two <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> defects that were originally identified by NHTSA are known causes of dangerous unintended acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855, {{at the age}} of 23, {{he joined}} the GWR, {{becoming}} the first Telegraph Superintendent of the company. He set about developing a complete system of block signalling using telegraphy, supported by a book of rules and instructions. This system was first applied on the Metropolitan and District railway, followed soon by the GWR, whose Chairman, Daniel Gooch, disapproved of <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> devices, claiming that they reduced the [...] "natural vigilance" [...] of the operating staff. On the GWR, Spagnoletti's block telegraph instrument was particularly useful on single-track lines where it allowed more trains to be run. [...] It became the foundation of all block signalling used on almost all British railways, and on the railways of many other countries. In 1866 Spagnoletti devised a system of communication between passengers and the guards of a train, consisting of a handle which a passenger could turn in the compartment in which they were travelling. This activated a system of alarm bells in the train and also caused a red disc to be shown {{on the outside of the}} carriage in which the alarm had been used. He continued to develop various devices and inventions applicable to signalling and railways, and also in other areas such as fire safety.|$|E
