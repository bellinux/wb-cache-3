2500|$|A horn {{loudspeaker}} is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small <b>metal</b> <b>diaphragm</b> vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air.

The author is an employee of Ranco Controls Limited, who are engaged in high volume production of these types of control units. Design has traditionally followed an empirical approach, the present study was initiated to investigate analytical techniques which would improve the design method. A finite element analysis method has been used to determine stresses and deformations of typical convoluted diaphragms under pressure loading. The analytical results have been verified by applying the method to several standard cases and to published data. In addition a large scale model of a diaphragm has been manufactured and measurements taken of strains and deformation under central point loading and pressure loading. Good correlation has been obtained between analytical and experimental methods. The results of the stress analysis have been used in conjunction with experimentally determined material fatigue properties to predict component life. Reasonable correlation has been found between predicted life and actual experimental life tests...|$|R

However, successful commercial exploitation of highly miniaturized capacitive sensors is often inhibited {{by the presence of}} parasitic effects such as environmental noise and parasitic capacitances. Therefore, to alleviate the problems encountered in the capacitive pressure sensor approach, it is important to integrate the sensors and the circuitry as directly as possible. This paper builds on preliminary work reported previously by us [Sens. Actuators A 101 (2002) 231] and focuses on direct integration of read-out circuitry with microfabricated microsensors. These capacitive {{pressure sensors}} with three-candidate diaphragm materials (Kapton polyimide film, stainless steel, and titanium) are demonstrated the integration with read-out circuitry on stainless steel substrate.

We designed, fabricated and tested three different shock wave generators of which one system employs a highly elastic rubber membrane and the other systems use a fast acting pneumatic valve instead of conventional <b>metal</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> The valve opening speed is obtained with the help of a high speed camera. For shock generation systems with a pneumatic cylinder, it ranges from 0. 325 to 1. 15 m/s while it is around 8. 3 m/s for the rubber membrane. Experiments are conducted using the three diaphragmless systems and the results obtained are analyzed carefully to obtain a relation between the opening speed of the valve and the amount of gas that is actually utilized in the generation of the shock wave for each system. The rubber membrane is not suitable for industrial applications because it needs to be replaced regularly and cannot withstand high driver pressures. The maximum shock Mach number obtained using the new diaphragmless system that uses the pneumatic valve is 2. 125 +/- 0. 2 %.
