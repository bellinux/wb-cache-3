40|$|John Donne was a {{firm believer}} in the circle and the {{circular}} world around him. Circle images are pervasive in his poetry, such as the compass image in "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning, " and the lovers as a world in "The Sunne Rising. " Donne used circle imagery to express a variety of relationships, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> woman, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> God, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> himself, and <b>man</b> <b>to</b> nature. I have picked three poems which best show Donne's complex and intense use of the circle. All three involve a journey, a circular journey. It is through each of these circular journeys that the particular relationship is clarified, felt, and understood. The first poem is "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning," which deals with the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> woman relationship. The second poem, "Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward," is concerned with the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> God relationship, which also involves the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> self relationship. The third poem, "The First Anniversarie," is more complicated in both its imagery and its tone than the first two poems. Unlike the other two poems, it is concerned not with one relationship, but several, encompassing <b>man</b> <b>to</b> God, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> himself, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> nature and <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>man...</b>|$|R

5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand the pounding of cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough <b>men</b> <b>to</b> encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. These could be protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough <b>men</b> <b>to</b> storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was not a war of assembled armies facing each other on a field, but a war of artillery sieges. It required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating.|$|E
