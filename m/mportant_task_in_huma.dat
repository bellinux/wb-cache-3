40|$|AbstractIt is {{generally}} accepted that data encryption {{is the key}} role in current and future technologies. Many Public key cryptography schemes were presented, divided into different classes depending on a specific mathematical problem. Cryptography plays an i <b>mportant</b> <b>task</b> <b>in</b> accomplishing information security. It is used for encrypting or signing data at the source before transmission, and then decrypting or validating the signature of the received message at the destination. Since the introduction of public-key cryptography by Diffie and Hellman in 1976, the potential for using the discrete logarithm problem in public-key cryptosystems has been recognized. There are several public key cryptography, such as RSA and El-Gamal and Elliptic curve cryptography. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is considered more suitable than other public key cryptography algorithms because of its small key size. ECC is chosen in this work because of its advantages over other public key cryptography. Generally, to produce private keys and elliptic curve cryptography domain parameters, a random generator is used...|$|R

The medium viscoelasticity significantly homo-genized the trajectories of cells along the centerline {{of a simple}} straight channel, {{which could not be}} achieved in conventional Newtonian media. More than 95 % of red blood cells (RBCs) were successfully delivered to the stagnation point of a cross-slot microchannel and stretched by extensional flow. By computational simulations, we proved that this method prevents inaccuracies due to random lateral distributions of cells and, further, guarantees rotational-free cell stretching along the shear-free channel centerline.
