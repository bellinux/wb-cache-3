The maintenance scheduling program determines a set of thermal units <b>maintenance</b> <b>switch</b> off for a time period of one year. This paper considers the application of dynamic programming and successive approximations method in determination of annual thermal unit maintenance schedules. The objective function is multiple component and consists of system operation costs and system reliability indices (loss-of-load-probability and expected unserved energy). The evaluation of these costs is performed through a simulation method which uses a cumulant load model.

40|$|The {{lysogeny}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>switch</b> in phage lambda {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} examples on the molecular level of computation, command and control in a living system. If, following infection of the bacterium E. coli, the virus enters the lysogenic pathway, it represses its developmental functions, and integrates its DNA into the host chromosome. In this state the prophage may be passively replicated for many generations of E. coli. In fact, this repressed state is intrinsically more stable than the gene encoding the repressor. We develop a mathematical formalism to predict the stability of such epigenetic states from affinities of the molecular components. We apply the model to the behavior of recently published mutants at the right operator complex of lambda, and find that the reported stability indicates that the current view of the switch is incomplete. The approach described here should be generally applicable to the stability of expressed statesComment: LaTeX 24 pages, 7 figures in PostScrip...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} computational study of some 900 possible "lambda-lac" mutants of the lysogeny <b>maintenance</b> <b>switch</b> in phage lambda, of which {{up to date}} 19 have been studied experimentally (Atsumi & Little, PNAS 103 : 4558 - 4563, (2006)). We clarify that these mutants realise regulatory schemes quite different from wild-type lambda, and can therefore be expected to behave differently, within the conventional mechanistic setting in which this problem has often been framed. We verify that indeed, within this framework, across this wide selection of mutants the lambda-lac mutants {{for the most part}} either have no stable lytic states, or should only be inducible with difficulty. In particular, the computational results contradicts the experimental finding that four lambda-lac mutants both show stable lysogeny and are inducible. This work hence suggests either that the four out of 900 mutants are special, or that lambda lysogeny and inducibility are holistic effects involving other molecular players or other mechanisms, or both. The approach illustrates the power and versatility of computational systems biology to systematically and quickly test a wide variety of examples and alternative hypotheses for future closer experimental studies.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{safety risk}} to electrical personnel {{working on an}} energised switchboard is the hazard of exposure to arc flash, which has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Although reported arc flash injuries are infrequent compared to other electrical injuries, especially electric shock, the very high costs associated with these arc flash injuries make them {{one of the most}} important categories to avoid in an industrial workplace. The main objective of this project is to conduct arc flash studies for switchboards installed at Fortescue’s Solomon Hub to quantify the existing arc flash hazard posed by this type of equipment. The aim of the study is to find feasible solutions to reduce arc flash incident energy to less than 8 cal/cm 2 and to provide appropriate arc flash PPE recommendations. Switchboards with voltage levels of 0. 4 kV, 0. 69 kV, 6. 6 kV, 11 kV and 33 kV were investigated. The arc flash calculations were conducted using the IEEE 1584 - 2002 Standard, IEEE Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations. The study found that many switchboards have dangerous incident energy levels that must be reduced, in order to allow energised work on the equipment. To mitigate the hazard, three simple solutions were proposed: optimise protection settings, install <b>maintenance</b> <b>switches</b> and remote operation. Firstly, optimising protection settings is the least expensive solution to reduce the operating time of protection devices, and hence limit arc flash incident energy exposure. Secondly, where a permanent setting will violate the grading requirement of the system, then installing <b>maintenance</b> <b>switches</b> is proposed. Thirdly, where the first two strategies cannot be implemented because they will violate the grading requirement of the system, then remote operation is proposed. This will eliminate the arc flash hazard because personnel will operate the equipment outside the arc flash boundary. If the recommendations of this study are implemented, the arc flash incident energy of the switchboards will significantly reduce to not greater than 8 cal/cm 2. The implications are improved safety for personnel, given that energy levels on many switchboards currently pose a significantly higher arc flash hazard...|$|R

Following its approval as second-line monotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, pemetrexed has established itself as the first-line regimen in combination with cisplatin, and its powerful antitumor effects and less cumulative toxicities were then taken advantage of in the JMEN and PARAMOUNT trials, respectively, to pioneer a new treatment strategy of <b>switch</b> and continuation <b>maintenance</b> monotherapy. These developments have brought about a marked paradigm shift, and made pemetrexed indispensable in the treatment for non-squamous NSCLC. So far, only three drugs have been approved for maintenance therapy; pemetrexed both by <b>switch</b> and continuation <b>maintenance,</b> erlotinib by <b>switch</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and bevacizumab by continuation maintenance. Compared with observation alone after defined cycles of the first-line chemotherapy, subsequent pemetrexed maintenance therapy has provided significantly longer survival and infrequent severe adverse events. The cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed maintenance therapy is controversial, {{as well as the other}} two maintenance drugs, bevacizumab and erlotinib. The latest attractive attention is a combination maintenance therapy. We may have to consider epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status for selection of a combination pattern. A combination maintenance therapy of pemetrexed plus bevacizumab is potential for patients with wild-type EGFR status, while a EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-containing combination is promising for patients with active EGFR mutation status. Pemetrexed will be a pivotal drug when a combination maintenance therapy is used in practice. For future maintenance therapy, we need to explore reliable predictive selection or exclusion markers that can predict who will really benefit from maintenance therapy.

We examined the cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed in this indication, {{from the perspective of}} the Swiss health care system, and assessed the influence of the costs of best supportive care (BSC) on overall cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on the pemetrexed maintenance study, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding pemetrexed until disease progression was calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Uncertainties concerning the costs of BSC on the ICER were addressed. RESULTS: The base case ICER for maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus BSC compared to BSC alone was € 106, 202 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Varying the costs for BSC had a marked effect. Assuming a reduction of the costs for BSC by 25 % in the pemetrexed arm resulted in an ICER of € 47, 531 per quality-adjusted life-year, which is below predefined criteria for cost effectiveness in Switzerland.
