5|$|Argentine Sergio Rinland {{designed}} the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when Yamaha powered the cars. In the 1992 season the cars (which were updated {{versions of the}} 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner, Ayrton Senna. After {{the end of that}} race the team ran out of funds and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the £6million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into administration. The Serious Fraud Office investigated the case. Landhurst's <b>managing</b> <b>directors</b> were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge. It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. (cf March Engineering, Fondmetal and Andrea Moda Formula). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's receivers in 1993. Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash. The factory was bought by the Carlin DPR GP2 motor racing team in 2006.|$|E

25|$|The VOC had {{two types}} of shareholders: the participanten, who {{could be seen as}} non-managing members, and the 76 bewindhebbers (later reduced to 60) who acted as <b>managing</b> <b>directors.</b> This was the usual set-up for Dutch joint-stock {{companies}} at the time.

The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be permanent during the lifetime of the company.
