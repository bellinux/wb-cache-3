If the paskha is cooked, this mass is then heated. The pan containing the mixture is then placed in a container of cold water and progressively cooled. Afterwards it is placed in a tradional wooden <b>mould</b> <b>assembly</b> called pasochnitsa (пасочница), with a layer of cheese cloth protecting the mould. The wooden mould can be taken apart for cleaning; however, more modern materials, such as plastics, are used nowadays. The mould is cooled for twelve hours in a cold, but not freezing place (typically in a cellar or refrigerator). Finally, the paskha is turned out of the mould, the cheesecloth removed, and put on a dish. It may then be decorated with candied fruits, nuts, or flowers. In contemporary times, cheese paska is not always formed in a mould and is sometimes served in a mound on a plate.|$|E

With the use of presented testing equipment, {{it is possible to}} determine force kinetics and deformation of moulding sand in real time. The need for this kind of study comes from the modern casting industry. New foundries can be characterized with high intensity of production which is correlated with high level of mechanization and automatization of foundry processes. The increasingly common use of manipulators in production of moulds and cores can lead to generation of new types of flaws, caused by breakage in moulds and cores which could occur during <b>mould</b> <b>assembly.</b> Hence it is required that moulds and cores have high resistance to those kinds of factors, attributing it with the phenomenon of elasticity.

40|$|Prefabrication {{has evolved}} in depth and breadth from its beginnings, {{bringing}} {{many of the}} advantages of industrialisation to construction, while solving {{some of the problems that}} arose in the early years. Today prefabrication, compared to traditional construction methods, and concrete as a material, feature a number of beneficial characteristics. Precast elements are factory made products. The only way to industrialise the construction industry is to shift work from temporary construction sites to modern permanent facilities. Factory production entails rational and efficient manufacturing processes, skilled workers, systematisation of repetitive tasks, and lower labour costs per m² as a result of automated production. Factory products are process-based and lean manufacturing principles are deployed. Automation is gradually being implemented in factories and is already in place in areas such as the preparation of reinforcing steel, <b>mould</b> <b>assembly,</b> concrete casting, and surface finishing on architectural concrete. And other stages in the process are sure to follow. As prefabrication makes optimal use of materials, its potential for savings is much greater than in cast-in-situ construction. Structural performance and durability are also enhanced through design, modern manufacturing equipment and carefully planned working procedures. The environmental burden of prefabrication is mainly the burden caused by the raw materials of concrete (especially production of cement and steel). The environmental burden caused by raw materials is approximately three times larger than that caused by the production process of the elements, as indicated by the examples of environmental product declarations. Also thermal inertia of heavy materials is well known for both in warm and cold climates. Most people have experienced the comfort of coming into a comparatively cool stone building on a hot day in a warm climate. In precast structures several systems have been developed using this characteristic. As there is a Fib Bulletin under preparation in Commission 6 Prefabrication, by the Task Group 6. 3 Sustainability, in which both authors are members, the conclusions of this document will be presented including a proposal for an evaluation model that can be applied to precast structures.

40|$|Despite {{several decades}} of {{research}} for new materials for articulating joints in orthopedic applications, the efforts to develop patient-specific prototype of such biomaterial devices are rather limited. While addressing this aspect, the present work demonstrates an integrated manufacturing approach how to fabricate zirconia toughened alumina femoral head and acetabular socket initiation with composition and process optimization, and designing of prototypes. The properties and performance of a such ceramic components significantly depend on the microstructue (grain size) and sinter density, it is therefore important to optimize both the process parameters (sintering temperature, sintering time) and material parameters (sinter–aid addition and reinforcement content) to obtain tough and strong materials. Based on considering the fundamental densification-grain size relationship and using the predictive linear, quadratic or interactive response among the process and material parameters, the adopted response surface methodology (RSM) approach is shown to provide excellent capability to predict sinter density and grain size with significant statistical correlation between experimental and predicted values. Summarising, the optimization study establishes that sintering of 5 wt. % zirconia toughened alumina sintered with 800 ppm MgO sinter-aid at 1600 oC for 6 h can exhibit a great combination of relative density, compressive strength (1100 MPa), tensile strength (200 MPa) and SEVNB fracture toughness (4. 3 MP m 1 / 2). In order to assess the cytocompatibility properties, C 2 C 12 mouse myoblast cells were grown on the ZTA composite having the best combination of mechanical properties. The results of MTT assay reveal {{an increase in the}} number of mitochondrially active cells with time in culture for a period of up to 3 days. The fluorescence microscopic observations also confirmed good cell attachment and cell-to-cell contact with cellular bridge formation. In view of the importance of the wear resistance properties in the performance and durability of prototypes in total hip joint replacement application, the unlubricated sliding wear experiments with commercial cubic zirconia, and stainless steel counterbody reveal that a combination of steady state COF of 0. 5 and 0. 42 and wear rate of 10 - 9 mm 3 /N m observed for the optimized ZTA composite with having the best combination of mechanical properties. The wear mechanism is dominated by abrasive wear and cracking induced delamination of tribolayer. In commensurate with the computer aided-design (CAD) of prototypes after optimization of process and properties of ZTA, the custom made modular steel-die <b>mould</b> <b>assembly</b> was fabricated to produce high strength green powder compact of Al 2 O 3 - 5 wt% ZrO 2 (3 mol %Y 2 O 3) - 800 ppm MgO without any geometric distortion at uniaxial pressure of 18 - 22 ton. In line with design consideration, green compact of the femoral head / acetabular socket was presintered at 1200 oC in air for 2 h in a conventional sintering furnace and subsequently computer numerical control (CNC) machined to a limited extent. The final stage of prototype development involved the multi-step sintering of the compact at 1600 oC for 6 h in air, followed by polishing using tailor made arrangement. The process quality was closely monitored by measuring dimensional changes at each manufacturing stage as well as the circularity measurement of final polished prototype. The microstructure as well as the physical properties in terms of hardness, indentation toughness, and burst strength is also reported. Taken together the present manufacturing approach appears to be a scalable and commercially viable fabrication strategy to make bioceramics based femoral head and acetabular socket biomedical devices...|$|E
40|$|To ensure {{success in}} the {{production}} of laminated veneer products, it is necessary to acquire a sound basic understanding of the behaviour of the wood, and to understand the inherent reactions of wood to adhesive, heat, moisture, strain and stress. This can ensure an efficient wood utilization and promote the development of new processes and products that take advantage of the visco-elastic nature of wood. A shortcoming of the laminated bending process is that the products may become distorted after moulding and during use. In this study, we have examined how the performance of laminated veneer products can be improved through the implementation of basic knowledge of wood in the design and production process. The results show that the material and process parameters and storage in a changing relative humidity have a clear impact on distortion. Fibre orientation of the veneers in the <b>moulded</b> <b>assembly</b> was the most critical parameter to control. Fibre deviations mainly resulted in twist of the product. A moisture content in one veneer deviating from that {{of the rest of the}} veneers in the <b>assembly</b> before <b>moulding</b> resulted in distortion of the laminated veneer products both after moulding and during use. To decrease the negative effect of fibre orientation and moisture content on shape stability, the veneer should be straight-grained and well-conditioned to a moisture level adapted to the use of the final product. Special care should also be taken to orientate the veneers during <b>assembly</b> before <b>moulding.</b> Godkänd; 2014; 20131112 (ysko); Konferensartikel i tidskrif...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of multi-component injection moulding (well known in polymer shaping) into powder technology offers {{the possibility to}} create composite materials made of ceramics and metals. In the co-shaping process the different materials, e. g. ZrO 2 and steel 17 - 4 PH, are directly injected into one mould. In the subsequent step of co-firing the part is debindered and sintered up to nearly theoretical density.

5000|$|In December 1985, McAlpine {{handed over}} the {{completed}} factory building to Nissan for the installation of machinery and factory components, ahead of schedule. Phase 1 of the plant construction was completed in July 1986, consisting of a body, paint and final assembly Line. The first Bluebird was produced shortly after and is {{on display at the}} Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens. Official opening of the plant by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Nissan President Yutaka Kume took place in September 1986. By February 1987, NMUK had become the sole supplier of the Bluebird model to the UK market, and work on phase two of the plant began, with Plastics <b>moulding</b> and engine <b>assembly</b> beginning in 1988, and was completed in May 1990. This would prove to be a landmark year for the plant, with the introduction of the P10 Primera, the first model to be wholly built at NMUK, replacing the Bluebird. By 1991, despite the recession, the plant turned its first profit of £18.4 million, and was awarded 'British Manufacturer' status by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Around this time, Nissan ended its relationship with Octav Botnar and the Automotive Financial Group (AFG), which had been its UK import concessionaire since 1970, and brought the import and distribution business in-house, basing it at the Sunderland plant. In August 1992, the plant began to produce two models, with the introduction of the highly successful Micra, which was the first car of a Japanese brand to be voted [...] "European Car of the Year.

40|$|This {{research}} has investigated the modelling and optimisation of the tilt casting process of Titanium Aluminides (TiAl). This study {{is carried out}} in parallel with the experimental research undertaken in IRC at the University of Birmingham. They propose to use tilt casting inside a vacuum chamber and attempt to combine this tilt casting process with Induction Skull Melting (ISM). A totally novel process is developing for investment casting, which is suitable for casting gamma TiAl. As it is known, gamma TiAl alloys has great properties including low density, high specific yield strength, high specific stiffness, good oxidation resistance and good creep resistance at high temperature [Clemens - 2000][Appel et at. - 2000]. A worldwide research effort {{has been made to}} develop gamma TiAl because it can offer a great potential for reducing the weight of high performance components and also engine of power generation gas turbine. Titanium alloys are very reactive at molten condition, and so, they are melted in an ISM crucible in order to avoid crucible contamination. There is still a big challenge to produce a long blade, up to 40 cm, due to the low superheat provided by the Induction Skull Melting (ISM) furnace which is widely used to melt the alloys. Here computational simulation has been seen important to predict the casting defects and to help optimise the experimental process. Computational modelling for the casting process involves a range of interactions of physical phenomena such as heat transfer, free surface fluid flow, solidification and so on. A number of free surface modelling techniques are applied to simulate the interface between the molten metal entering the mould in the filling phase, and the gas escaping. The CFD code PHYSICA developed in the University of Greenwich is used to simulate the above physical phenomena and to simulate the fluid flow both within the rotating <b>mould</b> cavity/crucible <b>assembly</b> and in the porous mould wall (including vents). Modelling the mould in a finite volume method is cumbersome, so an alternative 3 D/ 1 D coupled transient heat transfer model has been developed in this study. It is {{based on the fact that}} the mould filling for titanium aluminide (TiAl) is carried out during a few seconds and the thermal conductivity of the mould material is very low. Heat can be assumed to transfer mainly in a direction perpendicular to the mould wall ID. ID transient heat transfer model is governed by ID heat conduction equation in the mould part where the coordinates of each defined cell centre were calculated rather than meshing them. The coupling method between ID and 3 D model is presented. The model is then validated using two simple geometries which describe two similar states in the mould filling as test cases. It has been applied to model short thin and long blades, especially to obtain accurate thermal boundaries. Comparisons with experiments have also been done. Across the presentation of the results, the factors affect the quality of the casting in the mould filling have been discussed. This thesis also presents a novel Counter Diffusion Method which was developed with suggestions from my supervisors as a corrective mechanism to counter numerical diffusion. This is a novel method to discretise the free surface equation fully implicitly in a fast, efficient way without numerical diffusion. Validation of the novel method was undertaken against the classical collapsing column experiment. The results showed that they are in good agreement. Then the method has been used to model a long thin blade for TiAl. A huge reduction in computational time is seen when the geometry is complex and massive amount of mesh cells are generated. That greatly speeds up the simulations. Solidification is modeled during the cooling which is following the filling stage. Gap formation between metal and mould is covered and the effects of the gap and gap size are presented by the application of model on a long twisted turbine blade.
