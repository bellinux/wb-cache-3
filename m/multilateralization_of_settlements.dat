40|$|Not only in East Asia the {{political}} construction of “coherent regions ” is often {{closely linked to}} practices of financial regionalism. Starting from a non-idealistic understanding of community building, this paper compares three stages {{of the development of}} East Asian financial regionalism: Japan's proposal to establish an Asian Monetary Fund, the establishment of a network of currency swap agreements in 2000 (Chiang Mai Initiative) and the <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> this cooperative scheme in May 2010. It is demonstrated how the evolution of these cooperative arrangements has materialized an influential “East Asia”-Asianism essentially embedded in financial regionalism.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{monetary}} transfers {{system that was}} created by the short-term inland bill of exchange markets. For decades this system was the most practical way of channeling the growing volume of transfers which were taking place {{as a consequence of the}} growth of the Spanish economy. This analysis argues that, between 1775 and 1885, the markets involved in this activity became progressively more efficient, due largely to the <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> the payment system. This situation lasted longer in Spain than in the rest of Europe since Spanish banking was, initially, slower to develop. Using univariate and multivariate GARCH models, it was possible to conclude that the inland bill of exchange markets constituted an essential monetary instrument, and one that faithfully reflects the integration of monetary markets in Spain.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the impacts of free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) in East Asia have assumed full utilization of preferences. The evidence suggests that this assumption is seriously in error, with the estimated uptake particularly low in East Asia. In this paper, we assume a more realistic utilization rate in estimating impacts. We find that actual utilization rates significantly diminish the benefits from preferential liberalization, but in a non-linear way. Reciprocity is an important motivation for pursuing FTAs over unilateral actions, although the Doha Round could deliver the same outcome if only it could be concluded. We isolate the impact of reciprocity, but find that the additional benefits also depend on utilization rates. Furthermore, the potential for trade deflection combined with possible retaliatory actions could negatively affect members and non-members. In the absence <b>of</b> Doha, the <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> preferences, even without reciprocity, is the practical route that {{is most likely to}} deliver the greatest benefits to members.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the likely impact of European preferences, in particular of its Rules of Origin (RoO), on {{the prospects for}} integration of West Africa in world trade. We show that West African trade has not yet achieved the structural transformation of countries having successfully established themselves as manufacturing assembly platforms. EU RoO are complex, restrictive and discriminatory, hampering this integration of African producers in world trade. The paper explores the consequences of moving to a single product-specific RoO which would allow a maximum foreign content (MFC) to satisfy the substantial transformation criterion. We suggest that the developmental objective of the EPAs would be satisfied with a MFC of 90 %- 95 % for LDCs and a 60 %- 70 % for non-LDCs. Such a differentiated treatment should allow the small african companies in West Africa to enter into cross-border production chains. With such a move, the EU would also ?seize the agenda? in the much awaited move towards <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> preferential RoO. economic partnership agreement, trade preferences, rules of origin, European Union, West Africa...|$|R

The study is conducted in Klaten District, covering 401 villages in the district. A survey method is secondary data analysis. Data are analyzed statistically using T test, varians analysis, correlation, and multiple regresion. The research shows {{that there is no}} significant differences in distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> between the Merapi volcanic slope, the lowland, and the hilly zone. Physical factors are not significantly influencing the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in various topographic zone. A neglegible ifference in the index distribution pattern <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> can be observed. Hilly zone of the district reveals an index of 0. 959. lower than those in the volcanis slope (1. 035) and in low land (1. 058). distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in various topographi zone are ditermine by different sets of socio-economic variables. In the volcanic zone two variables i. e. population density and the portion of sawah area are strongly influencing the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement.</b> In this zone population density contributes more than the sawh area.
