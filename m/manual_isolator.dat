40|$|To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the BACTEC 13 A (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Md.), BACTEC MYCO/F LYTIC (Becton Dickinson), BacT/ALERT MB (bioMérieux, Durham, N. C.), and ISOLATOR 10 lysis-centrifugation (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, N. J.) systems for detection of mycobacteremia in adults, we inoculated 5 -ml aliquots of blood from patients with suspected mycobacteremia into the bottle or tube required for each system. Of 600 sets tested, 85 (14 %) yielded Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and 9 (2 %) yielded other species of mycobacteria. Of 26 complete (three bottles and one tube) adequately filled (5 ± 1 ml) sets from which MAC was recovered, BACTEC 13 A was positive for 19 (73 %), BACTEC MYCO/F LYTIC was positive for 21 (81 %), BacT/ALERT MB was positive for 22 (85 %), and ISOLATOR 10 was positive for 21 (81 %). Of the six possible two-way comparisons, the mean times to detection for the recovery of MAC from each bottle in positive adequately paired sets were 15. 3 days for BACTEC 13 A versus 12. 8 days for MYCO/F LYTIC for 33 of 340 pairs, 14. 1 days for BACTEC 13 A versus 11. 6 days for BacT/ALERT MB for 38 of 380 pairs, 12. 6 days for BACTEC 13 A versus 20. 0 days for ISOLATOR 10 for 26 of 261 pairs, 12. 8 days for BACTEC MYCO/F LYTIC versus 11. 0 days for BacT/ALERT MB for 33 of 340 pairs, 13. 2 days for BACTEC MYCO/F LYTIC versus 20. 4 days for ISOLATOR 10 for 24 of 230 pairs, and 9. 9 days for BacT/ALERT MB versus 19. 0 days for ISOLATOR 10 for 24 of 257 pairs. There {{were no significant differences in}} yields between the systems. However, the mean time to detection differed significantly among the systems. The time to detection was shortest for BacT/ALERT MB, followed by BACTEC MYCO/F LYTIC and BACTEC 13 A and then ISOLATOR 10. Although the numbers were too small for statistical comparison, the time to detection was substantially shorter for MAC than for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in the liquid systems. The continuously monitored systems (BACTEC MYCO/F LYTIC and BacT/ALERT MB) were as sensitive and, on balance, faster for the detection of MAC bacteremia than were the heretofore standard <b>manual</b> <b>ISOLATOR</b> 10 and radiometric BACTEC 13 A systems...|$|E
40|$|The BACTEC MYCO/F Lytic {{blood culture}} bottle (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, Md.) is {{designed}} to optimize the recovery of fungi and mycobacteria; however, this bottle also supports the growth of most aerobic bacteria. We compared the MYCO/F Lytic bottle with two other BACTEC bottles and the Isolator system for the recovery of bacteria as well as fungi and mycobacteria from blood. A total of 6, 108 blood culture sets were inoculated with blood obtained from adult patients. Twenty-five to 28 ml of blood collected by a phlebotomy team for each blood culture set was randomly distributed into each of four blood culture receptacles: the Isolator tube (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, N. J.) and three BACTEC bottles: the MYCO/F Lytic bottle, the BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottle, and the BACTEC Anaerobic Lytic/ 10 bottle. The sediment from the Isolator tube was inoculated onto chocolate agar (CA), brain heart infusion agar (BHI), and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and into a BACTEC 13 A bottle. Incubation durations were as follows: MYCO/F Lytic bottle, 42 days; Plus Aerobic/F bottle, 5 days; Anaerobic Lytic/ 10 bottle, 5 days; sediment from Isolator tube on CA, 3 days; sediment from Isolator tube on BHI, 30 days; sediment from Isolator tube on SDA, 30 days; and sediment from Isolator tube in a BACTEC 13 A bottle, 42 days. Two isolates of Histoplasma capsulatum were recovered from the Isolator tube only. Three isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were recovered: two isolates from the MYCO/F Lytic bottle only and one isolate from the Isolator tube (whose sediment was inoculated into the BACTEC 13 A bottle) only. Two isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans were recovered: one from the MYCO/F Lytic bottle only and the other from the MYCO/F Lytic bottle and the Isolator tube (whose sediment was inoculated into the BACTEC 13 A bottle). For potential pathogens overall, there was a statistical difference in recovery that favored the Isolator system over the MYCO/F Lytic bottle (P = 0. 0015), including statistically significant differences for Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0. 0001) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (P = 0. 0313). However, there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the two blood culture systems when detection of bloodstream infection was considered. The time to detection for all potential pathogens combined was less for the MYCO/F Lytic bottle than for the Isolator system (P = 0. 0004). Overall, the potential pathogen recovery was greater for the BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottle than for either the Isolator system (P = 0. 0003) or the MYCO/F Lytic bottle (P = 0. 0001). However, the BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottle did not recover M. tuberculosis, H. capsulatum, or C. neoformans isolates. The combination of the Isolator system and MYCO/F Lytic bottle may be useful as a selective blood culture method to optimize the recovery of fungi and mycobacteria from blood. Compared with the <b>manual</b> <b>Isolator</b> system, the MYCO/F Lytic system has the advantage of less preanalytic processing and continuous automated monitoring of bottles for growth by the BACTEC 9240 instrument...|$|E
40|$|The HIV {{pandemic}} has {{reversed the}} gains in TB control and has thus {{contributed to an}} increase in TB morbidity and mortality, especially in low and middle-income countries. Improved TB diagnosis, active case finding as well as interventions towards the control of HIV will therefore conceivably result in better control of TB. Availability of a safe, affordable and efficacious vaccine is the best control measure for HIV. Participation of developing countries in these efforts is crucial. The overall aim of this thesis is to improve tuberculosis control in the era of HIV. In study I, a cross-sectional study was performed in two urban HIV VCT centers so as to determine the magnitude of TB among clients attending these centers. TB was diagnosed by symptoms screen, sputum and lymph nodes smears and culture of TB. We recruited 1, 318 participants, of these 347 (26 %) were HIV infected and TB was diagnosed in 63 (4. 7 %). Pulmonary TB, the most infectious form of TB was the most prevalent form detected in 52 participants. In study II, we compared <b>manual</b> <b>Isolator</b> lysis centrifugation to automated MB BacT broth systems for the detection of disseminated TB, and also compared 20 mLs to 40 mLs of blood for detecting disseminated TB. We recruited 258 hospitalized HIV-infected patients suspected to have TB. TB was culture confirmed in 83 (32 %) patients. There was no difference between 20 mLs or 40 mLs of blood for the detection TB [20 (15 %) vs 21 (16 %) ] p= 0. 83]. The MB BacT system had a significantly greater yield in detecting disseminated TB compared to the Isolator system [31 (76 %) vs 20 (49 %) p= 0. 001]. 21 (51 %) of the patients died prior to blood culture detection, the median survival was 6 days range 0 - 58 days. In study III, the test performance of a simple rapid urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen ELISA was compared to sputum and blood culture for the detection of HIV associated TB. Urine LAM sensitivity and specificity was 65 % and 86 % respectively in culture confirmed TB while the sensitivity and specificity of sputum smear, the conventional TB diagnostic method was 36 % and 98 % respectively. Urine LAM sensitivity improved with a decrease in CD+ 4 T-cell counts. In study IV, we prospectively enrolled and followed up a cohort of police officers so as to determine their suitability for HIV vaccine studies through determination of the current HIV prevalence and incidence. The HIV prevalence and incidence was 5. 2 % and 8. 4 per 1000 PYAR among the 1, 240 recruited police. In study V, a randomized multisite phase IIa clinical trial compared the safety and immunogenicity of priming with HIV-DNA at a dose 1000 µg in five injections “standard regimen” to a dose of 600 µg in two injections as separate or combined plasmid pools “simplified regimen” followed by boosting with HIV-MVA. The proportion of IFN-γ ELISpot responders did not differ between 2 injections of 600 µg combined (87 %), 2 injections of 600 µg separate (97 %) and the 5 injections of 1000 µg separate (97 %). Conclusion: TB screening in VCT centers is feasible and should be offered for early detection and treatment to prevent transmission. Automated liquid blood culture is optimal for diagnosing disseminated TB, however deaths occur prior to detection. Therefore urine LAM ELISA could be used as an adjuvant to sputum smear for rapid identification of TB in advanced HIV infection. The HIV incidence in the police cohort has declined and hence this cohort is now only suitable for phase I/II HIV vaccine trials. Therefore {{there is a need to}} prepare other cohorts for efficacy studies. The last study demonstrated a simpler way to administer HIV-DNA vaccines, suitable for efficacy trials...|$|E
