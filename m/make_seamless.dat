5000|$|A DJ mixer {{is a type}} {{of audio}} mixing console used by DJs for two {{different}} purposes: some DJs use the mixer to <b>make</b> <b>seamless</b> transitions from one song to another when they are spinning a set at a dance club. Hip hop DJs and turntablists use the DJ mixer to play record players like a musical instrument and create new sounds. DJs in the disco, house music, electronic dance music and other dance-oriented genres use the mixer to make smooth transitions between different sound recordings as they are playing. The sources are typically record turntables, compact cassettes, CDJs, or DJ software on a laptop. DJ mixers allow the DJ to use headphones to preview the next song before playing it to the audience. Most low- to mid-priced DJ mixers can only accommodate two turntables or CD players, but some mixers (such as the ones used in larger nightclubs) can accommodate up to four turntables or CD players. DJs and turntablists in hip hop music and nu metal use DJ mixers to create beats, loops and [...] "scratching" [...] sound effects.|$|E

30|$|Topographic {{products}} generated {{through the}} processing scheme proved {{the effectiveness of}} the main idea employing stereo data hierarchy. Since the geodetic control was well performed by from-coarse-to-fine approach, the modelbased stereo processing was able to produce highly reliable topographic products. As these datasets are obtained from different sensors and have various characteristics, there will be additional benefits if multiple topographic products can be analyzed and/or exploited simultaneously. For example, as the CTX DTM and ortho-image can be adjusted to <b>make</b> <b>seamless</b> mosaic with HRSC topographic data, CTX stereo products provided a great opportunity for scientists to observe 3 D topography over more extensive area. In addition, the finest processing with HiRISE data produced even submeter level topographic products in which unprecedented detailed geomorphic characteristics were shown, and the highly accurate quantitative geological interpretation can be performed accordingly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Green Computing and Cloud Computing is one newly {{hot point}} {{in the area of}} {{research}} and application. Currently, the research and application associated with the Cloud Computing are mainly concentrated in Educational Information Management System (EMIS). In this paper, we proposed the model of the educational information system resources integration based on private cloud green. This finding is from the principles and characteristics of the cloud computing and the improved traditional virtualization technology. In this context of meeting the maximum reusability about the original system and reducing the costs of secondary development, we can <b>make</b> <b>seamless</b> integration and on-demand call among the heterogeneous, remote and different platforms and the tight coupling multi-EMISs in one "system". So that, we make the sharing of information among which is difficult to interact with each other in the "information island " and even integrate a variety of underlying independent hardware into a unified whole. Finally, this model can change according to demands and intelligently adjust the integrated hardware resources, achieving the better balance between effectiveness and resources, energy saving and basically meeting the needs of the data sharing. ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMost tubes have seams (intercellular or autocellular {{junctions}} that seal membranes {{together into}} a tube), but “seamless” tubes also exist [1 – 3]. In Drosophila, stellate-shaped tracheal terminal cells <b>make</b> <b>seamless</b> tubes, with single branches running through each of dozens of cellular extensions. We find that mutations in braided impair terminal cell branching and cause formation of seamless tube cysts. We show that braided encodes Syntaxin 7 and that cysts also form in cells deficient for other genes required either for membrane scission (shibire) or for early endosome formation (Rab 5, Vps 45, and Rabenosyn- 5). These data define a requirement for early endocytosis in shaping seamless tube lumens. Importantly, apical proteins Crumbs and phospho-Moesin accumulate to aberrantly high levels in braided terminal cells. Overexpression of either Crumbs or phosphomimetic Moesin induced lumenal cysts and decreased terminal branching. Conversely, the braided seamless tube cyst phenotype was suppressed by mutations in crumbs or Moesin. Indeed, mutations in Moesin dominantly suppressed seamless tube cyst formation and restored terminal branching. We propose that early endocytosis maintains normal steady-state levels of Crumbs, which recruits apical phosphorylated (active) Moe, which in turn regulates seamless tube shape through modulation of cortical actin filaments...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{seamless}} customer identification (SCI), a {{means to}} identify physically present customers without any effort on customers ’ part beyond a one-time opt-in. With SCI, customers need not present cards or operate smartphones to convey their identities. So, stores can provide personalized shopping experiences at any time, not just at check-out. SCI uses two complementary technologies: device detection and face recognition. Device detection identifies customers by detecting their phones through low-power wireless discovery, in our case using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Face recognition recognizes customers by matching pictures captured during registration with images captured by a store camera. Device detection makes face recognition feasible by {{limiting the number of}} potential customers, while face recognition provides directional information that device detection lacks. Together, these technologies provide an ordering of likely candidates to a store employee, who makes the final determination of identity. We have designed and built SCI, and demonstrated its usefulness in an application called Zero-Effort Payments (ZEP). ZEP uses SCI to let customers effortlessly make small purchases at a coffee stand. We conducted two real-world deployments of ZEP on actual customers: a two-day deployment during a technology fair and a four-month deployment in our building. Across both deployments, 274 customers made 705 purchases using ZEP. Through these deployments and other experiments, we demonstrate how our techniques <b>make</b> <b>seamless</b> customer identification feasible and practical. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{success story}} of open source {{software}} (OSS) makes us see very clearly that in a networked world, centralized production of information {{is not the only}} viable model. It is now largely understood that distributed production can often equal and surpass it, both in quality and quantity. This has led people in all disciplines to rethink their relationship with information, giving birth to a plethora of initiatives generating value by promoting the mass collaboration of individuals over shared sets of information. Based on rich Internet applications, wikis, social tagging or social networking technologies, these initiatives gave birth to a revolution that has been dubbed Web 2. 0.
