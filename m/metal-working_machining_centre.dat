In 1851, Robbins and Lawrence traveled to London to demonstrate their rifles at the Great Exhibition, held in London’s Crystal Palace. The rifles were made in Windsor using interchangeable parts. They won a medal and so impressed the British Army that they placed an order for 25,000 rifles [...] for the Crimean War and also ordered 141 of the Robbins & Lawrence <b>metal-working</b> <b>machines</b> making the firm the first large-scale exporter of machine tools. Thus began the “American System” for producing interchangeable parts which accelerated the development of the precision tool-making industry that followed rapidly.|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{building}} {{may have been}} considered fire-proof, [...] "the contents were not." [...] An {{early part of the}} conflagration was a storage room used for rejected models, which may have totalled approximately 20,000 in number. While the patent office could loan those out to museums and other organizations, the increase in litigation made their preservation important and militated against such transfers. Contemporaneous reports state that in all between 65,000 and 80,000 models were damaged. These models included <b>metal-working</b> <b>machines,</b> wood-working machines, agricultural implements, carriages, wagons, railroading, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic engineering. A model of the original Eli Whitney cotton gin was among the models destroyed. In the south and west wings of the Patent Office there were some 100,000 models that were not damaged. Reports of the time show about two-fifths of all the models were damaged either by fire or water. An estimated 200,000 drawings were hastily carried out of {{the building}} before they were damaged.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{availability}} and productivity of manufacturing systems, process monitoring has become an important matter in modern automated plants. The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are insufficient, especially for manufacturing processes of highly complicated and automated systems. Instead, multi-sensor based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multi-sensor based process monitoring system for an existing <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The general structure of the monitoring system and {{the implementation of the}} main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail...|$|R

40|$|International audienceKey {{performances}} of industrial {{systems can be}} characterised by performances both related to the system itself but also the product/service it is delivering. It can be particularised in the manufacturing domain, by the performances related to the part manufactured (e. g. dimensional deviation, surface roughness) and to the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> (e. g. productivity, availability). The mastering of {{these two types of}} performances is nowadays mostly considerate separately, in the sense that current approaches lead to control product or machine performances mainly in an isolated way. Only few approaches try to take them into account jointly to permit to control {{performances of}} one thanks to the control of performances of the other and this all along the time. Thus a challenge in manufacturing {{is to be able to}} control part deviations from the mastering of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> degradation. In that way, this paper is first proposing a review on current approaches able to support these two performance considerations and then to investigate scientifically, in the frame of automotive sector, a specific approach able to control part performances directly from <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a simulation study of a typical flexible manufacturing system (FMS) that has routing flexibility. The objective in this study is to test the effectiveness of the modified dissimilarity maximization method (modified DMM) for real time FMS scheduling. modified DMM method is an improvement of the DMM method. Modified DMM method is an alternative process plan selection method developed for routing selection in real time FMS scheduling. A computer simulation model, which mimics a physical system, is used to evaluate the effect of DMM and Modified DMM rules on the system performance. The typical FMS employed in this study includes seven <b>machining</b> <b>centres,</b> a loading and unloading area, and six different part types. The part type has alternative routings because of the existence of identical <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> in the system. The DMM and Modified DMM are used for selecting an incoming part and later routing it to a <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> for its next operation. The result show that the Modified DMM outperforms DMM on system throughput in saturation case, increases utilization of the machines and increases utilization of the handling system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{small and}} medium batch series {{manufacturing}} the small tool and workpiece changing time {{is one of}} the main objectives to follow in obtaining high productivity. These auxiliary times are defined as the times consumed with preparing and changing the next tool or workpiece to follow the machining process, times that usually overlap the machining process. For this purpose <b>machining</b> <b>centres</b> are equipped with an automatic tool changer system and an automatic pallet changer system. The palletizing systems imply eliminating the times consumed with the alignment, fixing and clamping of the workpieces, these systems consisting of several mechanisms: the pallet, the automatic pallet changing mechanism, the positioning mechanism and the pallet clamp/unclamp mechanism. In this paper we present an general overview of the automatic pallet changing mechanisms used both in flexible manufacturing systems and <b>machining</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R
