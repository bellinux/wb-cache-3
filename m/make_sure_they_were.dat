5|$|Trapper Nelson {{was born}} Vincent Nostokovich (or Natulkiewicz) to Polish {{immigrant}} parents in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1908 or 1909. As a boy, {{to earn money}} he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey. His parents did not speak English, so Nelson would often assist them in translating to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not taken advantage of. However, when his mother died and his father remarried, Nelson ran away from home, heading west.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E
25|$|Whilst commoners {{could not}} wear finer clothes than nobles did, the nobility had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not better dressed than the King and his family. In 1528 a royal decree decided that no noble could own {{more than three}} clothes of silk. No ladies or maids could wear broad bonnets. Pearls in {{textiles}} as well as textiles containing gold were reserved for royal persons.|$|E

25|$|The bomber {{carrying}} the missile was modified {{with an additional}} antenna and equipment at the bombardier's position needed to guide the RASCAL. During the flight to the launch point, the bombardier transferred wind and navigation data periodically to the missile. Prior to launch the bombardier tuned a video relay receiver, altitude phasing, and adjusted the terminal guidance tracking indicator. Missile control surfaces were also checked to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> functional.|$|E
25|$|Francia outlawed all opposition, and {{established}} a secret police force. His underground prison {{was known as the}} 'chamber of truth', and most of Paraguay's manufactures were made with prison labour. He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a banquillo ("stool") under an orange tree outside his window. So as not to waste bullets, most victims were bayoneted, while their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also {{won the right to}} be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E

25|$|Oral tales, not {{recorded}} until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dead {{and not simply}} shamming. His wife defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered {{and may have been}} violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than general. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, not a bad one as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship {{was at the heart of}} colonial society, but this concept was precisely what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.|$|E
500|$|Around 500 tribbles {{were created}} for the episode, with special tribbles created for certain {{purposes}} with beanbags or surgical balloons inserted in them. Three additional sets were {{created for the}} episode, although there were problems with finding enough matching chairs for the trading post area. The chairs had to be pulled out of showrooms around Los Angeles County, and Pevney was warned to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not damaged during the episode's brawl scene. William Campbell had previously appeared as Trelane in [...] "The Squire of Gothos" [...] and {{was intended to be}} a recurring villain as Koloth. Because of his other work commitments, these plans were not followed up on until he returned as Koloth in the [...] episode [...] "" [...] in 1994. William Schallert appeared as Nilz Baris, and later appeared as a Bajoran in the DS9 episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|An early {{draft of}} the episode {{originally}} featured an Opera house explosion, which was changed because the writers felt using a dam would be more exciting. An early rule of Sideshow Bob episodes was to recap what had gone on in previous Bob episodes, in case the viewer had forgotten who he was. The original script was run by the Frasier producers to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> okay with it, and they only had one problem. There was a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character and refers to her as [...] "Maris", who in Frasier is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier said the scene should go. The writers {{spent a long time}} trying to figure out a civilization that considered chief hydrological engineer a true calling and chose the Cappadocians, who were famous for underground cities although not specifically dams.|$|E

500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is {{as soon as you}} put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|Marcus {{was born}} in The Cedars, Dallas, Texas, the son of Herbert Marcus, Sr., who later became a co-founder of the {{original}} Neiman-Marcus store with his sister Carrie and her husband, Al Neiman. Stanley {{was the first of}} four sons born to Herbert, Sr., and his wife, the former Minnie Lichtenstein. The pregnancy indirectly led to the eventual founding of Neiman-Marcus, as Herbert Sr. decided to leave Sanger's, where he was a buyer of boys' clothing, when he deemed his raise insufficient to support a family. Returning from two years spent in Atlanta, Georgia, establishing a successful sales-promotion business, the Marcuses and Neimans used the $25,000 made in the sale of that business to establish their store at the corner of Elm and Murphy. Given that the family's other option for the money was to invest in the then-unknown Coca-Cola Company, Marcus loved to say that Neiman-Marcus was established [...] "as a result of the bad judgment of its founders." [...] In his memoir, Marcus recalled his father as [...] "affectionate" [...] and his mother as even-handed in her attention to each of their children, making sure even into their adulthood to give them equivalent gifts and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> praised equally.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted male models Brad Alphonso, Jon Kortajarena, Rob Evans, Sean O'Pry and Simon Nessman. In the video, Madonna {{sported a}} {{brassiere}} designed by Agent Provocateur. The singer's stilettos, which were custom-made by footwear designer Paola Bay, consisted of black silk embroidered with silver threading. [...] "She wanted them {{as high as}} possible {{and to be able}} to dance with them on," [...] stated Bay. [...] "We did three fittings to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> like second skin." [...] Arianne Phillips, dress designer for the video, recalled that she had to create custom-made high-heeled stilettos for Kazaky, because of unavailability of shoes in their size. Artur Gaspar from the band recalled that [...] "By the end of the day on set, our feet were bleeding and we had blisters... But if Madonna can repeat the dancing for the 50th time, why can't we?" [...] Phillips explained that they had created three different looks for Madonna in the video. The first was called a [...] "super vixen" [...] look for which she created short tops that could be worn as brassiere. Hairstylist Andy Lecompte wanted to go for a 1960s style with it. The second look portrayed was called [...] "rockstar" [...] for which designer Michael Smith created T-shirts out of metal mesh, while Lecompte cut the singer's hair short, so that it would resemble her early look. The final look was called the [...] "platinum bombshell", and was inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

500|$|Following the events, {{as well as}} {{the release}} of Carey's {{succeeding}} album, Charmbracelet (2002), she began working on new material for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Aside from the dance-influenced tracks and the ballads, Carey created a concept, in which a song's lyrics would reach out to God. She created the song's choral lyrics, melody and main instrumentation, before calling James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright for a collaboration. During their meeting, Wright helped Carey arrange the song's chord structure, as well as produce the introduction, while Carey finished the rest of the lyrics. Once completing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey had her pastor, Clarence Keaton, read two verses from the Bible on the song, [...] "Weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning" [...] during the introduction, and [...] "He said 'He'll never forsake you, or leave you alone' Trust him". According to Carey, the song, {{as well as the}} Biblical verses, were included on her [...] "comeback album" [...] because they helped her get through many difficult situations in the past. She described moments that were difficult growing up, during which she reached out to God, as well as during her breakdown, when she used such verses to give her faith. Carey explained how although the verses helped her greatly, no one had ever said them to her. For this reason, she wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there for fans and listeners to hear, in order to give them faith and assurance lest they be in a grave situation.|$|E
500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used {{to play the game}} during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You {{have to know how to}} hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E
2500|$|The lower [...] "B" [...] Deck {{contained}} washrooms, a {{mess hall}} for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Harold G. Dick, an American {{representative from the}} Goodyear Zeppelin Company, recalled [...] "The only entrance to the smoking room, which was pressurized to prevent the admission of any leaking hydrogen, was via the bar, which had a swiveling air lock door, and all departing passengers were scrutinized by the bar steward to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not carrying out a lit cigarette or pipe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unnamed Intelligence {{officers}} personally {{acquainted with}} Jackson {{stated that he}} was a psychopath who would often dress up and attend the funerals of his victims because he felt a need [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dead." [...] Described as a sardonic man who was extremely dedicated; physically he was dark-haired, blue-eyed, [...] "small, but firmly-built". Suspicious by nature, he repeatedly advised his associates that they should never reveal secret information to anyone. His paranoia and fear of recognition by his potential victims was such that he attempted to destroy all photographs of himself including school and family pictures.|$|E
2500|$|According to Daily NK, {{anyone who}} did not {{participate}} in the organised mourning sessions or did not seem genuine enough in their sorrow has been sentenced to at least six months in a labour camp. [...] Mourners were also barred from wearing hats, gloves or scarves even though the temperature that day was —presumably so authorities could check to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> displaying sufficient grief. [...] North Korea angrily denied this accusation, blaming it on [...] "reptile media" [...] in the pay of the South Korean government. A photo slideshow from The Los Angeles Times does show multiple mourners with gloves and scarves.|$|E
2500|$|Barry Lynn, {{an ordained}} UCC {{minister}} and {{the executive director of}} Americans United for Separation of Church and State, stated that although he personally would not have invited a Presidential candidate to speak at the meetings, he believed [...] "the Internal Revenue Service permits this to happen." [...] The church had consulted lawyers prior to the event to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> following the law and had instructed those in attendance that no Obama campaign material would be allowed in the meeting.
