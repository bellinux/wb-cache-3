40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} and compared urethral pressure measurements using air charged and <b>microtip</b> catheters in a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 64 women referred for urodynamic investigation underwent sequential urethral pressure measurements using an air charged and a <b>microtip</b> catheter in randomized order. Patients were blinded {{to the type}} and sequence of catheter used. Agreement between the 2 catheter systems was assessed using the Bland and Altman 95 % limits of agreement method. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients of air charged and <b>microtip</b> catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest were 0. 97 and 0. 93, and for functional profile length they were 0. 9 and 0. 78, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients and Lin's concordance coefficients of air charged and <b>microtip</b> catheters were r = 0. 82 and rho = 0. 79 for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest, and r = 0. 73 and rho = 0. 7 for functional profile length, respectively. When applying the Bland and Altman method, air charged catheters gave higher readings than <b>microtip</b> catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (mean difference 7. 5 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (mean difference 1. 8 mm). There were wide 95 % limits of agreement for differences in maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (- 24. 1 to 39 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (- 7. 7 to 11. 3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: For urethral pressure measurement the air charged catheter {{is at least as}} reliable as the <b>microtip</b> catheter and it generally gives higher readings.

As such, it is an initial step in molecular diagnostics, forensics, pharmacogenomics, and many other genetic analysis based disciplines. Current commercial solutions employ microfilters, centrifugation, or magnetic beads to extract DNA. Recently, silicon microtips have shown equivalent yield to the aforementioned methods, while using fewer reagents and shorter processing time. The working principle of the <b>microtip</b> system relies on dielectrophoretic force and capillary action to concentrate and bind DNA to the <b>microtip</b> surface. There remain two challenges associated with the <b>microtip</b> method: (1) increase efficacy of the process {{in the presence of}} a high concentration of inhibitors, such as in blood and (2) improve stability of the <b>microtip</b> surface chemistry during storage. In this thesis, we investigate a polymer film of Polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a potential surface layer to address these challenges.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Point-of-care(POC) {{diagnosis}} of tuberculosis (TB), {{one of the}} most widely spread diseases in the globe today, has been critically demanded over a century. To date, many diagnostic methods have been developed for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); polymerase chain reaction latex agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, radiometric detection, genprobe amplified MTB direct test, TB rapid cultivation detection technique, and flowcytometry. The methods are more sensitive and rapid than the traditional microbial culture-based methods; however, the performance should be further improved. In addition, due to the large volumes and the low analyte concentration of actual sputum samples, a cumbersome concentration step is required. Currently available concentration methods employ centrifugation, microfiltration, or magnetic beads. However, the methods are limited in cumbersome preparation steps, low yield, and low throughput. To address the challenges, microtip- and nanotip immunosensors are studied for fluorescence- and electrical measurements, respectively. For a <b>microtip</b> immunofluorescence sensor, concentration mechanisms based on flow circulation and electric field are combined at different scales to concentrate target bacteria in 1 mL sputum samples onto the surfaces of microscale tips. Genus-specific antibodies are immobilized on the <b>microtip</b> surface for specific capturing. Experimentally, the concentration mechanism is studied. Then, the performance of conentration mechanism is validated by using an immunofluorescence. To understand specific capturing mechanism of target bacteria on a <b>microtip</b> surface, the bacterial behavior on the <b>microtip</b> surface during evaporation is investigated as a function of the substrate properties, liquid composition, and environmental conditions. The novel concentration mechanism using a <b>microtip</b> can detect MTB complex cells in sputum within 25 minutes. The detection limit in sputum is 200 CFU/mL with a success rate of 96 %, which is comparable to PCR. The presented <b>microtip</b> based immunosensor shows great potential for POC diagnostic tool. For simpler POC diagnosis, an electrical detection method using a dendritic nanotip is presented. The dendritic nanotip is composed of SWCNTs and Si nanowires, which is designed to maximize the surface area for high sensitivity. Upon the binding of target cells on to SWCNTs of a nanotip, the gating effect is induced to increase the resistance of the sensor system. The working principles are studied for each binding layer by cyclic voltammetry. A SWCNT-based dendritic nanotip is utilized to concentrate target bacteria by using an electric field and capillary effect. The captured targets on the nanotip are detected by measuring the resistance change in deionized water. The detection results are verified by fluorescence- and scanning electron microscopes. In the experimental results, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) cells strain of Mycobacterium bovis can be detected within 15 minutes using both electrical and fluorescent detection. The sensitivity is 1, 000 CFU/mL for both methods. As a future plan, the surface phenomena for specific detection of target bacteria will be studied to understand the specific capturing mechanism on <b>microtip</b> surface. The detection mechanism using a nanotip will be studied further to clarify the detection mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 DNA sample {{preparation}} {{is essential for}} genetic analysis. However, rapid and easy-to-use methods are a major challenge to obtaining genetic information. Furthermore, DNA {{sample preparation}} technology must follow the growing need for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The current use of centrifuges, large robots, and laboratory-intensive protocols has to be minimized to meet the global challenge of limited access healthcare by bringing the lab to patients through POC devices. To address these challenges, a novel extraction method of genomic DNA from human samples is presented by using heat-cured polyethyleneimine-coated microtips generating a high electric field. The <b>microtip</b> extraction method is based on recent work using an electric field and capillary action integrated into an automated device. The main challenges to the method are: (1) to obtain a stable <b>microtip</b> surface for the controlled capture and release of DNA and (2) to improve the recovery of DNA from samples with {{a high concentration of}} inhibitors, such as human samples. The present study addresses these challenges by investigating the heat curing of polyethyleneimine (PEI) coated {{on the surface of the}} <b>microtip.</b> Heat-cured PEI-coated microtips are shown to control the capture and release of DNA. Protocols are developed for the extraction and purification of DNA from human samples. Heat-cured PEI-coated <b>microtip</b> methods of DNA sample preparation are used to extract genomic DNA from human samples. It is discovered through experiment that heat curing of a PEI layer on a gold-coated surface below 150 °C could inhibit the signal of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Below 150 °C, the PEI layer is not completely cured and dissolved off the gold-coated surface. Dissolved PEI binds with DNA to inhibit PCR. Heat curing of a PEI layer above 150 °C on a gold-coated surface prevents inhibition to PCR and gel electrophoresis. In comparison to gold-coated microtips, the 225 °C-cured PEI-coated microtips improve the recovery of DNA to 45 % efficiency. Furthermore, the 225 °C-cured PEI-coated microtips recover more DNA than gold-coated microtips when the surface is washed. Heat-cured (225 °C) PEI-coated microtips are used for the recovery of human genomic DNA from whole blood. A washing protocol is developed to remove inhibiting particles bound to the PEI-coated <b>microtip</b> surface after DNA extraction. From 1. 25 μL of whole blood, an average of 1. 83 ng of human genomic DNA is captured, purified, and released using a 225 °C-cured PEI-coated <b>microtip</b> in less than 30 minutes. The extracted DNA is profiled by short tandem repeat analysis (STR). For forensic and medical applications, genomic DNA is extracted from dried samples using heat-cured PEI-coated microtips that are integrated into an automated device. DNA extraction from dried samples is critical for forensics. The use of dried samples in the medical field is increasing because dried samples are convenient for storage, biosafety, and contamination. The main challenge is the time required to properly extract DNA in a purified form. Typically, a 1 hour incubation period is required to complete this process. Overnight incubation is sometimes necessary. To address this challenge, a pre-extraction washing step is investigated to remove inhibiting particles from dried blood spots (DBS) before DNA is released from dried form into solution for <b>microtip</b> extraction. The developed protocol is expanded to extract DNA from a variety of dried samples including nasal swabs, buccal swabs, and other forensic samples. In comparison to a commercial kit, the microtip-based extraction reduced the processing time from 1. 5 hours to 30 minutes or less with an equivalent concentration of extracted DNA from dried blood spots. The developed assay will benefit genetic studies on newborn screening, forensic investigation, and POC diagnostics...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{alarming}} {{increase of}} {{multi-drug resistant tuberculosis}} (MDR-TB) has become a serious issue, especially with TB affecting {{nearly a third of}} the global population and claiming over a million lives each year. Drug resistance emerges from gene mutations and improper treatment regimens of the drug-susceptible patients, which is transmitted to others when left undetected and untreated. Testing every patient for drug-resistance would be ideal; however, the additional time and resources available for current supplementary tests for drug-resistance are severely limited. The main challenge of drug susceptibility testing is in discovering a simple and inexpensive method. Drug-susceptibility tests can be differentiated into two categories of phenotypic or genotypic methods. Genotypic methods such as INNO-LiPA Rif, GenoType MTBDR, and Gene Xpert MTB/RIF are very rapid with high sensitivity and specificity, but suffer from the trade-off of high cost, power supply, and requirement of skilled trained personnel. It is also challenging in that the target drug-resistance sequences should be identified prior to running the tests. Phenotypic drug-susceptibility tests such as MGIT, NRA, and MODS are based on detection of bacterial growth in the presence of antibiotics. Although very reliable and mostly cheap, it requires trained personnel and relatively slow, taking weeks for results. Thus low-cost yet rapid identification of patients with MDR-TB is crucial for increasing chances of survival and controlling the possibility of transmission. To address the need for a low-cost and direct detection of TB, we developed a sputum sample preparation protocol and a point-of-care TB diagnostic device based on the previous <b>microtip</b> platform. The newly developed sputum protocol was biosafe while retaining the integrity of the antigens so that it can be used in BSL 1 and 2 labs. The biosafe sputum samples were used in the <b>microtip</b> immunofluorescence sensor, where it combines fluid flow circulation and an AC electric field to concentrate target cells in a 1 mL volume to the <b>microtip</b> surface. The surface of the <b>microtip</b> was decorated with IgY antibodies specific to Mycobacterium to capture these cells. Once captured, the <b>microtip</b> sensor was labeled and washed for immunofluorescent detection. The device was automated from the beginning of cell capture to the washing of the fluorescent antibodies to minimize operational errors and manual labor. The automated immunofluorescent <b>microtip</b> sensor takes 30 minutes for detection with a detection limit of 100 CFU/mL. To study electrokinetic effects of viable and non-viable Mycobacterium cells, control and heat-killed Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) cells were tested on planar electrodes with frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 10 MHz to determine if the <b>microtip</b> assay will be capable of being implemented as a drug-susceptibility test. Electrophysiology of cells changes upon cell death, especially when the cell wall and membrane is compromised, changing the electric properties. By analyzing the AC electroosmotic and dielectrophoreic forces, the frequency of 5 MHz was chosen to differentiate viable and non-viable BCG. At the chosen frequency, BCG cells treated with temperatures of 50 ºC ~ 80 ºC were tested to determine the temperature influence on cell integrity. A transition temperature to differentiate viable and non-viable BCG cells was found to be 60 ºC by dielectrophoresis (DEP). Over the transition temperature the lipid cell wall becomes more permeable, which reduces the DEP force the cell experiences. Heat-killed cells treated at 85 ºC were shown to be able to be differentiated from control. The cells were further analyzed by characterizing their dielectric properties by matching the experimental crossover frequencies at various medium conductivities. This showed heat-killing decreased the cell envelope capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity, which was shown to be deformed under SEM. To study drug-effects on DEP, first line TB drugs of rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) were used to treat BCG cells and compared with untreated BCG cells on planar electrodes. RIF and INH were chosen due to their significance in treatment of TB and their different treatment mechanism. RIF inhibits RNA transcription with no direct interaction with the cell wall whereas the INH inhibits synthesis of mycolic acids in the cell wall structure. Frequency of 5 MHz was employed to differentiate drug-treated and non-treated BCG cells. Cell count of attracted cells showed RIF with similar responses to control, whereas INH-treated cells could be differentiated by the 4 th day. RIF-treated cells are only differentiated from control by comparing the aggregation and clusters of cells measuring the fluorescence intensity. Properties of drug-treated cells were also characterized by matching the crossover frequencies at various medium conductivities. RIF-treated cells showed partial change in the cytoplasm conductivity, while INH-treated cells showed the largest change in the cell envelope capacitance as well as the cytoplasm conductivity. The DEP response correlated with the expected drug mechanism of the administered antibiotic.

It is shown that for some particular geometries it is possible to get a significant reduction of the angular width of the emitted beam. We discuss in more detail the electron emission from plane emitting sources, and show that they are particulary well suited to focus the emitted beam. Such electron sources might be very suitable for performing electron holography and interferometry in the reflection mode. Experiments are proposed to test our findings. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} for, gated silicon field emitter arrays {{fabrication}} is presented. The fabrication process {{is based on}} the photoelectrochemical silicon etching in HF electrolyte solution, a well known technique for macropore array formation. For the first time, we have successfully used this technique to produce very regular silicon <b>microtips</b> array with high aspect ratio (tip height/tip width ratio). The process is able to fabricate field emitter array with self-aligned chromium metal gate using only one mask...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a relatively simple}} method to fabricate field-emitter arrays from silicon substrates. These devices are obtained from silicon micromachining {{by means of the}} HI-PS technique-a combination of hydrogen ion implantation and porous silicon used as sacrificial layer. Also, a new process sequence is proposed and implemented to fabricate self-aligned integrated field-emission devices based on this technique. Electrical characteristics of the <b>microtips</b> obtained show good agreement with the Fowler-Nordheim theory, which are suitable for the proposed application.

30|$|Inadvertent {{ureteric}} catheterisation {{has been}} reported in the past in conjunction with <b>microtip</b> catheters during cystometry [2 – 4], during routine catheterization with a Foley's catheter in a case of a paraplegic patient [5], {{and in the case of}} long-term catheterisation of a fibrotic bladder [6]. Alternatively, similar cases have been reported during retropubic suspension [7] and as the result of suprapubic catheter insertion [8]. Such a complication may be associated with postoperative anatomical changes. [6].|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{findings}} are presented of an in vivo comparison between a Sentron catheter and another tip transducer manometer: a Millar <b>microtip</b> catheter. Both catheters {{have been used}} simultaneously in the left ventricle of dogs. Pressure variations were elicited by drug infusion. Pressure values and derivatives obtained from both systems were compared. A cross correlation between episodes of the two pressures was computed. Results from this study showed good correlation between left ventricular systolic pressure measured with both manometers (R = 0. 992, p < 0. 0001), end-diastolic pressure (R = 0. 809, p < 0. 0001) and between first derivatives: positive derivative (R = 0. 993, p < 0. 0001) and negative (R = 0. 634, p < 0. 0001). The mean cross correlation between both pressure signals was 0. 61 +/- 0. 04. In the frequency domain no statistical difference {{was found between the}} location of the maxima of the peaks. It is concluded that a Sentron manometer can be a valid alternative, at a reasonable price, to a cheaper, though less accurate fluid filled catheter and a more expensive 'golden standard' <b>microtip</b> catheter. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new way to observe the surface domain {{distribution}} of a magnetic sample at a submicrometer scale. This magnetic microscopy is based on the idea of measuring magnetic forces with the recently developed atomic force microscope (AFM). We study the magnetic forces involved in the interaction between a single-domain <b>microtip</b> and the sample surface magnetic domains. The influence of the experimental conditions on the performance of the AFM as a magnetic profiling device is also discussed. Preliminary experimental results are reported...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a facile single step fabrication method of complex 3 D microstructures like <b>microtips,</b> microlenses, microtrapezoids, etc. with controlled dimensions {{which has been}} the main focus of researchers over the decades. Each type of above mentioned microstructures individually requires a large number of expensive and complex fabrication processes e. g. plasma RIE, stereo lithography, UV micro stamping and so on. In this study, we have proposed a simple, convenient, cost effective and commercially applicable one step dual diffuser lithography (DDL) method for the fabrication of such complex 3 D microstructures by adding a pair of diffusers in conventional photolithography, which diffused the incident beam of ultraviolet (UV) light at wide angles. A conventionally used positive photoresist AZP 4620 was exposed to the diffused light at various exposure energies and the effect of change in exposure energy on the fabricated patterns was studied. Patterns with sub-micron dimensions and <b>microtips</b> with similar to 200 nm tip size were also fabricated using the proposed DDL process. The morphology of the fabricated patterns was analyzed using the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images and 3 -dimensional (3 D) profiler data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|High aspect-ratio {{single-crystal}} silicon nücrotips have been fabriCated using the semi-anisotropic dry etching technique. After the further oxidation sharpening process, arrays of 50 X 50 uniform sharp emitter tips has been achieved. The 200 A-thick Cr metal was also coated {{on the surface}} of Si <b>microtips</b> to improve the performance. Furthermore, a modified self-aligned process of the gated field emitter arrays (GFETs) has been successfully developed to reduce the fabrication complexity. Employing this method, the tip radius of Si microemitter is about 200 A, and the gate aperture can be easily reduced to about 0. 3 p. m. It will largely decrease the turn-on voltage ofthe field emission devices...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical etching {{of silicon}} in {{hydrofluoric}} acid (HF) solution is {{employed as a}} micromachining technique. It is demonstrated that the commonly accepted geometric constraints on the shape of electrochemically etched silicon structures can be significantly relaxed. Several new structures etched on the same n-doped silicon wafer are reported. The fabricated structures include wall arrays, hole arrays, meander-shaped structures, spiral-like walls, microtubes, micropillars, <b>microtips</b> and more. A simple model for the electrochemical etch process, which describes {{the effect of the}} dimension of the initial seed, the current density, and also the KOH etching time of the initial pattern on the final geometries, is detailed.
