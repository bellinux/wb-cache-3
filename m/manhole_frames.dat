5000|$|The bearing {{surfaces}} of <b>manhole</b> <b>frames</b> and covers are machined to assure flatness and {{prevent them from}} becoming dislodged by traffic. Round castings are much easier to machine using a lathe.|$|E
50|$|EJ's main {{manufacturing}} facility, {{corporate headquarters}} and hydrant & valve assembly lines {{are located in}} East Jordan. The foundry production facility in Ardmore also provides numerous castings for EJ sales operations. EJ is a producer and supplier of construction castings to hundreds of U.S. cities, townships, counties, and states. The EJ product line includes <b>manhole</b> <b>frames</b> and manhole covers, utility castings for the telecommunications industry, trench grates, tree grates, detectable warning plates, airport and design specific castings, monument boxes, meter boxes, valve boxes, drainage grates, curb inlets, and catch basins. EJ construction castings {{can be found in}} major metropolitan areas, as well as world-wide.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to characterise and refine the physical properties of glass fibre reinforced polyester polymer concrete. This material is currently being employed by AV Mouldings (Pty) Ltd. to manufacture manhole and drain components according to specifications existing for cast iron covers. No specification exists for polymer concrete. In particular {{it has been found}} that there is a large market for Type 2 A replacement <b>manhole</b> covers and <b>frames</b> due to the current problem in South Africa of the cast iron versions being stolen and sold for scrap metal. It has been found that polymer concrete covers manufactured to replace stolen cast iron covers (in existing cast iron frames) fail occasionally in service. The investigation thus focuses on the characterisation of glass fibre reinforced polymer concrete and analysis of the current standards with a view to establishing a new South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) specification for polymer concrete manhole components. The main testing procedure involved flexural testing of beam specimens. Preliminary tests were carried out to measure strength, toughness, strain rate sensitivity, and the effect of different reinforcing materials. Accelerated degradation tests were then conducted to establish the materials resistance to UV radiation, acids, alkalis, and various solvents. Different resins were evaluated, and experiments were conducted using graded aggregates, in an attempt {{to reduce the number of}} voids in the material. Vibratory moulding techniques and postcuring methods were also evaluated. The viability of employing silane coupling agents in polymer concrete was investigated in detail towards the end of the research. Redesign of the Type 2 A replacement cover was then undertaken...|$|R
