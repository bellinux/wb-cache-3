40|$|<b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis,</b> a <b>turkey</b> pathogen, can be {{detected}} by PCR directly from tracheal or genital swabs. However, up to 40 % samples may contain inhibitory substances.

This IC can easily be distinguished from the M. meleagridis amplicon after agarose gel electrophoresis since it is longer. Use of this IC in PCR amplifications revealed that more than 35 % of turkey tracheal swabs and more than 45 % of turkey cloacal swabs contained inhibitors. In most cases, dilution (1 : 100) of swab lysates allowed amplification of the internal control but DNA purification may be necessary to eliminate inhibitors (20 % of tracheal swabs and 5 % of cloacal swabs).

This assay was based on two mouse monoclonal antibodies recognising all MM strains tested but none of seven avian mycoplasmal species tested. Furthermore, their binding to the Tween 20 antigen was inhibited by serum from MM-infected birds. The B-ELISA test format was optimized. The cut-off was determined using a set of sera from MM-free turkeys. This B-ELISA was then compared with a commercial indirect ELISA (I-ELISA). Specificities of the two ELISA tests {{were not significantly different}} (100 or 99 %, respectively). The sensitivity of B-ELISA was significantly higher than the I-ELISA when I-ELISA suspicious results were considered as negative. Testing sera from experimentally MM-infected animals showed that serum plate agglutination (SPA) test detected positive birds before both ELISA methods. Samples were collected in MM-infected commercial flocks and analyzed by SPA, ELISAs, MM-PCR or culture. Results showed that the sensitivity of the B-ELISA appeared superior to the I-ELISA.

40|$|<b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> (MM) is a {{major cause}} of disease and {{economic}} loss in turkeys. Formerly it was thought that this species was very host specific and only restricted to turkey. In this study, we report on the recovery of MM from breeding flocks of chickens located near a turkey breeding unit. Ten MM field strains were isolated (by culture on Frey broth medium) from tracheal swabs of chickens displaying clinical signs of mycoplasmosis-essentially respiratory symptoms and poor performance. Assignment of the isolated field strains to MM was confirmed by a growth inhibition assay using MM-specific polyclonal antiserum and by PCR amplification targeting the 16 S rRNA sequence as well as the Mm 14 sequence, a MM-species-specific DNA fragment previously identified and characterized in our laboratory. The nucleotide sequence of Mm 14 proved to be highly conserved among the 10 MM field strains, indicating a common source of infection. However, on the basis of slight differences in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis whole-cell proteins and western blot profiles, two groups of the isolated MM field strains could be distinguished. Evidence of MM infection of chickens was further provided by serology, since 13. 77 % (35 / 254) of sera proved positive to MM by either rapid serum agglutination or recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, sera of all chickens from which MM was isolated were positive for antibodies to MM.

At slaughter, C psittaci, APV and ORT antibodies were detected in 94, 34 and 6. 5 % of the turkeys, respectively. No antibodies against M. gallisepticum or M. meleagridis were present. Additionally, turkeys on three Belgian farms were examined from production onset until slaughter using both serology and antigen or gene detection. All farms experienced two C. psittaci infection waves, at 3 - 6 and 8 - 12 weeks of age. Each first infection wave was closely followed by an ORT infection starting at the age of 6 - 8 weeks, which was still detectable when the second C. psittaci infection waves started. Animals on farm A were not vaccinated against APV leading to an APV subtype B outbreak accompanying the first C. psittaci infection wave. Despite subtype A APV vaccination on farms B and C, the second C. psittaci infection waves were accompanied (farm B) or followed (farm Q by a subtype B APV infection. On all farms respiratory signs always appeared together with a proven C psittaci, APV and/or ORT infection. This study suggests an association between C. psittaci, APV and ORT, and indicates the multi-factorial aetiology of respiratory infections in commercial turkeys.

Then, we combined the Escherichia coli-expressed products of MS 2 / 28, Mm 14, and pMGA 1. 2, to develop a recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (recELISA), for the simultaneous and specific detection of antibodies to the three aforementioned major avian mycoplasma species. For comparative purposes, a novel in-house crude antigen capture ELISA (capELISA) was developed in parallel. In the latter protocol, the microtiter wells were enriched in species-specific antigens by capturing sonicated crude antigens on coated rabbit polyclonal antibodies that had been extensively adsorbed with the whole antigen of the heterologous species. With regard to rapid serum agglutination, both ELISA tests were highly specific, and they showed a significant correlation when field sera from naturally infected birds were tested. recELISA proved to be highly specific because absorbance values, with the heterologous species, were significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than those obtained with capELISA. Given its cost-effectiveness and simplicity, the recombinant antigen-based ELISA seems to represent a valid tool for the specific screening {{of the three major}} avian mycoplasma species. recELISA will be particularly useful with regard to trade control because a large number of samples from various fields could be rapidly processed...|$|R

Furthermore, the pathogenicity of H. meleagridis was compared in a laying line and meat type chickens after experimental infection. Mortality was 0 % in both lines. However, the histopathological changes were more pronounced in the laying line. They included Infiltration of inflammatory cells in lamina propria and submucosa and detachment of the epithelium in the caecum at day 7 th p. i. The parasite and its DNA could be detected by histology and by PCR not only in the caecum and liver but also in heart, lung, spleen and kidneys. Several trials were carried out in vitro to determine the efficacy of Paromomycin-Sulfat against H. meleagridis. The results showed that the effectiveness of Paromomycin-Sulfat was influenced by the used dose of the drug, the H. meleagridis strain and the inoculation dose of the parasite. All tested concentrations (10, 20, 40 and 80 ppm) of Paromomycin- Sulfat showed an inhibitory effect on H. meleagridis from 1 day p. i [...] A complete lethality was obtained only by using 80 ppm Paromomycin-Sulfat. Finally, two different experiments were carried in vivo to determine the efficacy of Paromomycin-Sulfat after experimental infection of turkey poults with H. meleagridis. In the first experiment, administration of Gabbrovet® at a dose level of 100 mg/kg/day in drinking water 3 days before infection throughout 12 days after infection lead to significant reduction of the mortality. In all experimental groups a dose-response effect was seen. The mortality rate in group 100 mg/kg was 10 %. On the other hand the mortality rates in groups 50 mg/kg and in group 25 mg/kg were 23 % and 50 % respectively. Mortality in the untreated, infected group was 90 %. A marked reduction of lesions in caeca and livers of treated groups could be observed. The blood level of GOT, LDH, total protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and bile acids were measured 0, 7, 14, and 21 days p. i. in H. <b>meleagridis</b> infected <b>turkeys,</b> infected and Gabbrovet® 70 treated birds, and a non-infected, untreated control group. A decrease of the level of LDH, albumin, and cholinesterase and increased levels of the bile acids were observed in infected, untreated turkeys at 7 th days p. i., meanwhile the level of GOT and total protein remained unchanged. In the 100 mg/kg/day Gabbrovet® treated group, the blood values remained in the range of values of the uninfected group. In birds treated with lower doses, shifts in the blood level were observed on the 14 th day p. i. and thus one week later than in the untreated animals. In the 2 nd experiment HistoBloc®, a product based on Paromomycin-Sulfat, was administrated in the feed from day 1 till the end of experiment (day 42). The infection with H. meleagridis was done at the 21 st day of age. Mortality in infected, untreated group was 80 %. In contrast, the mortality was 73 % in the group that received feed with 100 ppm, 43 % in the group that received feed with 200 ppm, and 20 % in the group that received 400 ppm. A marked reduction of lesions in caeca and livers of treated groups could be observed...|$|R
