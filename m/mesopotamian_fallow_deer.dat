40|$|<b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> is {{an exotic}} species in Sweden; {{it was brought}} here in the 1570 s and has now {{established}} viable, wild populations in the southern parts of Sweden. Roe deer is native in Sweden {{and there is a}} concern that it is displaced by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> in areas where both species exists, as reported from other countries. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if there is an effect of competition at artificial feeding sites by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> on roe deer, more specific, to measure the use of feeding sites at different month and type of winters. In addition, by divide individuals into age classes and sex, also get a more precise measure of feeding site use. The data for this study consisted of GPS-positions from 31 roe <b>deer</b> and 50 <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> during six winter seasons (2006 - 2012). An individual within 50 m of the feeding station was counted as utilizing the feeding site. Both roe <b>deer</b> and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> increased feeding site use during a hard winter and decreased their use in a mild winter. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males used feeding sites more than roe <b>deer</b> and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females. The two species did use the feeding sites differently each month. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> used feeding sites more than roe deer in all months except for February and March. However, the high use by roe deer in February and March were driven by 6 females and 1 male. The feeding site use was not different among different age classes in roe deer. There was a trend that older <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males use feeding sites more than younger males. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females always used feeding sites less than <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males had three feeding activity peaks during a day and a long pause between each. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females on the other hand, did have a daily pattern that is more similar to the roe deer. This study conclude that <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> used feeding sites more than roe deer, but it did not detect any clear evidence of competition between the two species. However, the low use by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females could be an indication of intra-specific competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of inter-specific interactions in large herbivore assemblies is under debate. We have studied inter-specific interactions between roe and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> on pastures, {{to assess whether}} competition between these Cervidae occurs through behavioural interference. Roe were displaced by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (i. e. the former {{moved away from the}} latter at a distance of > 50 m) in 83 % of cases (N = 127). Ninety-four percentage (N = 83) of displacement events occurred while roe deer were feeding; in 50 % of these cases (N= 78), roe stopped grazing and left the feeding ground. Even when <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> did not show any sign of direct aggression to roe, these moved away from fallow in 72 % of cases (N= 127). Vigilance rate was significantly greater in roe than in <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> irrespectively of the presence of the other species. When roe and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> grazed within 50 m from each other, vigilance rate increased significantly in roe, but not in <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b> Roe deer, in a group, were significantly more tolerant of the presence of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (even in group), than when solitary. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> seemed to be able to exclude roe deer from feeding sites through behavioural intolerance...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{breeding}} populations of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were established in Roman Europe has been obscured by {{the possibility that the}} skeletal remains of the species, in particular Dama foot bones and antlers, were traded over long distances as objects in their own right. This paper sets out to refine our understanding of the evidence for the transportation of living and dead <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> in Iron Age and Roman Europe. To achieve this, museum archives containing purportedly early examples of Dama antler were searched, with available specimens sampled for carbon, nitrogen and strontium isotope analyses, and compared with data for archaeological <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> from across Europe. Importantly, the resulting isotope values can be interpreted in light of new modern baseline data for <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> presented here. Together these multi-isotope results for modern and archaeological <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> provide a more critical perspective on the transportation of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> and their body parts in antiquity...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} air temperature {{on the behavior of}} <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> in farm kept. The literature review presents <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> characterization; it gives an overview of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> management methods and describes the current situation in farming in the Czech Republic. The research part deals with observations of behavioral patterns of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b> Every month {{in the course of a}} calendar year, a selected group of farmed <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> was observed all day, with special regard to their behavioral patterns concerning grazing, feed intake, standing or lying. Air temperature was measured every time. My research has shown a significant effect of air temperature on the behavior of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b> Grazing was most prevalent in May (52 %), feed intake in January (39 %), lying in December (43 %) and standing in November (31 %). Moreover, spatial preferences of mineral deer-licks were examined in relation to feeding habits. The study has demonstrated that the location of a deer-lick has a considerable impact on its use. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> prefer significantly (75 %) a deer-lick close to a watering place rather than the deer-lick close to the border of the area. The results of the research were analysed in graphs and statistically evaluated by reference to Pearson's chi-squared test...|$|R

40|$|The Mesola Forest (1, 058 ha), {{located in}} the Ferrara {{province}} {{in the north of}} Italy, is completely enclosed and is home to a small group of endemic red deer (Cervus elaphus) that used to be widespread across all of North Italy. The Forest also contains a large population of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (Dama dama) reintroduced in the 1950 s- 1960 s.

40|$|Information on {{interspecific}} {{aggression is}} scarce for wild ungulates. I described patterns and sex/age correlates of interspecific aggression between wild roe deer Capreolus capreolus and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> Dama dama at feeding sites in Maremma Regional Park, central Italy. A previous {{study showed that}} <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> can actively exclude roe from feeding areas. Here I show that 81 % out of 42 aggressive interactions were fallow-roe deer aggressions, whereas 19 % were roe-fallow aggressions. No aggressive interaction involved physical contact between opponents and roe deer were displaced in all events. When roe <b>deer</b> avoided <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> the probability of remaining feeding increased significantly with respect to when aggression occurred. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males, especially yearlings, were more aggressive than females to all roe deer sexes/age classes. For <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> aggression was {{an efficient way to}} monopolise the access to foraging space.

40|$|Information {{is scarce}} on {{behavioural}} interference between wild ungulates. In particular, data are lacking on relationships between interference and habitat use. We analysed habitat correlates of behavioural interactions between <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> Dama dama and roe deer Capreolus capreolus at a feeding site, in a Mediterranean area. Previous {{research has shown}} that behavioural interference between these deer, with the former dominant over the latter, occurred also through direct aggression. Here we show that, for roe deer, the probability of being displaced by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> did not depend on the habitat where the deer meet. Interspecific encounters, thus interactions, were the most frequent in the habitat selected by roe deer, i. e. the set-aside grassland. In the habitats most used by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (pastures and crops), roe deer experienced a greater risk of suffering a displacement. The rate of intolerance encounters increased in spring, when habitat overlap occurred because <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> intensified the use of set-aside. Our results suggest that, most likely, avoidance of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> by roe deer is not habitat-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Interference is {{expected}} to occur at feeding areas between species with a similar diet, but few studies have tested this idea for wild ungulates. We analysed interactions between <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> European roe deer and wild boar, in three sites, in a Mediterranean area. We expected that interference should be greater between deer than between them and wild boar. We documented {{the negative effects of}} behavioural interference by fallow on foraging behaviour of roe deer, under field conditions. Deer species built up 90 % interference interactions, with fallow always dominant on roe, also through direct aggression. Although roe deer decreased feeding and increased vigilance levels in proximity (< 50 m) of either <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> or wild boar, they were displaced significantly more often by the former than by the latter. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were neither displaced nor alarmed by roe and rarely by wild boar. No deer species displaced wild boar. Interference was significantly greater on solitary roe deer, especially females, in spring and roe left the feeding ground most often in the smallest site (13 ha). Roe deer avoided areas where the local density of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> was the highest. During our 4 -year-study, roe deer density decreased whereas <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> numbers increased. Behavioural interference may explain how <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> outcompete roe deer through spatial exclusion from feeding sites and avoidance of areas with high densities of the former. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> evolved in semi-arid, relatively poor habitats of Asia Minor: interspecific defence of crucial resources could have developed as a beneficial tactic for its survival...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the relationships between}} population density and habitat features is important to evaluate the ecological needs of a species, its potential impact on ecosystems and its interspecific interactions. We analysed the spatial variation of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> Dama dama densities in a Mediterranean area in summer 2007 and winter 2007 / 2008. Previous research has shown that <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> can actively displace and exclude roe deer from natural feeding sites. Here we show that both species have the greatest densities in ecotone habitats between wood and open fields (abandoned olive groves and pastures), but with contrasting geographic patterns. The <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> showed the greatest densities in the central northern part of the study area near to local historical release sites. The densities of roe deer were great where <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were rare and low where <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were abundant. Spatial overlap was great at the habitat scale, indicating a high potential for competition, but was low at the plot scale, suggesting that partitioning of space occurred at a fine scale. Supporting great numbers of deer, the ecotone areas are crucial for the management of ecosystems. We suggest that roe deer avoid areas with great densities of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> and that interspecific interference from the latter affects the density and distribution of the former both at a fine and at a large scale...|$|R
