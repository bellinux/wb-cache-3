5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the <b>map</b> <b>data,</b> most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E

25|$|Another {{consideration}} in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the <b>map.</b> <b>Data</b> sets are geographic information; their collection depends on the chosen datum (model) of the Earth. Different datums assign slightly different coordinates to the same location, so in large scale maps, such as those from national mapping systems, {{it is important to}} match the datum to the projection. The slight differences in coordinate assignation between different datums is not a concern for world maps or other vast territories, where such differences get shrunk to imperceptibility.|$|E
500|$|Both Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean {{stretched}} {{the power of}} the Super Famicom to its limits, with a total of 48 megabits of data. [...] Additionally, Star Ocean was also one of two games that used a special S-DD1 chip to aid in compression of almost all graphics and <b>map</b> <b>data,</b> meaning that it effectively stored even more data than Tales of Phantasia, though the compression lead to a lower audio quality. [...] The game also featured special technology called a [...] "Flexible Voice Driver" [...] that allowed for the compression of sound, allowing for voice clips for characters when in battles, another trait that was both very rare for a Super Famicom game, and shared with Tales of Phantasia. Different voice clips would be played depending on the scenario; if the characters were confronted by weak enemies, they may say something more confident, where as if confronted by strong enemies, they may say something more fearful or frantic. Mode 7 graphics were generated using software, and appear when items pop out of treasure chests; the need for extra tiles, however, limited the graphical effects implementation. The game also featured surround sound. Planning for a sequel began as soon as development was completed on Star Ocean. Feedback about weak boss monsters later lead to more challenging battles in Star Ocean 2.|$|E

40|$|The most {{critical}} factor affects accuracy of a Struc-tured Light System (SLS) is calibration. Camera calibration {{is easy to}} complete because of its extensive study. To simplify projector calibration, previous work models the projector as an inverse camera and tries to build similar 3 D- 2 D <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> for projector calibra-tion. Achieved <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> is directly fed to some classic two-step camera calibration methods. When pro-jector comes with a large distortion lens, this kind of methods will fail because their first steps use closed-form solution to calculate initial guess for optimization in next steps. We proposed a new method to calibrate the pro-jector by removing its distortion first. Because projector cannot “see ” anything, not like camera case, constraints such as “straight lines remain straight ” working just on 2 D image is invalid for distortion estimation. With 3 D- 2 D <b>mapping</b> <b>data,</b> the estimation will involve several extra unknowns into a non-linear optimization. We use partial <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> whose 2 D points in a “small central area” of projector pattern image to acquire an initial guess for those unknowns, and then use all <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> to refine them and estimate distortion parameters. Experiments show our method can still calibrate the projector when classic methods fail. 1...|$|R
