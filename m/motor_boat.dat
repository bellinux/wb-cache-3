50|$|HM <b>Motor</b> Gun <b>Boat</b> 501 was a <b>Motor</b> Gun <b>Boat</b> {{operated}} by Royal Navy Coastal Forces during the Second World War.

5|$|All of the dreadnoughts {{except for}} Petropavlovsk were laid up in October–November 1918 {{for lack of}} manpower. She bombarded the rebellious {{garrison}} of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919 and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the White Russians in the Gulf of Finland. On 17 August 1919 Petropavlovsk was claimed as torpedoed and put out of action by the British Coastal <b>Motor</b> <b>Boat</b> CMB 88 in Kronstadt harbor, but was, in fact, not damaged at all. On 24 November 1919 a fire broke out in Poltavas forward boiler room and gutted much of her interior; she was never repaired although numerous proposals were made to reconstruct her. The crews of Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and they were renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna and Marat respectively after the rebellion was crushed to commemorate the Paris Commune and to erase their 'betrayal' of the Communist Party. The two undamaged ships were recommissioned in 1925–26 and all the ships were given proper revolutionary names.|$|E
5|$|Hangar 3, an {{original}} Belfast truss hangar, houses Duxford's maritime exhibition. The collection includes notable vessels and naval aircraft. Boats on display include Coastal <b>Motor</b> <b>Boat</b> 4, built by Thornycroft in 1916. She saw action during the Baltic campaign of 1918–19, and her commander Lieutenant Augustus Agar won the Victoria Cross for sinking the Russian cruiser Oleg on 17 June 1919. Other vessels include the Vosper {{motor torpedo boat}} MTB-71, acquired from the British Military Powerboat Trust in 2005, {{an example of an}} X-Craft midget submarine, and a wartime Royal National Lifeboat Institution boat, the Jesse Lumb which was stationed at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. A variety of naval aircraft are on display, including a de Havilland Sea Vixen, Sea Venom, and Sea Vampire, and a Westland Wasp helicopter which was embarked on the frigate HMS Apollo during the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|In the Year 2000 the German polar {{explorer}} Arved Fuchs built {{a detailed}} copy of Shackleton's boat named James Caird II. In his expedition titled 'Shackleton 2000' he succeeded {{to replicate the}} voyage of Shackleton and his crew from Elephant Island to South Georgia. The James Caird II {{was among the first}} expositions when the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg was first opened. A further replica, James Caird III was built by boat builder Bob Wallace of Massachusetts; it was purchased by the South Georgia Heritage Trust and since 2008 has been on display at the Carr Maritime Gallery, part of the South Georgia Museum at Grytviken. In 2011, a new 10.5–metre survey <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> (SMB) was named James Caird IV; it operates from , the Royal Navy's ice patrol ship.|$|E

5|$|In August, Robinson {{was sent}} to Anzac Cove as a naval liaison officer and on his second day there, was badly wounded near the front line, forcing his {{evacuation}} to England, where King George V presented him with his medal at Buckingham Palace. Returned to the Mediterranean in December 1915 following his recuperation, {{he took over the}} coastal monitor HMS M21, in which he shelled Turkish positions throughout Egypt and Palestine and was awarded another mention in despatches and the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 4th Class. Returning to England in the summer of 1917, he narrowly missed selection for Keyes's operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend owing to his war wounds, and instead trained crews of coastal torpedo boats, a role which led to a distant posting in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War, fighting the Bolshevik forces along the Russian coastline. Robinson commanded a squadron of coastal torpedo boats in the Caspian and forced the surrender of several enemy forts through aggressive tactics. These achievements would later win him the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class. His most notable achievement at this time was leading a small coastal <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> inside the harbour of Fort Alexandrovsk, where he sank a barge and prompted a mass surrender from the garrison.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia urged senior {{officials}} in Dhaka and coastal districts {{to prepare for}} the storm. Officials in Chittagong asked that all 24ships be moved out of the harbor and river channel. In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm. Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate. Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation. One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60people was reported missing off of Barisal Division. By November15, 47fishing vessels were still unaccounted for. A navy <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore. In the aftermath of the storm, the number of deaths in Bangladesh rose to 49.|$|E
5|$|While {{stalling}} {{north of}} Luzon, Goni enhanced the southwest monsoon across the Philippines, resulting in rainfall and gusty winds across the western {{portion of the}} nation. The storm spawned seven tornadoes, one of which damaged or destroyed ten houses in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. Rough seas swamped a <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> near Banton Island, forcing the crew of seven to swim ashore. Across Luzon, flooding caused landslides in 13locations, including a mountain slope in Mankayan, Benguet, that buried three mining camps, killing 13miners. More than 100policemen and miners searched through the mud for survivors. Water levels quickly rose in rivers across Luzon, washing away 14flood control systems, including one dyke. Swollen rivers also inundated several bridges and washed away one in Santa, Ilocos Sur, that left 5,100people isolated. At three dams, water gates were opened after flood levels reached critical heights. Across Luzon, trees were knocked down and the power supply was disrupted; all electrical service was restored by September1, or 11days after the storm's closest approach. In total, Typhoon Goni damaged 5,742houses, of which 188 were completely destroyed. Total damages amounted to ₱4.5billion ($96.6million USD), split roughly evenly between agricultural and infrastructural impacts. In Ilocos Norte province in northwestern Luzon, damage was estimated at ₱1.8billion ($38.7million USD). Overall, Typhoon Goni killed 33people and left 9missing in the Philippines, mostly due to landslides or drownings, and injured 24others.|$|E

25|$|Wilson survived {{as leader}} of the Labour party in opposition. In the summer of 1973, holidaying on the Isles of Scilly, he tried to board a <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> from a dinghy and stepped into the sea.

25|$|The ships reached Dunedin Star on 1 or 2 December. Nerine {{launched}} {{some of her}} supply-laden Carley floats {{to reach}} the shore party, but the strong current swept them away. She {{moved closer to the}} shore, launched her remaining floats and returned to Walvis Bay. Temeraire launched her <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> and took 10 men off Dunedin Star, but the boat shipped a lot of water which stopped her motor. The Norwegian boatmen then rowed {{for an hour and a}} half to Manchester Division, which took the 10 survivors aboard. The Norwegians were now so exhausted that Temeraire had to take them and their boat back aboard. The next day Sir Charles Elliot arrived. Temeraire again lowered her <b>motor</b> <b>boat,</b> which in four trips rescued the remaining 32 men from Dunedin Star and transferred them all to Sir Charles Elliot. In the heavy sea the tug then struggled to get alongside Manchester Division to transfer all of the rescued men except Captain Lee and his Chief and Second Engineers, who were taken aboard Nerine.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, {{following}} a suggestion from three junior {{officers of the}} Harwich destroyer force that small motor boats carrying a torpedo might be capable of travelling over the protective minefields and attacking ships of the Imperial German Navy at anchor in their bases, the Admiralty gave tentative approval to the idea and, {{in the summer of}} 1915, produced a Staff Requirement requesting designs for a Coastal <b>Motor</b> <b>Boat</b> for service in the North Sea.|$|E
