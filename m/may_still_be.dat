5|$|A {{much smaller}} {{version of the}} Cathedral, also {{designed}} by Sir Frederick Gibberd, was constructed in 1965 as a chapel for the former De La Salle College of Education, Middleton, Lancashire, a Catholic teacher-training college. The site is now occupied by , a further education college of the Borough of Rochdale and the chapel <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{linguists}} {{claim that}} panlectal grammars have psychological validity, and polylectal diasystems {{are much more}} likely to be cognitively real for bilingual and bidialectal speakers, speakers of only one dialect or language <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> aware of the differences between their own speech and that of other varieties.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{milligram}} {{amounts of}} ferric iodide, a black solid, <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> prepared through {{the reaction of}} iron pentacarbonyl with iodine and carbon monoxide {{in the presence of}} hexane and light at the temperature of −20°C, making sure that the system is well sealed off from air and water.|$|E

5|$|None {{of these}} fortifications survive intact, {{although}} some pre-existing buildings {{that were used}} as blockhouses <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> seen. San Rocco Battery, one of the insurgents' fortifications, was the location where Fort Saint Rocco was built {{later on in the}} late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of Song bridges include Guyue Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province. The bridge {{was built in}} 1213, the sixth year of the Jiading Era in the Southern Song dynasty. Song-era pontoon bridges include the Dongjin Bridge, 400m (mi) long, which <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> seen today.|$|E
5|$|The {{average age}} of {{menarche}} is 12–15. They may occasionally start as early as eight, and this onset <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> normal. This first period often occurs later {{in the developing world}} than the developed world.|$|E

5|$|The family Trogloraptoridae {{may have}} had a wider {{distribution}} given that redwood forests encompassed a far greater area in North America during the Pliocene (about 5 mya). Other species <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> present in other caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is {{sometimes}} referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young T Tauri-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge. In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.|$|E
5|$|We are {{of opinion}} that the scheme of the act of March 3, 1891, precludes the {{contention}} that certificates of division of opinion <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> had under sections 651 and 697 of the Revised Statutes.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} such a {{diversity}} among the Araucaria genus in New Caledonia still remain unclear, but appears to be relatively recent. Also speciation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> processed {{as suggested by the}} cryptic diversity observed among the genus.|$|R
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> admissible.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
50|$|The Geosynchronous-belt subsynchronous orbital {{regime is}} {{regularly}} used in spaceflight. This orbit is typically used to house working communication satellites {{that have not}} yet been deactivated, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> used again in geostationary service if the need arises.|$|R

5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|European {{settlers}} on the North American Prairies {{found that}} the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs. Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> found. A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, {{with the construction of}} a large new sanctuary. There was also a Rood screen and loft, with a carved image of Christ crucified, with the figures of Mary and St John either side, though this is now gone, although the steps to the loft <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> seen to {{the north side of the}} chancel.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the New 52 reboot, Selina had a {{relationship}} with Slam Bradley, Jr., and she named him as the father of her daughter Helena. However, the father <b>may</b> <b>still</b> have <b>been</b> Batman.|$|R

5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Margaret Scully in a park, {{and tries to}} give her Scully's {{necklace}}. Margaret returns the necklace to Mulder, asking that he give it to Scully when he finds her. Margaret also says {{that she had the}} dream again about losing her daughter; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> alive. A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, he looks up into the stars.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage have shown that damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's {{geographical}} area is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> small. This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E

50|$|Large {{aircraft}} do {{not require}} FSII as they are usually equipped with electric fuel line heaters that keep the fuel at an appropriate temperature to prevent icing. However, if the fuel heaters are inoperable, the aircraft <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> declared fit to fly, if FSII {{is added to the}} fuel.|$|R
