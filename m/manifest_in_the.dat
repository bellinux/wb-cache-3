5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are {{triggered}} by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely}} to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malagasy population. Many Malagasy nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt.

5|$|Huene {{felt the}} {{vertebrae}} of BMNH R3078 had proportions different enough from Cetiosaurus to warrant its own genus. Also, {{the fusion of}} centra with minimal osseous proliferation is <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> caudal vertebrae of Cetiosauriscus. The Cetiosaurus specimen OUMNH J13695 has a low horizontal ridge on each of its lateral surfaces, creating a slightly subhexagonal transverse cross-section, and is also seen on Cetiosauriscus, {{as well as the}} anterior caudals of Haplocanthosaurus, and caudals 15 to 30 of Omeisaurus. Also, the area around the periphery of each articular face is flattened, creating a 'bevelled' appearance, and also occurs in Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus. A whiplash tail was apparently found in the same deposits but it is not certain it belongs to the same individual. Since there is no overlapping material, this assignment to Cetiosauriscus should be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|The eze Nri was {{the title}} of the ruler of Nri with ritual and mystic (but not military) power. He was a ritual figure rather than a king in the {{traditional}} sense. The eze Nri was chosen after an interregnum period while the electors waited for supernatural powers to <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new eze Nri. He was installed after a symbolic journey to Aguleri on the Anambra River. The authorities must be notified prior to commencement of this journey to obtain the Ududu-eze,the royal scepter. There, the process of paying of homage to all the necessary shrines/deities in Aguleri by the new Eze Nri, visitation to Menri`s tomb at Ama-Okpu, collection of Ofo, purification of the virgin boy to receive the clay from the chosen diver from Umuezeora in Aguleri, sitting on the throne of Eri at Obu-Gad in Aguleri by the new Eze-Nri before going back to Nri on the seventh day to undergo a symbolic burial and exhumation, then finally be anointed with white clay, a symbol of purity. Upon his death, he was buried seated in a wood-lined chamber. The eze Nri was in all aspects a divine ruler.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E

25|$|Greater {{changes in}} {{attitude}} toward the river were <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bow River Water Quality Council's reports over time. By 1994, the reports {{emphasized the importance of}} the Bow's ecological balance as a whole for maintaining its water quality and quantity. In the mid-1990s, the upper Bow River began being treated explicitly biocentrically. This was part of the larger pursuit of treating Banff National Park's ecosystems as something intrinsically valuable: maintaining these ecosystems was now prioritized over human enjoyment of the parks.|$|E
25|$|Back-arc basins are {{hypothesized}} to form {{as a result}} of trench rollback (also, hinge rollback). This is the backward motion of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted. As the subduction zone and its associated trench pull backward, the overriding plate is stretched, thinning the crust which is <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back-arc basin. Sedimentation is strongly asymmetric, with most of the sediment supplied from the active magmatic arc which regresses in step with the rollback of the trench.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} a new theatre had already become <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artistic {{community}} around 1906. At the time the small São Geraldo Theatre (along the Avenida Central with Rua dos Chãos) was the only space used for theatre and cinema, but the larger Portuguese theatre companies could not stage any of their theatrical presentations in the limited stage. Artur José Soares, José António Velosos and Cândido Martins Iiderarm formed the Sociedade do Teatro Circo, and began collecting the materials from the demolished Convent on 16 December 1907.|$|E

Wahhabi influence in Saudi Arabia, however, remained tangible in the physical conformity in dress, in public deportment, and in public prayer.

By 1989, with the increasing popular discontent nationwide that had begun to <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USSR, the Internal Troops of the MVD, on orders from the Presidum of the Supreme Soviet, officially became a reporting agency of the MIA after years {{as a part of the}} Ministry of Defense.|$|E
