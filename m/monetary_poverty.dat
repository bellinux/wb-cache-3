50|$|Using {{a single}} <b>monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> {{threshold}} is problematic when applied worldwide, {{due to the}} difficulty of comparing prices between countries. Prices of the same goods vary dramatically from country to country; while this is typically corrected for by using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, the basket of goods used to determine such rates is usually unrepresentative of the poor, most of whose expenditure is on basic foodstuffs rather than the relatively luxurious items (washing machines, air travel, healthcare) often included in PPP baskets. The economist Robert C. Allen has attempted to solve this by using standardized baskets of goods typical of those bought by the poor across countries and historical time, for example including a fixed calorific quantity of the cheapest local grain (such as corn, rice, or oats).|$|E

Additionally, the <b>monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> shows faster progress as well as a higher level of fluctuation than multidimensional poverty. <b>Monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> is also more sensitive to the changes in a household's characteristics than multidimensional poverty. Moreover, improvements in multidimensional poverty are attributed mainly to the reduction in the incidence of poverty rather than the intensity of poverty.

40|$|Poverty is “pronounced {{deprivation}} in well-being. ” The conventional view links well-being {{primarily to}} command over commodities, so {{the poor are}} {{those who do not}} have enough income or consumption to put them above some adequate minimum threshold. This view sees <b>poverty</b> largely in <b>monetary</b> terms. <b>Poverty</b> may also be tied to a specific type of consumption; for example, people could be house poor or food poor or health poor. These dimensions of poverty often can be measured directly, for instance, by measuring malnutrition or literacy. The broadest approach to well-being (and poverty) focuses on the capability of the individual to function in society. Poor people often lack key capabilities; they may have inadequate income or education, or be in poor health, or feel powerless, or lack political freedoms. There are four reasons to measure poverty: • To keep poor people on the agenda • To be able to identify poor people and so to be able to target appropriate interventions • To monitor and evaluate projects and policy interventions geared to poor people • To evaluate the effectiveness of institutions whose goal is to help poor people.

While a <b>monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> line of 370 dollars generates a ratio of poverty of households of 51, 4 per cent, the cost of basis needs approach induces an impact of the national poverty of only 41, 5 per cent, and modifies appreciably the configuration ofpoverty profiles. Furthermore, if {{the introduction of a}} scale of equivalence whose value is inferior to one, does not modify really the extent the poverty - in terms of households as compared to the approach of the cost of basis needs -, it decreases relatively the impact and the depth of the urban poverty and, especially, tends to modify the relationship between the poverty and the gender. In addition, relatively to the international threshold of 370 dollars, thebasis needs approach suggests an appreciably highest decline of the poverty {{in the course of the}} period 1990 _ 96 : _ 34, 9 per cent - against _ 19, 8 -, result inferior to that that prevails when the line of poverty extreme is introduced - _ 40, 4 per cent.

40|$|The spatial {{differential}} {{of poverty in}} Burkina Faso is apprehended using a micro-multidimensional approach based on three basic needs - housing, health and education-, supposed to express the “capabilities” of households. Two analytical aspects are highlighted. Firstly, the extent of poverty in terms of basic needs is highest in the rural sector, compared to the urban zones, in particular {{in the area of}} North and, to a lesser extent, in those of the South & South_West, Center_North and Center_South. In this respect, if deficits of instruction of the head of household explain approximately half of national poverty, they vary appreciably according to couples “area_attribute”. Thus, in the urban zones, it is primarily the shortage of instruction of the head of household which is the essential component of the multidimensional index. However, in rural zones, the situation is contrasted. In addition, the approach in terms of “capabilities” underlines significant differences according to the sex and the labour statute of the head of household, and suggests actions differentiated as regards fight against poverty, modulated according to zones, as well with regard to the access to the private goods as with the collective services. Secondly, a proximity of situation is observed between the monetary structure of regional poverty and its non-monetary counterpart. On the one hand, the spatial coherence observed between the relative levels of the ratios of poverty and the multidimensional indices confers much similarity between the regional profiles of <b>monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> and poverty in terms of “capabilities”. In addition, the econometric estimates show that, for the various basic needs taken separately, more the gaps compared to the thresholds of subsistence are important, more the ratio and the depth of <b>monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> are high. Moreover, the predicted values of the indicators of <b>monetary</b> <b>poverty</b> by the “capabilities” alone are rather close to the values observed. These conclusions probably confirm the character more complementary than substitutable of the two approaches, and tends to strengthen the interest of the multidimensional investigations, in particular compared to the effectiveness of the anti-poverty policies.

Physical measures might be based upon caloric intake, or as considered in India, the number of square meals (thoughtfully defined) in a sample period and the purchase of clothing, with some experts also arguing for an inventory of physical household assets. The attraction of choosing physical measures is that they appear to avoid the necessity of converting currencies across countries to a common measure. However, the survey problems of identifying those below such thresholds, or of choosing equivalent food baskets across space to obtain the same caloric intake, involve problems as knotty as those using monetary measures. In any event, {{the focus of this}} paper is on <b>monetary</b> measures of <b>poverty</b> and takes up two interrelated issues of comparing poverty levels: what prices and what expenditure weights should be used when comparing the purchasing power parity (PPP) of currencies, either across or within countries, such as across rural and metropolitan areas...|$|R
40|$|As the Chilean {{government}} {{seeks to}} reduce both poverty and inequality through cash transfers to poor households, {{local governments are}} responsible for both identifying the poor and allocating transfers. Until recently, however, evaluating the effectiveness of local governments in enacting these policies has been restricted by data limitations. The paper builds on recent evidence that cash transfers had highly variable impacts on poverty and inequality at the county level in 2002. In particular, we explore how local public finance {{and the strength of}} the governing mandate influence the efficiency of cash transfers. With a richly-specified model, we find that public spending on goods and services, the fraction of available subsidies claimed by the local government, and the share of county land that is zoned for industrial purposes are all correlated with considerable reductions in poverty and inequality. In addition, the strength of the governing mandate weakly influences the efficiency of transfers in reducing poverty, but not inequality. These results demonstrate that a better understanding of such institutions can lead to more efficient targeting for social programs. <b>Monetary</b> transfers; Inequality; <b>Poverty...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} policies against poverty and inequality, policy makers all over Europe {{should have at}} their disposal information referring to appropriate domains, since the impossibility to access to goods and services varies with age, gender and zone of residence. However, the major Italian and European surveys collecting information on poverty and living conditions {{can be used to}} produce accurate indicators only at the regional level. To compute these indicators at the Provincial and Municipality levels there is the need to resort to small area methodologies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} produce and compare <b>monetary</b> indicators of <b>poverty</b> for the Provinces of Tuscany using parametric and nonparametric small area estimation methods. The target is the estimation of the at-risk-of- poverty rate (Head Count Ratio) and of the mean and the quantiles of the household income distribution using census data and data from the EU- SILC survey. These measures can be considered as a starting point for more in depth analyses, such as the estimation of the income cumulative distribution function...|$|R
