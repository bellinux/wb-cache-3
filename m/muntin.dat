5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of <b>muntin</b> and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E

25|$|At {{the west}} end of the north aisle is a small and unusual 15th-century priests' room – an oak framed {{apartment}} of two stages lighted by a small 15th-century square-headed window. This has a heavy plank and <b>muntin</b> screen with narrow door and roof of heavy joists supporting the upper floor. The screen is 15th-century oak with a moulded and embattled head and rail. The door is narrow, massive and nail studded. The use of this chamber is unknown, {{it may have been the}} sacristy and muniment room or a priests' room to accommodate the monk when the Church was served by Prittlewell Priory. The hinges of the door and the trap door are probably original. The lower chamber is now used as the Vicar's vestry and there is an oak bier, dated 1706, in the upper chamber.|$|E
50|$|Double- or triple-layer {{insulated}} glass {{can be used}} in place of ordinary single panes in a window divided by <b>muntins,</b> though this reduces the effectiveness of the insulation. Other insulating glass arrangements include insertion of a decorative grid of simulated metal, wooden or plastic <b>muntins</b> sandwiched between two large panels of glass, sometimes adding another grid of simulated wood <b>muntins</b> facing the interior to produce a more convincing divided light appearance.|$|R
50|$|These are {{the pieces}} of framing that {{separate}} a larger window into smaller panes. In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so <b>muntins</b> let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored <b>muntins</b> still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room). By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, <b>muntins</b> tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.|$|R

2500|$|The Hills-DeCaro House is most {{significant}} for its architecture {{which represents the}} transition and integration of Wright's early experimental style and his mature Prairie style. [...] Among features which reference his earlier designs are the windows; instead of the elaborate, geometric art-glass patterns which Wright first introduced in the Frank W. Thomas House, Wright employs simpler leaded frames with clear glass. [...] The design is most {{similar to that of}} the Robert G. Emmond House or the wood <b>muntin</b> configuration of the Thomas H. Gale House, two of Wright's first works. [...] Additionally, the house has a finished basement and attic, both of which Wright would avoid whenever possible following the development of his Prairie house.|$|E
2500|$|Existing and new walls, alike, {{were covered}} in uniform, lightly textured, pale stucco {{from the ground up}} to – and {{including}} – the eave soffit. A continuous canted ledge of painted redwood stretched around the house below the second floor windows. Additional redwood trim was employed in rectangles to wrap around each corner on the second floor. [...] All windows and doors in the home were fashioned in leaded glass with nickel caming. The unvarying glass pattern was a variation of the typical Prairie <b>muntin</b> bar design and consisted of a frame of narrow rectangular and trapezoidal panes surrounding a single large glass pane. Wright arranged most windows into one of two ensembles – one for each floor – to unify his design. In five locations on the first floor, double casement windows or full length French doors were flanked by two more isolated, narrow casements. All openings on the second floor were composed of paired casements topped by a single transom light. A cantilevered, rectangular bay, which formed a focal point on the second level of the street (east) elevation, contained a band of four such three-piece windows and was subtly bookended by two deeply inset casements.|$|E
60|$|He and his MATE {{were now}} in a strong and well guarded Prison, himself loaded {{with a pair of}} double Links and Basils[17] of about {{fourteen}} pounds weight, and confined together in the safest Appartment call'd Newgate Ward; Sheppard conscious of his Crimes, and knowing the Information he had made to be but a blind Amusement that would avail him nothing; he began to Meditate an Escape. They had been thus detained for about four Days, and their Friends having the Liberty of seeing them, furnish'd him with Implements proper for his Design, accordingly Mr. Sheppard goes to work, and on the 25th of May being Whit-son Monday at about two of the Clock in the Morning, he had compleated a practicable breach, and sawed of his Fetters; having with unheard of Diligence and Dexterity, cut off an Iron Bar from the Window, and taken out a <b>Muntin,</b> or Bar of the most solid Oak of about nine Inches in thickness, by boring it thro' in many Places, a work of great Skill and Labour; they had still five and twenty Foot to descend from the Ground; Sheppard fasten'd a Sheet and Blanket to the Bars, and causes Madam to take off her Gown and Petticoat, and sent her out first, and she being more Corpulent than himself, it was with great Pain and Difficulty that he got her through the Interval, and observing his Directions, was instantly down, and more frighted than hurt; the Phylosopher follow'd, and lighted with Ease and Pleasure; But where are they Escap'd to? Why out of one Prison into another. The Reader is to understand, that the New Prison and Clerkenwell Bridewell lye Contiguous to one another, and they are got into the Yard of the latter, and have a Wall of twenty-two Foot high to Scale, before their Liberty is perfected; Sheppard far from being unprepared to surmount this Difficulty, has his Gimblets and Peircers ready, and makes a Scaleing-Ladder. The Keepers and Prisoners of both Places are a sleep in their Beds; he Mounts his Bagage, and in less than ten Minutes carries both her and himself over this wall, and compleats an entire Escape. Altho' his Escape from the Condemn'd Hold of Newgate, has made a far greater Noise in the World, than that from this Prison hath. It has been allow'd by all the Jayl-Keepers in London, that one so Miraculous was never perform'd before in England; the broken Chains and Bars are kept at New Prison to Testifie, and preserve the Memory of this extraordinary Villain.|$|E

50|$|During {{the great}} Fire of Aachen in 1656, {{portions}} of the roof and towers burned. The destroyed elements were then replaced in a baroque style. From 1727 until 1732 the Chief Architect of Aachen, Johann Joseph Couven, led a fundamental baroque remodeling of the structure, especially of the front façade and entry steps. The gothic figures and <b>muntin</b> adorning the windows were removed, and even the interior was remodeled in the baroque style. Today, the sitting room and the “White Hall” both still convey this change in style.|$|E

The front lower-story entrance has a double-leaf door with side and transom lights, {{the same for}} second-story porch. The windows were of 6/6 thin <b>muntin</b> double-hung sash with an alteration on the east facade of 4/1 sash. The roof appears {{to have had a}} widow's walk.

50|$|A multi-lite {{window is}} a window glazed with small panes of glass {{separated}} by wooden or lead glazing bars, or <b>muntins,</b> arranged in a decorative glazing pattern often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or lattice window) {{was the most common}} window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.|$|R
50|$|Fenestration on the portico {{consists}} of two long windows {{on the first floor}} to either side of the entrance, with sandstone sills and lintels. On the second story the windows are round-arched with radiating <b>muntins.</b> The roof above them has broad overhanging eaves. To either side on both stories of the south wing are tripartite single-pane windows. Those on the first story have transoms with a single row of square panes.|$|R
50|$|Early {{canopies}} {{were made}} of numerous pieces of flat glass held in position by a frame and <b>muntins.</b> The <b>muntins</b> reduced visibility, which was especially problematic for military aircraft. Also, glass canopies were much heavier than acrylic canopies, which were first introduced shortly before World War II. The acrylic bubble canopy was used on aircraft such as the Supermarine Spitfire and Westland Whirlwind, which gave better all-round visibility and reduced weight. It is still being used today on most fighter aircraft.In the 1970s, US aviation artist Keith Ferris invented a false canopy to paint {{on the underside of}} military aircraft, directly underneath the front of the plane, the purpose of which was to confuse an enemy so they do not know in what direction the aircraft is headed. This ruse was inspired by animals and fishes that have similar markings on the head and tail, so they can confuse other creatures. Pilots remain skeptical of this feature, asserting that if the enemy is close enough to see the marking, they are too close to be fooled by it.|$|R
