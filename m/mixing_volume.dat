Usual groundwater fluxes estimation with Darcy's law may lead to cumulated errors on spatial variability, especially in fractured aquifers where local direct measurement {{of groundwater}} fluxes becomes necessary. In the present study, both classical Point Dilution Method (PDM) and Finite Volume Point Dilution Method (FVPDM) are compared on the fractured crystalline aquifer of Ploemeur, France. The manipulation includes the first use of the FVPDM in a fractured aquifer using a double packer. This configuration limits the vertical extend of the tested zone to target a precise fracture zone of the aquifer. The result of this experiment is a continuous monitoring of groundwater fluxes that lasted for more than 4 days. Measurements of groundwater flow rate in the fracture (Qt) by PDM provide good estimates only if the <b>mixing</b> <b>volume</b> (Vw) (volume of water in which the tracer is mixed) is precisely known.

In order to compute the <b>mixed</b> <b>volume,</b> a <b>mixed</b> subdivision of the tuple of polytopes is needed, which can be obtained by embedding the polytopes in a higher-dimensional space, i. e., by lifting them. Dynamic lifting is opposed to the static approach. This means that one considers one point at a time and only fixes the value of the lifting function when the point really influences the <b>mixed</b> <b>volume.</b> Conservative lifting functions have been developed for this purpose.
