40|$|For {{the further}} {{development}} of an integrated European electricity market, congestion management mechanisms {{are one of the}} major market design issues. Against the background of increasing generation from RES and resulting congestions, an efficient management of network congestions is gaining importance especially in Germany. Introducing nodal pricing as the first best mechanism is not considered to be realistic for Germany in the nearer future. Yet the splitting of the German electricity market into several market zones will also improve congestion management. A key issue in the so-called <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> is the determination of the net transfer capacity (NTC) between the market zones as it determines the effectiveness of <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> as congestion management mechanism. We therefore develop an integrated approach to incorporate the effects of renewables feed-in, load pattern and cross border flows on NTCs. We conclude that the NTCs strongly depend on RES infeed and that this effect has to be considered when modelling alternative congestion management mechanisms like <b>market</b> <b>splitting...</b>|$|E

40|$|Capítulos en librosThis paper {{describes}} a strategic information platform {{developed for the}} German electric utility Eon, to provide historical bidding analysis and medium-term forecasting of the Iberian Electricity Market. This platform, PLAMER, has three main modules: Initialization module, consisting of different sub-modules to define the electrical system structure and to organize the input data {{of the rest of}} modules, PLAMER-bids, to read, aggregate and visualize market historical bids and also to prepare them for their future forecasted values, and PLAMER-clearing, for market clearing emulation using forecasted bids. PLAMER-clearing models the Iberian market based on a bid clearing mechanism with an inherent <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> procedure. This <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> is built with a bi-nodal simplification, one node representing the Spanish System and the other the Portuguese one. Both are simply connected by a unique equivalent interconnection line. The medium term clearing model uses a generation portfolio per generation company in terms of technologies, for supplying monthly demand for different load levels, and labour and non-labour periods. Some technical constraints, such as minimum outputs and pumping energy balance, are also taking into account. The mathematical problem of PLAMER-clearing is a quadratic programming model solved using GAMS language and CPLEX optimizer. Finally, a real Iberian case study is detailed and some <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> outputs are analyzed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|In a {{competitive}} market, <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> (nodal pricing) {{is the most}} efficient way to deal with congestion. Counter-trading is inefficient as it gives the wrong long term signals for entry and exit of power plants, and hence, causes over-entry in the market. However, in a non-competitive market, entry will improve the competitiveness of the market, and will increase social benefit by reducing price-cost margins. This paper studies whether the procompetitive entry effects could make counter-trading more efficient than <b>market</b> <b>splitting.</b> We find that this is not the case and that counter-trading is likely to have a negative effect on overall welfare. The benefits of additional competition (more competitive prices and lower production cost) do not outweigh the distortions (additional investment cost for the entrant, and socialization of the congestion cost to final consumers) ...|$|E

When several areas or countries {{are intended to}} function as a whole market, cross-border congested lines require implementation of a management methodology.

A model equilibrium approach is presented to represent both congestion management methods through an equivalent optimisation problem. All the analysis is made for a two areas market scenario and mainly focused to the medium term.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we compare {{different}} congestion management schemes in liberalized electricity markets using an agent-based simulator. By modelling market participants as adaptive agents in oligopolistic structures, {{we consider the}} possibility of strategic behavior and the existence/exercise of market power. Generation companies submit their bids to the market place {{in order to maximize}} their payoffs, where we apply reinforcement learning as behavioral agent model. The market is then cleared taking into account specific congestion management methods, such as locational marginal pricing (LMP), <b>market</b> <b>splitting</b> and flow-based market coupling. We demonstrate the functionality of the simulator using a test network, illustrating that different congestion management methods lead to different market dynamics and/or equilibria. Additionally, we assess the effects on the distribution of the surplus for producers and consumers as well as overall social welfare.

In the light of the sharp increase in redispatch measures seen within the last years, the importance of an efficient management of network congestion increases particularly in Germany. Against this background, we develop an integrated approach to model (re) dispatch for Germany in detail while considering interactions with neighbouring countries. Compared to 2011, our findings indicate a much more critical network situation in Germany for 2015. We identify increased RES production, resulting imports and exports, delays in grid extension and the impacts of the nuclear phase-out (leading to an amplified north-south congestion problem) as main drivers for the nearly doubling of redispatch volumes in 2015.
