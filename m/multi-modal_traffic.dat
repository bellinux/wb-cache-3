40|$|To re-establish regular {{operations}} in a tram traffic network after a large disturbance, e. g. resulting from vehicle breakdown or station closure, {{the viability of}} several rescheduling and rerouting strategies has to be evaluated prior to their implementation. Here, a <b>multi-modal</b> <b>traffic</b> simulation system can help to enhance the decision quality. Such a system obviously faces tight time constraints, so simulation data has to be acquired fast.

40|$|AbstractMulti-modal {{trips are}} common in urban {{transportation}} networks. Traveling preferences are also considered by users {{in addition to their}} travel mode, path, cost and time. In this paper, in order to show the behavior of traveling choice {{under the influence of the}} cost, time and user preference, a variational inequality model is developed to describe the stochastic multi-user and <b>multi-modal</b> mixed <b>traffic</b> equilibrium. In this model, the mutual influences among different traffic modes are considered in a general traffic network, and travelers are grouped into different user classes according to their socio-economic characteristic and travel behavior. The model is illustrated by an application to a numerical example. Numerical results indicated that the mode choice of users is influenced by some factors such as the cost, time and users preferences for different mode and different transfer station...|$|R

Macroscopic {{pedestrian}} models, which are mainly based on fluid dynamics, are often used to simulate huge crowds due to their low computational costs (Columbo & Rosini 2005). Similar approaches are used in the field of traffic simulations (Lighthill & Whitham 1955). A combined macroscopic simulation of vehicles and pedestrians is extremely helpful for all-encompassing traffic control. Therefore, we developed a hybrid model that contains networks for vehicular traffic and human flow.

In spite of the outstanding progress made in this research filed; {{traffic management}} still a very challenging problem regarding the multiple factors that have {{to be taken into account}} in any proposed solution. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces a collaborative model based context awareness <b>multi-modal</b> <b>traffic</b> management aiming at providing an efficient way to manage the traffic inside a transportation station. In this model (Multi-Layers Stations: the stations that have different intersections for different means of transport), the traffic management is based on a Q-learning technique that takes into account the context awareness parameters to provide more potent decisions. The learning technique offers the opportunity to the system (transportation station) to adapt dynamically its decision (choice of the best transportation mean) based on feedbacks provided by the passengers traveling from that specified station and thus optimize their journey through the transportation network. The efficacy of our proposed technique is validated through extensive simulations for different layers of transport means like metros, trains, and buses. Our proposal holds for any ITS system decisions provided the availability of real-time traces about the passengers passing by any statio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Research and {{development}} {{in the field of}} intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can be costly in terms of both time and money. A significant initial and ongoing investment is often required in order to obtain a physical platform from which experimentation and results may be gained. Simulation of entities, their dynamics and interactions can provide an appropriate and cost effective method for the development of vehicular applications. When simulating traffic behaviour, it is modelled either at a microscopic level, where the individual characteristics and behaviours of each vehicle are reproduced, or at a macroscopic level where the traffic behaviour is aggregated and represented in terms of density, flow and speed. A difficulty with macroscopic simulation it that it often simplifies certain aspects of a scenario under investigation. Non-realistic vehicle dynamics, simplified communication models and idealistic localisation can all detract from the credibility of evaluations carried out. While microscopic simulation can alleviate these concerns, the computational re-sources required to simulate a large scale scenario, such as a highway, become prohibitive. This paper demonstrates that the integration of a number of simulation platforms can help alleviate the aforementioned concerns.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the most}} {{important}} environmental prob-lems in large cities is the vehicular emission. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a growing alternative for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Since this kind of vehicle has low autonomy yet, it is important to optimize energy consumption, for instance by planning a suitable infrastructure of battery recharge and/or battery-switch stations. This paper presents an architecture for EV simulation, important to analyze traffic flow, its dynamics and the performance when there are obstructions or intense traffic. There are several tools for traffic simulation, SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) is one of them. But none of the existing traffic simulators integrates models of EV that allow, for example, perform simulation studies regarding energy consumption. SUMO is a portable open source simulator with <b>multi-modal</b> <b>traffic</b> feature capabilities that permit the simulation of various types of vehicles. This work is an exten-sion of the SUMO, two-dimensional (2 D) vehicular simulation package. To allow the simulation of energy consumption of EV, two extensions were incorporated in SUMO: EV models and modeling of altitude, transforming SUMO into a three-dimensional (3 D) simulator. The energy model effectiveness and correctness with 3 D capabilities has been validated using two driving schedules (Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule and Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule). This new tool will also support the study of better routes choice in 3 D environment with EV aiming minimum energy consumption. I...|$|E
40|$|The City of Vancouver is {{committed}} to improve public transit and reduce congestion to accommodate people traveling to, from, and within the city in various transportation modes. The Stadium District of the city also hosts {{a vast amount of}} special events, including the National Hockey League, the Canadian Football League, and the oncoming 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympics Games. Special events present unique challenges to downtown transportation management. During special events, the transportation management has to address a surge in vehicle and pedestrian demand and account for potential evacuation. To aid decision making in planning for these events, the City of Vancouver looks for new tools. For special events analysis, it is important account for: 1) the dynamic nature of the travel demand flow; 2) and the capacity changes at the supply side due to the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles; and 3) and the impacts of short term route closures. To meet these requirements, the Downtown Vancouver Emergency and Transportation Management System (DVTEMS) was developed by the City of Vancouver.

40|$|This {{research}} project was devised {{to provide a}} comparison of the engineering uses of VISSIM and SIDRA (two traffic modelling programs) in the assessment of traffic-based development impacts. SIDRA is a micro-analytical traffic evaluation tool, whereas VISSIM is a <b>multi-modal</b> microsimulation <b>traffic</b> modelling software. The key objectives of the study were to compare the output results of SIDRA and VISSIM, particularly the key performance measures of delay and queue length, and to also investigate the potential advantages and disadvantages of using VISSIM to perform development impact assessments. The key outcome of the model comparison was that SIDRA tended to calculate higher average delay statistics than VISSIM for intersections with low traffic demand and where some geometric negotiation is required. Further investigation identified that SIDRA automatically includes a geometric delay component within its calculation of average vehicle delay. By contrast, the equivalent statistic calculated by VISSIM ignores geometric delay (when coded using reduced speed areas) and incorporates only genuine control delay. This identifies a key difference between the methods used by each package to report a performance measure that is commonly assessed in TIAs. No consistent trend was apparent in the comparison of queue length data generated by each package, although there was some evidence that VISSIM reported larger queues than SIDRA at over-saturated intersections. In summary, SIDRA is likely to be more appropriate for projects with tight timeframes and smaller budgets. Assessments that require analysis of intersections with irregular geometry, or where multiple intersections are in close proximity to one another, are better conducted with a microsimulation model. The study concluded that the general modelling context needs to be identified before a choice of model is made. Consideration should be given to the network extents, intersection types, project budget and project timeframe. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{decision}} support system (DSS) integrated in a geographical information system (GIS) for the analysis and evaluation of different transport policies is presented. The objective of the tool is to assist transport administrators enhance {{the efficiency of the}} transportation supply while improving environmental and energy indicators. The DDS works on three levels. The first performs the transport network analysis, the second assesses the energy consumption and pollutant emissions and the third evaluates the several policies selected. Road traffic is simulated using a deterministic, <b>multi-modal</b> <b>traffic</b> assignment model with capacity constraints. The model allows the estimation of traffic flow patterns within each link of the road network starting from the knowledge of the network characteristics and traffic demand. Energy consumption and pollutant emission calculations are based on the methodology developed by the CORINAIR working group. The evaluation of each policy scenario is based on a number of traffic, environmental and energy indicators. A multi-criteria analysis, where decision is based upon judging over appropriate weighted criteria, is adopted. Models are integrated in a GIS environment, which serves as the repository of the data as well as the user interface of the tool. The use of the tool is demonstrated through characteristic case studies on the Greater Athens Area in Greece. Two policy measures, one concerning the extension of the region where half of the private cars are prohibited from entering to the Municipality of Athens and the other the reduction of parking places in the same region by 50 % are evaluated.
