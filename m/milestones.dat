5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent <b>milestones</b> of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two <b>milestones</b> that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual <b>milestones</b> can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
