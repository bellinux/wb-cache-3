5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a <b>man</b> <b>got</b> struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day that the <b>man</b> <b>got</b> hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E
5|$|According to StatCounter {{market share}} {{statistics}} (based on web use proxy), Iceland {{was the first}} country where Windows 10 was ranked first (not only on the desktop, it also holds across all platforms), with several bigger European countries following (a British Crown dependency Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>got</b> there first ahead of any country, late in 2015) and others such as Canada (most popular on desktops; iOS still more popular, ranked first). For one week late in November 2016, Windows 10 overtook first rank from Windows 7 in the United States, before losing it again; it becomes more popular every weekend.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a <b>man</b> <b>got</b> hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

25|$|Act One {{begins as}} the alarm in Mal and Jill's bedroom goes off, and Mal reaches for it. They rise for breakfast, and Sam, their son, {{tries to get}} Jill to sign a {{permission}} form for an after-school drama group without Mal knowing, but Mal finds the form and rips it up. It is unclear what Mal does not like about it, other than claiming acting is men prancing around in tights. Sam is openly contemptuous of his father, whilst Mal is openly disappointed with his son, unlike his daughter, Chrissie, who worked hard at school, found her <b>man,</b> <b>got</b> pregnant and got married (in that order). Mal's prized son-in-law, Dean, arrives at the house, and prior to setting off for work together, Dean speaks of how successful his marriage is (his proudest example being his wife making him cooked breakfast every day apart from Sunday when he makes her breakfast).|$|E

Combinations were formed, to be speedily dissolved under {{the crack of the}} Little whip." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1957, Fisher {{told his}} artist friends {{he was going}} south on a seven-week vacation. Less than three weeks later, acting on Häyhänen's information, {{surveillance}} was established near Fisher's photo studio. On May 28, 1957, in a small park opposite Fulton Street, FBI agents spotted a man acting nervously. From time to time the <b>man</b> <b>got</b> up, walked around, and eventually left.

500|$|The next {{match was}} between the Big Boss Man, {{accompanied}} by Slick, and [...] "The Bird Man" [...] Koko B. Ware. With Slick as a distraction, the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match. After crushing Koko in {{between himself and the}} turnbuckle with a jumping Avalanche, Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match. Instead, he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Koko stomach-first, but missed. The Bird Man then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin. Boss <b>Man</b> <b>got</b> his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned, and he slammed his opponent into the mat, allowing him to pin Koko for the win.|$|E

[...] I get 3 cents a dozen for eggs. [...] I'm lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream. [...] Will you tell me what I've got to lose?" [...] and a cheer went over the audience. [...] I knew then what the result of the election was going to be.|$|E

2500|$|That evening, {{the storm}} increased. [...] Comet drifted closer to Daunt rock. [...] When she was 60 {{yards from the}} rock, as {{darkness}} approached, the Coxswain decided the only option {{was to try to}} get alongside and for the crew to jump for the lifeboat. He knew the dangers. On the first attempt, one <b>man</b> <b>got</b> on board, on the second attempt no one jumped; a third time, and five men were safe. The lifeboat went in a fourth and fifth time, and again no one was able to make it. Two men were still on board, clinging to the rails, too exhausted to jump. On the sixth attempt, as the Mary Stanford came alongside, the two were seized by the lifeboat crew and dragged aboard. [...] (This moment was depicted on the postage stamp) ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{dark green}} Jeep Cherokee, {{registration}} number L808 RDT, travelling {{at a speed}} estimated by a witness as about 30mph (48km/h), struck security bollards in a terror ramming attack at the main entrance to Glasgow Airport. The vehicle {{was reported to have}} several petrol containers and propane gas canisters on board. One eyewitness said flames issued from beneath the car when it hit the building, while another eyewitness said it appeared the driver was trying to drive through the terminal doors. According to reports, the car was occupied by two [...] "Asian-looking" [...] men. When the Jeep failed to explode, one man (later identified as Abdulla) threw petrol bombs from the passenger seat and the other (Ahmed) doused himself in petrol and set it alight. Police indicated the vehicle burst into flames when it was driven at the terminal. An eyewitness noted that a <b>man</b> <b>got</b> {{out of the car and}} began to fight with police. Another eyewitness said that the man was throwing punches and repeatedly shouting [...] "Allah". The man was arrested and later identified as Bilal Abdulla, a UK-born doctor of Iraqi descent who was working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Another man exited the car and ran into the terminal building while he was on fire and began writhing on the ground, before being kicked in the testicles by an airport employee, John Smeaton, who was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his heroism. Sky News reported that petrol was spread from containers by the occupants when they got out of the car. During the subsequent investigation propane gas canisters were removed from the car. A Strathclyde Police spokesman confirmed the two men in the car were arrested, one of them badly burned. The man was initially taken to Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley before being transferred to the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary due to it having a specialist burns unit, where he died on 2 August. The Jeep was removed early on the morning of Sunday 1 July before flights resumed and the airport was partially reopened.|$|E
