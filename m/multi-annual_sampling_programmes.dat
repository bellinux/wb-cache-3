40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that sand {{can serve as a}} vehicle for {{exposure}} of humans to pathogens at beach sites, resulting in increased health risks. Sampling for microorganisms in sand should be considered for inclusion in regulatory programmes aimed at protecting recreational beach users from infectious disease. In an effort to provide recommendations for sand <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> in the original article, we outlined published guidelines for beach monitoring programmes, currently focused exclusively on measuring microbial levels in water. We also provided background on spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of microbes in sand, as these factors influence <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes.</b> First steps toward establishing a sand <b>sampling</b> <b>programme</b> include identifying appropriate beach sites and use of initial sanitary assessments to refine site selection. A tiered approach is recommended for monitoring. This approach would include the analysis of samples from many sites for faecal indicator organisms and other conventional analytes, while testing for specific pathogens and unconventional indicators is reserved for high-risk sites. Given the diversity of microbes found in sand, studies are urgently needed to identify the most significant aetiological agent of disease and to relate microbial measurements in sand...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation tool {{to aid the}} design of nutrient monitoring programmes in coastal waters. The tool is developed by using time series of water quality data from a Smart Buoy, an in situ monitoring device. The tool models the seasonality and temporal dependence in the data and then filters out these features to leave a white noise series. New data sets are then simulated by sampling from the white noise series and re-introducing the modelled seasonality and temporal dependence. Simulating many independent realisations allows us to study the performance of different monitoring designs and assessment methods. We illustrate the approach using total oxidised nitrogen (TOxN) and chlorophyll data from Liverpool Bay, U. K. We consider assessments of whether the underlying mean concentrations of these water quality variables are sufficiently low; i. e. below specified assessment concentrations. We show that for TOxN, even when mean concentrations are at background, daily data from a Smart Buoy or <b>multi-annual</b> <b>sampling</b> from a research vessel {{would be needed to}} obtain adequate power...|$|R

40|$|As an {{integral}} part of the UK food surveillance scheme, routine food sampling is undertaken by officers at local councils. One of the main purposes of the food <b>sampling</b> <b>programme</b> is to detect food contaminants before they are sold to the public. This paper investigated the current UK food sampling activity undertaken by the local Environmental Health Departments and examined the effectiveness of the food programme. A national survey was undertaken by means of a questionnaire sent to 439 UK local authorities and a response rate of 39. 2 % (172 LAs) was achieved. Thirty-nine per cent of replies indicated that ensuring food safety and hygiene was the most important aim of sampling. Less than half of the returns suggested that their food programmes contributed to the prevention of foodborne illness. However, over three-quarters agreed that the current food sampling system could be improved upon. This study concluded that current UK food sampling is marginalized by financial constraints. In order to design an effective routine food programme, it should be based on an overall co-ordinated approach from local to European levels.

40|$|Integrated geophysical, geochemical and hydrogeological {{modelling}} {{techniques have}} been used in this PhD research study to characterise the ground contamination at four study sites. The primary aim of the research is to study the efficiency of using an integrated approach to study hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination in the subsurface soil, geology and groundwater systems. Each of the four sites have different industrial legacies (hence types of contamination) and periods of operation. The sites in increasing age are: Bromsgrove landfill, Cathays Railway Depot, Barry Docks and Weston-Super-Mare gasworks. The geophysical methods used in this study are Electrical Resistivity imaging (IRIS) and multifrequency ground conductivity (Gem- 2). These techniques can map the electrical properties of the sub-surface in both 2 D and 3 D. The electrical properties are then compared with independent professional geochemical <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> for both soil and groundwater. The results of this project show that the geophysical methods provide a clear indication of the zones of ground contamination (hydrocarbons and heavy metals) in both 2 D and 3 D. Electrical resistivity/conductivity mapping using both independent techniques show consistent results. The geophysical results also show a good correlation with the geochemical <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> for soil, water and gas. The results are encouraging in that geophysics could be used more widely in professional contaminated land site investigations to supplement conventional invasive techniques and <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes.</b> The research has also investigated whether geophysical parameters such as electrical conductivity {{could be used as a}} groundwater modelling parameter in the Visual Modflow software. The advantage being that geophysics can provide a high intensity of data in 3 D and even temporal 4 D at a site. The geophysical results can define an accurate spatial distribution of the contaminated area. This can be used to assign a ‘concentration recharge’ in the modelling compared to the normal practice of using chemical data from a small number of discrete sampling points. However this approach will still require chemical data for validation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring of {{effluent}} discharges {{from industrial}} establishments discharging directly into municipality sewers {{is one of}} the major water pollution control activities conducted by municipalities. For largely industrialised municipalities the task can be quite expensive and not effective if <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> are not properly designed. In most cases samples are randomly collected without proper knowledge of the discharge patterns of various industries. As a result the information obtained does not give a good reflection of the quality of effluent being discharged. These problems can be resolved by adapting a statistical approach to the design of <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes.</b> This approach is useful in determining the frequency of sampling, the number of samples needed to estimate the average concentration of target pollution indicator parameters and the magnitude of the uncertainty involved. The benefits and applications of this approach are demonstrated by a case study presented in this paper.

Little has been documented {{about the influence of}} potential error in these data on the precision of assessments and the management information they produce. This paper presents the results of a study of the precision of North Sea herring fish market sampling carried out by the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands. Data from eight years of market sampling were analysed to obtain the precision of estimated numbers-at-age in the catch. The market sample data was then used to estimate 1000 realisations of the international catch-at-age and mean weightsat- age in the catch. Three methods of estimating the variability of missing catch data were used and three options for the catch-at-age matrices were computed. These base datasets were utilised to obtain 1000 assessments conditional on the ICA (Integrated Catch-at-age Analysis) model.

40|$|Kimberlite and lamproite {{exploration}} programmes {{have traditionally}} been underpinned by systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes,</b> aimed at identifying anomalous concentrations of kimberlite indicator minerals (KIMs) proximal to the host rocks. These 'pathfinders', which typically include {{one or more of}} the phases ilmenite, eclogitic and peridotitic garnets, chromite, Cr-rich diopside, occasionally olivine, and sometimes diamond, tend to concentrate as a lag halo around the source rocks because of their relatively high densities compared to more abundant crustal minerals such as quartz and feldspar [...] Dispersion of the KIMs away from the parent rocks by processes such as fluvial and glacial transport, and longshore currents in lacustrine or marine environments, typically results in decreasing concentrations away from the source. However, distal re-concentration of pathfinder minerals may occur in geomorphic settings which act as traps or sinks for relatively dense phases. It is important to distinguish between proximal and distal pathfinder concentrations at an early stage, not only because of the time and cost associated with <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes,</b> but also with the view to planning ongoing exploration to locate the ultimate source rocks.

40|$|Documenting {{establishment}} and spread of invasive species requires extensive co-ordinated <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes.</b> Identifying the factors promoting or inhibiting local {{establishment of an}} invasive species can improve capacity to predict further spread and underpin strategies to limit spread. Here, a structured <b>sampling</b> <b>programme</b> {{was used to assess}} the current distribution of feral populations of Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, in Ireland. Sixty-nine sites were sampled using a standardised protocol combining semi-quantitative and quantitative approaches. Sites were chosen to represent variation in proximity to aquaculture and a range of environmental variables. Oyster populations were found at 18 locations, with densities ranging from single individuals to nine individuals per m 2. The broad size range of oysters found is indicative of more than one recruitment event. Logistic regression indicated that feral oysters were positively associated with the presence of hard substrata or biogenic reef, long residence times of embayments and large intertidal areas. There was also a tendency for oysters to occur disproportionately in bays with aquaculture, but > 500 m from it. Small-scale analysis within sites showed that oysters were almost exclusively attached to hard substrata and mussel shell. The approach taken here provides a rigorous repeatable methodology for future monitoring and a detailed basis for the prediction of further spread. This is the post print version of the article.
