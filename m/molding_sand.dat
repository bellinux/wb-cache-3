25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. The <b>molding</b> <b>sand</b> becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the <b>molding</b> <b>sand</b> from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} of defect is metal penetration, which occurs when the liquid metal penetrates into the <b>molding</b> <b>sand.</b> This causes a rough surface finish. This is caused by sand {{particles}} which are too coarse, lack of mold wash, or pouring temperatures that are too high. An alternative form of metal penetration into the mould known as veining is caused by cracking of the sand.|$|E
