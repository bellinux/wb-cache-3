40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of weakly <b>magnetized</b> and strongly <b>magnetized</b> relativistic jets {{embedded in a}} weakly <b>magnetized</b> and strongly <b>magnetized</b> stationary or weakly relativistic (v = c/ 2) sheath have been performed. A magnetic field parallel to the flow is used in these simulations performed by the new GRMHD numerical code RAISHIN used in its RMHD configuration. In the numerical simulations the Lorentz factor $\gamma = 2. 5 $ jet is precessed to break the initial equilibrium configuration. In the simulations sound speeds are $\lesssim c/\sqrt 3 $ in the weakly <b>magnetized</b> simulations and $\lesssim 0. 3 c$ in the strongly <b>magnetized</b> simulations. The Alfven wave speed is $\lesssim 0. 07 c$ in the weakly <b>magnetized</b> simulations and $\lesssim 0. 56 c$ in the strongly <b>magnetized</b> simulations. The results of the numerical simulations are compared to theoretical predictions from a normal mode analysis of the linearized relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations capable of describing a uniform axially <b>magnetized</b> cylindrical relativistic jet embedded in a uniform axially <b>magnetized</b> relativistically moving sheath. The theoretical dispersion relation allows investigation of effects associated with maximum possible sound speeds, Alfven wave speeds near light speed and relativistic sheath speeds. The prediction of increased stability of the weakly <b>magnetized</b> system resulting from c/ 2 sheath speeds and the stabilization of the strongly <b>magnetized</b> system resulting from c/ 2 sheath speeds is verified by the numerical simulation results.

Do we get nearer the truth or farther from it that we have got a gas or an imponderable fluid instead of a spirit? We go on exorcising one thing after another, but what boots it? The evasive genius flits into something else, and defies us. The powers of the outer and inner world form hand in hand a magnetic circle for whose connection man is necessary. It is the imagination that takes his hand and clasps it with that other stretched to him in the dark, and for which he was vainly groping. It is that which renews the mystery in nature, makes it wonderful and beautiful again, and out of the gases of the man of science remakes the old spirit. But we seem to have created too many wonders to be capable of wondering any longer; as Coleridge said, when asked if he believed in ghosts, that he had seen too many of them.
