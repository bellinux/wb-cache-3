40|$|Abstract. Multifunctional {{materials}} {{are created by}} intimately integrating different materials. The assessment of the local properties and composition of the different components of such a multifunctional material necessarily relies on techniques with sufficient spatial resolution. The increased use of these microanalysis or microprobe techniques has created a demand for appropriate quality assurance tools, such as reference materials. In this paper {{a number of issues}} related to the certification of reference materials for multifunctional {{materials are}} discussed. Examples of reference materials are shown to illustrate the particular challenges the reference material producer is faced with such as micro-homogeneity, minimum sample intake and stability. Principles of Reference <b>Material</b> <b>Certification</b> Reference Materials for Analytical Quality Assurance. The accuracy and reliability of methods and techniques for the analysis of the composition or property of a material become increasingly critical, also in view of laboratory accreditation requirements. Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA) is based on three pillars: validated methods, proficiency testing, and reference materials.

40|$|The quality {{assurance}} (QA) environment for highway construction has been changing rapidly {{over the past}} years pushed by budget reductions, new testing methods and the use of alternative project delivery methods. The objective of this research effort is to define the state-of-practice for risk-based QA optimization practices in departments of transportation (DOTs) and to propose a framework to help QA resource allocation decision making. The context for this objective is construction projects across their full range of type, size, complexity and project-delivery method. The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review, national survey, interviews with eight DOTs and a Delphi process to achieve the research’s objective. The first results of this research is discovery that DOTs optimize their QA approach depending on a material’s variability or project’s characteristics. However, DOTs are currently inconsistent in how they optimize practices QA for alternative delivery methods. The results are shown in a framework that provides five levels of QA practices across a spectrum of visual inspection, <b>material</b> <b>certification,</b> and sampling and testing. Secondly, the framework revealed that the optimization model structure is sound and that the theoretical modeling techniques originating in economics (e. g., Kirkpartick 1974) have practical application to infrastructure construction. The Delphi process showed that the total cost of quality (CoQ) was optimized when the highest level of QA effort was selected...|$|E

40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of genetically}} modified organisms (GMOs) in food and feed is commonly carried out by event-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) requiring the use of certified reference materials (CRMs) for the calibration of the qPCR step. Those same CRMs can also {{be included in the}} measurement process as quality control samples. The CRMs ERM-BF 415 e, ERM-BF 427 c and ERM-BF 425 c are mixtures of dried conventional and genetically modified maize NK 603, maize 98140 and soya 356043 seed powders, respectively. Based on a gravimetric approach, they were prepared and certified for their GMO content expressed as a mass fraction. In a later certification campaign, which required the establishment of analytical quality criteria for the quantification of GMOs described here, they were certified additionally for their genetically modified (GM) -DNA copy numbers in relation to target taxon-specific DNA copy numbers calculated in terms of haploid genomes (DNA copy number ratio). For the three certification campaigns of ERM-BF 415 e, ERM-BF 427 c and ERM-BF 425 c in which the GMO content was measured as DNA copy number ratio, interlaboratory comparisons were run with a large number of expert laboratories. Quality criteria for the evaluation and scrutiny of qPCR raw data were established, such as cut-off limits for the coefficient of determination (R 2), PCR efficiency and reproducibility. In this manuscript, different data evaluation approaches for qPCR raw data from the three interlaboratory comparisons were compared and the impact on the mean DNA copy number ratio and its standard deviation has been assessed. The importance of raw data evaluation and data filtering is discussed and its relevance not only for GMO reference <b>material</b> <b>certification</b> campaigns but also for routine GMO measurements is shown.

40|$|The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements has {{organised}} an {{interlaboratory comparison}} (ILC) {{to allow the}} participating laboratories to demonstrate their proficiency in particle size and zeta potential measurements on monomodal aqueous suspensions of silica nanoparticles in the 10 – 100 nm size range. The main goal of this ILC was to identify competent collaborators {{for the production of}} certified nanoparticle reference materials. 38 laboratories from four different continents participated in the ILC with different methods for particle sizing and determination of zeta potential. Most of the laboratories submitted particle size results obtained with centrifugal liquid sedimentation (CLS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) or electron microscopy (EM), or zeta potential values obtained via electrophoretic light scattering (ELS). The results of the laboratories were evaluated using method-specific z scores, calculated on the basis of consensus values from the ILC. For CLS (13 results) and EM (13 results), all reported values were within the ± 2 |z| interval. For DLS, 25 of the 27 results reported were within the ± 2 |z| interval, the two other results were within the ± 3 |z| interval. The standard deviations of the corresponding laboratory mean values varied between 3. 7 and 6. 5 %, which demonstrates satisfactory interlaboratory comparability of CLS, DLS and EM particle size values. From the received test reports, a large discrepancy was observed in terms of the laboratory’s quality assurance systems, which are equally important for the selection of collaborators in reference <b>material</b> <b>certification</b> projects. Only a minority of the participating laboratories is aware of all the items that are mandatory in test reports compliant to ISO/IEC 17025 (ISO General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories.

40|$|Reference {{materials}} for particulate matter (PM) on filter media {{are not available}} for the quantification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air. This {{is due to the}} difficulty of obtaining reference material that has a homogeneous distribution on a filter surface that is large enough for characterization and distribution. High volume sample filters from different locations and seasons were considered to validate the feasibility of the use of quartz filters as reference material for PAH concentrations. A rapid thermal desorption (TD) technique coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was applied to characterise the material for the content of fifteen different PAHs. TD technique allowed for rapid and accurate analysis of small sections of filter (5 mm diameter), leaving enough material for the production of twenty sub-filter cuts (42 mm diameter) {{that could be used for}} distribution and control. Stability and homogeneity tests required for <b>material</b> <b>certification</b> were performed as indicated by the ISO guide 34 : 2009 and ISO 35 : 2006. The contribution of the heterogeneous distribution of PAHs on the filter surface resulted generally lower than 10 % and higher for more volatile PAHs. 1 year of storage at - 18 ºC indicated no significant variation in PAH concentrations. Nevertheless, a methodology for shipping and storing of the filter material at ambient temperature in especially designed plastic envelopes, was also shown to allow for stabile concentrations within twenty days. The method accuracy was confirmed by the analysis of NIST SRM 1649 a (urban dust) and PAH concentrations were validated against the reference values obtained from an inter-laboratory exercise. In case of benzo[a]pyrene for masses quantified between 100 pg and 10 ng the TD method provided expanded uncertainties of circa 10 %, while the inter-laboratory reference value uncertainties ranged between 15 and 20 %. The evaluation of these results supports the use of the presented methodology as a valid approach for the certification of PAH concentrations in PM 10 quartz filters. The methodology allows for the production of a certificate of analysis for a single high volume filter, the concentration of which can easily be adjusted by selecting an appropriate sampling location.

40|$|In 2009 the Alfred-Wegener-Institute {{organised}} an inter-laboratory comparison for analysing {{the oxygen}} isotope compositions of biogenic silica. The {{relationship of the}} oxygen isotope compositions of carbonate to climate-relevant parameters is widely utilized. However, challenges still exist {{in the use of}} biogenic silica. Problems arise during the sample preparation stage and during the isotopic analysis itself. The problems are commonly related to the removal of loosely bound exchangeable oxygen from the silica. Amorphous silica contains OH groups within the SiO 2 skeleton as well as chemically combined water. The OH groups and chemically combined water must be removed prior to analysis as their oxygen is easily exchanged following silica formation and thus does not reflect the original isotopic composition of the water. Various methods have been established in the past 20 years for the dehydration and dehydroxylation of amorphous silica, including Controlled Isotopic Exchange (CIE) followed by fluorination, Stepwise Fluorination (SWF) and inductive High-Temperature carbon reduction (iHTR). A new method under consideration is Helium Flow Dehydration (HFD) followed by fluorination. These methods have never been compared in a comprehensive interlaboratory comparison. This inter-laboratory comparison should function as a method performance study as well as a <b>material</b> <b>certification</b> study. The studys goals are: 1. To evaluate the agreement of &# 948; 18 O results in terms of accuracy and reproducibility among different methods in different laboratories, and 2. To provide the &# 948; 18 OSi community with well-calibrated biogenic standards covering a large range of &# 948; 18 O values. The second goal is related to the current existence of only one quartz standard (NBS- 28) made available by IAEA as a reference material for analysis of oxygen isotopes from SiO 2. There is a need for natural biogenic reference materials with oxygen isotopic compositions in the range of naturally occurring lacustrine and marine sediments. Six different samples so far only used as internal standards in the participating laboratories have been analysed by eight different laboratories using their typical analytical methods. The samples cover a wide-range of &# 948; 18 O values (23 to 43) and originate from lacustrine and marine sediment deposits as well as from chemically precipitated amorphous silica. The samples consist of diatoms, phytoliths or synthetical nano-spheres. Each laboratory has analysed each sample at least ten times on various days to evaluate reproducibility. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses have also been performed to verify the purity and the structure of the proposed standards. The XRF analysis of the six standards indicates SiO 2 contents ranging from 94 to 99 %. The XRD analyses showed that five of the standards have a broad, pure amorphous silica (opal-A) peak whereas one (Kieselguhr) is crystalline, with crystobalite bands resulting from pre-calcination performed by the supplying company. At the time of this abstract submission the laboratories were completing their analyses. Preliminary results will be presented at the meeting. Based on these results, we hope to recommend up to six biogenic silica standards for &# 948; 18 OSi values with a reproducibility of better than ± 0. 3. We will also evaluate the various methods in terms of the analytical uncertainties accompanying each approach...|$|E

An ETU is required to be both flight-like, nearly identical to a flight unit without the need for <b>material</b> <b>certifications,</b> and demonstrate structural and performance integrity. A prototype breadboard design previously demonstrated the feasibility of meeting flight performance requirements using magnetic bearings. The chopper mechanism is a critical component of the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) which will be flown on EOS-CHEM (Earth Observing System-Chemistry). Particularly noteworthy are the science requirements which demand high precision positioning and minimal power consumption along with full redundancy of coils and sensors in a miniature, lightweight package. The magnetic bearings are unique in their pole design to minimize parasitic losses and utilize collocated optical sensing. The motor is of an unusual disk-type ironless stator design. The ETU design has evolved from the breadboard design. A number of improvements have been incorporated into the ETU design. Active thrust control has been added along with changes to improve sensor stability, motor efficiency, and touchdown and launch survivability. It was necessary to do all this while simultaneously reducing the mechanism volume. Flight-like electronics utilize a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and contain all sensor electronics and drivers on a single five inch by nine inch circuit board.
