5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
25|$|Who could {{sanction}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Babi Yar, or my {{protests against}} the (1968) Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia? Only I criticised Khrushchev to his face; not even Solzhenitsyn did that. It is only the envy of people who couldn't stand against the propaganda machine, and they invented things about my generation, the artists of the '60s. Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of our dreams were doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.|$|E
500|$|The band also {{recorded}} interludes with Primus bass player and singer Les Claypool and MTV VJ Matt Pinfield. Claypool stated, [...] "I {{came in and}} they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> some sort of intro for the record. I got stoned and got {{in front of the}} mic and started babbling and they ended up not using the intro and using that instead." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1966, Dylan told Ralph Gleason: Rolling Stone's {{the best}} song I wrote." [...] In 2004, {{speaking}} to Robert Hilburn, Dylan still {{felt that the}} song had {{a special place in}} his work: [...] "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that, it gives you the song and it goes away. You don't know what it means. Except that the ghost picked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the song." ...|$|E
500|$|The spanking thing started because I {{believed}} that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character. Warren [...] asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|E
500|$|Since she had {{not seen}} the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to Broadway to better {{understand}} the theme that [...] "even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich." [...] The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill. She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because [...] "Dre was really pushing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> in a new way", but when she presented him with the song, [...] "he just totally tricked the track out." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} had a moment in which <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> you. Even now I write with the {{greatest}} press upon <b>me,</b> meaning <b>to</b> <b>write</b> in detail in a day or two.|$|R

500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his dissatisfaction, Dylan wrote 20 pages of verse he later described as a [...] "long piece of vomit". He reduced this to a song with four verses and a chorus—"Like a Rolling Stone". He told Hentoff that writing and recording the song washed away his dissatisfaction, and restored his enthusiasm for creating music. Describing the experience to Robert Hilburn in 2004, nearly 40 years later, Dylan said: [...] "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that... You don't {{know what it means}} except the ghost picked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would. Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they had asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Barbie, I would have done that, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Cuomo remarked, [...] "I {{came out}} of it pretty angry. But ironically, it {{inspired}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> another song." [...] Jacknife Lee produced the track with the band in early 2008 in what was the third and final recording session for the album. The many references to popular culture in the song are said to be a [...] "statement of defiance" [...] according to Internet reviewer David Ritter, who later describes it to be an [...] "anti-anthem anthem" [...] that opens up a [...] "broad space for critical exploration {{of what it means to}} be an [...] aging band in the major label system".|$|E

500|$|... "Welcome to the Family" [...] {{features}} {{a recording of}} Andrew Wade's heart beat {{towards the end of}} the track. The title track, [...] "Homesick", was written as one piece, before being split into two songs, which the band thought didn't work well and changed it back to one song. McKinnon said he was [...] "proud" [...] of the track: [...] "My parents were really happy when they first heard it: My dad is always worried about me and my mom really did ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> her some soft songs. I finally did." [...] "Holdin' It Down for the Underground" [...] came about after McKinnon lost two family members and writing the song helped him relieve the pain.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of Moș Nichifor Coțcariul by Junimea illustrated its ambivalence toward Creangă. Maiorescu found the text [...] "interesting {{in its way}} and decisively Romanian", but asked Convorbiri Literare journal to either modify it or refrain from publishing it altogether. This was complemented by its author's own self-effacing assessment: calling the text [...] "a childish thing", he suggested to Maiorescu that revisions were needed, stating [...] "I have written it long, {{because there was no}} time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it short." [...] Contrarily, the writer's posterity referred to it as one of the greatest Romanian contributions to the genre: according to George Călinescu, the insight into Nichifor's musings resulted in transforming the writing as a whole into [...] "the first great Romanian novella with a stereotypical hero", while Voinescu described the entire story as [...] "a true masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'I {{wrote it}} because it was {{necessary}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it,' Mariah said of her most personal, and angriest, song to date. Fans might be surprised at her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{tells the}} story of an {{independent}} woman who was apprehensive about being in a relationship in fears of being rejected, she finally allows herself to break her emotional and communication barriers when she begins to fall in love. Clarkson revealed that she finds herself similar to the titular [...] "Miss Independent". She said, [...] "It's very funny when the song came into play with me ... 'cause at that certain time of my life, I was actually going through that kind of thing," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I've always been real guarded about work and career. It wasn't even with, like, guy relationships, it was just, like, friends and just letting people in, you know? And so it was kinda weird 'cause I was going through that same thing at the same time, so it was very easy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the bridge to the song." ...|$|E
500|$|The Programme was {{initially}} hesitant about producing the Manual, which promised to draw even more war resisters and publicity to it. [...] "The [...] didn't even want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it", Satin says. [...] "I wrote it at night, in the SUPA office, {{three or four}} nights a week after counseling guys and gals 8 to 10 hours a day– pounded it out in several drafts over several months on SUPA's ancient Underwood typewriter." [...] When it finally appeared, some leading periodicals helped {{put it on the}} map. [...] For example, The New York Review of Books called it [...] "useful", and The New York Times said it contains advice about everything from how to qualify as an immigrant to jobs, housing, schools, politics, culture, and even the snow. [...] After the war, sociologist John Hagan found that {{more than a third of}} young American emigrants to Canada had read the Manual while still in the United States, and nearly another quarter obtained it after they arrived.|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} topic, Firrell has said: [...] "I {{felt there was}} a problem with writing because of {{narrative}} - because it unfolds in time necessarily, and I was jealous of the painters where everything in painting is available in a single field. Simply, I wanted to make words work like a picture and that led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> aphorisms. When I wrote All Men Are Dangerous, I wrote something of immense truthfulness and importance with all of its meaning entirely available in a single field." ...|$|R

500|$|Jeffrey Blitz {{wanted the}} film's music to be [...] "sweet {{and a touch}} melancholy and just a step out of rhythm", demonstrating Hal's sense of himself in the world, and to express his teenage angst while [...] "maintain an {{underlying}} sweetness". While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele that I never played... And Jeffrey [...] had gotten a little bee in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at one point I started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Alice Vincent of The Daily Telegraph gave the song {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "delights <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> that this is a return to 'Just Dance'-era Gaga: a simple, infectiously catchy slice of floor-filling, stadium-cheering pop". She also complimented the [...] "rich timbre" [...] of Gaga's vocals on the song, and her emoting. For Jess Denham from The Independent, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] sounded more rock-oriented than [...] "Just Dance" [...] or [...] "Poker Face"; she also complimented the vocals, compared the verses to work by singer Bruce Springsteen, and added that the track was [...] "as catchy as they come and sure to prove a club banger". Idolator's Robbie Daw described Gaga as a [...] "rock goddess". The [...] "dark and grungy" [...] sound of the track was relegated more towards Born This Way, rather than the songs from Artpop. Daw ended the review saying that it was a departure from Gaga's dance-pop work of her early career.|$|E
500|$|In Lauper's first {{effort at}} {{writing for the}} stage, she found that it {{required}} a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters. [...] Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: [...] "How much of a stretch is it for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?" [...] The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included {{a wide range of}} voices. Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her iPhone, and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down. Oremus would then [...] "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs" [...] and orchestrate the material. The songs range in style [...] "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics". [...] New York Times critic Melena Ryzik wrote: [...] "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations." [...] The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.|$|E
