40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} the problem of <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> <b>coverage</b> of ground areas using a group of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) equipped with image sensors. The solution {{is divided into two}} parts: (i) the task modeling as a graph whose vertices are geographic coordinates determined {{in such a way that}} a single UAV would cover the area in minimum time; and (ii) the solution of a mixed integer linear programming problem, formulated according to the graph variables defined in the first part, to route the team of UAVs over the area. The main contribution of the proposed methodology, when compared with the traditional vehicle routing problem’s (VRP) solutions, is the fact that our method solves some practical problems only encountered during the execution of the task with actual UAVs. In this line, one of the main contributions of the paper is that the number of UAVs used to cover the area is automatically selected by solving the optimization problem. The number of UAVs is influenced by the vehicles’ maximum flight time and by the setup time, which is the time needed to prepare and launch a UAV. To illustrate the methodology, the paper presents experimental results obtained with two hand-launched, fixed-wing UAVs...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} concurrent task and path planning {{for a number of}} surveillance Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) such that a user defined area of interest is covered by the UGVs’ sensors in minimum time. We first formulate the problem, and show that it is in fact a generalization of the Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MTSP), which is known to be N P-hard. We then propose a solution that decomposes the problem into three subproblems. The first is to find a maximal convex covering of the search area. Most results on static coverage use disjoint partitions of the search area, e. g., triangulation, to convert the continuous sensor positioning problem into a discrete one. However, by a simple example, we show that a highly overlapping set of maximal convex sets is better suited for <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> <b>coverage.</b> The second subproblem is a combinatorial assignment and ordering of the sets in the cover. Since the Tabu search algorithm is known to perform well on various routing problems, we use it as a part of our proposed solution. Finally, the third subproblem utilizes a particular shortest path subroutine in order to find the vehicle paths, and calculate the overall objective function used in the Tabu search. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by a number of simulation examples...|$|E

Here the trajectory generation problem is first considered as a <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> control problem. The analysis of the resulting set of complex optimality conditions shows that the <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> trajectories are produced by bang-bang control laws and can be characterized by some few geometric parameters. Then regular <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> convergence trajectories can be defined. For practical considerations it appears necessary to solve on line this problem. Taking into consideration the structure of the regular <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> convergence trajectories, an equivalent mathematical programming problem is formulated.. An off line exhaustive solution approach, based on reverse dynamic programming, is proposed to cover a large set of initial relative positions.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> path {{planning}} strategy is proposed for multi points manufacturing problems in drilling/spot welding tasks. By optimizing the travelling schedule {{of the set}} points and the detailed transfer path between points, the <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> manufacturing task is realized under fully utilizing the dynamic performance of robotic manipulator. According to the start-stop movement in drilling/spot welding task, the {{path planning}} problem can be converted into a traveling salesman problem (TSP) {{and a series of}} point to point <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> transfer path planning problems. Cubic Hermite interpolation polynomial is used to parameterize the transfer path and then the path parameters are optimized to obtain minimum point to point transfer time. A new TSP with <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> index is constructed by using point-point transfer time as the TSP parameter. The classical genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to obtain the optimal travelling schedule. Several <b>minimum</b> <b>time</b> drilling tasks of a 3 -DOF robotic manipulator are used as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
