It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, {{with a piece of}} atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|E

I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more.

40|$|Mirror to My Thoughts {{evolved from}} three dialogues. It was a sunny Wednesday {{afternoon}} and, as I sat meditating my attack on my beloved Apple Crumble, Pete Cobb leaned {{to my left}} and asked if I had considered a Doctorate. Naturally I was mildly perplexed at the distraction, {{but in the same}} breath intrigued. Could it be simply the right place, the right time? Some weeks earlier, Stanford University were in negotiations with me regarding a visiting professorship for the fall which incorporated a retrospective exhibition curated by Professor Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz. I did the calculations – dates, times, what was required, but, more importantly, whether I was able to intellectually abridge 20 years of practice into a single document that would come to fruition in the same season. It seemed appropriate. Some time after Pete Cobb's proposition, I sat in my studio and listed <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> <b>life's</b> work, arranging it into major themes. It was at this point I began to see reflecting back at me a concentrated, complex, thought-provoking resource that was honest and true. Works on identity, perception and degrees of separation were just a few themes that were referenced in a number of key works...|$|R

The exploit was achieved with a combination of information provided to the hackers by Amazon's tech support through social engineering, and the password recovery system of Apple which used this information.

[...] "It's funny how one door closes and another opens," [...] Diamont said.

500|$|The {{band was}} given a small budget to film the music video. McIlrath remarked that the band {{did not want to}} make a video that felt [...] "really cheesy or overproduced", and instead wanted to {{incorporate}} the song's message. The night before filming began, the band performed at a local venue, and asked the audience members to star in the video; several audience members came the following day. The subway car featured in the video continued to make its regular stops, while the band and the actors performed. During one scene in the video, the vandals sneak into the local zoo, and deface a tiger cage with a sticker that says [...] "I've spent <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> <b>life</b> trapped in a cage".

He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E

It was those final years that were the crucial period for me. Illusions there met up with reality. I have since come to appreciate the rightness of a quotation I recently read, one made by a statesman, now dead, who said: [...] "The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie - deliberate, contrived and dishonest - but the myth - persistent, persuasive and unrealistic."
