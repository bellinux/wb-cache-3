25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. <b>My</b> <b>primary</b> reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit <b>my</b> <b>primary</b> care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Bourguiba {{settled in}} the bourgeois {{neighborhood}} of Tourbet el Bey, in the medina of Tunis, where his brother M'hamed rented a housing on Korchani Street. Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare {{the first half of}} the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. [...] "To go to school", he recalled, [...] "I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, I crossed the souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to ask my older brother to buy me a new pair. That was my life throughout <b>my</b> <b>primary</b> education". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba had to go home and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger.
