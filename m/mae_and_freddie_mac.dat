5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, UBS {{settled a}} lawsuit filed against it and 17 other banks by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the U.S. federal agency that oversees Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac,</b> with a payout of US$885 million, but without UBS having to admit any wrongdoing.

5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac.</b> In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, Schumer {{proposed}} that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> conforming loan ("affordable") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.|$|R

5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac.</b> During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} policy {{response}} to the 2007 – 09 financial crisis {{from the perspective of}} a senior Treasury official at the time. Government agencies faced severe constraints in addressing the crisis: lack of legal authority for potentially helpful financial stabilization measures, a Congress reluctant to grant such authority, and the need to act quickly in the midst of a market panic. Treasury officials recognized the dangers arising from mounting foreclosures and worked to facilitate limited mortgage modifications, but going further was politically unacceptable because public funds would have gone to some irresponsible borrowers. The suddenness of Bear Stearns’ collapse in March 2008 made rescue necessary and led to preparation of emergency options should conditions worsen. The Treasury saw Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac’s</b> rescue that summer as necessary to calm markets, despite the moral hazard created. After Lehman Brothers failed in September, the Treasury genuinely intended to buy illiquid securities from troubled institutions but turned to capital injections as the crisis deepened. ...|$|R

25|$|On July 11, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that U.S. government officials were considering {{a plan for}} the U.S. government to take over Fannie Mae and/or <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis. Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> smaller <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump.

25|$|On May 8, 2013, Representative Scott Garrett {{introduced}} the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, {{if it were}} passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac.</b> The bill would require {{that the cost of}} direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.|$|E
25|$|Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac,</b> are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E
