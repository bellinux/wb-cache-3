5|$|In the {{following}} months, {{a number of}} war criminals {{from the ranks of}} the Waffen-SS were released. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> made eligible for prisoner-of-war compensation from local governments. In 1956 the Federal Ministry of Defence announced that former members of the Waffen-SS, up to the grade of lieutenant colonel, would be accepted to the Bundeswehr at their old rank.|$|E
5|$|Shahumyan had a {{population}} of about 20,000, of whom 85 percent were ethnic Armenian. While the Armenian volunteers pledged to defend and protect civilians living in Shahumyan from Azerbaijani incursions, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> told to stay away by the inhabitants themselves to save the villages and the entire district from violence.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose {{to the position of}} a military governor (jiedushi) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> slain or changed their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that {{little is known about the}} Sogdian presence in North China since that time. Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.|$|E
5|$|Johann Strauss I's {{influence}} over the local entertainment establishments meant that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> wary of offering the younger Strauss a contract for fear of angering the father. Strauss Jr. was able to persuade the Dommayer's Casino in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, {{to allow him to}} perform. The elder Strauss, in anger at his son's disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to ever play at the Dommayer's Casino again, which had been the site of many of his earlier triumphs.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, more Texian {{settlers}} joined the group at La Bahía. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack. Austin ordered that 100men remain at Goliad, {{under the command of}} Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards Béxar.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese {{immigrants}} {{had been}} in Hawaii since the whaling days. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> mixed blood Afro-Portuguese sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of racial bias towards them. The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the Azores and Madeira in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus. They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their own culture.|$|E

5|$|The OT {{supplied}} {{supervisors and}} labour {{as well as}} organising supplies, machinery and transport to supplement the staff and equipment of construction companies, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> German however construction companies in occupied counties bid for contracts. Companies could apply for OT work or could be conscripted. Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was always possible as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, or taken over or merged with another firm to make a more efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Second Army {{consisted}} of five infantry divisions: (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories. The {{quality of the}} officer corps has also been questioned. One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers. Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.|$|E
5|$|The term ildebrandshuse (English: fire houses) today {{refer to}} a type of townhouses that was built in large numbers in the years {{immediately}} after the fire. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> modelled on generic renderings made by Johan Cornelius Krieger with inspiration from Christof Marselis. The houses are two or three storeys high, five bays wide and have a prominent wall dormer. The façade towards the street is in brick {{while the rest of the}} house has timber framing. They are typically painted in bright colours. Well-preserved examples are today found in locations such as Gråbrødretorv and Gammel Mønt.|$|E

Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge's {{speech was}} well received, and he {{attracted}} some admirers on its account; {{towards the end}} of the term, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate. Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without sufficient personnel to man many of its ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> sold to foreign nations. This left the United States as the world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the Howitt {{report on}} the {{development}} of pig production in the United Kingdom was published. Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British pig farmers should focus on three breeds only: the Welsh, the British Landrace, and the Large White. The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds, including the Large Black. By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> extinct. The Large Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E
