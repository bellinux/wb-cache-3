50|$|The Outer Marker, which {{normally}} identifies the {{final approach fix}} (FAF), is situated on the same course/track as the localizer and the runway center-line, four to seven nautical miles before the runway threshold. It is typically located about 1 NM km inside {{the point where the}} glideslope intercepts the intermediate altitude and transmits a 400 Hz tone signal on a low-powered (3 watts), 75 MHz carrier signal. Its antenna is highly directional, and is pointed straight up. The valid signal area is a 2400 ft × 4200 ft ellipse (as measured 1000 ft above the antenna.) When the aircraft passes over the outer <b>marker</b> <b>antenna,</b> its marker beacon receiver detects the signal. The system gives the pilot a visual (blinking blue outer marker light) and aural (continuous series of audio tone morse code-like 'dashes') indication.|$|E
5000|$|BVP-1 LOS (light {{observation}} system) - Is a Czech-built reconnaissance vehicle {{based on}} the DP-90 equipped with three smoke grenade launchers {{on each side of}} the turret, GPS, a generator and a computer. It also has an elevatable telescopic mast mounted on the dummy unmanned BVP-2 turret with a day/night television camera, a laser rangefinder and a laser target <b>marker.</b> <b>Antennae</b> mounts {{on each side of the}} rear part of the hull's roof are also available. The Czech army plans to deploy these vehicles in BVP-2 companies, hence the similarity to the BVP-2.Photos ...|$|R
40|$|Method and {{apparatus}} {{are provided}} {{for determining the}} velocity of individual food particles within a liquid/solid food mixture that is cooked by an aseptic cooking method whereby the food mixture is heated as it flows through a flowline. At least one upstream {{and at least one}} downstream microwave transducer are provided to determine the minimum possible travel time of the fastest food particle through the flowline. In one embodiment, the upstream detector is not required. In another embodiment, a plurality of small dipole <b>antenna</b> <b>markers</b> are secured to a plurality of food particles to provide a plurality of signals as the markers pass the upstream and downstream transducers. The dipole <b>antenna</b> <b>markers</b> may also include a non-linear element to reradiate a harmonic frequency of a transmitter frequency. Upstream and downstream transducers include dipole antennas that are matched to the impedance of the food slurry and a signal transmission cable by various impedance matching means including unbalanced feed to the antennas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDrosophila {{antennae}} {{is gaining}} attention {{to study the}} hearing molecules and its mechanism in last few decades. Various molecules required {{for the formation of}} hearing organ is conserved between Drosophila and human being. This suggests Drosophila {{can be used as a}} model organism to decipher the vertebrate hearing mechanism. In this context a protocol describing the fixation, sectioning and staining of antennae is lacking from the literature. The current paper describes various commercially available <b>markers</b> of the <b>antennae</b> to visualise it under confocal microscope...|$|R
40|$|We present here, {{the results}} of a {{campaign}} of measures carried on between August 25 th and September 8 th, 1999,in Ny-Ålesund, to tie the reference point of the VLBI antenna on the ground marks. A number of Leica retro-targets has been attached (glued) all over the structure of the antenna, and their positions determined (horizontal and vertical angles, along with distance whenever it was possible) with respect to a local reference network. The positions of two points at opposite edges of the elevation axis have also been pinpointed and measured (only horizontal and vertical angles. in this case), to determine the vertical component of the reference point and to measure the offset between the elevation and azimuth axes. The local reference network has been measured using direct and inverse intersection depending on different position and mutual visibility of pillars. Occasionally some pillars have been measured using both methodologies. Furthermore, trigonometric levelling has been performed for connecting the levelling bolts of the six closest pillars to the 3 -D network adjustment results and therefore obtain an univocal determination of the height of the VLBI reference point tight to the altimetric control network. The positions of several <b>markers</b> on the <b>antenna</b> have been measured for 8 antenna azimuth angles, uniformly spread along 360 degrees, in steps of 45 degrees, with the VLBI antenna at the same elevation angle, nearly at the zenith direction. In order to test the position of the elevation axis, we did similar measures on a selected number of <b>markers</b> at different <b>antenna</b> elevation angles, in the range from 90 to 45 degrees, in steps of 15 degrees, for a fixed azimuth angle. The analysis of these measures provide both coordinates for the position of the reference point of the VLBI antenna, and an estimate of the offset between the elevation and azimuth axes in the antenna of Ny-Ålesund. The offset vector from the reference pillar selected (marker 91) is X= 21. 830 ± 0. 001 m and Y= 18. 787 ± 0. 001 m, while the height referred to the levelling bolt of the same pillar (marker 91 b) is Z= 10. 269 ± 0. 001 m. In the last section we list some suggestions for modifications of the local reference network around the VLBI antenna in order to simplify similar future campaigns of measurements...|$|R
