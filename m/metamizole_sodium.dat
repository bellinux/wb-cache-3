It is widely used to treat elevated blood pressure and as a general-purpose tranquilizer/sedative. Despite the -lol suffix, the drug is not a beta-blocker. Corvalol is so common in Eastern Europe that, in 1996, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation included it in the list of mandatory items in all Russian passenger vehicle first aid kits, alongside such drugs as aspirin, <b>metamizole</b> <b>sodium</b> (branded Analgin), nitroglycerin, and activated charcoal.|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical and electrophoretic {{behavior}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>metamizole</b> {{under conditions of}} variable pH has been studied. Voltammetric results indicate that <b>sodium</b> <b>metamizole</b> behaves as a quasi-reversible system over the potential window considered. These studies were complemented with capillary zone electrophoresis analysis in order to know the starting composition of solutions of <b>sodium</b> <b>metamizole</b> at different pH valúes and buffer composition. Among degradation products, {{the extent of the}} active metabolite 4 -methylaminoantipyrine was found to be media dependent as well as was the appearance of different degradation products. Consequently, the extent of the oxidation process in voltammetric studies is dependent on the composition of the starting solutions. Information obtained by cyclic voltammetry and capillary zone electrophoresis has been concordant and conclusive in that both methods {{can be used in a}} qualitative study of <b>sodium</b> <b>metamizole,</b> under the experimental conditions assaye...|$|R
40|$|In Brazil, {{in order}} for a {{pharmaceutical}} company to register a drug form as generic or ‘similar’ with the Brazilian food and drug agency (Anvisa), it must be proved bioequivalent to its innovatory branded form (reference drug). This requires comparative trials, carried out in conformity with official compendia (Brazilian Pharmacopeia or another officially recognized code). Additionally, according to the Anvisa resolution RDC 31 / 2010, the dissolution profile of the drug must be tested and compared with that of the branded reference, as a benchmark of quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the quality of 500 mg <b>sodium</b> <b>metamizole</b> (dipyrone) tablets produced by seven different laboratories in Brazil: three generic drugs (G 1, G 2, G 3), three (branded) similar drugs (S 1, S 2,S 3) and their reference branded product (Novalgina®, Sanofi-Aventis, drug R). All tests were carried out by methods specified in the Brazilian Pharmacopeia 4 th edition (Farmacopeia Brasileira IV). The following tests were performed: uniformity of mass, friability, disintegration time, hardness, assay, uniformity of dosage units, salicylic acid limit assay, dissolution and identification. The dissolution profile was also recorded, as recommended in RDC 31 / 2010. Whereas every sample was approved in all the Farmacopeia Brasileira IV tests, the results in the dissolution profile test showed that four of the test drugs (G 1, G 2, S 1 and S 2) were notpharmaceutically equivalent to drug R. Thus, only drugs G 3 and S 3 showed dissolution profiles similar to that of drug R and the other four drugs could not be considered equivalent to it and were not approved...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to study the ability to inhibit urease by some {{pharmaceutical}} compositions that are promising in the prevention of tuberculosis reactivation. In particular, according to a number references sources, quercetin is able to successfully inhibit urease by a non-competitive mechanism. Another compound - dipyrone (metamizol sodium) according to preliminary molecular modeling has a pharmacophore structure similar to urea. Materials and methods. The biochemical studies (urease activity) of some substances effect on urease was carried out. As the leader substances – inhibitors was used quercetin and metamizole, another substances are not shown inhibition activity on the urease. As the substrate a 0. 5 % aqueous urea solution was used. The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 37 ° C, the incubation time was 10 minutes. The activity of urease was determined by the color reaction with the hypochlorite reagent. Photometry was performed on a FEK- 3 M photoelectric colorimeter at a wavelength of 590 nm. Results and discussion. Quercetin and <b>metamizole</b> <b>sodium</b> have the strongest inhibitory properties for urease, since the lowest values of semi-inhibitory concentrations are obtained for them. In the presence of chlorophyllipt, the inhibitory activity of quercetin against urease is not suppressed. Metformin showed no inhibitory activity against urease, and it was low for other substances. Conclusion. The highest anti-urease activity showed a composition based on <b>metamizole</b> <b>sodium</b> and quercetin, a little less - based on quercetin and vitamin D. Also interesting for further research is the composition of quercetin and chlorophyllipt...|$|E

Results: The levels of axonal degeneration of the rats in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 A, and  8 were found to be significantly higher compared to the levels of the rats in the control group (...|$|E
40|$|Metamizole is an {{effective}} non-opioid analgesic drug used {{in the treatment of}} acute and chronic pain. Due to induced potentially life-threatening blood disorders, metamizole was withdrawn from market {{in many parts of the}} world, however, it is one of the most popular analgesics in Poland that is available as an over the counter drug. Patients tend to prefer capsules over tablets, as they are easier to swallow and taste better. The powder-filled capsules also have greater bioavailability and require less excipients, as compared to tablets. Polymic excipients are mainly used in capsule filling, and have influence upon the physico-chemical properties of the hard gelatin capsules and the powder formulation. The aim of the study was to determine whether various combinations of polymers impact the disintegration time and pharmaceutical availability of hard gelatin capsules with <b>metamizole</b> <b>sodium.</b> The results of our work demonstrated that the 80 % of all active substance was released in all tested formulations within 15 minutes. Herein, the capsule containing lactose monohydrate had the longest release (4 % after 2 min.), while capsules containing mannitol had the fastest release (81. 2 % after 2 min.). Moreover, the addition of HPMC to capsules with lactose brought about a slight increase in the metamizole release rate, while the addition of PVP 30 to capsules with microcrystalline cellulose slightly accelerated release. This data suggests that the use of different polymers in capsules formulation brings about changes in the physical properties of powders and modifies the release profile of metamizole. In our study, the most preferred formulation was one containing microcrystalline cellulose (good powder properties and fairly fast release) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{medicines}} rational use exists {{all over the}} world. It concerns particularly analgesics, antipyretics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In Ukraine the side effects caused by non-steroidal antiphlogistics rank the second place according to the prevalence among all registered cases. The objective of the research was to analyze adverse drug reaction report forms concerning adverse reactions caused {{by the use of}} NSAIDs, analgesics, antipyretics, and were submitted during 2015 to the Vinnytsia regional unit of the State Expert Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. The conducted research showed that 1460 cases of adverse reactions (AR) or lack of efficacy of medication (LOE) were registered in Vinnytsia region in 2015. Among all registered cases of AR with proven causal relationships (94. 4 %) caused by NSAIDs, there were 42. 4 % of AR caused by diclofenac sodium, 24. 2 % caused by ibuprofen, 10. 6 % caused by paracetamol, 9. 1 % caused by analginum (<b>metamizole</b> <b>sodium)</b> and 7. 6 % caused by nimesulide. The classification of patients according to age showed inhomogeneity in these medications prescription: ibuprofen and acetaminophen were taken mostly by teenagers, analginum was raken by young people and older people took mostly nimesulide. Diclofenac retained the stable position of “the gold standard” in the treatment and was evenly administered to patients of all ages. In addition, diclofenac and nimesulide were determined to be mostly prescribed to patients with rheumatologic pathology and ibuprofen, paracetamol and analgin were prescribed for the treatment of acute respiratory viral infections (hyperthermal syndrome). It should be noticed that allergic reactions dominated among the manifestations of adverse reactions of the studied drugs...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: O termo polifarmácia, ou seja, a utilização concomitante de múltiplos fármacos pelo mesmo indivíduo vem sendo amplamente associado a pacientes institucionalizados e idosos, no entanto pode ocorrer em grupos de pacientes portadores de doenças crônicas como artrite reumatoide (AR). OBJETIVO: Quantificar a polifarmácia em um grupo de pacientes com AR e realizar um levantamento sobre o risco de potenciais interações indesejáveis entre os medicamentos utilizados no manejo dessa doença e os fármacos utilizados em enfermidades não crônicas. MÉTODOS: Realizou-se um estudo de coorte com 103 pacientes portadores de AR, atendidos no Componente Especializado da Assistência Farmacêutica/MS, Florianópolis/SC. Os pacientes foram acompanhados mensalmente, por meio de fichas. As interações medicamentosas foram identificadas pelo Drugdex System - Thomson Micromedex® - Interactions. RESULTADOS: Observou-se a presença de polifarmácia em 95, 1 % dos pacientes e de 19 potenciais interações indesejáveis entre os medicamentos utilizados por 74 pacientes, em média 3, 0 ± 1, 2 interações/paciente. Todas as potenciais interações estavam relacionadas a metotrexato. Omeprazol foi o {{principal}} representante, correspondendo a 29, 3 % delas, seguido por diclofenaco sódico (17, 6 %) e dipirona sódica (13, 2 %). CONCLUSÃO: Considerando que este estudo confirma que a polifarmácia é uma prática comum na terapêutica dos pacientes portadores de AR, deve haver maior vigilância acerca de efeitos adversos ou de redução da efetividade de determinados fármacos devido às suas interações farmacológicas INTRODUCTION: The term polypharmacy, {{meaning the}} concomitant {{use of multiple}} medications by one individual, has been widely reported in institutionalized or elderly patients. It can, however, occur in patients with chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVE: To quantify polypharmacy {{in a group of}} RA patients and to assess the risk of potential undesirable interactions between medications used for managing RA and those used for non-chronic diseases. METHODS: A cohort study was carried out with 103 RA patients registered at the Strategy of Access to Medications from the Brazilian Health Ministry, at the School of Pharmacy of the city of Florianópolis, state of Santa Catarina. Patients were monthly followed up by use of form completion. Drug interactions were identified by use of the Drugdex System - Thomson Micromedex® - Interactions database. RESULTS: Polypharmacy was found in 95. 1 % of the patients, and 19 potential undesirable interactions were observed between the drugs used by 74 patients (mean of 3. 0 ± 1. 2 interactions/patient). All potential interactions were related to methotrexate. Omeprazole was the major representative, accounting for 29. 3 % of the interactions, followed by diclofenac sodium (17. 6 %), and <b>metamizole</b> <b>sodium</b> (13. 2 %). CONCLUSION: Considering that this study confirms that polypharmacy is a common therapeutic practice in RA patients, it is worth emphasizing the need for greater surveillance regarding the adverse effects or effectiveness reduction of certain drugs due to drug interactio...|$|E
