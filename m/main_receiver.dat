Millions of ethnic Germans fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid economic expansion, and became the dominant economy in Western Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of NATO, but without access to nuclear weapons. The Franco-German friendship became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the European Union. In 1989, the Berlin Wall was destroyed, the Soviet Union collapsed and East Germany was reunited with West Germany in 1990. In 1998–1999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the eurozone. Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about one quarter of the eurozone's annual gross domestic product.

30|$|We {{analyze the}} total power {{consumption}} in three cases {{to determine the}} total power consumption's expected value. The first case (case 1 with orange box) addresses the false wake-up packets. This case has two possible cases, case 1 a and case 1 b. One is that the error wake-up packet has been received by wake-up radios with matched wake-up ID addresses, {{the other one is}} that the error wake-up packet has been received by wake-up radios without any matched wake-up ID addresses. In the earlier case, the wake-up radios will acknowledge the sender as they receive the matched wake-up ID addresses. The sender will send the message to wake-up radios. The wake-up radios find that the message's ID address does not match their own wake-up ID addresses. Then, the wake-up radios send retransmission requests to sender, and then they go to sleep. Regarding the message's ID address, it is the same as wake-up ID address. The wake-up radio receives the wake-up signal's wake-up ID address and the message's ID address from sender. It can compare the wake-up ID address with the message's ID address to know if both of them are correct or one of them is incorrect. If the wake-up ID address matches the message's ID address, then both of them are correct. If wake-up ID address does not match the message's ID address, then one of them is incorrect. In this case, the wake-up radio will request retransmission. In the latter case, the wake-up radios will not acknowledge the sender, as mismatched wake-up ID addresses, and go to sleep. As the wake-up receiver is separate from the <b>main</b> data <b>receiver,</b> they have different bit error rates. In case 2, we discuss the <b>main</b> data <b>receiver's</b> error from the noise. If the wake-up ID is correct and the correct wake-up receiver ACKs, then the message received by the <b>main</b> data <b>receiver</b> might be incorrect as the <b>main</b> data <b>receiver</b> has its own bit error rate, which is different with the wake-up receiver. The second case (case 2 with green boxes) addresses the false message. The correct wake-up radio receives the false message and sends retransmission request to sender. Other wake-up radios go to sleep after they receive the correct wake-up packets. The third case (case 3 with blue boxes) addresses a successful wake-up packet and a successful message. Only the correct wake-up radio will acknowledge the sender as it receives a correct wake-up packet and a correct message.

40|$|Since {{the middle}} 1980 's, as {{consequence}} of the worldwide process of liberalization, {{there has been an}} important rise in international capital flows, especially Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In particular, {{during the second half of}} 1990 ’s, worldwide FDI inflows grew four times faster than domestic output, twice as fast as domestic investment and three times as fast as exports. However, the geographical distribution of these flows of international capital was highly uneven. The <b>main</b> <b>receivers</b> of these FDI inflows were the most-developed countries. The developing countries only received approximately 30 % of the worldwide FDI inflows. At the same time, there has been a decrease in the speed of economic convergence among countries and regions. Between 1950 and 1990 the rate of convergence has been around 2 % annually, but from the mid 1980 ’s, this rate decreased to the 0. 2 %- 0. 5 % level on an annual basis. Immediately, a question arises: could the very high share of international capital directed to the most-developed countries, be one reason for the slowdown in the rate of economic convergence?. Most studies on the effects of the internationalization of production processes in economic growth have identified the liberalization process with international trade, excluding the effects of FDI and its consequences on regional convergence. However, the liberalization process has increased not only trade, but also international capital flows. In this paper we address this last point. The main objective is to analyze the possible relationship among FDI and economic convergence. In particular, we present arguments which support the hypothesis that FDI inflows could be one of the elements helping to slowdown the speed of convergence in recent years. We show, on one hand, that FDI is an "engine of growth", the same as international trade. The main reason is that FDI is not merely a transfer of capital. FDI contributes to strengthening the economic structure on the host country, modernizes and internationalises it as well. FDI is usually accompanied by specific intangible assets of the transnational corporation, changes in production systems and/or technological innovations, among others. There is not doubt that all these factors generate positive growth effects in the target destination. On the other hand, we show that the <b>main</b> <b>receivers</b> of this FDI are not the developing countries. The developed countries, with more than two-thirds of the worldwide FDI inflows dominate the global picture. So, if these facts are analysed together, it is possible to show that the positive effects of FDI on economic growth are concentrated mainly in the most developed countries. From this point, the negative effect of FDI on economic convergence is an obvious result. ...|$|R

30|$|Feedback {{has been}} {{considered}} a key tool for helping students to improve performance. Traditional feedback usually relates to learners’ mechanisms of communication with their teachers and colleagues. As mentioned in the previous section, {{the use of technology}} adds new possibilities for tracking learners’ activity and offers them more immediate feedback about their learning performance. However, most efforts to use learning analytics focus on providing information for instructors in order to refine their pedagogical strategies (Knight et al., 2013). Very rarely are students considered the <b>main</b> <b>receivers</b> of learning analytics data or given the opportunity to use the information to reflect on their learning activity and self-regulate their learning more efficiently. Some authors warn that learning analytics could actually disempower learners by making them reliant on institutional feedback (Buckingham Shum et al. 2012). Most analytics studies have drawn on historical data to identify patterns in students’ learning behaviour which are then related to academic performance and/or retention. However, much of this work lacks an understanding of the pedagogical context that influences student activities, and how identifying patterns in students’ learning behaviours can be used to influence and contribute to more positive teaching and learning experiences. Essentially there is a knowledge gap for teachers attempting to bridge the divide between the information provided by learning analytics and the types of pedagogical actions designed by teachers to support learning. The field of learning design offers a way to address this gap by helping teachers to articulate the design and intent of learning activities which {{can be used as a}} guide for interpreting learning analytics data.|$|R
40|$|Dendritic spines may be tiny in volume, but are {{of major}} {{importance}} for neuroscience. They are the <b>main</b> <b>receivers</b> for excitatory synaptic connections, and their constant changes {{in number and}} in shape reflect the dynamic connectivity of the brain. Two-photon microscopy allows following the fate of individual spines in brain slice preparations and in live animals. The diffraction-limited and non-isotropic resolution of this technique, however, makes detection of such tiny structures rather challenging, especially along the optical axis (z-direction). Here we present a novel spine detection algorithm based on a statistical dendrite intensity model and a corresponding spine probability model. To quantify the fidelity of spine detection, we generated correlative datasets: Following two-photon imaging of live pyramidal cell dendrites, we used Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBEM) to reconstruct dendritic ultrastructure in 3 D. Statistical models were trained on synthetic fluorescence images generated from SBEM datasets via Point Spread Function (PSF) convolution. After the training period, we tested automatic spine detection on real two-photon datasets and compared the result to ground truth (correlative SBEM data). The performance of our algorithm allowed tracking changes in spine volume automatically over several hours. Using a second fluorescent protein targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, we could analyze the motion of this organelle inside individual spines. Furthermore, we show {{that it is possible}} to distinguish activated spines from non-stimulated neighbors by detection of fluorescently labeled presynaptic vesicle clusters. These examples illustrate how automatic segmentation in 5 D (x, y, z, t, λ) allows us to investigate brain dynamics at the level of individual synaptic connections...|$|R

Four organizations are analyzed: the Red Cross; Save the Children; PLAN Sweden; and We Effect. The main focus is on their campaigns and outreaching work connected to these campaigns. The analysis is based on a qualitative discourse analysis of the material complemented by a semiotic approach. The developing world is presented as old-fashioned and out obsolete. The problems existing there are simplified and insufficient solutions are offered. Children are commonly occurring and often presented as the <b>main</b> <b>receivers</b> of the support even though the support is available for all ages. Women are over-represented, while men are rarely occurring. However, men are indirect portrayed as the perpetrators and thus the notion of men is present, presenting them as dangerous and irresponsible.

Despite that the organizations work all over the world the pictures mainly show black women and children. Overall the developing world is depicted as dependent on others to reach positive development. Difference is accentuated, which could increase prejudices and stereotypes.
