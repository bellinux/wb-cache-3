It also provides buyers' evaluation of the preferred carrier on the same attributes to examine the performance gaps in the services offered by the line.

50|$|Besides being {{impressive}} landmarks and {{key elements}} in the city defenses, fortification towers often served as important navigation marks. Within the precinct of the Beirut castle, a small tower referred to as Burj al-Musallah functioned as a leading <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> approaching <b>ships.</b> Sailors found safe access to the Beirut harbor by setting a course that kept Burj al-Musallah in line with Burj al-Kashef on Martyrs’ Square. Both were demolished in 1892. The southeastern tower of the Crusader castle was separated from the land by a 14-meter-wide moat. Hidden in the western wall of the tower was a secret exit, discovered {{at the level of}} the moat. In the Umayyad period, Beirut was a fortified city. The Crusader commander, Jean d’Ibelin, took control of Beirut in 1197 and undertook renovation works on the castle. When Mamluk troops captured the city from the Crusaders in 1291, they partly demolished the fortifications. Bombardments by a Russian fleet in 1827 and a British fleet in 1840 gave the final blow to the damaged castle. It became militarily obsolete and was never rebuilt.|$|R

60|$|In {{walking over}} the workyard at Arbroath this morning, the writer {{found that the}} stones of the course {{immediately}} under the cornice were all in hand, and that a week's work would now finish the whole, while the intermediate courses lay ready numbered and <b>marked</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> to the rock. Among other subjects which had occupied his attention to-day was a visit {{from some of the}} relations of George Dall, a young man who had been impressed near Dundee in the month of February last; a dispute had arisen between the magistrates of that burgh and the Regulating Officer as to his right of impressing Dall, who was bonâ fide one of the protected seamen in the Bell Rock service. In the meantime, the poor lad was detained, and ultimately committed to the prison of Dundee, to remain until the question should be tried before the Court of Session. His friends were naturally very desirous to have him relieved upon bail. But, as this was only to be done by the judgment of the Court, all that could be said was that his pay and allowances should be continued {{in the same manner as}} if he had been upon the sick-list. The circumstances of Dall's case were briefly these:--He had gone to see some of his friends in the neighbourhood of Dundee, in winter, while the works were suspended, having got leave of absence from Mr. Taylor, who commanded the Bell Rock tender, and had in his possession one of the Protection Medals. Unfortunately, however, for Dall, the Regulating Officer thought proper to disregard these documents, as, according to the strict and literal interpretation of the Admiralty regulations, a seaman does not stand protected unless he is actually on board of his ship, or in a boat belonging to her, or has the Admiralty protection in his possession. This order of the Board, however, cannot be rigidly followed in practice; and therefore, when the matter is satisfactorily stated to the Regulating Officer, the impressed man is generally liberated. But in Dall's case this was peremptorily refused, and he was retained at the instance of the magistrates. The writer having brought the matter under the consideration of the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses, they authorised it to be tried on the part of the Lighthouse Board, as one of extreme hardship. The Court, upon the first hearing, ordered Dall to be liberated from prison; and the proceedings never went further.|$|R

500|$|On 20 July 1973, the Australian {{government}} decided that Sydney {{was to be}} decommissioned.

Several suggestions for disposal were made by various companies and agencies. The Geelong Regional Tourist Authority wanted the ship moored in Corio Bay for use as a maritime museum, convention centre, and floating casino. The Naval History Society of Australia suggested that the island superstructure be removed and located in The Rocks as a maritime museum, while the owners of the Sydney Opera House planned to use the ship as a floating car park. Tenders closed on 7 October 1975, and the ship was sold on 30 October for breaking up as scrap metal to the Dongkuk Steel Mill in Seoul, South Korea for A$673,516. Sydney was towed from her namesake city by a Japanese tugboat on 23 December 1975, leaving at 1300 hours.|$|R
50|$|On 10 April 1898 {{the first}} Navy Bill {{was passed by}} the Reichstag. It {{authorised}} the maintenance of a fleet of 19 battleships, 8 armoured cruisers, 12 large cruisers and 30 light cruisers to be constructed by 1 April 1904. Existing ships were counted in the total, but the bill provided <b>for</b> <b>ships</b> to be replaced every 25 years on an indefinite basis. Five million marks annually was allocated to run the navy, with a total budget of 408 million <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> shipbuilding. This would bring the German fleet to a strength where it could contemplate challenging France or Russia, but would remain clearly inferior to the world's largest fleet, the Royal Navy.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Navy had {{identified}} {{the need for}} a rapid-firing, multi-barrelled close-range anti-aircraft weapon at an early stage. Design work for such a weapon began in 1923 based on the earlier Mark II, undoubtedly to utilise the enormous stocks of 2-pounder ammunition left over from the First World War. Lack of funding led to a convoluted and drawn-out design and trials history, and it was not until 1930 that these weapons began to enter service. Known as the QF 2-pounder Mark VIII, it is usually referred to as the multiple pom-pom. The initial mounting was the 11.8 to 17.35 ton, eight-barrelled mounting Mark V (later <b>Mark</b> VI), suitable <b>for</b> <b>ships</b> of cruiser and aircraft carrier size upward. From 1935, the quadruple mounting Mark VII, essentially half a Mark V or VI, entered service <b>for</b> <b>ships</b> of destroyer and cruiser size. These multiple gun mounts required four different guns and were nicknamed the [...] "Chicago Piano". The mount had two rows each of two or four guns. Guns were produced in both right- and left-hand and [...] "inner" [...] and [...] "outer" [...] so that the feed and ejector mechanisms matched. Single-barrelled mounts, the Mark VIII (manual) and Mark XVI (power operated), were also widely used, mainly in small escorts (such as the Flower-class corvettes) and coastal craft (especially early Fairmile 'D' motor gunboats). The Mark XVI mounting was related to the twin mounting <b>Mark</b> V <b>for</b> the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and the [...] "Boffin" [...] mounting for the Bofors 40 mm gun. An interesting feature was the very large magazine, from 140 rounds per gun for the eight-barrelled mount, to 56 rounds for the single mounts. This large ammunition capacity gave the eight-barrelled mount the ability to fire continuously for 73 seconds without reloading. A high velocity (HV), 1.8 lb. (820 g), round was developed for the pom-pom, just prior to World War II, which raised the new gun muzzle velocity from 2,040 ft/s (622 m/s) to 2400 ft/s (732 m/s). Many older mountings were modified with conversion kits to fire HV ammunition, while most newly manufactured mounts were factory built to fire HV ammunition. A mount modified or designed for HV ammunition was given a '*' designation; for example a Mk V mount modified for HV ammunition would be designated Mk V*.|$|R
