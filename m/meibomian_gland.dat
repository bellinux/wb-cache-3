40|$|A novel {{method that}} {{provides}} complex assessment of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> morphological and functional state — biometry of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> — was developed. The results of complex examination (including <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> biometry), correlation analysis data and clinical findings demonstrate direct {{association between the}} objective (i. e., <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> dysfunction by biomicroscopy, tear film break-up time / TBUT, symptomatic TBUT, compression testing) and subjective signs of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> dysfunction (patient’s complaints) and the parameters of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> biometry. High direct correlation between biometrical index and compression test result was revealed (p = 0. 002, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0. 6644). <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> dysfunction is characterized by biometric parameters abnormalities, i. e., dilatation of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> orifices, decrease of distance between <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> orifices, partial or total atrophy of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> (even up to gland collapse with its visual reduction and increase of distance between the glands). The suppression of inflammatory process and the recovery of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> secretion improve biometric parameters and result in the opening of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> orifices, liquefaction of clogs, evacuation of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> secretion, narrowing of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> orifices and increase of distance between them. The proposed method expands the armamentarium of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> dysfunction and lipid-deficient dry eye diagnosing. <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> biometry can be applied in specialized ophthalmological hospitals and outpatient departments. It is a simple procedure of short duration that does not require any special equipment or professional skills. <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> biometry enables to prescribe pathogenically targeted therapy and to improve quality of life.  </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{study the}} utility of meibography for the {{morphology}} of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> in normal eyelids and in various eyelid diseases. DesignA cross-sectional study. MethodsA newly designed transilluminator, fitting both the upper along with lower eyelids, and an infrared camera were used to obtain video clips of the <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> for 60 asymptomatic subjects with normal eyelid margin. Parameters studied included, ocular surface, Schirmer test, and tear breakup time (TBUT). The <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> of patients with meibomian glands’ abnormality secondary to infectious, inflammatory, malignant, congenital, or post-radiation therapy disease related etiologies were compared with normal patients. Still pictures were extracted from the video clips to evaluate the <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> for gland dropout and gross morphological changes. ResultsIn normal subjects, <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> appeared to be thinner and longer in the upper eye lids than in the lower eye lids. Gland dropout occured with increased age, more in the lower eye lid and in females. Excessive gland drop out (> 75 %) was seen in patients with history of trachoma, Stevens Johnson syndrome, severe blepharitis, and post-radiation for orbital tumors. Variable gland drop out was noticed in patients with floppy eyelid syndrome, and blepharitis. In patients with congenital distichiasis, partial or complete gland drop out at {{the part of the}} eyelid margins affected by distichiasis was noticed. ConclusionsThe newly designed transilluminator permitted the examination of both upper and lower eye lid <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> with minimal discomfort. Evaluating the anatomical changes involving <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> with meibography may help increase our understanding of the meibomian gland-related diseases, monitor the effects of treatment, and provide helpful information for patient education...|$|R

25|$|Isotretinoin {{is known}} to cause <b>meibomian</b> <b>gland</b> {{dysfunction}} which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). It has also been found to cause salivary gland dysfunction in some people, causing xerostomia (dry mouth). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of {{the cells of the}} exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some patients after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy.|$|E
25|$|Ocular tumors* in {{dogs are}} found in the eyelid, conjunctiva, third eyelid, cornea, sclera, iris, ciliary body, retina, choroid, optic nerve, and orbit. The most common types are <b>Meibomian</b> <b>gland</b> adenoma (eyelid), {{papilloma}} (eyelid), melanoma (eyelid, conjunctiva, sclera, iris, ciliary body, choroid), squamous cell carcinoma (conjunctiva), adenoma (ciliary body), adenocarcinoma (ciliary body), lymphoma (retina, choroid, ciliary body), medulloepithelioma (retina, choroid), ganglioglioma (retina, choroid), osteosarcoma (orbit), mast cell tumor (orbit), and optic nerve sheath meningioma.|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the modern diagnosis of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> dysfunction (MGD) increases daily. Firstly, it is caused by changing of the perception about the prevalence of this disease, according to various data it is from 40 to 71 % {{of the population in}} different age groups. Considering the increasing number of patients suffering from MGD, there is the need to develop screening methods for diagnosis of this disease. Screening methods should be available not only for specialists involved in the treatment of xerosis keratoconjunctival in specialized ophthalmology clinics, but also in out-patient sector. An important aspect in the diagnosis of the severity of the functional disorders of the <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> is the assessment of morphological status that determines the further choice of therapy. To evaluate the morphological and functional state of the <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> proposed to use biometrics of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands.</b> A slit lamp is used for examination. Furthermore, objective data characterizing the morpho-functional state of the <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands,</b> can be obtained by carrying out meibography. Authors used not only white light but also infrared light for the visualization of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> during meibography. The multifunctional ophthalmic devices equipped with infrared lighting can be used for lighting. For example, specialized slit lamps, corneal topographs, Sheympflyug camera, the fundus camera and others. We applied nonmidriatic fundus camera TOPCON TRC-NW 300, using for fotoregistration of the ocular fundus. A feature of the proposed method — meyboskopy — was simplicity and absence of necessity of the investigator skills by scanning with the fundus camera of the inner surface of the eyelid. Meiboskopy doesn’t require  additional equipment and software of the fundus camera and allows to receive objective quality video of <b>meibomian</b> <b>glands,</b> it opens new diagnostic possibilities. Extending of the range of diagnostic capabilities in detecting of MGD based on the screening methods will allow time to assess the severity of this disease and to appoint pathogenetically substantiated therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of prenatal administration of retinoic acid (RA) on the development of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide diaphorase (NADPH-d) positive structures in the rat <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands.</b> One mg/kg of RA was applied to pregnant Wistar rats intraperitonaelly during the gestational period in each of the 12 th- 14 th embryonic days (totally 3 mg/kg). Sections of the central upper eyelids were investigated in rat pups on the 14 th postnatal day. They were processed histochemically for NADPH-d, to study the presence and distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) positive nerve structures. NADPH-d staining of <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> was compared in two groups of rat pups. In the control group, eyelids of 14 day-old rats were studied with no experimental intervention. The second group consisted of rat pups which were prenatally administered the excess of RA. Histochemical analysis of control eyelids revealed numerous NADPH-d well-stained acini of <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> arranged tightly into groups. Intensively stained vessels and NADPH-d/NOS-positive nerve fibers bordered acini of <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands.</b> These structures were present in the submucosal layer as well. The analysis of RA group showed less numerous, shrunken acini of <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands</b> that were seen not only smaller in size, but also in density of their staining and the amount of nitrergic nerve fibers around acini were considerably lowered. In the submucosa differences were noticed compared to the control group, there were numerous NADPH-d stained vessels accompanied by NADPH-d/NOS-positive nerve fibers. The excess of RA during the prenatal period may influence on the development and morphology of NADPH-d positive structures of rat’s <b>Meibomian</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R

25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional <b>meibomian</b> <b>gland</b> are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{and other}} retinoids {{are well known}} to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during {{treatment}} and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent <b>Meibomian</b> <b>Gland</b> Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (keratitis), swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), photophobia and other visual disturbances.|$|E
