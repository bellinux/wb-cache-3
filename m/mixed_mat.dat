40|$|Some {{recent works}} {{revealed}} that deep neural networks (DNNs) {{are vulnerable to}} so-called adversarial attacks where input examples are intentionally perturbed to fool DNNs. In this work, we revisit the DNN training process that includes adversarial examples into the training dataset so as to improve DNN's resilience to adversarial attacks, namely, adversarial training. Our experiments show that different adversarial strengths, i. e., perturbation levels of adversarial examples, have different working zones to resist the attack. Based on the observation, we propose a multi-strength adversarial training method (MAT) that combines the adversarial training examples with different adversarial strengths to defend adversarial attacks. Two training structures - <b>mixed</b> <b>MAT</b> and parallel MAT - are developed to facilitate the tradeoffs between training time and memory occupation. Our results show that MAT can substantially minimize the accuracy degradation of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks on MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CIFAR- 100, and SVHN.

40|$|Polyethylene <b>mixed</b> crystal <b>mats</b> {{have been}} studied after rolling at room {{temperature}} to roll ratios up to 2. 5, using the LOQ instrument at the ISIS pulsed neutron source (RAL, Chilton). Radius of gyration measurements for vertical (R(v)) and horizontal (R(H)) sectors, where the vertical sector includes the roll direction, show that R(H) is virtually unchanged by rolling, whereas R(V) is increased significantly. Combined with an unchanged intensity from extrapolation to zero angle, these results indicate the absence of local melting during deformation. Intermediate angle measurements show a decrease in intensity, while the 'sheet-like' form of the scattering is retained.

40|$|A {{two-stage}} latent prosody model-language model (LPM-LM) -based {{approach is}} proposed to identify two Mandarin accent types spoken by native speakers in Mainland China and Taiwan.

Experimental results on a <b>mixed</b> TRSC and <b>MAT</b> database showed that fusion of the proposed LPM-LM with a SDC/GMM+PPR-LM+UPR-LM baseline system could further reduced the average accent identification error rate from 20. 7 % to 16. 2 %.

40|$|Numbers of {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus) in the Highlands {{have more than}} doubled in the last few decades and {{conservation}} organisations have expressed concern over their potential impacts on the natural heritage. Bryophytes and lichens represent a substantial component of Scottish biodiversity and northwest Scotland has cryptogam assemblages that are rare elsewhere in the world. Few studies have separated the impacts of red deer from those of sheep and none has focused on the response of important bryophyte and lichen assemblages to red deer management. This thesis has started to address this shortfall in scientific knowledge. Research was centred at Letterewe and neighbouring estates near Loch Maree, Wester Ross where there has been no sheep grazing for decades. Existing exclosures were used to compare blocks of cryptogam communities associated with specific habitats either side of the deer fence. In this way bryophyte and lichen species cover, diversity, dominance and richness associated with low-lying siliceous rocks, globally rare wet heath/bog and the internationally important epiphytic Lobarion lichen community were investigated. Other approaches involved comparing cryptogam communities found on boulder tops inaccessible to red deer with those that were accessible, attempting to correlate red deer dung densities with localised impact to liverwort-rich oceanic heath and by contrasting summit moss-heath vegetation between two estates that have different mean deer densities. Liverworts associated with the <b>mixed</b> hepatic <b>mat</b> were also compared either side of a long-standing deer fence at Knoydart. These studies have shown that red deer and their management (using exclosures) have both positive and negative effects on important bryophyte and lichen assemblages in northwest Scotland.

40|$|Achieving {{the desired}} density during field {{compaction}} of asphalt mixes {{is critical to}} meeting the design specifications of an asphalt pavement. Existing techniques measure the density of asphalt mixes at a discrete number of points. As such, the process is cumbersome, time consuming, and is not indicative of the overall compaction achieved unless large amounts of data is collected and analyzed. In this paper, {{the concept of a}} novel neural network-based asphalt compaction analyzer capable of predicting the density continuously, in real time, during the construction of the pavement is presented. The concept is verified using laboratory data from an asphalt vibratory compactor (AVC). The compaction analyzer is based on the hypothesis that a vibratory compactor and the hot <b>mix</b> asphalt (HMA) <b>mat</b> form a coupled system having unique vibration properties. The measured vibrations of the compactor along with the process parameters such as lift thickness, mix type, mix temperature, and compaction pressure can be used to predict the density of the asphalt mat. Vibration data obtained during compaction of asphalt mixes in the laboratory is used to design and train the neural network (NN). The trained neural network is then used to continuously predict the degree of compaction in real time. Th...|$|R
40|$|Good {{knowledge}} of a species' distribution and ecology is important for a successful management. The distribution of species is determined by many factors, among others climatic and topographic factors determining their potential distribution. Other factors such as dispersal mode further affects their actual distribution through the ability to disperse and establish in suitable habitats. In this thesis, the ecology of three species belonging to the nationally and globally rare <b>mixed</b> northern hepatic <b>mat</b> community is assessed in two separate studies, at a regional scale through species distribution modelling (SDM), and at a local scale Scapania nimbosa Taylor through micro-climatic comparison of presence and absence sites in addition to growth measurements. The results from the second study indicate that S. nimbosa grows approximately 4. 68 ± 2. 25 mm during one growth season, although this is probably an under estimate, and the variation between shoots is very large. In the fist study, the SDM for both Anastrophyllum donnianum (Hook.) Steph., Scapania ornithopodioides (With.) Waddell and S. nimbosa predicted highly suitable areas outside the known geographical range at the south-western Norwegian coast, although the model for S. nimbosa could not be interpreted with confidence. It {{was not possible to}} find any difference in micro-climate between presence and absence sites for S. nimbosa. These results indicate that all three species are limited by dispersal rather than habitat in Norway, with suitable absence sites both at a regional scale for all three species, and also at a local scale for S. nimbosa. Anastrophyllum donnianum seems to be limited from reaching highly suitable areas in northern Norway due to a barrier of unsuitable climate mainly due to insufficient summer rain. This area may become suitable if climate change leads to an increase in summer precipitation along the Norwegian coast. Scapania ornithopodioides is absent from northern Norway despite the presence of highly suitable habitats continuously scattered throughout large parts of the western coast. The results suggest that both A. donnianum and S. ornithopodioides prefer high rain frequency and high amount of summer rain, and medium summer temperatures at approximately 10 ͦ C. This is consistent with the current understanding of the ecology for these two species. Areas that stand out as interesting for the search of potentially undiscovered populations include northern Norway, the Fosen peninsula and the Lofoten Islands. Highly suitable areas may also be appropriate for tranlocation of turfs or plant fragments, with the aim at increasing the abundance and geographical range of threatened species. Other studies indicate that in situ regeneration from plant fragments of several <b>mixed</b> northern hepatic <b>mat</b> species is likely to be successful. This is especially relevant for the rare species S. nimbosa, which is vulnerable due to a presumably small geographical range in Norway which may be contracted in the face of climate change, and due to limited dispersal abilities...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} manage and conserve species and plant communities, {{it is important}} to have a good understanding of their ecology and distributions. The three liverwort species Anastrophyllum donnianum, Scapania ornithopodioides and Scapania nimbosa, are restricted to the <b>mixed</b> northern hepatic <b>mat</b> community found in the most oceanic parts of north-western Europe. These species are of conservation concern because they are globally rare with strict environmental requirements and a limited dispersal potential, which makes them vulnerable to disturbance and climate change. In this study we used species distribution modelling to (1) predict their potential distribution in Norway (2) to assess whether they are limited by dispersal or suitable climate, (3) identify which climatic factors are most important in determining their distribution and (4) suggest regions for further field based surveys. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were developed for each species using target-group background data, and five environmental coverage layers. Our results indicate that all three species are limited by dispersal rather than the availability of suitable areas in Norway. In particular, A. donnianum seems to be limited from reaching uncolonised highly suitable areas in northern Norway due to a barrier unsuitable region with insufficient summer rain. S. ornithopodioides is absent from northern Norway despite the presence of highly suitable regions scattered along the coast. The models locate highly suitable areas where conservation measures should be focused when they overlap with known populations. Areas of interest for targeting searches for potentially undiscovered populations are indicated...|$|R
40|$|The Nakivubo swamp {{is located}} in Uganda, near its capital Kampala, and has been {{receiving}} wastewater from Kampala for over 30 years. This swamp consists of a floating root mat co-dominated by the sedges Cyperus papyrus and Miscanthidium violaceum. Tbe partially treated wastewater mostly flows beneath the floating mat into Lake Victoria via the Murchison Bay. Papyrus has a loose floating root mat which facilitates vertical mixing bebfl/een the interstitial mat water and the free water column beneath the mat. This leads to a less steep gradiënt of nutrients over the vertical profile and facilitates nutriënt uptake from the water column by papyrus vegetation. In comparison, Miscanthidium has a thick compact floating root mat. This mat structure prevents free vertical and lateral <b>mixing</b> of the <b>mat</b> water with the water column beneath. This leads to reduced interactions of theplants with wastewater in these zones, and therefore less nutriënt abstraction by plants from the wastewater. Differences in the morphological, hydraulic, physico-chemical, floristic and overall wastewater treatment performance between areas covered by the two major vegetation types were elucidated. Water flow is highly channelised and hydraulic retention times in the swamp during the rainy periods may be as low as 18 hours. Nutriënt uptake and removal efficiency of nutrients and faecal coliforms is higher in zones dominated by papyrus compared to those of Miscanthidium. The potential of this swamp to remove nutrients and pathogens from wastewater in a sustainable way (with emphasis on the description and quantification of their pathways), while maintaining ecological quality and biodiversity, was investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{periodic}} dredging of {{inland waterways}} {{and the subsequent}} disposal of the dredged sediment result in the continuous establishment of contaminated sites. As this dredged sediment is rich in nutrients, occupies extended areas and is often unsuitable for agriculture and public works due {{to the presence of}} contaminants, planting energy crops is one option for the remediation of this waste material. To evaluate dredged sediment as a substrate for growing willows, a 20 × 150 m disposal depot was successfully planted using rolls of connected willow rods (SALIMAT). Rods of a Salix fragilis clone and a Salix triandra clone were equally <b>mixed</b> in each <b>mat.</b> This SALIMAT proved to be an economic and effective planting technique for large areas of wet substrate. Leaf nutrient contents were determined to identify potential limiting growth factors Biomass production and tree survival over 4 years of stand development were assessed for three different planting spacings (10, 20 and 40 cm). Results of the foliar analyses indicated that both species were supplied with sufficient N, P, K and Ca to ensure optimal growth. The introduction of SALIMAT resulted in the rapid development of a high-density fast growing stand characterised by shoot densities of up to 54 shoots/m 2. An average annual production of 13. 4 ton DM/ha was measured. The mixture of the two clones did not result in a polyclonal stand as Salix triandra was suppressed by Salix fragilis. The development of a willow stand was unsuccessful on parts of the depot with a sand fraction of 60 %...|$|R
40|$|Within Europe, montane oceanic {{vegetation}} {{is restricted}} to areas with an oceanic climate, such as western Ireland. It was found that {{a wide range of}} montane heath and associated vegetation occurs in western Ireland, and can be dominated by dwarf shrubs, bryophytes or graminoid species. Montane vegetation dominated by bryophytes, especially the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum, is particularly restricted to oceanic areas. Much variation occurs in this vegetation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients, with exposure exerting a particularly important influence on the composition of montane vegetation in Ireland. The ecology of a community of large leafy liverwort species, known as the <b>mixed</b> northern hepatic <b>mat,</b> was also studied. This community grows only in western Ireland and western Scotland and has highly specific climatic requirements, requiring frequent, high rainfall and a narrow range of microclimatic conditions. Climatic conditions were measured in hepatic mat sites using temperature and humidity dataloggers. The habitat preference of hepatic mat vegetation was found to vary along a latitudinal gradient, occurring in heath under Calluna vulgaris in the north-west of Ireland, and on open grassy slopes in the south-west of Ireland. A particularly pressing threat to these montane plant communities is climate change. Projections, from species distribution models, suggest {{that there may be a}} future reduction in suitable climate space for the species that make up these communities in Ireland. Bryophyte species, particularly those of hepatic mat, are projected to lose climate space in the south of their range and gain space in the north, which they are unlikely to colonise due to limited dispersal capacity. Many species of montane heath are projected to lose space and suitable conditions are projected to occur at only the highest altitudes in Ireland. Therefore, it is likely that the montane vegetation will be negatively impacted by climate change in the future...|$|R

According to Forbes, early reviews are <b>mixed.</b> Wired reviewer <b>Mat</b> Honan {{stated that the}} movie was [...] "profoundly unfunny" [...] and that [...] "If 'Funny or Die' is a promise, the crew should probably start coffin shopping." [...] Honan claims that the film has several inaccuracies but also notes that the film is a parody, which somewhat offsets that. CNET reviewer Amanda Kooser also notes that the movie [...] "cut a few corners as far as accuracy goes". Kooser notes that the film succeeded, in a sense, in beating Ashton Kutcher's Jobs to market as the first Steve Jobs biopic after his death (Pirates of Silicon Valley had been produced and released in 1999, 3 years after Jobs returned to Apple). Kooser also notes that the movie had rampant anachronistic technology term usage. Variety reviewer AJ Marechal notes that the movie, which was written in three days and shot in five, [...] "has its funny moments", but {{that it may be}} [...] "too long", especially for the Funny or Die viewership. The New York Times critic Brooks Barnes described the movie as a [...] "biopic poking fun at biopics" [...] and said that writer Ryan Perez said [...] "In true Internet fashion, it’s not based on very thorough research — essentially a cursory look at the Steve Jobs Wikipedia page". Barnes also noted that the movie also bested a third Jobs movie in the works by Aaron Sorkin adapted from Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson with input from Wozniak to the market. Fortune reviewer Philip Elmer-DeWitt describes the movie as [...] " [...] an over-long Saturday Night Live skit that never quite gets rolling", but noted it had a few things going for it.|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} Sweden, conventional {{forest regeneration}} procedures applied in modern commercial forestry can disturb terricolous lichen (Cladina spp.) pastures. This {{has become a}} source of conflicts with Sámi reindeer herders. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate forest regeneration strategies that may minimise the disturbance to, and promote the regeneration of, reindeer lichen pastures. The Sámi herders’ practices and knowledge related to the lichen resources were also analysed. Effects of gentle soil preparation methods on the re-establishment of lichen cover, reindeer grazing and establishment of Pinus sylvestris planted seedlings were studied in a field experiment. Using the HuMinMix-technique to <b>mix</b> the lichen <b>mat</b> with humus and mineral soil (humix-substrate), was found to promote lichen mat recovery more effectively than conventional scarification. Seedling establishment was highest for mounding and tracks with mineral soil. Rates of seedlings mechanically damaged, possibly caused by reindeer trampling in winter, indicates that planting on densely grazed areas should be avoided to minimize sources of conflict and to prefer either direct seeding or natural regeneration instead. According to a survey, complete re-establishment of the lichen mat after soil preparation was estimated to take about one decade on humix-substrate, compared to probably more than five decades following conventional harrowing. Possibilities for artificial dispersal of reindeer lichen, e. g. in areas disturbed by conventional soil preparation, were also studied. The substrate was identified as a key factor for lichen establishment. In this regard, mineral soil was identified as a poor substrate for reindeer lichen immobilization, while milled organic materials, such as moss, were suitable substrates for lichen immobilization and growth. All dispersal methods tested resulted in lichen establishment, but transplanted lichen cushions were heavily depleted by reindeer grazing, while fragmented lichen thalli were much less affected. A study based on ethnolinguistics demonstrated that whereas the Western use of the word ‘pasture’ is often associated with a specific plant community, Sámi herders’ understanding of the word (guohtun in Sámi) also incorporates the effect of snow on grazing. Sámi herders use their knowledge of the effects of forest trees and other vegetation on snow conditions, to strategically plan reindeer grazing during winter. Sámi herders’ knowledge of winter pastures should therefore be integrated with information on the effects of forest regeneration procedures on stand development to develop strategies that meet the needs of both commercial forestry and the reindeer herders...|$|R
