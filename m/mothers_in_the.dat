5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from their <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art of spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by single <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Similarly, Sarah Gammage examines {{the effects of}} unpaid care work performed by women in Guatemala. The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin {{such as that of}} Sara Cantillon has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.|$|E
5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E

This study argues a <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth, compared to a <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top ten ranked countries, and a <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to see her child die before reaching their first birthday.|$|R

25|$|Hemorrhage, {{or heavy}} blood loss, {{is still the}} leading cause of death of {{birthing}} <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world today, especially in the developing world.

25|$|Gorilla infants are {{vulnerable}} and dependent, thus mothers, their primary caregivers, {{are important to}} their survival. Male gorillas are not active in caring for the young, but they do {{play a role in}} socialising them to other youngsters. The silverback has a largely supportive relationship with the infants in his troop and shields them from aggression within the group. Infants remain in contact with their mothers for the first five months and mothers stay near the silverback for protection. Infants suckle at least once per hour and sleep with their <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same nest.|$|E

25|$|Infant formula {{costs are}} a {{significant}} fraction of the WIC program costs: 21% post-rebate and 46% pre-rebate. Formula manufacturers are granted a WIC monopoly in individual states. Meanwhile, breastfeeding rates are substantially lower for WIC recipients; this is partly attributed to formula being free of charge to <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WIC program, who are of lower socio-economic status. Violations of federal policy have also been found in terms of infant formula company advertising using the WIC trademark, to reach both WIC and non-WIC participants. In recent years WIC has been expanding its breastfeeding promotion strategies, including providing subsidies for clients who use milk banks.|$|E
25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} meant that working mothers needed access to childcare. In anticipation of <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workforce, the Federal Minister of Labour was empowered to enter into agreements {{for the establishment of}} daycare facilities for the children of mothers working in war industries. From 1942 to 1946, the Dominion-Provincial Wartime Agreement allowed for subsidized day nursery care for mothers working in essential wartime industries. Provinces that were most industrialized, such as Ontario and Quebec, saw a growing demand for this type of service and took advantage of this agreement to establish their own standards and regulations. This program provided aid to mothers working in war industries; however, it placed strict limitations similar services for women with young children in other work sectors. These wartime day nurseries boasted organized play, frequent outings and other features that would become early childhood education. In June 1946, with the war in Europe over, Federal funding for day nurseries was pulled and the majority of day nurseries were closed. However, some municipalities continued offering day care services and made up the shortfall.|$|E
500|$|Jill Deans, in a 2000 article, {{used the}} book in a {{discussion}} of adoption, surrogacy, and particularly, embryo donation. She noted that it is [...] "a classic tale of surrogacy" [...] and that it [...] "evokes the intricacies of the nature/nurture debate". She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers, in the form of Horton, but vilifies birth <b>mothers,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Mayzie. Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book's real-life implications for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in Horton and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like. Nel, meanwhile, connected the book to the short story [...] "Matilda the Elephant". Noting that the Geisels could not have children, Nel argued that [...] "Matilda", and by extension Horton, may have been manifestations of the Geisels' longing for children.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E

2500|$|While most {{children}} {{throughout the world}} develop language at similar rates and without difficulty, cultural and socioeconomic differences {{have been shown to}} influence development. [...] An example of cultural differences in language development can be seen when comparing the interactions of <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States with their infants with mothers in Japan. [...] <b>Mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States use more questions, are more information-oriented, and use more grammatically correct utterances with their 3-month-olds. [...] Mothers in Japan, on the other hand, use more physical contact with their infants, and more emotion-oriented, nonsense, and environmental sounds, as well as baby talk, with their infants. [...] These differences in interaction techniques reflect differences in [...] "each society's assumptions about infants and adult-to-adult cultural styles of talking." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} days of the home school movement, Dr. Cynthia Bower taught phonics classes to groups of home school <b>mothers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer, and the school began {{providing}} the service of annual achievement testing. The schoolâ€™s philosophical stand has always been that parents are primarily responsible for the education of their own children. Believing this, CHA developed programs to equip parents to teach and to give them educational support. Out of this was born the Home School Satellite Program. The emphasis of the program has always been on preparation of the parent to teach, but there have been opportunities for students to participate in some school events and/or classes. Many of these students have found their way into the CHA day school program because of this association.|$|E

[...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They could care for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to David Broder, [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are. [...] I find myself in many closed rooms filled with men, but I'm rarely invited to women's movement's functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.'
