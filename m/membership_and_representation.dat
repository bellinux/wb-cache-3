40|$|In the {{academic}} debate, Brazilian unionism {{has been characterized}} both as representative and as non-representative – with defenders of both positions grounding their arguments in the same basic facts. Taking issue with these interpretations, the article questions whether or not union membership is a suitable measure of representation. If, given Brazil’s corporative union structure, unions {{do not need to}} recruit members, to what extent can membership serve as an adequate measurement of union representation? Precisely what do union membership rates measure, and precisely {{what does it mean to}} "represent workers" in Brazil? The article first offers a conceptual discussion of the relationship between union <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>representation.</b> The thesis is that in Brazil the former does not suffice as a measurement of the latter. But if the union membership rate is high, what is it measuring in any case? The second part of the text explores the empirical side of the question, through analysis of a 1994 survey conducted within four occupational categories. It becomes clear that membership rates are indicative of the degree to which the union makes its presence felt in the life of those it represents. But it also becomes clear that in and of itself this rate does not account for the complexity of the relations between the rank-and-file and union leaders. In short, the referent is blurry – but it is there. The text seeks to lend it greater conceptual and empirical clarity...|$|E

40|$|The Council of Governments is a {{significant}} new approach to metropolitan cooperation. Of the approximately 150 councils (as of January, 1970), all but 14 have been established since 1965. Councils {{across the country are}} characterized by great variety in organization <b>and</b> <b>representation.</b> This paper examines this complexity, particularly in terms of <b>membership,</b> <b>representation</b> <b>and</b> voting. The first chapter is primarily a short history of the council movement and the forces which have helped to shape its development.

Agenda structuring changes are observed to directly impact upon strategy and policy focus, while informality and humour emerge as key weapons in the maintenance of cohesion in an increasingly business-oriented environment. Boardroom culture emerges as a potent ingredient in the governance process, thereby signalling its future importance for both researchers and board chairs.

40|$|Defence date: 27 May 2002 Examining Board: Daniel Verdier (Supervisor; European University Institute, San Domenico di Fiesole) Adrienne Héritier (Co-supervisor; Max-Planck Gesellschaft, Bonn) Petros Mavroidis (Université de Neuchâtel) Patrick Messerlin (Institut d’Etudes Politiques, Paris) First made {{available}} online in June 2012. In this PhD dissertation I explain how {{different forms of}} international trade institutions affect domestic coalition patterns. Negotiated trade policy instruments create incentives for sector-wide interest representation, while administrative instruments elicit interest aggregation on a more product-specific, intra-sectoral level. I provide a rationale why reciprocal trade negotiations foster sector-wide associations, whereas trade rule enforcement elicits intra-sectoral coalitions. In contrast to existing explanations, these propositions can account for coalition patterns during both the GATT 1947, which consisted {{of a series of}} trade negotiation rounds, and the WTO (1995 -), which combines negotiations with binding administrative enforcement in the form of international dispute settlement. Comprehensive evidence from EU trade policy lobbying confirms the explanatory force of the hypotheses. Sectoral peak associations co-ordinate interest representation during the GATT and WTO Rounds, whereas private interests predominantly organise on an intra-sectoral level when filing petitions for enforcement instruments administered by the European Commission. Exhaustive databases provide evidence about the predominantly intra-sectoral trade associations that lodge complaints with administrative instruments such as Anti-Dumping, market access investigations and WTO dispute settlement, while other sources reveal how sector-wide peak associations organise during negotiation Rounds. I provide supportive evidence from existing research on interest representation in American trade policy, and control for other factors such as industry concentration and non-trade regulation. The shift from negotiations-only to enforcement is further significant for interest representation in four selected sectors of European industry: chemicals, pharmaceuticals, steel and textiles. Although each of these industries {{has a long history of}} sector coherence, they all reorganised their <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>representation</b> structure to accommodate for the increased importance of enforcement instruments. The adoption of direct company membership and/or the inclusion of product-specific trade associations accompany the decrease in importance of the sectorwide peak association in a world where the provision of detailed information for judicial enforcement is starting to weigh more than the political clout of sector-wide peak associations during negotiations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how culture and expertise of a complex phenomenon, the economic crisis, influence the construction of different social representations. In order to analyse the ???naïf theories??? elaborated by the common sense with regard to the economic thinking and acting, this research has been conducted inside the theoretical framework of SRT (Social Representation Theory). By interviewing Italian and Greek subjects belonging to different social groups, we examined how ???expert??? and ???lay??? people face this unfamiliar phenomenon. Inspired by the Structural Approach, which considers SRs (social representations) as constituted of two parts, a structure and a content, data were collected through a multi-method strategy (hierarchized evocations method, characterization and multiple choice questionnaires). Four groups of participants (n = 120 for each country; n = 30 for each group; gender balanced) were employed: university students (the second/third year; faculty of economics), mid-level bank clerks, shopkeepers, and laypeople. Obtained data were treated with rang/frequency and similarity analysis, as well as mono and multivariate statistical analysis. Discussion focuses on the relationships between culture, group <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> social <b>representations</b> of crisis <b>and</b> economic behaviors. The main findings demonstrate culture and group appurtenance differences in the ways participants define and foresee strategies to face the crisis.

However, in agricultural modelling {{there is often a}} disregard of this contiguous aspect. Therefore, some parametric procedures for suitability analysis compartmentalise units into defined membership classes. This imposition of crisp boundaries neglects the continuous formations found throughout nature and overlooks differences and inherent uncertainties found in the modelling.

40|$|Most {{experts on}} {{multilateral}} development banks (MDBs) mention the possibility of large-scale co-financing in their forecasts concerning their future operations. However, interaction between MDBs and other actors, including co-financing, is rarely considered as a research problem for analytical and scientific papers. Yet this type of cooperation {{is one of the}} most important factors of effectiveness for the entire system of MDB financing. Thus, working in partnership with governmental institutions (development assistance agencies, export credit agencies, etc.), MDBs help attract additional financial resources and expertise in the countries where they are active. Working on state, regional and global levels, multilateral banks cooperate not only with governmental institutions, but also with private sector and civil society representatives. Such cooperation benefits both parties. In addition to mobilizing additional financial resources, it improves project preparation and implementation, taking into account national peculiarities, while partner institutions get a chance to use their experience and expertise. Given the recent establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), they are unlikely to achieve their main goal of narrowing the infrastructure financing deficit in developing countries without active cooperation with other institutions. This article discusses the results and examines the prospects of the NDB and AIIB cooperating with traditional MDBs. It also focuses on the new banks’ engagement with other financial institutions, including commercial banks and national development banks. The author analyzes interbank memorandums and agreements as a formal basis for cooperation between various institutions, and examines in detail the examples of co-financing infrastructure projects by the new and traditional MDBs, as well as new multilateral cooperation mechanisms established by development banks. The author concludes that the new banks’ strategies differ from those of other institutions, and each has its own advantages. The AIIB seeks to establish cooperation primarily with large institutions to use their considerable experience and explore co-financing opportunities for large-scale projects. The NDB, with limited <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> geographical <b>representation,</b> focuses on, inter alia, cooperation with MDBs with a small number of participants, national development banks and commercial banks, which allows it to adopt the best international practices and gain experience in specific countries, receive consultative support for issuing bonds and improve financial management...|$|R

Previous papers claim that (complete) learning increases <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> decreases aggregate welfare. That claim is based on analysis of approximations to the relations between a damage parameter <b>and</b> <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> welfare. Those approximations have characteristics not shared by the functions {{they are intended to}} approximate, so conclusions based on the approximations are wrong.

40|$|PurposeTo {{determine}} {{diversity in}} the <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> analyze <b>representation</b> of private practitioners and ethnic and racial minorities/women in senior leadership roles in a regional vascular society. MethodsThe program book distributed at the 2008 annual meeting was used to compile information on membership categories, academic status, gender, and ethnic origin of members. Excluded from further analysis were all but active and senior members (n = 386). Officers for President and current President-Elect (P, n = 31), Secretary (S, n = 10), Treasurer (T, n = 11), and Councilor (C, n = 33) over a 30 -year period were scrutinized for similar information. Members {{were considered to be}} “academic” if they worked full time at an academic medical center or as faculty at a teaching hospital with a vascular fellowship and national recognition. Private practice (PP) or academic practice (AP) was determined by personal knowledge, mailing address, e-mail address, and search engines. Ethnic and racial origin was determined by name, personal knowledge, or a web search. ResultsOf the 386 active and senior members in the society, 86 % were white, 13. 7 % were of various ethnic/racial groups, and 5. 7 % were women. Sixty-eight percent of members were in PP. Female members {{were more likely to be}} in AP compared with male members (68. 1 % vs 29. 6 %, P <. 0002). White males made up 89. 4 % of all officers and 94. 2 % of all senior positions over the 30 years of the society. Seventy officer positions were occupied by those in AP (82. 3 %) vs 15 positions (18 %) for the PP group. For the senior positions, 92. 3 % were from the AP group compared with the 8 % from the PP group. (P <. 0036) White male academics (WMAs) (23. 7 % of membership) occupied 86 % of all senior leadership and 57 % of C positions compared with 13 % and 42 %, respectively, for the rest of the membership (P <. 0041). Of the 33 C positions, 66. 6 % were filled by members in AP. Of these 22 AP Councilors, 11 (50 %) then moved up to senior leadership positions compared with two of 11 (18 %) PP councilors (P =. 07). ConclusionsEthnic and racial minorities and women are under represented in the membership compared with the general population, medical school graduates, and faculty. PPs and non-white male academics are under represented in senior leadership positions.
