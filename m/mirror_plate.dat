In an effort to extent the application range, mirrors are being developed that withstand higher light intensities. The absorbed light generates heat. Being suspended on thin hinges, and isolated from the bulk by an air gap, the mirrors heat up. Their temperature can be significantly higher than that of their substrate. In this paper we describe an experiment carried out to verify simulations on the temperature within the <b>mirror</b> <b>plates</b> during irradiation. We created a structure out of electrically connected <b>mirror</b> <b>plates</b> forming a four-point electrical resistor, and calibrated the thermal coefficient of the resistor in a temperature chamber. We irradiated the resistor and calculated the mirror temperature. In the experiment, the temperature in the <b>mirror</b> <b>plates</b> increased by up to 180 °C. The mirrors did not show significant damage despite the high temperatures. Also, the experiment confirms the choice of heat transport mechanisms used in the simulations.

50|$|According to Bobrov {{the first}} mail and plate armor {{appeared}} as cuisses in the Middle East, and were imported by the Golden Horde. Persian miniatures {{of the first}} half of 15th century show different combinations of mail and plate armour with lamellar armor and brigandines sometimes worn with a single round <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> as breast re-enforcement. The first representation of mail and plate armour as body protection is shown in Persian miniatures, which show mail and plate armour composed of relatively large plates, worn with laminar pauldrons and skirt (formed from long, horizontal plates), re-enforced by a large round <b>mirror</b> <b>plate.</b> The first representation of classic mail and plate armour (without lamellar elements) can be seen in Baghdad's miniature which dates from 1465. From the end of the 15th century mail and plate armour began to fully replace lamellar armours. The main difference between eastern European (Russian and Polish) and Oriental mail and plate armor (according to Bobrov) is that eastern European versions usually do not have sleeves, while Oriental versions have sleeves (the forearms were protected by vambraces). In a heavy version these sleeves have embedded plates, and a light version (more widely used) has sleeves entirely made from mail.|$|E

Historically, a beamline component with several parts had to be implemented with a complete, internal description of all these parts. e. g. a guide component including all four <b>mirror</b> <b>plates</b> and required logic to allow scattering between the mirrors. For quite a while, users have requested the ability to allow "components inside components" or meta-components, allowing to combine functionality of several simple components to achieve more complex behaviour, i. e. four single <b>mirror</b> <b>plates</b> together defining a guide.

5000|$|Evidence {{of the use}} of the blown {{plate glass}} method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for <b>mirrors</b> and coach <b>plates.</b> Louis Lucas de Nehou and A.

50|$|In {{addition}} {{there was}} no evidence of laser interferences between the guiding laser and the irradiation laser. The guiding laser, at a wavelength of 650 nm, hits the mirror on the back of the conducting cantilever from vertical trajectory and is reflected away from the cantilever towards the position sensitive photodetector (PSPD). The illumination beam, on the other hand, travels from underneath the sample platform and is reflected into position by the reflecting mirror. The angle of the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> ensures that the beam does not extend past the sample surface.|$|E
50|$|Pure {{lamellar}} armour {{became very}} rare, however {{different combinations of}} laminar and lamellar armour were very popular. This happened because even though laminar armour was much more reliable than lamellar, laminar armour was not flexible enough, while lamellar armours were very flexible. Laminar cuirasses could be worn with lamellar pauldrons and tassets (worn with separate bracers, greaves and helm). Less common was the opposite combination of lamellar cuirass worn with laminar pauldrons and tassets. Both could be optionally worn with lamellar or laminar cod-piece and loin-guard, or even with <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> reinforcement.|$|E

50|$|The module {{constructed}} by Lee et al. implemented a tilted <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> that was positioned underneath the sample substrate. This conductive mirror was tilted at 45° and successfully reflected the illuminating laser to a focused spot directly underneath the conductive tip. The steering mirror was {{employed as a}} means of controlling the trajectory of the laser source, with this addition the position of the reflected beam on the sample could be easily adjusted for placement underneath the AFM tip. The illumination laser source was a diode-pumped solid-state laser system that produced a wavelength of 532 nm and a spot of 1 mm in the sample.The addition of the mirror and laser underneath the sample substrate results in a higher scanning level due to raising the sample substrate. This configuration has no effect on any other instrument component and does not affect AFM performance. This result was confirmed by identical topographical images that were taken with and without the placement of the mirror and laser. This particular set-up required the separation of the x, y and z piezo-scanners The separation of piezo-tubes accounts for the elimination of x-z cross-coupling and scanning-size errors, which is common in traditional AFM.|$|E
5000|$|Ironically {{in the end}} of 15th century, when laminar armour {{became much}} more popular than {{lamellar}} ones, both armour types began to be replaced by plated mails. Initially plated mail was made only as cuisses, but soon by the beginning of 16th century plated mail was utilized in both pauldrons and cuisses, as they could better envelop body and fully replaced laminar and lamellar pauldron and tassets. So a typical laminar armour of that period was just a laminar cuirass which could be worn over brigandine with sleeves supplemented by plated mail cuisses. (Helm, bracers and greaves are not mentioned here as they were conventional for that region). Sleeves of brigandine worked as pauldron, and if a brigandine was long enough its laps could work as tassets. Another option was wearing a laminar cuirass without any brigandine, but with plated mail pauldrons and cuisses. Both variations of laminar armour could be re-enforced by <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> (even though laminar armour would have been enough protection from steel weapons, a metal mirror was worn as protection from the [...] "evil eye"). Finally {{by the end of the}} 16th century laminar and lamellar armour practically disappeared in the Middle East and Central Asia regions.|$|E

Temperature rise, standardization reproducibility, vacuum chamber effects and magnetic center reproducibility measurements are also presented. The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) undulator beam line has 33 girders, each with a LCLS undulator quadrupole which focuses and steers the beam through the beam line. Each quadrupole has main quadrupole coils, as well as separate horizontal and vertical trim coils. Thirty-six quadrupoles, thirty-three installed and three spares were, manufactured for the LCLS undulator system and all were measured to confirm that they met requirement specifications for integrated gradient, harmonics and for magnetic center shifts after current changes. The horizontal and vertical dipole trims of each quadrupole were similarly characterized. Each quadrupole was also fiducialized to its magnetic center. All characterizing measurements on the undulator quads were performed with their <b>mirror</b> <b>plates</b> on and after a standardization of three cycles from - 6 to + 6 to - 6 amps.

50|$|The {{instrumentation}} of conductive AFM (c-AFM) {{has evolved}} {{with the desire}} to measure local electrical properties of materials with high resolutions. The essential components are: the piezo-tube, the guide laser, the conducting tip, and cantilever. Although these components are identical to traditional AFM their configuration is tailored to measuring surface currents on the local scale. As mentioned previously, the piezo-tube can be placed either above or below the sample, depending on the application of the instrumentation. In the case of c-AFM, repulsive contact mode is the predominantly used to obtain electric current images from the surface as the sample moves in the x and y direction. Placing the z-piezo above the cantilever allows for better control of the cantilever and tip during analysis.The material that comprises the conductive tip and cantilever can be customized for a particular application. Metal-coated cantilevers, gold wires, all-metal cantilevers and diamond cantilevers are used. In many cases diamond is the preferred material for cantilever and/or tip because it is an extremely hard material that does not oxidize in ambient conditions. The main difference between the instrumentation of c-AFM and STM is that in c-AFM the bias voltage can be directly applied to the nanostructure (tip and substrate). In STM, on the other hand, the applied voltage must be supported within the vacuum tunneling gap between the STM probe and surface. When the tip is in close contact with the sample surface the application of bias voltage to the tip creates a vacuum gap between the tip and the sample that enables the investigation of electron transport through nanostructures.The main components and instrumentation of c-AFM instrumentation are identical to that required for a pc-AFM module. The only modifications are the illumination source, filter and inverted microscope objective that are located beneath the sample substrate. In fact, most pc-AFM instruments are simply modified from existing cp-AFM instrumentation. The first report of this instrumental modification came in 2008. In that paper, Lee and coworkers implemented the aforementioned modifications to examine the resolution of photocurrent imaging. Their design consisted of three main units: a conductive <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> steering mirror and laser source.The main difficulty with the previously existing c-AFM instrumentation is the inability of the technique for characterizing photonic devices. Specifically, it is difficult to measure changes in local and nano-scale electrical properties that result from the photonic effect. The optical illumination component (laser) was added to the c-AFM module in order to make such properties visible. Early in development, the main concerns regarding pc-AFM include: physical configuration, laser disturbance and laser alignment. Although many of these concerns have been resolved pc-AFM modules are still widely modified from c-AFM and traditional AFM instruments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − We {{considered}} the uniformity of fabricated micromirror arrays by characterizing the fabrication process and calculating the appropriate driving voltages of micromirrors used as virtual photomask in maskless photolithography. The uniformity of the micromirror array {{in terms of}} driving voltage and optical characteristics is adversely affected by factors, such as the air gap between the bottom electrode and the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate,</b> the spring shape and the deformation of the <b>mirror</b> <b>plate</b> or torsion spring.
