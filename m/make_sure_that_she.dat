Aguilera took boxing lessons {{to prepare for the}} video, and more than 100 dancers auditioned. Aguilera wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and LaChapelle had the same vision for the video, not wanting it to be [...] "glossy or pretty." [...] A scene where Aguilera is lowered into a boxing ring in a cage and a dance segment in the ring were filmed on the first day. The following day, a foxy boxing scene, a table dancing segment, a party scene with Redman's rapping his part, and a shower scene were filmed. The video premiered on September 30, 2002, on Making the Video, and was described as [...] "a post-apocalyptic orgy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{was written}} by Alejandro Sanz for his album El Tren de los Momentos (2006). He also handled the song's {{production}} together with Lulo Pérez. Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something with me, because it was a little like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
500|$|Before Beauty and the Beast, Disney's {{tradition}} of depicting female characters as victims had already long been established. The fact that Belle was hardly {{depicted as a}} feminist in earlier versions of the film became a point of contention among the filmmakers. Despite the fact that Disney wanted Beauty and the Beast to resemble an old-fashioned film, the filmmakers envisioned Belle as [...] "a woman that was ahead of her time". As the first woman {{in the history of}} Disney to write a feature-length animated film, Woolverton decided to explore Belle as an opportunity to create a female character who would ultimately be better received than Disney's previous animated heroines, specifically Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Woolverton was aware that the task would be particularly challenging due to the previous character's popularity, but fought relentlessly to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was creating [...] "a new kind of Disney heroine." [...] Inspired by the women's rights movement Woolverton herself had experienced during the 1960s and 1970s, the screenwriter was determined to avoid creating another [...] "insipid" [...] Disney princess and decided to conceive Belle as a headstrong feminist. Woolverton strongly believed that contemporary audiences would not identify with Belle unless she was updated appropriately, and thus evolved the character into [...] "a woman of the '90s". The screenwriter refused to watch Jean Cocteau's 1946 film adaptation of the fairy tale and chose to base Belle on American actress Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of Jo March in the 1933 film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's book Little Women instead, who she felt was [...] "a real depiction of womanhood." [...] Similarly, story artist Brenda Chapman drew influence from Hepburn's on-screen bickering with actor Spencer Tracy during the scene in which Belle tends to the Beast's wounds.|$|E

500|$|A cruiser {{reported}} aircraft {{detected by}} R.D.F {{on the port}} bow of the convoy and Ledbury was taken through the convoy {{to get to the}} engaged side; but a heavy and sustained attack by Junkers 88s dive bombing developed when the destroyer was still in between the two columns. The attack became increasingly indefensible; two ships were hit, one exploded, the other remained afloat but both were creating a huge mass of burning petrol on the water. Torpedo planes were now sighted on the starboard bow very close, but the light was failing quickly. Ledbury engaged the torpedo planes, but one delivered a very good attack, dropping two torpedoes. Another ship exploded, and Captain Hill assumed that [...] was torpedoed at this time. Ledbury called Manchester to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was standing by the damaged ships; the destroyer sighted six ships out in the darkness steaming on various courses, mostly in a north or north-western direction. The destroyer called up the nearest ship and ordered course 120. This ship was [...] The orders were repeated to the nearest merchantmen. Ledbury then returned to Ohio intending to take her in tow, but the tanker reported that she could steam with her steering aft but had no compass. The destroyer switched on a brighter stern light and told the tanker to follow her to Malta. Ledbury informed stragglers of the presence of a minefield near Zembra, while she also contacted [...] that the survivors from the damaged ships had not been picked up and that she was going on with the tanker. It seemed to the crew that a very long time had passed before the ships were clear of the glare of the burning ships. During the night, Ledbury sighted four E-Boat wrecks just around the next corner (These were sighted at 02:04, 03:32, 03:45 and 04:31 respectively).|$|E
2500|$|In fall 2000, Norwood {{finally began}} conceiving ideas {{for a third}} studio album with the Atlantic label. While Rodney Jerkins, the main {{producer}} of her previous album, and his Darkchild crew, including Fred Jerkins III and LaShawn Daniels, {{had been working on}} several new songs for the singer's upcoming project in hopes of recreating the winning chemistry of Never Say Never, [...] Norwood wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was gaining more creative control over the project and thus, arranged meetings with all her writers and musicians to discuss the lyricals topics and sounds she wanted for the album. [...] "I was involved from A-Z," [...] she said. [...] "Every song on the album was inspired by my life [...] I wanted to talk about how I feel on so many levels.

He later told In Touch Weekly that the album is definitely more menacing than Rihanna's prior work, describing the album as [...] "liberated". American singer Akon, on the other hand, stated that he was [...] "going to lighten her up" [...] and didn't want an angry Rihanna. With the success of her last album, Rihanna wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn't fall into one sound or vibe. At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that the Rated R {{is a whole new}} sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained.|$|E

2500|$|Williams was {{originally}} signed to Atlantic Records {{as a solo}} artist in 2003. She had been introduced to Atlantic A Tom Storms through Kent Marcus and Jim Zumwalt, lawyers of managers Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams, and then eventually signed to Atlantic by Jason Flom. Steunebrink and Richard Williams had originally discovered and signed her to a production deal that was later bought out by Atlantic. The original plan of the label was to turn her into a pop singer, but Williams resisted, saying {{that she wanted to}} play alternative rock music with a band. In an interview with HitQuarters the band's A at Atlantic, Steve Robertson, said, [...] "She {{wanted to make sure that}} we didn't look at her as some straight to Top 40 pop princess. She wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and her band got the chance to show what they can do as a rock band writing their own songs." [...] Label president Julie Greenwald and the label staff decided to go with her wishes.

2500|$|Sissy's Magical Ponycorn Adventure was {{developed}} by Untold Entertainment Inc. developer Ryan Henson Creighton and his five-year-old daughter Cassie Creighton. Ryan {{was in charge of}} developing the game and voicing non-playable characters, while Cassie was in charge of voicing Sissy, drawing the art, creating the non-playable characters, and designing some of the puzzles. Ryan, a veteran designer of children's video games, brought Cassie with him to the Toronto Game Jam with the intent of allowing her to develop her first video game; because of her young age, Ryan had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not act disruptively there. On her first day at the Game Jam, she did [...] "about six hours" [...] worth of coloring, and an hour's worth of voice acting at home. Ryan took her drawings and integrated them into the Untold Graphic Adventure Game System. It took about two days to finish. The game's website has ads that play before the game loads, and a PayPal button that viewers may click on and donate money to Cassie's college fund. It was released on May 24, 2011. Ryan was not interested in making a game for kids who just like breasts and guns; instead, he wanted to make a game that could appeal to a broad range of people, including people who do not play games. Jaime Woo wrote that video game culture was often [...] "critical, dismissive, and negative" [...] and that the game was [...] "easy fodder" [...] due to its cute appearance. Ryan was unconcerned about potential negative response, and called it a [...] "pure, non-cynical game".|$|E
