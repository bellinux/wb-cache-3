2500|$|In May 2007, a fire {{ripped through}} [...] of land just outside Avalon's city limits. Over 200 {{firefighting}} recruits were brought over by U.S. <b>Marine</b> <b>hovercraft</b> and helicopter {{to protect the}} city. Ultimately, only one residence and six commercial structures were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{commercial}} success of hovercraft suffered from rapid rises in fuel prices {{during the late}} 1960s and 1970s, following conflict in the Middle East. Alternative over-water vehicles, such as wave-piercing catamarans (marketed as the SeaCat in the UK until 2005), use less fuel and can perform most of the <b>hovercraft's</b> <b>marine</b> tasks. Although developed {{elsewhere in the world}} for both civil and military purposes, except for the Solent Ryde to Southsea crossing, hovercraft disappeared from the coastline of Britain until a range of Griffon Hovercraft were bought by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.|$|R
50|$|In Ice Station, Book is {{in charge}} of the <b>Marine's</b> second <b>{{hovercraft}},</b> and his team investigates a hovercraft that goes missing from their radar, only to discover the civilians inside had been shot dead. Upon arriving at the station itself, Book was caught in the fight against the French, and his helmet's earpiece was damaged, which meant he was unaware of the fight in the central shaft when he was moving civilians. He attempted to keep a young girl, Kirsty Hensleigh, from falling into the killer whale infested pool, but also fell in. Afterwards, he helped Gant prepare diving equipment so that they could find out what was in the cavern below them, and explained Schofield's story to her, and respected her prioritising her job before her feelings for Schofield. While trying to escape the SAS forces heading for the station, Kirsty Hensleigh falls from the hovercraft, and Book takes the brunt of the fall, but both are captured. Taken back to the station, Trevor Barnaby demanded to know if Schofield had men in the cavern, threatening to kill him, but Book refused the talk. But after Snake said he was lying, Barnaby had Book hung over the diving pool and lowered in with a pod of killer whales. Book tried to escape, but was ultimately killed.|$|R
