25|$|The Grohmann Museum, at Milwaukee School of Engineering {{contains}} the world's most comprehensive art collection {{dedicated to the}} evolution of human work. It houses the <b>Man</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> collection, which comprises more than 700 paintings and sculptures dating from 1580 to the present. The museum also features a spectacular rooftop sculpture garden.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} plate, {{the scene is}} Thavies Inn Gate (sometimes {{ironically}} written as Thieves Inn Gate), one of the Inns of Chancery which housed associations of lawyers in London. Tom Nero has grown up and become a hackney coachman, and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Tom's horse, worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading, has collapsed, breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage. Disregarding the animal's pain, Tom has beaten it so furiously that he has put its eye out. In a satirical aside, Hogarth shows four corpulent barristers struggling {{to climb out of}} the carriage in a ludicrous state. They are probably caricatures of eminent jurists, but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects' names, and they have not been identified. Elsewhere in the scene, other acts of cruelty against animals take place: a drover beats a lamb to death, an ass is driven on by force despite being overloaded, and an enraged bull tosses one of its tormentors. Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print: ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Yeobright {{had never}} before been to her son's house, and its exact {{position}} was unknown to her. She tried one ascending path and another, and found that they led her astray. Retracing her steps, she came again to an open level, where she perceived at a distance a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> She went towards him and inquired the way.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said a girl--he did {{not know}} who she was. Who came out from the Council House crying aloud, and told the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> among the ruins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect, master," [...] Meinik said as, {{standing}} well back, {{he watched}} the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> [...] "the general is building this second line, not because he thinks {{that there is a}} chance of our getting through the first, but to keep the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> so as to prevent them from thinking anything about the spirits. Now that they have passed one night there, they will have got somewhat over their fear and, of course, every day that passes, without ill befalling them, they will think less and less about the evil ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the bye," [...] he said, [...] "I {{see that}} the Water Company is getting on very well with its connections. They must have several hundred <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, captain," [...] said Dick, {{and ran to}} the stables. He {{found the}} utility <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{cleaning}} out a stall, and soon had Snuggers hitching up. Inside of ten minutes Dick was on the way to town. As he bowled along, little did he dream of how long it would be before he should see dear old Putnam Hall again.|$|E
60|$|In {{another part}} of the hill an {{altogether}} different scene began to force itself upon the eye towards midday. A circular tent, of exceptional newness and size, was in course of erection here. As the day drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the shepherd's responsibilities; and they turned their attention to this tent and inquired of a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> there, whose soul seemed concentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time, what was going on.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{them were}} sipping wine, others were playing cards, others chess, other groups were chatting together, and many were smoking {{cigarettes}} while {{they waited for the}} coming duels. Nearly all of them wore colored caps; there were white caps, green caps, blue caps, red caps, and bright-yellow ones; so, all the five corps were present in strong force. In the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight, narrow-bladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand, and outside was a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> sharpening others on a grindstone.|$|E
50|$|Le musée de la métallurgie (Metalworking Industry Museum)was {{created in}} 1990, by {{workers of the}} factory. It shows the life of these <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and the story and {{evolution}} of the factory.|$|R
60|$|In {{the lower}} hallway the boys found several <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> {{cleaning}} and oiling the hardwood floor. They had {{a box of}} wax polish with them, and this immediately gave Tom an idea.|$|R
60|$|In these trying circumstances, {{the chief}} {{engineer}} accepted an offer made by the gentlemen in the ship, to take turn about in superintending the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the tank paying-out the cable.|$|R
60|$|He {{went off}} {{with the end of}} the net, and Foster waited, half amused. The fellow {{probably}} wanted to ensure his saying nothing about the poaching by making him an accomplice, but this did not matter much. It was an adventure and he was anxious to find a guide. By the way the net unwound and slipped across the grass he thought there was another <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> but he carried his part forward as he had been told and then dropped it and sat down among some rushes. Two indistinct figures were moving towards each other and he got up presently when one signaled. When he joined them a number of small dark objects showed through the net.|$|E
60|$|When Tottie Bones {{left the}} dark and dirty den {{that was the only}} home she had ever known, she ran lightly out into the {{neighbouring}} street, and, threading her way among people and vehicles, entered an alley, ascended a stair, and found herself in a room which bore some resemblance to an empty schoolroom. At one corner there was a desk, at which stood a young <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on a business-looking book. Before him were several children of various ages and sizes, but all having one characteristic in common--the aspect of extreme poverty. The young man was a gratuitous servant of the public, and the place was, for the hour at least, a penny savings-bank.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And bitter work {{it was for}} them, no doubt, poor souls! We used {{to break}} into the old shafts and adits which they had made, and find old stags'-horn pickaxes, that crumbled to pieces when we brought them to grass; and they say, that if a man will listen, sir, of a still night, about those old shafts, he may hear the ghosts of them at working, knocking, and picking, as clear as if there was a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the next level. It may be all an old fancy. I suppose it is. But I {{believed}} it when I was a boy; and it helped the work in me that night. But I'll go on with my story.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a {{good deal}} to do in their way," [...] said the first pikeman. [...] "All <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> after notice to be ducked, they say, and every engine to be stopped forthwith." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they got}} to the bridge Dave was much {{surprised}} to see a couple of <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> repairing the structure. They were putting down some planking that was bound to last a long while.|$|R
6000|$|... "We may {{catch him}} {{in time to}} stop him yet," [...] Jack said, [...] "if he has gone round {{to look at the}} walling of the old goafs. There are three <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> there." ...|$|R
60|$|Ten {{days after}} he had {{finished}} the work, {{he heard the sound}} of men's voices and, peeping out, saw a Burmese officer with a party of eight armed men going to the Phongee's cell. It was possible that they might have come on other business, but it was more probable they had come in search of him. Some of the women who had come up to the hermit had seen him at work; and might have mentioned, on their return, that the priest had a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> clearing away the bushes. The matter might have come to the ears of some officer anxious to distinguish himself, and the idea that this was the prisoner for whom a search was being made occurred to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{conditions}} of art should be simple. A {{great deal more}} depends upon the heart than upon the head. Appreciation of art is not secured by any elaborate scheme of learning. Art requires a good healthy atmosphere. The motives for art are still around about us as they were round about the ancients. And the subjects are also easily found by the earnest sculptor and the painter. Nothing is more picturesque and graceful than a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The artist who goes to the children's playground, watches them at their sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the same themes that engaged {{the attention of the}} ancient Greeks, and such observation and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct that foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always divorced.|$|E
60|$|Scattered {{over the}} summit were {{numerous}} holes {{that appeared to}} have been recently sunk. In one of them the stranger picked up a fragment of the crumbled rock, and examined it carelessly. Then he slowly descended the gentler slope towards the west, {{in the direction of a}} claim wherein his quick eye had discovered a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> A walk of a few moments brought him to the bank of red clay, the heap of tailings, the wooden sluice-box, and the pan and shovel which constituted the appurtenances of an ordinary claim. As he approached nearer, the workman rose from the bank over which he was bending, and leaning on his pick, turned his face to the new-comer. His broad, athletic figure, his heavy blonde beard, and serious, perplexed eyes, were unmistakable. It was Gabriel Conroy.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fellow is {{obviously}} prosperous, since he's spending {{a large sum}} on draining. I saw a big stack of pipes {{and a number of}} <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> My opinion is it's a ridiculous waste of money." ...|$|R
60|$|As the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the lode lived {{either in}} tents or rude shelters of bark and logs, this seemed very probable; but Weston {{was not in}} the mood to concern himself about the matter then.|$|R
60|$|Bob lost no time {{in setting}} about the work of opening the new well, and his first duty next morning was to set {{a portion of the}} <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> making ready for the {{erection}} of the derrick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Meinik, do {{you with}} these three work, tonight; four others {{will take your}} place, before dawn. Mind, at first I don't want you to attempt to move any fixed stones; but simply to clear away all small stones, and rubble. You can stow a good deal behind the two upper bamboos. The rest you must put on the stairs. I will see, tonight, what we can manage {{in the way of}} tools for {{chipping}} away the big stones that cannot be moved. You had better relieve each other very often. The three who are not at work should sit down on the ledge, outside, so that any stone accidentally dislodged will not fall on anyone. Every ten minutes, one will come up {{to take the place of}} the <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Be sure that each, as he passes up or down, replaces the blanket carefully." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{conveyed}} no information, and Edward, repeating his queries, {{received a}} rapid answer, in which, from the haste and peculiarity of the dialect, the word 'butler' was alone intelligible. Waverley then requested {{to see the}} butler; upon which the fellow, with a knowing look and nod of intelligence, made a signal to Edward to follow, and began to dance and caper down the alley up which {{he had made his}} approaches. A strange guide this, thought Edward, and not much unlike one of Shakespeare's roynish clowns. I am not over prudent to trust to his pilotage; but wiser men have been led by fools. By this time he reached the bottom of the alley, where, turning short on a little parterre of flowers, shrouded from the east and north by a close yew hedge, he found an old <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> without his coat, whose appearance hovered between that of an upper servant and gardener; his red nose and ruffled shirt belonging to the former profession; his hale and sunburnt visage, with his green apron, appearing to indicate ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was not}} {{all play}} in Carmel. That portion of the {{community}} which Saxon and Billy came to know, [...] "the crowd," [...] was hard-working. Some worked regularly, {{in the morning or}} late at night. Others worked spasmodically, like the wild Irish playwright, who would shut himself up for a week at a time, then emerge, pale and drawn, to play like a madman against the time of his next retirement. The pale and youthful father of a family, with the face of Shelley, who wrote vaudeville turns for a living and blank verse tragedies and sonnet cycles for the despair of managers and publishers, hid himself in a concrete cell with three-foot walls, so piped, that, by turning a lever, the whole structure spouted water upon the impending intruder. But in the main, they respected each other's work-time. They drifted into one another's houses as the spirit prompted, but if they found a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> they went their way. This obtained to all except Mark Hall, who did not have to work for a living; and he climbed trees to get away from popularity and compose in peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; indeed. When I {{tell you}} my story, I think you will {{understand}} that I would tell it to no one but yourself in County Galway. I fear that Florian saw the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> upon the flood gates." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} help suggesting, [...] "I suppose the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in his mines, and mills, and on his railroads and {{steamship}} lines are taking a much-needed rest, too. I hope {{you are not going}} to let them break themselves down, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For pity sake, Chebron!" [...] Amuba exclaimed, [...] "do {{not walk}} like that. If the <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> get sight of you they cannot but see that {{something}} strange has happened, {{and it will}} be recalled against you when the creature is missed." ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{we began}} getting my prau ready I was obliged to give up collecting, as I found that unless I was {{constantly}} on the spot myself very little work would be clone. As I proposed making some long voyages in this boat, I determined to fit it up conveniently, and was obliged {{to do all the}} inside work myself, assisted by my two Amboynese boys. I had plenty of visitors, surprised to see a white <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and much astonished at the novel arrangements I was making in one of their native vessels. Luckily I had a few tools of my own, including a small saw and some chisels, and these were now severely tried, cutting and fitting heavy iron-wood planks for the flooring and the posts that support the triangular mast. Being of the best London make, they stood the work well, and without them it would have been impossible for me to have finished my boat with half the neatness, or in double the time. I had a Ke workman to put in new ribs, for which I bought nails of a Bugis trader, at 8d. a pound. My gimlets were, however, too small; and having no augers we were obliged to bore all the holes with hot irons, a most tedious and unsatisfactory operation.|$|E
60|$|This {{conception}} of the Great State, on the other hand, is still altogether unsubstantial. It is a project as dream-like to-day as electric lighting, electric traction, or aviation {{would have been in}} the year 1850. In 1850 a man reasonably conversant with the physical science of his time could have declared with a very considerable confidence that, given a certain measure of persistence and social security, these things were more likely to be attained than not in the course of the next century. But such a prophecy was conditional on the preliminary accumulation of a considerable amount of knowledge, on many experiments and failures. Had the world of 1850, by some wave of impulse, placed all its resources in the hands of the ablest scientific man alive, and asked him to produce a practicable paying electric vehicle before 1852, at best he would have produced some clumsy, curious toy, more probably he would have failed altogether; and, similarly, if the whole population of the world came to the present writer and promised meekly to do whatever it was told, we should find ourselves still very largely at a loss in our project for a millennium. Yet just as nearly every <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> upon Voltaic electricity in 1850 knew that he was preparing for electric traction, so do I know quite certainly, in spite of a whole row of unsolved problems before me, that I am working towards the Great State.|$|E
6000|$|And here, respectfully craving her permission, I {{must say}} a few words about this enterprising wife of mine. Though in years nearly old as myself, in spirit she is young as my little sorrel mare, Trigger, that threw me last fall. What is extraordinary, though she comes of a rheumatic family, she is {{straight}} as a pine, never has any aches; while for me with the sciatica, I am sometimes as crippled up as any old apple-tree. But she has {{not so much as a}} toothache. As for her hearing--let me enter the house in my dusty boots, and she away up in the attic. And for her sight--Biddy, the housemaid, tells other people's housemaids, that her mistress will spy a spot on the dresser straight through the pewter platter, put up on purpose to hide it. Her faculties are alert as her limbs and her senses. No danger of my spouse dying of torpor. The longest night in the year I've known her lie awake, planning her campaign for the morrow. She is a natural projector. The maxim, [...] "Whatever is, is right," [...] is not hers. Her maxim is, Whatever is, is wrong; and what is more, must be altered; and what is still more, must be altered right away. Dreadful maxim for the wife of a dozy old dreamer like me, who dote on seventh days as days of rest, and out of a sabbatical horror of industry, will, on a week day, go out of my road a quarter of a mile, to avoid the sight of a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
60|$|Another {{ten days}} of arduous toil, and, in turning a sharp corner in a defile, {{they saw a}} number of <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> As these {{heard the sound of}} the horses' feet they threw down their picks and shovels, and seized their guns.|$|R
60|$|Cortez, with Roger and the girl, {{ascended to}} the roof. From it they {{commanded}} a considerable prospect. On {{some of the}} roofs they could make out bodies of <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> but these were too far off {{to see what they}} were doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} two hundred <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> to-morrow morning," [...] Selingman remarked. [...] "If that agent {{had not been}} a very ignorant person, he would have known that a {{concrete}} floor is a necessity to any factory where heavy machinery is used." ...|$|R
