40|$|The rapid {{development}} in information and communications technology (ICT) {{has changed the}} methodology {{of teaching and learning}} geography in secondary schools. This paper tries to study the effectiveness of using web-based interactive animated <b>maps</b> <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> teaching and learning. For this purpose, a web-based interactive animated map was developed. The main features of the animated map were to test the studentsâ€™ ability in map reading, map feature recognition and understanding of main geographical concepts. A sample of this study consisting of 106 Form Four students (16 years old) was randomly selected and categorised into two groups. The experimental group was exposed to interactive animated maps whereas the control group used standard computer-delivered static maps without the animated features. The results of the post-test show that students using web-based interactive animated maps outperformed students using the standard computer-delivered static maps. The findings will be discussed especially those pertaining to the imbedded features of animated maps as a new approach of teaching geography that challenges and enhances student understanding...|$|E

40|$|Maps can lie, wield {{power and}} even start wars. But mapping, which {{describes}} {{the process of}} selecting and plotting information spatially, suggests a way of looking beyond the finished artefact, thereby eluding the charges leveled against the <b>map.</b> <b>In</b> recent discourse, <b>mapping</b> emerges {{from the ashes of}} the imperial <b>map</b> <b>in</b> a blaze of hopeful rhetoric: it is participatory, generative, revealing, enabling, performative. This paper will examine the historical and political baggage of the map and the potentials of mapping as an emerging concept. Building on the expansive discourse on <b>maps</b> and <b>mapping</b> <b>in</b> cartography, <b>geography</b> and history, I will focus this discussion on mapping as it has been interpreted in contemporary design, art, planning and education, drawing from some of my own experiences using mapping as a pedagogical tool in design education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to point out the {{importance}} of the application of the geographical <b>maps</b> and atlases <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> teaching. Beside students’ textbooks, maps represent one of the most important utility appliances <b>in</b> teaching <b>geography.</b> As such, they have to be synchronized with the curriculum, which means that they have to contain adequate general and thematic maps. The content of the map has to be simple and easily understandable as well as accurate and in accordance with the current occurrences and processes, both in the country and in the world. Such atlases would find their practical appliance <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> classes, and the accuracy of the map content would influence the shaping of the students’ geographical concept...|$|R
40|$|Geographical Information Systems (GIS) {{represent}} one of {{the major}} contributions to spatial analysis and planning of the new technologies. While teachers and others have viewed its potential contribution to geographical education as considerable, it has not been known with any certainty whether they present a valuable educational tool that aids geographical education. The value of GIS to geographical education is viewed as depending on a geographical education being, in itself, valuable. Within this context, synergetic focus groups are employed to explore the conceptions of GIS held by 109 secondary school students studying Senior Geography in metropolitan and regional Queensland, Australia. A phenomenographic approach is adopted to identify the six qualitatively different ways, or conceptions, in which the participating students experience GIS as: 1. Maps and a source of <b>maps</b> <b>in</b> <b>geography.</b> 2. Mapping in geography: a way to use and create maps. 3. A professional mapping tool: exceeding the needs of senior geography. 4. Frustrating geography: irksome and presenting many challenges to the student-user. 5. Relevant geography: within and beyond the school experience. 6. A better geography: offering a superior curriculum, and broader geographical education, when contrasted to a senior geography that omits its use. The structural and referential elements of each of these conceptions are elucidated within corresponding Categories of Description. The qualitatively different ways in which the conceptions may be experienced are illustrated through an Outcome Space, comprising a metaphoric island landscape. This structural framework reveals that for the Senior Geography students who participated in this investigation, the extent to which GIS may augment the curriculum is influenced by the nature of students' individual understandings of how GIS manages spatial data. This research project is a response to repeated calls in the literature for teachers of geography themselves to become researchers and for a better understanding of GIS within geography education. It reviews the salient literature with respect to geography and geography education generally, and GIS within geographical education specifically. The investigation has confirmed that qualitatively different conceptions of GIS exist amongst students and that these are not consistently aligned with assumptions about its use and benefits as presented by current literature. The findings of the study contribute to knowledge of the potential educational outcomes {{associated with the use of}} GIS in geography education and decisions related to current and potential geography curricula. It provides guidance for future curriculum development involving GIS and argues for additional research to inform educators and the spatial sciences industry about the actual and perceived role of GIS within geography education...|$|E
40|$|After World War I, which {{resulted}} in Hungary surrendering approximately two-thirds of its territory, strong support was given to “Hungarian Studies” aimed at strengthening Hungarian identity and justifying revisionary attempts. This paper investigates how <b>geography</b> <b>in</b> general, and statistical and <b>mapping</b> methods <b>in</b> human <b>geography</b> <b>in</b> particular, contributed to the revisionist project in interwar Hungary. To put the story in its disciplinary context, the paper begins by presenting the links between power, territorial politics, and geography that have existed <b>in</b> Europe since <b>geography</b> was institutionalized as academic discipline. Second, the paper investigates how geography and political power became intertwined in Hungary in the decades between 1867 {{and the end of}} the peace negotiations after World War I. Third, the main section of the paper employs some case studies to explain how human geographers in Hungary deployed some of their central arguments during the interwar period to delegitimize the post-WWI European order and to substantiate the righteousness of Hungarian revisionist goals...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Education, 1998. The {{place of}} {{topographic}} <b>map</b> reading <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> education is discussed with particular reference to South Africa. Theories of literacy acquisition and geographic and spatial concept development {{are related to}} the teaching of map reading. The extent of and reasons for poor pupil performance in mapwork as well as its consequences are examined. Using outcomes based learning principles the task of reading the 1 : 50 000 topographic map is analysed, the skills required to perform the sub-tasks of recognition, identification and comprehension are identified and a method is developed to sequence the teaching of these tasks. Programmed instruction design is investigated and self-instruction materials for reading the South African topographic map are developed. Results of a pilot test conducted when the programme was in a formative stage guided the final layout of the materials. A teaching kit comprising 52 work cards and corresponding answer cards and a pupils' answer and record booklet was used by learners in grade nine during a classroom trial and the results are reported. The use of the self-instruction method improved the map reading performance of this small sample population of adolescents, improvements to the prototype and further testing are recommended...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{questionnaire}} study conducted {{with a group}} of 87 pre-teenage children (age 11 - 12 years) in Hong Kong to show their vernacular perception and experience of maps before they began formal mapwork learning in their first year of secondary education. This study reveals major findings that these pre-teenage children see the main purpose of using maps is to find unfamiliar places and to locate them in most everyday situations. As a result, they like to deal with practical, real maps such as street maps and the MTR (Mass Transit Railway) transport maps where the above-mentioned practical map purpose can be achieved. Most of these pre-teenage children are aware of <b>maps</b> available <b>in</b> their surroundings. However, they may not be observant enough to notice or pay attention to reading them carefully. It is rather a matter of map awareness that puts these pre-teenage children into the two broad groups of map and non-map-users. It also revealed that even those pre-teenage children who claimed to be non-map-users demonstrated some intuitive superficial understanding of simple map concepts and elements. Teachers are strongly encouraged to tap into the intuitions and experiences possessed by pre-teenage children in order to develop their <b>map</b> interest further <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> lessons and to make the understanding of maps a practical life skill for them to master. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
