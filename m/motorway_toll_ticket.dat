40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} concept of how to collect toll on highways. Unlike any {{existing}} method, the proposed approach requires no structure to be built on highways for the toll collection purpose and drivers {{are not required to}} stop or even slow down to pay toll. Toll must be prepaid in advance and a driver must keep a <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> as proof of payment. We apply public key cryptographic operations to the ticket issuing system to prevent forgery as well as repudiation from the seller. This paper explains the mechanism of the system: the details of <b>toll</b> <b>tickets</b> issuance, the detection and penalization of drivers without a <b>toll</b> <b>ticket,</b> the prevention of <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> reproduction by involved parties, and the detection of an agent selling <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> for his own benefit...|$|R

500|$|The A8 is a {{toll road}} {{based on the}} Croatian vehicle {{classification}} using a ticket system—charging {{for use of the}} motorway based on distance travelled. The system was introduced as a unified toll charge system throughout the Istrian Y motorways in June 2011. Consequently, vehicles using either the A8 or the A9 or switching between the two at the Kanfanar interchange are charged a toll only when they leave the Istrian Y system, no matter where their <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> was issued. Along the A8 <b>motorway,</b> a <b>toll</b> is charged only for using the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar–Rogovići section; the remaining sections of the motorway are toll-free as of June 2012. Despite this, <b>toll</b> <b>tickets</b> are issued and collected at all exits with toll plazas. For instance, vehicles traveling between Rogovići and Vranja interchanges are issued <b>toll</b> <b>tickets</b> and are required to stop at toll plazas when entering and leaving the A8, but they are not charged for using the route. The toll charge for travelling {{the entire length of the}} motorway ranges from 36.00kuna (...) for passenger cars to 205.00kuna (€27.33) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll can be paid in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and several prepaid toll collection systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC; the last is an electronic toll collection system that is shared between all motorways in Croatia except the A2, providing drivers with discounted toll rates and dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the current status}} of research on fraud detection undertaken as part of the European Commission-funded ACTS ASPeCT (Advanced Security for Personal Communications Technologies) project, by Royal Holloway University of London. Using a recurrent neural network technique, we uniformly distribute prototypes over <b>toll</b> <b>tickets,</b> sampled from the U. K. network operator, Vodafone. The prototypes, which continue to adapt to cater for seasonal or long term trends, are used to classify incoming <b>toll</b> <b>tickets</b> to form statistical behavior profiles covering both the short- and the long-term past. We introduce a new decaying technique, which maintains these profiles such that short-term information is updated on a per <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> basis whilst the update of the long-term behavior can be delayed and controlled by the user. The new technique ensures that the short-term history updates the long-term history applying an even weighting to each <b>toll</b> <b>ticket.</b> The behavior profiles, maintained as probability distributions, form the input to a differential analysis utilizing a measure known as the Hellinger distance between them as an alarm criterion. Fine tuning the system to minimize the number of false alarms poses a significant task due to the low fraudulent/nonfraudulent activity ratio. We benefit from using unsupervised learning in that no fraudulent examples are required for training. This is very relevant considering the currently secure nature of GSM where fraud scenarios, other than subscription fraud, have yet to manifest themselves. It is the aim of ASPeCT to be prepared for the would-be fraudster for both GSM and UMTS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because {{the current}} {{research}} on traffic level {{has not yet been}} achieved classification, it cannot timely and effectively provide the basis for the Public transportation and safety management of the traffic control department. Introduce traffic safety index based on <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> data to evaluate freeway traffic levels. Firstly, combined with the relevant indicators of traffic engineering, put forward the concept of freeway traffic safety index; secondly, calculate the traffic safety index by analyzing real-time <b>toll</b> <b>ticket</b> data; finally, in order to improve the accuracy of evaluation, have an optimization of traffic safety index definition. Application on the Beijing-Hong Kong-Macao freeway shows that traffic safety index can be combined with monitoring data to evaluate the condition of road sections and the road network, and its historical data can be used to predict the road traffic conditions, and provide effective guidance for freeway traffic safety operation...|$|R
