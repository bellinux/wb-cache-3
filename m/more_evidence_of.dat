Among them, the Badami cave inscriptions of Mangalesha (578), Kappe Arabhatta record of c.700, Peddavaduguru inscription of PulakeshinII, the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of VikramadityaII (all in Kannada language) provide <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the Chalukya language. The Badami cliff inscription of PulakeshinI (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of PulakeshinII (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script.|$|E
5|$|In 1985–86 Cleveland County Archaeology Section {{carried out}} a major {{excavation}} of {{the west end of}} the nave to consolidate an area of subsidence. Its cause was the collapse of an unrecorded burial vault. The excavations found <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the fire of 1289 including scorched masonry, a shattered bell and broken grave-slabs. The remains of 47 people – 21 men, 17 women, 6 children and 3 of undetermined gender – were discovered, some of whom had been buried with grave goods including a gold finger ring and jet crosses. Two chalices and patens were found alongside the remains of two priests. The skeletons were cremated and the ashes scattered in the Monks' Walk in the Priory Gardens. A geophysical survey carried out to the west and east of the west range indicated the existence of the remains of other monastic buildings which have yet to be excavated.|$|E

5|$|In pre-Columbian times, the Lees Ferry {{area was}} {{inhabited}} first by Paleo-Indians, who populated the region beginning about 11,500 years ago, {{followed by the}} Archaic culture, which appeared on the Colorado Plateau about 8,000 years ago. The Anasazi, Paiute and Navajo peoples, who left <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> habitation in the valley, arrived {{only in the last}} 1,000 years or so. Evidence, including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River, suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless, indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E

25|$|Along the {{southern}} edge of Żejtun, excavations led to the discovery of an ancient Roman villa. The remains still contain areas of the original Roman tiling and coloured stucco. The complex was an active settlement since the Bronze Age, although the presently visible remains can be dated from the Punic period right up to Late Antiquity. <b>More</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> ancient habitation in the area comes from burial grounds, such as those around St Gregory's Church, Tal-Barrani, Tal-Ħotba and Bulebel.

25|$|In 1874, Hodge {{published}} What is Darwinism?, {{claiming that}} Darwinism, was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was {{contrary to the}} notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Both in the Review and in What is Darwinism?, (1874) Hodge attacked Darwinism. His views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile, at Princeton University, a totally separate institution, President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However, in 1868, upon Maclean's retirement, James McCosh, a philosopher, became president. McCosh believed that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus argued that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college (Princeton University) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.|$|E
25|$|From 1925 to 1926 Lees {{surveyed}} Oman with K. Washington Gray, {{the resulting}} papers (given to the Geological Society of London and the Royal Geographical Society) remained standard {{works for the}} region until at least the 1950s. Lees (1928) addressed the intriguing question of how remnants of oceanic crust, known as the Semail Ophiolite, came to occur all around the Hajar Mountains of Oman. He proposed a huge thrust sheet, the Semail Nappe, based on his observations in the Oman Mountains, and on {{his knowledge of the}} Alps and of the Zagros. Lee's theory was remarkably far-sighted and, as evidence of plate tectonics grew, a development of his theory emerged. This postulated that, as the continents moved together, a slab of ocean crust from the ancient Tethys Ocean had been pushed over the continental margin for hundreds of kilometres about 87-76 million years ago. However, Hugh Wilson, a leading proponent of the 'in-situ' theory that these igneous rocks had essentially flowed into position, observed that the major displacement surfaces were not prominent in the field and that he had seen <b>more</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> extension than compression in the Oman Mountains. Glennie (2001) remains a spirited critique of most of Wilson's arguments. Almost all later authors interpret the Semail Ophiolite as thrust, or obducted, probably due to a short period of subduction close to the margin of the Arabian plate.|$|E
