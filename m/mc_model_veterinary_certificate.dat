40|$|Mesoscopic {{simulations}} of electron transport in disordered materials {{are based on}} the many particle Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. One of the major disadvantages of the multi-electron <b>MC</b> <b>modeling</b> is that the simulation process becomes significantly slow as the concentration of electrons increases. This problem makes it almost impossible to gain information about the electron transport at high Fermi levels. Recently a single-particle <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> has been proposed which is based on the truncated density of localized states (DLOS) and benefits from very short time execution. Although this model can successfully clarify the properties of the electron transport in moderately disordered systems (e. g. nanocrystalline TiO 2), utilizing the single-particle <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> for a strongly disordered medium (e. g. nanocrystalline ZnO) may conducts erroneous estimation of the electron transport coefficient. The limitation of this single-particle <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> originates primarily from using a truncated DLOS. Another obstacle of the model is that it ignores the spatial occupation of localized states in the transport medium. In this regard, for a strongly disordered medium, the deviation of the single-particle <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> is quite large when compared with theoretical the predictions. Here, based on the modified electron residence time in the localized states, we propose a different single-particle <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> which covers the aforementioned models' drawbacks and simultaneously reduces the simulation time. The proposed model is justified by theoretical calculations for a simple cubic lattice at wide range values of disorder parameter, Fermi level, and temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{configuration}} coordinate (CC) {{and momentum}} conservation (<b>MC)</b> <b>models</b> {{have been widely}} used to explain the phonon sidebands of impurity spectra in semiconductors. In this paper, the distinction between the CC and <b>MC</b> <b>models</b> is discussed. We conclude that the <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> only applies to shallow Coulombic impurities; in other cases, such as isoelectronic traps, the CC model is more appropriate. We show that the Huang-Rhys parameters for bulk phonon modes coupling to a bound electron or exciton can be calculated from the bound-state wave function in k space if the phonon-induced intervalley and intravalley electron scattering processes of the pure crystal are known. We study in detail the phonon sidebands of nitrogen-bound excitons in GaP, giving the selection rules for electron-phonon coupling in the CC model, and showing that their strength can be well accounted for by the CC model. The apparently anomalous ''X'' peak of the LO-phonon sideband in GaP:N is shown to be associated with intervalley scattering in the conduction band. The <b>MC</b> <b>model,</b> which has been used in an attempt to explain the phonon sidebands of GaP:N in some previous work, is shown to be inapplicable to this case...|$|R

The {{recrystallization}} {{behavior of}} cold-rolled, commercial-purity titanium was studied experimentally and with Monte-Carlo (<b>MC)</b> <b>modeling.</b> Utilization of EBSD-OIM as input for <b>MC</b> <b>modeling</b> resulted in realistic predictions of recrystallization kinetics, microstructure and texture, {{which were in}} good agreement with experimental results. <b>MC</b> <b>modeling</b> of recrystallization kinetics predicted that the non-uniform stored energy distribution, heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallization and recovery in combination leads to a negative deviation from linear JMAK kinetics. It was found that concurrent recovery that takes place during recrystallization is an important process that controls both the overall recrystallization kinetics and the deviation of linear JMAK kinetics. On the other hand, the non-uniformly distributed stored energy itself has {{little effect on the}} negative deviation from JMAK kinetics but intensifies the deviation when heterogeneous nucleation is combined. Modeling results also revealed that heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallized grains and their early impingement in local areas of high deformation are essential for producing a log-normal distribution of grain size and a typical recrystallization texture of rolled titanium...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigators}} of EPID dosimetric properties have ascribed the backscatter, that contaminates dosimetric EPID images, to its supporting arm. Accordingly, Monte-Carlo (<b>MC)</b> EPID <b>models</b> have approximated the backscatter {{signal from}} the layers under the detector and the robotic support arm using either uniform or non-uniform solid water slabs, or through convolutions with back-scatter kernels. The aim of this work {{is to improve the}} existent <b>MC</b> <b>models</b> by measuring and modelling the separate backscatter contributions of the robotic arm and the rear plastic housing of the EPID. The EPID plastic housing is non-uniform with a 11. 9 cm wide indented section that runs across the cross-plane direction in the superior half of the EPID which is 1. 75 cm closer to the EPID sensitive layer {{than the rest of the}} housing. The thickness of the plastic housing is 0. 5 cm. Experiments were performed with and without the housing present by removing all components of the EPID from the housing. The robotic support arm was not present for these measurements. A <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> of the linear accelerator and the EPID was modified to include the rear-housing indentation and results compared to the measurement. The rear housing was found to contribute a maximum of 3 % additional signal. The rear housing contribution to the image is non-uniform in the in-plane direction with 2 % asymmetry across the central 20 cm of an image irradiating the entire detector. The <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> was able to reproduce this non-uniform contribution.

40|$|Purpose – To {{illustrate}} {{and discuss}} how {{different types of}} responsibility values are mobilised in a Swedish international company. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is informed by a constructivist pragmatism framework. The {{part of the study}} related to the case site was inspired by an ethnographic research approach and involved intensive face-to-face observations over a period of two years. Data was collected at four main levels: external and internal documents, observation of project meetings, interviews with project members, and informal talks with organisation members. Findings – Possible conflicts of interest between human and business perspectives are exposed. Awareness of these interest-conflicts, however, facilitates a potential bridging of the two perspectives. Our findings suggest possible explanations as to why management control (<b>MC)</b> <b>models</b> work in practice. Although values pertaining to shareholder maximisation are given prominence in external communication, the internal <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> also emphasises the values considered necessary and desirable by professionals, such as confidence, commitment and respect. The study reveals that the way values are handled affects the responsibility taken by employees in everyday situations. By using the constructivist pragmatism framework, it becomes clear that values cause people to act, and not MC systems. Originality/value – Although many studies have described the shortcoming of <b>MC</b> <b>models,</b> few studies platform from the concept of responsibility. In this paper it is shown how accounting communicates values underpinning responsibility, and contributes towards explaining why certain types of <b>MC</b> <b>models</b> can be more successful than others.

In this research, settlement behaviour of a pile foundation located in sandy-silt, under the loads from high-rised building is simulated in 2 D using a finite element program (PLAXIS). Three different types of analysis were investigated: a linear elastic (LE) analysis where the soil was assumed as linear-elastic material, a simple nonlinear analysis where the soil was completely assumed as Mohr- coulomb (<b>MC)</b> <b>model</b> and an advanced nonlinear analysis where the soil was completely assumed as Hardening-Soil (HS) model. A comparison was done between the predicted settlement from Finite element analysis and field settlement values. Based on the results of analysis, it is suggested that although complete <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> shows good agreement with the settlement behaviour obtained from field static load test at lower working loads, <b>MC</b> <b>model</b> is not adequate to capture the settlement prediction at higher working loads. In addition, modelling the soil completely using HS model is required to capture the safe settlement prediction at higher working loads.
