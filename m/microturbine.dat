25|$|The University of New Brunswick has {{attempted}} to reduce its environmental impact through installing a natural gas burning <b>microturbine</b> at the Central Heating Plant that produces 100kW of electricity for the university.|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of California's 2001 energy crisis, BWP {{unveiled}} a mini-power plant at its landfill. It marked the world's first commercial landfill power plant using Capstone <b>microturbine</b> technology. Ten microturbines run on naturally occurring landfill gas, producing 300 kilowatts of renewable energy for Burbank. That's enough energy to serve the daily needs of about 250 homes. The landfill {{is located in the}} Verdugo Mountains in the northeastern portion of the city.|$|E
2500|$|The methane in biogas can {{be burned}} to produce both heat and electricity, usually with a {{reciprocating}} engine or <b>microturbine</b> {{often in a}} cogeneration arrangement where the electricity and waste heat generated are used to warm the digesters or to heat buildings.

50|$|However, {{reciprocating}} engine generators are quicker {{to respond to}} changes in output power requirement and are usually slightly more efficient, although the efficiency of <b>microturbines</b> is increasing. <b>Microturbines</b> also lose more efficiency at low power levels than {{reciprocating engine}}s.|$|R
40|$|<b>Microturbines</b> are a {{relatively}} new distributed generation technology. Combined heat and power, known as cogeneration, can be considered the most economical attractive investment in <b>microturbines.</b> Latest technologies and increasing energy prices are propelling this technology to the forefront. This study aims to review {{the current state of}} utilization of <b>microturbines</b> in distributed generation as a standalone system or within a hybrid system to supply loads. It is found that more research and development effort is needed to improve the performance of <b>microturbines,</b> integrate them with other energy sources and adopt standards and regulations to connect them with the utility grid. These standards shall be developed to serve all parties and take into account regional and international requirements. Furthermore, complete mathematical modeling, especially for fuel consumption is still required. The development of small scale units within the range of kilowatts for in-house use as a backup source of residential PV system is also needed...|$|R

In so doing, it draws widely on his experience gained during the development of steam <b>microturbines</b> for use in small combined heat and power stations based on the organic Rankine cycle (CHP-ORC). Major issues concerning the dynamic properties of mechanical systems, in particular rotating systems, are discussed, and the results obtained when using unconventional bearing systems, presented.

40|$|Abstract:- This report {{describes}} different {{possibilities of}} simultaneous production of electrical and thermal energy (CHP- Combined Heat and Power) from gas. It mostly emphasizes advantages of using <b>microturbines</b> as devices producing energy. The document mentions already released products, shortly describes existing solutions {{and some new}} ideas, which are worth being considered. Some competitive solutions not using <b>microturbines</b> are also taken into consideration and briefly described. In the penultimate paragraph the maintenance costs {{of the two most}} promising solutions are calculated. Although the expenses reduction seems to be low and varies from 22 to 33 %, there are other advantages of using the systems – they are environmental friendly and almost noiseless...|$|R
50|$|Reciprocating engines {{typically}} use simple {{motor oil}} (journal) bearings.Full-size gas turbines often use ball bearings.The 1000 °C temperatures and high speeds of <b>microturbines</b> make oil lubrication and ball bearings impractical; they require air bearings or possibly magnetic bearings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Microturbines</b> {{also have}} a further {{advantage}} of having {{the majority of the}} waste heat contained in the relatively high temperature exhaust making it simpler to capture, whereas the waste heat of reciprocating engines is split between its exhaust and cooling system.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, PPAs are {{typically}} subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

50|$|One {{particularly}} intriguing {{option for}} both propulsion and power was a button-sized silicon <b>microturbine</b> ("jet") engine developed by Dr. Al Epstein at MIT during the 1990s.

50|$|Many engine-generators use a {{reciprocating}} engine, with fuels mentioned above. This {{can be a}} steam engine, such as most coal-powered fossil-fuel {{power plants}} use. Some engine-generators use a turbine as the engine, such as the industrial gas turbines used in peaking power plants and the <b>microturbines</b> used in some hybrid electric buses.|$|R

50|$|Microturbines are {{becoming}} widespread in distributed power and {{combined heat and power}} applications, {{and are very}} promising for powering hybrid electric vehicles. They range from hand held units producing less than a kilowatt, to commercial sized systems that produce tens or hundreds of kilowatts. Basic principles of <b>microturbine</b> are based on micro-combustion.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{incentives}} include {{federal and}} state tax deductions and tax breaks. Tax incentives can be directed at consumers, such as {{for the purchase of}} energy-efficient appliances or for solar energy systems, small wind systems, geothermal heat pumps, and residential fuel cell and <b>microturbine</b> systems. Tax incentives can also be directed at electricity producers, in particular for renewable energy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microturbine</b> {{systems have}} many claimed {{advantages}} over reciprocating engine generators, such as higher power-to-weight ratio, low emissions and few, or just one, moving part. Advantages are that microturbines may be designed with foil bearings and air-cooling operating without lubricating oil, coolants or other hazardous materials. Nevertheless, reciprocating engines overall are still cheaper when all factors are considered.|$|E

MIT's millimeter size turbine will deliver 500-700 W·h/kg in the near term, rising to 1200-1500 W∙h/kg in the longer term.|$|R
40|$|The {{installation}} of dispersed generators involves the critical reassessment of {{the adequacy of}} network protections, {{with reference to the}} relevant standards. The adequacy of the relay design, setting and coordination becomes critical for the proper network operation: that depends on the dynamic interaction among the various types of distributed generators (<b>microturbines,</b> fuel-cells, photovoltaic systems) and the network. Aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the dynamic behavior of different kinds of distributed generators, connected to the network either directly or by means of power electronic interfaces, after the occurrence of faults and typical perturbations. Simplified dynamic models of different types of distributed generation units (<b>microturbines,</b> fuel cells and photovoltaic plants) are given in the paper, and the results of the simulations obtained by using realistic distribution network configurations are presented and discussed, in view of the reassessment of the adequacy and reliability of the power system protections...|$|R
