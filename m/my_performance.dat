Aside from the uplifting [...] "You", both authors identify [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as the only saving grace. Gary Tillery notes the [...] "darkly sarcastic" [...] album title for a collection full of such [...] "downbeat" [...] tracks, the darkest of which is [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies". Harrison himself rated Extra Texture as his worst solo release of the 1970s. Speaking to Musician magazine in 1987, he dismissed it as [...] "a grubby album" [...] and added: [...] "The production left {{a lot to be}} desired, as did <b>my</b> <b>performance...</b> Some songs I like, but in retrospect I wasn't very happy about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked <b>my</b> <b>performance</b> because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E

Prince would inspire [...] "Nice & Slow" [...] while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. Usher's third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson.

Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice.
