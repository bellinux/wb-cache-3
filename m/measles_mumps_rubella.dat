25|$|The MMRV vaccine, a {{combined}} <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, {{has been proposed}} {{as a replacement for}} the MMR vaccine to simplify administration of the vaccines. Preliminary data indicate a rate of Febrile seizures of 9 per 10,000 vaccinations with MMRV, as opposed to 4 per 10,000 for separate MMR and varicella shots; U.S. health officials therefore do not express a preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections.|$|E
25|$|A {{preceding}} antigenic challenge can {{be identified}} in approximately two-thirds of people. Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, enterovirus, <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella,</b> varicella zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella,</b> pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than {{the risk of developing}} ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.|$|E
40|$|Combined <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> {{vaccination}} is soon {{to become}} available in Britain in the routine immunisation programme. A controlled study {{was performed in}} 319 children, aged 13 months, to assess the antibody response and clinical reactions to a new combined <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> vaccine in comparison with a single component measles vaccine. In the children who received the combined vaccine, seroconversion was established in 93 % for measles, 99 % for rubella, and 100 % for mumps. In the children who received the single measles vaccine, seroconversion was established in 92 % for measles and in none for <b>rubella</b> and <b>mumps.</b> There was no increase in clinical reactions after the <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> vaccine compared with the measles vaccine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study factors {{affecting}} uptake of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> immunisation. DESIGN [...] Cohort study {{using data from}} computerised child health systems. SETTING [...] 10 health districts in North East Thames and North West Thames regions. SUBJECTS [...] 7841 children born in January to March 1990 and resident in the districts up {{till the end of}} October 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Overall uptake of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> immunisation, variation of uptake among groups of children, and odds ratio of being vaccinated against <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella.</b> RESULTS [...] The overall uptake rate of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> immunisation for the study cohort in the 10 districts was 82 %. Wide variation was identified among children with different demographic characteristics. Lower uptake was associated with absent or incomplete primary immunisation, including omission of pertussis vaccine. Other {{factors affecting}} uptake included the type of resident district, birth order, where registered for immunisation (general practitioner or clinic), and one parent family status. CONCLUSIONS [...] Many districts have difficulties in meeting the 90 % target for <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> immunisation, mainly because of the characteristics of their local population. To increase overall coverage, the health service should target families with adverse factors, especially those whose children have missed previous immunisations...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: <b>Measles,</b> <b>mumps</b> and <b>rubella</b> (MMR) {{contribute}} to {{significant amount of}} mortality and morbidity in our country. Though MMR vaccine {{has been a part}} of immunization schedule in the developed countries, it is yet to be included in our national immunization schedule. Hence this study was conducted to assess the serological status of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps</b> and <b>rubella</b> in young children and to evaluate the seroconversion of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps</b> and <b>rubella</b> vaccine at 9 and 15 months of age. Methods: The cohort study was carried out at the out patient department of a tertiary care hospital in north India. A total of 240 normal children, 120 each in the age group 9 - 10 and 15 - 18 months attending the hospital for immunization were enrolled for the study. None of them had been vaccinated with MMR vaccine in the past, or gave any history of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps</b> or <b>rubella</b> infection, or were on any immunosuppressive agent. The pre-vaccination blood sample was taken and each child was administered a single dose of trivalent MMR vaccine. The post-vaccination sample was taken 6 - 8 wk later. The paired serum samples were analysed for the presence of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps</b> and <b>rubella</b> antibodies using commercially available ELISA kits.

2500|$|Most {{people with}} A-T have low {{lymphocyte}} counts in the blood. This problem {{seems to be}} relatively stable with age, but a rare number of people do have progressively decreasing lymphocyte counts as they get older. In the general population, very low lymphocyte counts are {{associated with an increased}} risk for infection. Such individuals develop complications from live viral vaccines (<b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> and chickenpox), chronic or severe viral infections, yeast infections of the skin and vagina, and [...] opportunistic infections (such as pneumocystis pneumonia). Although lymphocyte counts are often as low in people with A-T, they seldom have problems with opportunistic infections. (The one exception to that rule is that problems with chronic or recurrent warts are common.) The number and function of T-lymphocytes should be re-evaluated if a person with A-T is treated with corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone for longer than a few weeks or is treated with chemotherapy for cancer. If lymphocyte counts are low in people taking those types of drugs, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended to prevent opportunistic infections.|$|E

If antibody function is normal, all routine childhood immunizations including live viral vaccines (<b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> and varicella) should be given. In addition, several “special” vaccines (that is, licensed but not routine for otherwise healthy children and young adults) should be given to decrease the risk that an A-T patient will develop lung infections. The patient and all household members should receive the influenza (flu) vaccine every fall. People with A-T [...] who are less than two years old should receive three (3) doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) given at two month intervals. People older than two years who have not previously been immunized with Prevnar should receive two (2) doses of Prevnar. At least 6 months after the last Prevnar has been given and after the child is at least two years old, the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine should be administered. Immunization with the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine should be repeated approximately every five years after the first dose.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{persistence}} of antibodies againstmeasles,mumps, and rubella induced by themeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the kinetics of antibody decline {{after the second}} MMR vaccine dose were studied in the same cohort for 20 years. Methods. <b>Measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> antibodies weremeasured by enzyme immunoassay in 20 -year follow-up serum samples (n 183) of twice-vaccinated individuals, and measles antibodies were also measured in oral fluids (n 177). Antibody decay was determined in a group (n 58) with subsequent samples collected 1, 8, and 15 years after the second MMR dose. Results. In total, 95 %, 74 %, and 100 % of 183 vaccinees were still seropositive for <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella,</b> respectively, and 85 % of 177 vaccinees had measurable measles antibodies in their oral fluids. The antibody levels declined significantly after the second dose, but subsequently the rate of decline was slower. Conclusions. Ahigh rate of seropositivitywas found 20 years after the firstMMRdose, particularly for rubella and measles. Our results show thatMMR vaccine–induced antibodies wane significantly after the second dose.
