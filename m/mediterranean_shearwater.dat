40|$|Se discute la identificación y variaciones de plumaje de las dos subespecies de pardela mediterránea Puffinus yelkouan. Existe una gama mayor de variaciones en la subespecie mauretanicus, mientras que yelkouan es más regular y muestra un plumaje con más similitudes a la pardela pichaneta Puffinus puffinus. La separación de las dos subespecies depende mayoritariamente de la presencia o no de una franja pectoral, del porcentaje de aves con o sin este carácter y también de la posición geográfica.

40|$|Este artículo contiene 18 páginas, 7 figuras, 8 tablas. Fisheries have an {{enormous}} economic importance, but reconciling their socio-economic features with the conservation and sustainability of marine ecosystems presents major challenges. Bycatch mortality from fisheries is clearly among the most serious global threats for marine ecosystems, affecting {{a wide range of}} top predators. Recent estimates report ca. 200, 000 seabirds killed annually by bycatch in European waters. However, there is an urgent need to rigorously estimate actual mortality rates and quantify effects of bycatch on populations. The Mediterranean Sea {{is one of the most}} impacted regions. Here, we estimate for the first time both bycatch mortality rates and their population-level effects on three endemic and vulnerable <b>Mediterranean</b> taxa: Scopoli’s <b>shearwater,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> shag, and Audouin’s gull, that die in different types of fishing gears: longlines, gillnets and sport trolling, respectively. We use multi-event capture–recapture modelling to estimate crucial demographic parameters, including the probabilities of dying in different fishing gears. We then build stochastic demography models to forecast the viability of the populations under different management scenarios. Longline bycatch was particularly severe for adults of Scopoli’s shearwaters and Audouin’s gulls (ca. 28...|$|R
50|$|Mating with related {{individuals}} {{is rare in}} naturally occurring populations of birds due {{to the production of}} lower quality offspring suffering from the genetic effects of inbreeding depression. Seabirds have an inherently high risk of inbreeding because most are natally philopatric, and many are highly endangered with some species’ entire populations breeding on one small island. Despite this, inbreeding was observed no more than expected by random chance in the wandering albatross and the critically endangered Amsterdam albatross (D. amsterdamensis). In contrast, some studies of seabirds have shown evidence of inbreeding. Huyvaert and Parker (2010) detected low frequencies of inbreeding in waved albatrosses and genetic similarity was negatively related to EPFs, which is an unusual result that does not support the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. Close inbreeding was observed at low frequencies in the <b>Mediterranean</b> Cory’s <b>shearwater</b> (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) where two mother-son pairs were reported.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Intraspecific {{variability}} in the migratory movements of seabirds is being revealed far more complex than hitherto recognized, and our lack of understanding undermines their effective protection. Our aim is to test whether the isotopic values of a single feather of two threatened seabirds, the Mediterranean (Puffinus yelkouan) and the Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) shearwaters allow the geographic assignment of birds to their non-breeding areas. Location: These two species are known to use three main non-breeding areas: the NE Atlantic Ocean, the W Mediterranean and the Aegean-Black seas. Methods: We clustered in three groups the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of the first primary feather (P 1), inferred to be grown during the non-breeding period, of 34 Mediterranean and 56 Balearic shearwaters accidentally caught by longliners. To link the isotopic values of P 1 to its corresponding non-breeding area, we performed a discriminant function analysis (DFA) based on the three clusters and applied this function to feathers of known origin: P 1 from seven Mediterranean shearwaters from Hyères Archipelago (France) tracked with geolocators and body feathers from six chicks from Balearic shearwaters. To link the moulting patterns to the areas where the feathers were grown, we applied the DFA to a sequence of primary feathers of eight Balearic and five Mediterranean shearwaters (caught by longliners). Results: Isotopic and tracking data indicate {{that none of the}} Mediterranean shearwaters migrated to the Atlantic. The cluster and discriminant function analyses revealed that 8 % of Balearic and 54 % of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>shearwater</b> moulted P 1 in the Mediterranean Sea. Migratory movements were reflected in the changing isotopic values of the primary sequences. Main conclusions: Stable isotope analyses (SIA) are a powerful approach to reveal the intraspecific {{variability in}} the migratory patterns of seabirds that use distinct isotopic areas over their annual cycle. The assignment of birds to their non-breeding areas by means of SIA is a simple and effective tool that can help to evaluate the impact of human activities in remote areas not only at population but also at individual level, which is an essential knowledge for the management and conservation of threatened species.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} and {{the ecology}} of seabirds such as albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters have been subject of numerous studies, often employing the most recent technologies to track birds during their foraging trips. Until now, however, big oceanic species have been preferred for these studies because of the dimensions and weight of the devices. New light GPS loggers (< 9 g) were used to track foraging trips of a medium-sized species, the Cory’s shearwater, {{for the first time}} in the Mediterranean Sea. The tracks obtained in our study showed that <b>Mediterranean</b> Cory’s <b>shearwaters</b> alternatively used one of two different fishing areas. Various explanations could account for this difference; one of these could be that the two directions have a different relevance for the birds being for chick- and self-provisioning. This study provides new hypotheses concerning the behaviour of Cory’s <b>shearwaters</b> in the <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea, which is a different environment respect to previously studied oceans...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} offspring {{sex ratio}} variation in <b>Mediterranean</b> Cory's <b>Shearwater</b> (Calonectris d. diomedea) during two consecutive breeding seasons in two colonies. We test for differential breeding conditions between years and colonies looking at several breeding parameters and parental condition. We then explored {{the relationship between}} offspring sex ratio and parental condition and breeding parameters. This species is sexually dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females; consequently we expected differential parental cost in rearing sexes, or a greater sensitivity of male chicks to adverse conditions, which may lead to biased sex ratios. Chicks were sexed molecularly by the amplification of the CHD genes. Offspring sex ratio {{did not differ from}} parity, either at hatching or fledging, regardless of the colony or year. However, parental body condition and breeding parameters such as egg size and breeding success were different between years and colonies. Nevertheless, neither nestling mortality nor body condition at fledging varied between years or colonies, suggesting that male and female chicks were probably not differentially affected by variability in breeding conditions...|$|R
40|$|We describe, for {{the first}} time, nest-cavities {{selected}} by the <b>Mediterranean</b> endemic yelkouan <b>shearwater</b> Puffinus yelkouan on French islands, comparing it with the sympatric Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea. By monitoring 179 suitable cavities during four years, we show that yelkouan shearwaters select deeper cavities and with more winding tunnels than those selected by Cory’s shearwaters or unoccupied cavities. Logistic regression modelling indicates that cavities with nest-like characteristics are not limited. We show that breeding success is enhanced in deeper cavities, with winding tunnels and higher block covers. We do not find any apparent competition between the two shearwater species.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests oceanic traits {{may play a}} key role in the genetic structuring of marine organisms. Whereas genetic breaks in the open ocean are well known in fishes and marine invertebrates, the importance of marine habitat characteristics in seabirds remains less certain. We investigated the role of oceanic transitions versus population genetic processes in driving population differentiation in a highly vagile seabird, the Cory"s shearwater, combining molecular, morphological and ecological data from 27 breeding colonies distributed across the Mediterranean (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) and the Atlantic (C. d. borealis). Genetic and biometric analyses showed a clear differentiation between Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> Cory"s <b>shearwaters.</b> Ringing-recovery data indicated high site fidelity of the species, but we found some cases of dispersal among neighbouring breeding sites (1000 km) within and between each basin. In agreement with this, comparison of phenotypic and genetic data revealed both current and historical dispersal events. Within each region, we did not detect any genetic substructure among archipelagos in the Atlantic, but we found a slight genetic differentiation between western and eastern breeding colonies in the Mediterranean. Accordingly, gene flow estimates suggested substantial dispersal among colonies within basins. Overall, genetic structure of the Cory"s shearwater matches main oceanographic breaks (Almería-Oran Oceanic Front and Siculo-Tunisian Strait), but spatial analyses suggest that patterns of genetic differentiation are better explained by geographic rather than oceanographic distances. In line with previous studies, genetic, phenotypic and ecological evidence supported the separation of Atlantic and Mediterranean forms, suggesting the 2 taxa should be regarded as different species...|$|R
40|$|Longline fisheries, oil spills, and {{offshore}} wind farms {{are some of}} the major threats increasing seabird mortality at sea, but the impact of these threats on specific populations has been difficult to determine so far. We tested the use of molecular markers, morphometric measures, and stable isotope (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) and trace element concentrations in the first primary feather (grown {{at the end of the}} breeding period) to assign the geographic origin of Calonectris shearwaters. Overall, we sampled birds from three taxa: 13 <b>Mediterranean</b> Cory's <b>Shearwater</b> (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) breeding sites, 10 Atlantic Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) breeding sites, and one Cape Verde Shearwater (C. edwardsii) breeding site. Assignment rates were investigated at three spatial scales: breeding colony, breeding archipelago, and taxa levels. Genetic analyses based on the mitochondrial control region (198 birds from 21 breeding colonies) correctly assigned 100 % of birds to the three main taxa but failed in detecting geographic structuring at lower scales. Discriminant analyses based on trace elements composition achieved the best rate of correct assignment to colony (77. 5 %). Body measurements or stable isotopes mainly succeeded in assigning individuals among taxa (87. 9 % and 89. 9 %, respectively) but failed at the colony level (27. 1 % and 38. 0 %, respectively). Combining all three approaches (morphometrics, isotopes, and trace elements on 186 birds from 15 breeding colonies) substantially improved correct classifications (86. 0 %, 90. 7 %, and 100 % among colonies, archipelagos, and taxa, respectively). Validations using two independent data sets and jackknife cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the combined approach in the colony assignment (62. 5 %, 58. 8 %, and 69. 8 % for each validation test, respectively). A preliminary application of the discriminant model based on stable isotope δ 15 N and δ 13 C values and trace elements (219 birds from 17 breeding sites) showed that 41 Cory's Shearwaters caught by western Mediterranean long-liners came mainly from breeding colonies in Menorca (48. 8 %), Ibiza (14. 6 %), and Crete (31. 7 %). Our findings show that combining analyses of trace elements and stable isotopes on feathers can achieve high rates of correct geographic assignment of birds in the marine environment, opening new prospects for the study of seabird mortality at sea...|$|R
40|$|Seabirds {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} animal taxa worldwide as they have to deal with threats both at sea and on their breeding grounds. One of these threats is the loss and deterioration of their nesting habitat Here, we evaluated the long-term effectiveness of providing artificial burrows for the conservation of Yelkouan (Puffinus yelkouan) and Scopoli's (Calonectris diomedea) shearwaters on two islands of the Hyeres archipelago (Mediterranean, France). We estimated and compared the longevity, occupancy of and breeding success in artificial burrows and natural cavities. We also analysed factors affecting these three parameters in artificial burrows to optimize their installation for the conservation of our study species. Although their efficacy depended on the species and the island considered, artificial burrows provided more stable and persistent breeding habitat (12 -years persistence: 80 % vs. 72 %), allowed the recruitment of new breeders and good reproductive success (49 - 76 %), and probably reduced inter-specific competition for nesting cavities, across the two islands. The characteristics of both artificial burrows and the areas where they were installed affected artificial burrow efficacy in terms of longevity and occupancy by shearwaters. Thus, artificial burrows were successful tools for the conservation of these two <b>Mediterranean</b> species of <b>shearwaters,</b> particularly when their design and installation were optimized by limiting the risk of their destruction and by selecting burrow and habitat characteristics that enhance their occupancy by the target species.

40|$|International audienceDomestic {{cats are}} one of the most {{widespread}} predators on islands worldwide and are responsible for numerous reductions and extinctions of species on islands. The three main islands of the Hyères Archipelago house one of the largest colonies of the <b>Mediterranean</b> endemic Yelkouan <b>shearwater</b> Puffinus yelkouan that has recently been up-listed by the IUCN to ‘vulnerable’. The main objectives of this study were to assess the diet of cats and to study the effect of cat predation on Yelkouan shearwater populations at the archipelago scale. The diet of cats was studied using scat analyses according to years and seasons for each island. Simultaneously, Yelkouan shearwater breeding success was monitored during a period of 8 years on Port-Cros and Porquerolles, and 3 years on Le Levant. Descriptive analyses and GLM were used to compare data gathered on each island. At the archipelago scale, cats preyed strongly upon introduced mammals and shearwaters. Surprisingly, large differences appeared in cats’ diet according to the island considered. The Yelkouan shearwater was the primary prey of cats on Le Levant, but secondary on Port-Cros and Porquerolles. Cat predation was mainly concentrated during the shearwater prospecting period, when birds arrive at the colonies and look for a mate (if they are not already paired) and a burrow before breeding. Consequently cat impact was low on shearwater breeding success. However, this study demonstrates that the cat management conducted on Port-Cros was positive for fledging success. The successful cat eradication on Port-Cros supports the need to continue working for Yelkouan shearwater conservation with Le Levant as a priority, because this is where the colonies are largest and predation on Yelkouan shearwaters is very hig...|$|R
