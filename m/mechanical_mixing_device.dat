In film devices effectively the processes of heat - and mass-exchange with the gas comes into contact with the culture fluid flowing as a film on a transparent film-forming surface is STI in its light intensity and autotrophic biosynthesis occurs only in the presence of a mixture of air with carbon dioxide. Thus, completely eliminated the accumulation of metabolic products due to their continuous removal from film culture liquid with the process gas, which is not typical for devices of other types. Small size membrane bioreactors may increase the degree of saturation of the liquid carbon dioxide with the possibility of changing the concentration of gas in the culture fluid and to ensure the cultivation of microorganisms with a specified biomass yield. At present up to date-developed a significant number of ways to ensure contact of the gas with the liquid (bubbling, gas-lift, mechanical stirring, jet, membrane, etc.) on the basis of which an industrial bioreactor, with various "stress" effect. It is believed that for the cultivation of the most optimal are bioreactors with mechanical stirring of the liquid, which allow the greatest productivity of biomass.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} is to analyze the operation of gas-lift bubble-type vehicle and clarify the nature of energy concentration areas of working liquid fluctuation motion under the impact of external acoustic radiation. The effect of cultural liquid indignation inside the vehicle?s working volume has an indisputable advantage. This effect can be achieved without <b>mechanical</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> and technological deficiencies arising out of their use. The construction of areas of energy concentration as confocal cylindrical caustic surfaces to the internal surface of bubble-type vehicle {{is caused by the}} present aberration of sound-waves, generated in the casing, {{as well as by the}} construction of the proper wave-size vehicle. In addition, the amount of energy concentration areas of working liquid motion can be increased under certain conditions at the expense of additional flat radial caustic surfaces. Totally, the dynamic state created eliminates the stagnant areas presence, dramatically increases the heat-mass exchange efficiency and the produce quality. Therefore, the coincidence resonance is the operating element of gas-lift bubble-type vehicle. ????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ????????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????. ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ????? ?? ????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ??? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ??????????? ???????????????? ????????. ?????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ???????? ???? ? ????????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??????? ????????. ??? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ????? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???, ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ????????. ????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????...|$|R

40|$|With the {{expanding}} interest in cellular responses to dynamic environments, microfluidic devices have become important experimental platforms for biological research. Microfluidic "microchemostat" devices enable precise environmental control while capturing high quality, single cell gene expression data. For studies of population heterogeneity and gene expression noise, these abilities are crucial. I {{have developed a}} microchemostat device optimized for capturing data from thousands of cells in multiple sub-experiments. The device is robust, {{easy to use and}} capable of generating precisely controlled dynamic environments. The device uses an integrated fluidic junction, coupled to linear actuators, to modulate the external port pressures as a function of time. In this way the concentration of an inducer compound can be tightly controlled without the use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>devices.</b> To analyze the large amounts of data generated, I have developed a method for automated cell tracking, focusing on the special problems presented by Saccharomyces cerveisiae cells. I have used these tools to probe the response of a natural genetic circuit, the Gal system of S. cerevisiae. I have altered the regulation of the native Gal system, replacing the transcriptional positive and negative feedback loops with artificial promoters. Looking at these modified strains, I have determined that induced negative feedback is essential for tuning the cell's genetic response to the external galactose concentration. Moreover, without induced negative feedback, the system exhibits bistability, with subpopulations of responding and non-responding cells.

40|$|The {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to analyze the}} effectiveness of devices for artificially destratifying lakes. A criterion for the effectiveness of mixing was selected. This criterion was applied {{to a number of}} variations of <b>mechanical</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> in an attempt to indicate trends in optimization of designs. Experiments were performed in a vertically exaggerated scale model of Ham's Lake. Destratification was accomplished by a jet of water from two different sizes of propellers in different configurations (shrouded, skirted, and free) miXing the top water with the bottom water. Data taken from the experiments included density profiles as a function of time. The data obtained were analyzed determining the progression of the stability index with time. Adequate simulation of the prototype destratification experi-ments of Steichen (10) was achieved with the present model. The appropriate non-dimensional parameters are the overall Richardson number J â€¢ g~pH/pU 2. and a characteristic time obtained from the volume of the lake divided by the volume flow rate of the pump. AnalyZing the effects of varying propeller size and geometrical con-straints on mixing efficiency revealed the following facts: Operation of a pump with a shrouded propeller resulted in a shorter destrati-fication time and higher destratification efficiency than an unshrouded propeller when both pumps had the same power consumption rates. For the pump system operating with an unshrouded propeller increasing propeller size resulted in increased destratification efficiency over the shaft input power range studies.

40|$|Swirling flows {{have been}} widely used for many years in {{engineering}} applications such as; chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>devices,</b> separation units, spray drying technologies, turbo machinery and combustion systems. In practical combustion applications, swirl motion has been adopted to the incoming reactant flows in order to enhance the mixing of fuel and oxidizer and to improve flame stabilization and establishment, especially in regions of relatively low velocities, by recirculating hot product gas to the incoming reactants. At critical operating conditions the recirculation zone exhibit high sensitivity to flow disturbances leading to hydrodynamic instabilities. During combustion, these instabilities can interact with flame structures by modulating the rate of heat release, equivalence ratio, flame surface etc. As a result of these interactions, combustion instabilities can form in the systems. At initial state, combustion instabilities can stay unnoticed due to their relatively small amplitudes, but the amplitudes of the instabilities can increase when they couple with acoustical characteristics of any particular system elements. As a result, combustion systems can suffer from high amplitude noise, vibrations, flame flashback, local flame quenching, and even severe damages in system structures. This thesis provides insights into the interaction of acoustic waves with a swirl stabilized wood powder flame and its effects on flame structures. A high speed photography technique has been applied to wood powder flame under external forcing of the secondary air flow pattern to record spontaneous emission of radiant energy from the flame. Simultaneously, dynamic pressure signals were acquired with a data acquisition board in order to relate pressure data with radiant energy which has been assumed to be representative of heat release. In order to investigate the influence of the interactions on combustion, the resulting data were complemented with gas sampling measurements. From digital still images taken without external forcing, the wood powder flame was observed to expand to occupy the entire combustion chamber. In addition, the flame shape and size appears to be unchanged under a wide range of forcing frequencies, with one exception at a particular low frequency for which a resonant behaviour was observed. The critical frequency was 17 Hz independent of amplitude of the forcing frequency and at this forcing frequency dramatic changes in flame size and shape was observed. Instantaneous and phase averaged images have revealed the presence of large scale vortical structures that closely interacted with the flame surface. A fast Fourier transform of the point wise optical signal also shows that the flame is susceptible to instabilities at the acoustical forcing of 17 Hz. The existence of thermo-acoustically induced combustion instability has been investigated by a Rayleigh criterion which states that the amplitude of a sound wave will be amplified when heat is added less than 90 degrees out of phase with its pressure. In this study, the heat release extracted from high speed images recorded at 17 Hz is approximately 40 degrees out of phase with the pressure data which confirms the thermo-acoustic nature of the instability. Finally, from gas sampling measurements it was concluded that the acoustic oscillations at 17 Hz have increased the NOx emission level to around twice the level without forcing.
