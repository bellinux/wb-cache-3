50|$|Didactic science {{films were}} not always {{successful}} in keeping bored students awake and alert, but EB fared better than much of the competition. Special praise goes to cinematographers such as the very prolific Isidore Mankofsky, who could insert many close-ups of menacing hands zooming at the screen and low-angle shots of vacationers among the geological close-ups of the typical The Beach: A River of Sand. Charles F. Finance (who carried on through the 1980s), Stanley Croner and Warren Brown were among those who contributed this and other popular favorites of the long running American Geological Institute series. 8mm loops covering chemistry and medical topics were another <b>market</b> <b>tapped</b> into at this time for the serious science student to study subjects in more detail.|$|E

50|$|Integration of {{suppliers}} {{into the}} new product development process was shown {{to have a major}} impact on product target cost, quality, delivery, and <b>market</b> share. <b>Tapping</b> into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing, but also involves managing intellectual property issues.|$|R
50|$|The global {{sourcing}} {{of goods}} and services has advantages and disadvantages that can go beyond low cost. Some advantages of global sourcing, beyond low cost, include: learning how to do business in a potential <b>market,</b> <b>tapping</b> into skills or resources unavailable domestically, developing alternate supplier/vendor sources to stimulate competition, and increasing total supply capacity. Some key disadvantages of global sourcing can include: hidden costs associated with different cultures and time zones, exposure to financial and political risks in countries with (often) emerging economies, increased risk of the loss of intellectual property, and increased monitoring costs relative to domestic supply. For manufactured goods, some key disadvantages include long lead times, the risk of port shutdowns interrupting supply, and the difficulty of monitoring product quality. (With regard to quality in the food industry, see Roth et al. (2008).).|$|R
25|$|By 1965 AMT {{and other}} kit {{manufacturers}} had made significant changes to their product lines. Although dealer-oriented promotionals were their lead business, by the mid-1960s most manufacturers developed {{a whole new}} <b>market</b> by <b>tapping</b> into customizing and customizers.

50|$|Thus AMT {{and other}} kit makers had made serious {{changes in their}} product {{approach}} by, say, 1965. Whereas the dealer oriented promotionals were previously the lead business - by the mid-1960s a whole new <b>market</b> was <b>tapped</b> involving customizing and customizers.

50|$|An amortizing {{term loan}} (A-term loan or TLA) {{is a term}} loan with a {{progressive}} repayment schedule that typically runs six years or less. These loans are normally syndicated to banks along with revolving credits {{as part of a}} larger syndication. In the U.S., A-term loans have become increasingly rare over the years as issuers bypassed the bank <b>market</b> and <b>tapped</b> institutional investors for all or most of their funded loans.|$|R
40|$|The global {{location}} of R 2 ̆ 6 D labs by MNCs {{is a rather}} new phenomenon; {{especially when it comes}} to establishing R 2 ̆ 6 D labs in developing countries. The existing and rather limited literature on globalisation of innovation provides four possible explanations of why multinationals locate R 2 ̆ 6 D labs in developing countries: reduce research costs, access large <b>markets,</b> <b>tap</b> into a large pool of qualified human resources or benefit from knowledge spillovers available in the local/regional system of innovation. The empirical research presented in this paper reveals that none of these arguments can fully explain the increasing {{location of}} R 2 ̆ 6 D labs in China. The in-depth study of MNCs R 2 ̆ 6 D labs in Beijing and Shanghai, China, reveals that specific aspects of market, technological and political uncertainty provide a more adequate explanation to the increasing presence of R 2 ̆ 6 D labs from MNCs in developing countries such as China and thus calls for an integration in the regional innovation systems framework...|$|R

40|$|Draught beer quality can be {{compromised}} by {{the growth of}} spoilage microorganisms. Whilst best practice for assuring dispense hygiene is broadly recognized, {{it is not always}} fully or regularly implemented. In some <b>markets,</b> <b>tap</b> nozzles are removed and stored overnight at room temperature in carbonated (soda) water. The next morning they are returned (sometimes after rinsing) to the dispense tap. The effectiveness of this approach is compared with soaking in diluted line-cleaning solution (UK best practice) or a solution containing hypochlorous acid (commercial sanitizing tablets). Two novel approaches – ozonated water and use of ultrasonics – were also evaluated. Bioluminescence analysis of microbial attachment to the inner surfaces of nozzles showed that soaking in carbonated water resulted in gross contamination. Sanitizing tablets achieved ‘commercial sterility’ and a 4 -log reduction in bioluminescence compared with carbonated water. The efficacy of hypochlorous acid was confirmed by incubating cleaned nozzles in fresh beer without any increase in turbidity. Diluted line-cleaning solution was less effective and achieved a 2 -log reduction. Ultrasonics reduced microbial attachment but effectiveness was aligned to increasing process time. Soaking in ozonated water was without antimicrobial impact. This work has shown carbonated water to be ineffective in cleaning microbiologically contaminated nozzles. This is a concern as these microorganisms derive from the dispense line, the environment and likely human interaction. To minimize the risks of transfer to dispensed product or back-contaminating the dispense line, soaking draught beer nozzles in an effective sanitizing solution is strongly recommended...|$|R

50|$|The {{securitization}} <b>markets</b> frequently <b>tapped</b> by {{the shadow}} banking system started to close down {{in the spring of}} 2007, with the first failure of auction-rate offerings to attract bids. As excesses associated with the U.S. housing bubble became widely understood and borrower default rates rose, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) deflated. Tranched collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) lost value as default rates increased beyond the levels projected by their associated agency credit ratings. Commercial mortgage-backed securities suffered from association and from a general decline in economic activity, and the entire complex nearly shut down in the fall of 2008. More {{than a third of the}} private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds. In February 2009, Ben Bernanke stated that securitization markets remained effectively shut, with the exception of conforming mortgages, which could be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.|$|R
