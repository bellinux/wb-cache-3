Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) would be similar to the BTC in terms of culture and <b>manageability.</b> Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objection}} of the Admiralty {{to providing}} escorts for merchant shipping (as opposed to troop transits) {{was that it}} did not have sufficient forces. In large part, this was based on miscalculation. The Admiralty's {{estimates of the number of}} vessels requiring escort and the number of escorts required per convoy—it mistakenly assumed a 1:1 ratio between escorts and merchant vessels—were both wrong. The former error was exposed by Commander R. G. H. Henderson of the Antisubmarine Division and Norman Leslie of the Ministry of Shipping, who showed that the Admiralty was relying on customs statistics that counted each arrival and departure, concluding that 2,400 vessels a week, translating into 300 ships a day, required an escort. In fact, there were only 140 ships per week, or 20 per day, on transoceanic voyages. But the <b>manageability</b> of the task was not the Admiralty′s only objection.|$|E

[...] However, {{in addition to a}} shampoo bath, many grooms of long-maned horses also use a conditioner or cream rinse on the mane to improve shine and <b>manageability,</b> though for horses with braided manes, the mane may be left alone or have gels that increase stiffness and body added instead.|$|E
2500|$|Tectus niloticus is {{a highly}} sought after {{resource}} in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions. This {{has resulted in the}} species being over-harvested. By 2007 the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have the most depleted stocks, with four surveyed sites in the Solomon Islands in 2006 averaging a density of only 11 trochus ha^-1. Releasing hatchery-reared juveniles is an option to replenish reduced wild stocks. Methods of culture are still under assessment and development where experiments have been conducted in Vanuatu;, [...] Australia, Indonesia [...] and Vietnam. [...] Cage-based cultures have proven effective because they allow control of food and predators, both of which contribute greatly to the growth and survival of juveniles;. Other benefits of sea cages include lower cost, easy to construct and transport, <b>manageability</b> and the advantage of using existing water bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphase: The {{metaphase}} {{structure of}} chromatin differs vastly {{to that of}} interphase. It is optimised for physical strength and <b>manageability,</b> forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes. The structure of the condensed chromatin {{is thought to be}} loops of 30nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised.The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues.It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromatosis. The lack of compaction of these regions is called bookmarking, which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the [...] "memory" [...] of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This bookmarking mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis.|$|E
