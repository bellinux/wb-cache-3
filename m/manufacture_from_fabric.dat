50|$|Women in Eastern cultures, however, have {{maintained}} {{a much greater}} sense of modesty {{when it comes to}} maternity wear. In both the Islamic and Asian cultures, maternity wear is much less fitted, hemlines are longer and necklines higher. Modern Islamic maternity wear uses fabrics with brighter colours and bolder prints. Aside from cultural modesty, Chinese women have sometimes sought to hide their second pregnancy in less shapely clothes because Chinese policy has dictated that they can only have one child. In Chinese and Japanese cultures, there is a fear of radiation from devices such as computers and mobile phones, especially during pregnancy. Even though {{there is no evidence to}} support this (according to WHO), Asian maternity wear is often <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> “anti-radiation” <b>fabrics.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{wearable}} probe-fed {{microstrip antenna}} <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> conductive textile <b>fabric</b> designed for multiple Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) band communications {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed antenna operating at 2. 450 GHz, 4. 725 Hz and 5. 800 GHz consists of a patch and ground plane made of silver fabric mounted on a substrate of flexible low-permittivity foam. For verification, a reference prototype is <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> copper. The measurement of both antennas demonstrates the expected resonances, with some unexpected loss especially in the higher frequency range. Simulation results for the antenna in various bending condition indicate the robustness of the design with deviations of resonant frequencies in an acceptable range.

40|$|In {{this study}} the thermoelastic signal from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) {{laminates}} is investigated. A {{comparison between the}} theoretical and experimental values of the thermoelastic signal is reported, with the theoretical predictions obtained from two different quantitative models. These models {{are based on the}} classic thermoelastic effect law extended to the case of orthotropic materials (by using the mesomechanical or bulk approach), and the modified law assuming that the surface resin-rich layer behaves as a strain witness of the laminate. It is found that the theoretical predictions of the two models can be strongly and differently influenced by the intrinsic orthotropy of carbon fibres. Some effects are highlighted in particular such as the influence of the laminate lay-up and the strong mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the polymer matrix and the fibres. These influences are investigated analytically, predicting the thermoelastic signal from various lay-ups and using strain-based and stress-based analytical models. Experimental evidence of some theoretical findings is provided by reporting on tests performed on CFRP tensile samples <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> low-crimp unidirectional <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} have become viable alternatives to traditional engineering materials for many different product categories. Liquid transfer moulding (LTM) processes, specifically resin transfer moulding (RTM), is a cost-effective manufacturing technique for creating {{high performance composite}} parts. These parts can be tailor-made to their specific application by optimizing {{the properties of the}} textile preform. Preforms which require little or no further assembly work and are close to the shape of the final part are critical to obtaining high quality parts while simultaneously reducing labour and costs associated with other composite manufacturing techniques. One type of fabric which is well suited for near-net- shape preforms is stitched non-crimp fabrics. These fabrics offer very high in-plane strength and stiffness while also having increased resistance to delamination. Manufacturing parts from these dry preforms typically involves long-scale fluid flow through both open channels and porous fibre bundles. This thesis documents and analyzes the flow of fluid through preforms <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> non-crimp <b>fabrics</b> featuring through-thickness stitches. The objective of this research is to determine the effect of this type of stitch on the RTM injection process. All of the tests used preforms with fibre volume fractions representative of primary and secondary structural parts. A series of trials was conducted using different fibre materials, flow rates, fibre volumes fractions, and degrees of fibre consolidation. All of the trials were conducted for cases similar to RTM. Consolidation of the fibres showed improvements to both the thoroughness of the filling and to the fibre volume fraction. Experimentally determined permeability data was shown to trend well with simple models and precision of the permeability data was comparable to values presented by other authors who studied fabrics which did not feature the through-thickness stitches...|$|R

40|$|Damage {{accumulation}} {{in glass}} fibre woven reinforced epoxy laminates <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> two different <b>fabrics</b> {{have been investigated}} under three different loading conditions. One of the woven fabrics was non-hybrid glass using E-glass fibre yams in both warp and weft (fill) directions, the second fabric was a hybrid woven fabric using E-glass fibre yams in the warp direction and R-glass fibre yams in the weft direction. Destructive tests such as interlaminar shear, flexural and uniaxial tension tests were carried out on two different categories. In the first category four different fibre volume fractions of nonhybrid E-glass woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates have been investigated. In the second category hybrid and non-hybrid woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates for similar fibre volume fractions have been investigated. Acoustic Emission (AE) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were employed as nondestructive tools to predict and characterise the damage events in the composites. All laminates were fabricated using the wet hand lay-up process to laminate the fabric layers prior to curing. Epoxy resin (L 20 -SL set) was the sole matrix used for all composites. Test results showed higher mechanical performance for the hybrid composites and improvements in mechanical properties for higher fibre volume fraction in the non-hybrid composites. DMTA tests were carried out on the laminates of the categories mentioned above, the test results indicated the effect of fibre surface treatment concentration {{on the performance of}} mechanical properties of woven composites. DMTA data has been used to correlate the results of ILSS, flexural and tensile tests. A model was developed in this study based on the damage event sequential process of glass woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin composites. The model is an experimental analysis model, supported by DMTA, AE, SEM and visual examination of specimen fracture surface. ...|$|R
40|$|Two Disk-Gap-Band model {{parachute}} {{designs were}} tested in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The purposes of these tests were to determine the drag and static stability coefficients of these two model parachutes at various subsonic Mach numbers {{in support of the}} Mars Exploration Rover mission. The two model parachute designs were designated 1. 6 Viking and MPF. These model parachute designs were chosen to investigate the tradeoff between drag and static stability. Each of the parachute designs was tested with models fabricated from MIL-C- 7020 Type III or F- 111 fabric. The reason for testing model parachutes fabricated with different fabrics was to evaluate the effect of fabric permeability on the drag and static stability coefficients. Several improvements over the Viking-era wind tunnel tests were implemented in the testing procedures and data analyses. Among these improvements were corrections for test fixture drag interference and blockage effects, and use of an improved test fixture for measuring static stability coefficients. The 1. 6 Viking model parachutes had drag coefficients from 0. 440 to 0. 539, while the MPF model parachutes had drag coefficients from 0. 363 to 0. 428. The 1. 6 Viking model parachutes had drag coefficients 18 to 22 percent higher than the MPF model parachute for equivalent fabric materials and test conditions. Model parachutes of the same design tested at the same conditions had drag coefficients approximately 11 to 15 percent higher when <b>manufactured</b> <b>from</b> F- 111 <b>fabric</b> as compared to those fabricated from MIL-C- 7020 Type III fabric. The lower fabric permeability of the F- 111 fabric was the source of this difference.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} process of human {{psychological}} perceptions of clothing- related sensations and comfort to develop an intellectual understanding of and method ology for predicting clothing comfort performance <b>from</b> <b>fabric</b> physical properties. Var ious hybrid models are developed using different modeling techniques by studying human sensory perception and judgement processes. By combining the strengths of statistics (data reduction and information summation), a neural network (self-learning ability), and fuzzy logic (fuzzy reasoning ability), hybrid models are developed to simulate different stages of the perception process. Results show that the TS-TS-NN-FL model has the highest ability to predict overall comfort performance <b>from</b> <b>fabric</b> physical properties. To summarize, the three key elements in predicting psychological perceptions of clothing comfort <b>from</b> <b>fabric</b> physical properties are data reduction and summation, self-learning, and fuzzy reasoning.
