40|$|SummaryObjectiveDetermine how stepoff incongruities of {{the distal}} tibia affect {{aggregate}} (whole-cycle) contact stresses and contact stress gradients {{for a complete}} <b>motion</b> <b>cycle</b> in human cadaveric ankles. MethodTen human cadaveric ankles were subjected to quasiphysiologic forces during stance-phase range of motion. Each specimen was loaded intact, with anatomic reduction of the anterolateral quarter of the distal tibia, and with increasing stepoffs of the anterolateral fragment up to 4. 0 mm. Transient contact stresses were measured using a custom-built, real-time stress transducer that sampled stresses at 132 Hz at 1472 separate foci (sensels). Aggregate stresses were calculated by summing the sequential transient stress values multiplied by the transient sampling duration for the complete <b>motion</b> <b>cycle</b> at each sensel. Transient contact stress gradients were calculated at each sensel using a central-differencing formula applied to adjacent transient stress measurements. Aggregate contact stress gradients were calculated by vector summation of sequential transient stress gradients multiplied by the sampling duration. ResultsCompared to the intact configuration, anatomic reduction of the fragment caused minimal changes in aggregate contact stresses and stress gradients (30 % increase compared to intact values). In contrast, stepoffs caused substantial increases (200 % increase compared to intact values) in peak and mean whole-cycle stresses and gradients. ConclusionsAggregate contact stresses and stress gradients quantify loading history for the complete <b>motion</b> <b>cycle.</b> Incongruity-associated changes in aggregate stresses and gradients are a surrogate for “accumulated” damage over a <b>motion</b> <b>cycle</b> in stepoff specimens. These loading abnormalities may be important determinants of posttraumatic arthritis...|$|E

Our study aimed to establish a novel ex vivo CPM animal model and to evaluate the required <b>motion</b> <b>cycles</b> for testing the mechanical properties of a new cell-free collagen type I gel plug (CaReS ® - 1 S). Methods A novel ex vivo CPM device was developed. Full-thickness cartilage defects (11 mm diameter by 6 mm deep) were created on the medial femoral condyle of porcine knee specimens. CaReS ® - 1 S was implanted in 16 animals and each knee underwent continuous passive motion. After 0, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 motions, standardized digital pictures of the grafts were taken, focusing on the worn surfaces. The percentage of worn surface on the total CaReS ® - 1 S surface was evaluated with image processing software.

40|$|Purpose: Typically spatial {{modulation}} of the magnetization (SPAMM) tagged {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) requires many repeated <b>motion</b> <b>cycles</b> limiting the applicability to highly repeatable tissue motions only. This paper describes the validation of a novel SPAMM tagged MRI and post-processing framework for the measurement of complex and dynamic 3 D soft tissue deformation following just three <b>motion</b> <b>cycles.</b> Techniques are applied to indentation induced deformation measurement of the upper arm and a silicone gel phantom. Methods: A SPAMM tagged MRI methodology is presented allowing continuous (3. 3 - 3. 6 Hz) sampling of 3 D dynamic soft tissue deformation using non segmented 3 D acquisitions. The 3 D deformation is reconstructed by the combination of three mutually orthogonal tagging directions, thus requiring only three repeated <b>motion</b> <b>cycles.</b> In addition a fully automatic post-processing framework is presented employing Gabor scale-space and filter-bank analysis for tag extrema segmentation and triangulated surface fitting aided by Gabor filter bank derived surface normals. Deformation is derived following tracking of tag surface triplet triangle intersections. The dynamic deformation measurements were validated using indentation tests (similar to 20 mm deep at 12 mm/s) on a silicone gel soft tissue phantom containing contrasting markers which provide a reference measure of deformation. In addition, the techniques were evaluated in vivo for dynamic skeletal muscle tissue deformation measurement during indentation of the biceps region of the upper arm in a volunteer. Results: For the phantom and volunteer tag point location precision were 44 and 92 mu m, respectively resulting in individual displacements precisions of 61 and 91 mu m, respectively. For both the phantom and volunteer data cumulative displacement measurement accuracy could be evaluated {{and the difference between}} initial and final locations showed a mean and standard deviation of 0. 44 and 0. 59 mm for the phantom and 0. 40 and 0. 73 mm for the human data. Finally accuracy of (cumulative) displacement was evaluated using marker tracking in the silicone gel phantom. Differences between true and predicted marker locations showed a mean of 0. 35 mm and a standard deviation of 0. 63 mm. Conclusions: A novel SPAMM tagged MRI and fully automatic post-processing framework for the measurement of complex 3 D dynamic soft tissue deformation following just three repeated <b>motion</b> <b>cycles</b> was presented. The techniques demonstrate dynamic measurement of complex 3 D soft tissue deformation at subvoxel accuracy and precision and were validated for 3. 3 - 3. 6 Hz sampling of deformation speeds up to 12 mm/s.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the motions of the thoracolumbar spine affected by osteoporotic vertebral fracture at level T 12 and compare the results with those of non-fracture osteoporosis subjects. We examined the continuous segmental kinematics of the vertebrae, and describe the segmental motion of the spine when a fracture at T 12 is present. Fluoroscopy sequences of the thoracolumbar spines during sagittal and lateral flexion were collected from 16 subjects with osteoporosis of their spine (6 with vertebral fractures at T 12, 10 without a fracture). Vertebrae T 10 -L 2 in each frame of the sequences were landmarked. Kinematic parameters were calculated based on the landmarks and motion graphs were constructed. Compared to the control subjects who did not have a fracture, fracture subjects had a more asymmetric lateral range of motion (RoM) and required a longer time to complete certain phases of the <b>motion</b> <b>cycle</b> which are parameterized as lateral flexion ratio and percentage of <b>motion</b> <b>cycle,</b> respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) rupture {{is a common}} lesion. Current treatment emphasizes arthroscopic ACL reconstruction via a graft, although this approach is associated with potential drawbacks. A new method of dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) was subjected to biomechanical analysis {{to determine whether it}} provides the necessary knee stability for optimal ACL healing. METHODS Six human knees from cadavers were harvested. The patellar tendon, joint capsule and all muscular attachments to the tibia and femur were removed, leaving the collateral and the {{cruciate ligament}}s intact. The knees were stabilized and the ACL kinematics analyzed. Anterior-posterior (AP) stability measurements evaluated the knees in the following conditions: (i) intact ACL, (ii) ACL rupture, (iii) ACL rupture with primary stabilization, (iv) primary stabilization after 50 <b>motion</b> <b>cycles,</b> (v) ACL rupture with DIS, and (vi) DIS after 50 <b>motion</b> <b>cycles.</b> RESULTS After primary suture stabilization, average AP laxity was 3. 2 mm, which increased to an average of 11. 26 mm after 50 movement cycles. With primary ACL stabilization using DIS, however, average laxity values were consistently lower than those of the intact ligament, increasing from an initial AP laxity of 3. 00 mm to just 3. 2 mm after 50 movement cycles. CONCLUSIONS Dynamic intraligamentary stabilization established and maintained close contact between the two ends of the ruptured ACL, thus ensuring optimal conditions for potential healing after primary reconstruction.

In fact, several such structures have successfully survived destructive earthquakes (Northridge 1994, Kobe 1995, Kocaeli 1999, and Chi-Chi 1999). This paper investigates experimentally and theoretically the seismic performance of a typical bar-mat retaining wall. First, a series of reduced- scale shaking table tests are conducted, using a variety of seismic excitations (real records and artificial multi-cycle motions). Then, the problem is analyzed numerically employing the finite element method. A modified kinematic hardening constitutive model is developed and encoded in ABAQUS through a user-defined subroutine. After calibrating the model parameters through laboratory element testing, the retaining walls are analyzed at model scale, assuming model parameters appropriate for very small confining pressures. After validating the numerical analysis through comparisons with shaking table test results, the problem is re-analyzed at prototype scale assuming model parameters for standard confining pressures. The results of shaking table testing are thus indirectly ‘‘converted’’(extrapolated) to real scale. It is shown that: (a) for medium intensity motions (typical of Ms ≈ 6 earthquakes) the response is ‘‘quasi-elastic’’, and the permanent lateral displacement in reality could not exceed a few centimeters; (b) for larger intensity motions (typical of Ms ≈ 6. 5 – 7 earthquakes) bearing the effects of forward rupture directivity or having a large number of strong <b>motion</b> <b>cycles,</b> plastic deformation accumulates and the permanent displacement is of the order of 10 – 15 cm (at prototype scale); and (c) a large number of strong <b>motion</b> <b>cycles</b> (N> 30) of un realistically large amplitude (A ≈ 1. 0 g) is required to activate a failure wedge behind the region of reinforced soil.
