25|$|For example, the viceroy {{butterfly}} appears {{very similar}} to the noxious-tasting monarch butterfly. Although for a long time thought to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy has recently been discovered to be just as unpalatable as the monarch, <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> case of Müllerian mimicry. Poison dart frogs of South America and mantella frogs of Madagascar are examples of Müllerian mimicry with their conspicuous warning coloration (bright colours against black markings) and toxic composition.|$|E

25|$|The {{sputtering}} rate {{of tungsten}} by the plasma fuel ions is {{orders of magnitude}} smaller than that of carbon, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten, <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> more attractive choice. On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, {{so it will be}} necessary to ensure that the plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.|$|E
25|$|TRAP {{transporters}} {{were discovered}} in the laboratory of Prof. David J. Kelly at the University of Sheffield, UK. His group {{were working on the}} mechanism used by the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus to take up certain dicarboxylic acids. They characterised a binding protein component (DctP) of a transporter that recognized these compounds, which they assumed would form part of a typical ABC transporter, but when they sequenced the genes surrounding dctP they found two other genes encoding integral membrane proteins, dctQ and dctM, but no genes encoding components of an ABC transporter. They further showed that uptake of the same dicarboxylates was independent of ATP and that uptake required an electrochemical ion gradient, <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> unique binding protein-dependent secondary transporter.|$|E

25|$|Cyprus did {{not have}} any country-wide league until 1932. Football clubs of the time played {{friendly}} matches only. In 1932, Pezoporikos Larnaca organised an unofficial league, the first island-wide league, and it was won by APOEL after defeating AEL Limassol in the final by 4–0. In 1934, there was a disagreement between Trust and Anorthosis Famagusta on the organisation of the fourth unofficial league. APOEL and AEL Limassol organised a meeting for the foundation of a country-wide governing body and an official country-wide league. The meeting took place in APOEL's clubhouse on 23 September and the establishment of the Cyprus Football Association was agreed. Two years later the APOEL football team celebrated its first championship title of the official Cyprus football league. APOEL also won the championship for the following four years, <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> very successful period for the club with 5 consecutive championships (1936–1940).|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why <b>making</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
