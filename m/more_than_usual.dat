5|$|Running back Michael Bush was {{predicted}} {{to return to}} form after suffering a foot injury that {{kept him out of}} two games in November. Bush ran for 121yards and three touchdowns against Connecticut, his first game back from the injury. Heading into the Gator Bowl, Bush earned a school-record 24touchdowns and led the country in scoring. He ran for 1,049yards in nine games. He was also a capable receiver, catching 20passes for 245yards and a touchdown. But with Brohm on the sidelines, it was expected the Cardinals would rely on Bush's legs <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual,</b> in an effort to minimize the need for the inexperienced Cantwell to pass the ball.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had only}} scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests, Harvey was {{retained}} for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week {{leading up to the}} match had delayed the start, and Yardley’s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise, as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions. This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day, with Lindwall (6/20) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Australia had already passed England by the close of play, reaching 2/153. The next day, Harvey came to the crease at 4/243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Jack Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another. Harvey then succumbed to Eric Hollies for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual,</b> and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal the series 4–0.|$|E

25|$|The highest-rated game {{according}} to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1 {{percent of households}} (73 share), or 40,020,000 households at the time.

25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will even let a human hand approach their web. Like any other spider, however, {{they are afraid of}} bigger foes, and, in most cases, will retreat behind an obstacle (such as a dried leaf or prey remains) upon perceiving <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> disturbance to their web. Further disturbance may lead to the spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E
25|$|Frederick, {{the son of}} Frederick William I and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, {{was born}} in Berlin on 24 January 1712. The birth of Frederick was welcomed by his grandfather, Frederick I, with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> pleasure, as his two {{previous}} grandsons had both died in infancy. With {{the death of his}} father in 1713, Frederick William became King in Prussia, thus making young Frederick the crown prince. The new king wished for his sons and daughters to be educated not as royalty, but as simple folk. He had been educated by a Frenchwoman, Madame de Montbail, who later became Madame de Rocoulle, and he wished that she educate his children.|$|E

Orr also wrongly accused Blackwell of being only a captain when, in fact, he was a colonel, and as the documents show, so styled himself.|$|E

25|$|The wildcat {{does not}} dig its own burrows, instead {{sheltering}} in the hollows of old or fallen trees, rock fissures, and the abandoned nests or earths {{of other animals}} (heron nests, and abandoned fox or badger earths in Europe, and abandoned fennec dens in Africa). When threatened, a wildcat with a den will retreat into it, rather than climb trees. When taking residence in a tree hollow, the wildcat selects one low to the ground. Dens in rocks or burrows are lined with dry grasses and bird feathers. Dens in tree hollows usually contain enough sawdust to make lining unnecessary. During flea infestations, the wildcat leaves its den in favour of another. During winter, when snowfall prevents the wildcat from travelling long distances, it remains within its den <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dan Fouts {{had to pass}} even <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual,</b> {{with running}} back Chuck Muncie, the league's leading scorer, {{forced out of the}} game after only three carries. Fouts {{completed}} 33 of 49 passes for 351 yards and a touchdown against the Buccaneers' league-leading secondary. His only touchdown was a 27-yarder to Eric Sievers, the longest touchdown pass against the Buccaneers all season. He was intercepted twice. The Chargers also scored on runs of 8-yards by John Cappelletti and 1-yard by James Brooks, while the Buccaneers scored on a 58-yard reception by Theo Bell and a Bill Capece field goal. Brooks' touchdown was set up by a James Owens fumble, the Buccaneers' first fumble on a running play all season. With the Buccaneers down 21–10 in the fourth quarter, James Wilder scored on runs of 8 and 23 yards in the span of 27 seconds. Dave Lewis forced a Cappelletti fumble that gave the Buccaneers an opportunity to score again, but a hit by Glen Edwards caused Jimmie Giles to lose control of a reception, resulting in a Woody Lowe interception that led to Rolf Benirschke's game-winning field goal. Edwards also intercepted a last-minute pass by Doug Williams. Capece was criticized harshly when, despite having earlier kicked a 49-yard field goal, he missed an extra point attempt that provided the margin of victory for the Chargers. Williams completed 22 of 35 passes for 321 yards, raising his season completion percentage above 50% {{for the first time in}} his career. Fouts' touchdown gave him a league-leading total of 32 on the season. The Chargers had been facing elimination from the playoff race with a loss, but instead found themselves with the opportunity to win the AFC West. Their win also denied the New York Jets a playoff spot.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{first major}} work to appear {{after the war}} was Heartbreak House, written in 1916–17 and {{performed}} in 1920. It was produced on Broadway in November, and was coolly received; according to The Times: [...] "Mr Shaw on this occasion has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> to say and takes {{twice as long as}} usual to say it". After the London premiere in October 1921 The Times concurred with the American critics: [...] "As usual with Mr Shaw, the play is about an hour too long", although containing [...] "much entertainment and some profitable reflection". Ervine in The Observer thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted, except for Edith Evans as Lady Utterword.|$|E

500|$|Gillom {{grew up in}} Massillon, Ohio and {{attended}} Massillon Washington High School. He was a star end on the Massillon football team like his older brother Odell, but was also a linebacker and punter. Bud Houghton, who coached {{him when he was}} in junior high school, said Gillom needed a step and a half <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> to get his punts off, but he was the best he had ever seen once he made the kick. Houghton moved Gillom 15 yards behind the snapper instead of the usual 10, which gave him the room he needed. Gillom was a favorite of Massillon High football coach Paul Brown, who said in his autobiography that there [...] "has never been a better punter than Horace." ...|$|E

A scholarly man, an entertaining writer, an impartial observer of the game." [...] Biographer Scott Longert wrote that [...] "the writer was becoming as well-known as the ballplayer." [...] An editorial in the Toledo Blade said, [...] "In taking his vocation seriously, [...] was, in return, taken seriously by the people, who recognized in him a man of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> intelligence and one who would have adorned any profession in which he had elected to engage." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1951, pranks soon {{returned}} to the two campuses.

Early in the 1951 game, Navy's Frank Brady returned a punt 100 yards to take the lead, 7–0. It was the only time of Maryland's undefeated season that they trailed an opponent. The Terrapins responded, {{and by the end of}} the third quarter, they had taken the game in hand, 34–7. Against the stubborn Navy line, Scarbath resorted to the pass <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>usual,</b> and completed 16 of 34 for 285 yards. Despite a late Midshipmen surge, Maryland held on for the win, 40–21.|$|E
