To be an older director was a very positive thing. It <b>meant</b> <b>you</b> had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore: Goldfinger's {{personal}} {{pilot and}} leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Blackman was selected {{for the role of}} Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to [...] "Kitty Galore", but they and Hamilton decided [...] "if you were a ten-year old boy and knew what the name <b>meant,</b> <b>you</b> weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a dirty little bitch. The American censor was concerned, but we got round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [...] we were big supporters of the Republican Party." [...] During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name [...] "Pussy Galore" [...] to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called [...] "Miss Galore" [...] or [...] "Goldfinger's personal pilot".|$|E
500|$|The Ice Warriors were a {{well-known}} villain {{of the original}} Doctor Who series. They appeared alongside the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Ice Warriors (1967) and The Seeds of Death (1969) and returned in the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) stories The Curse of Peladon (1972) and The Monster of Peladon (1974). Showrunner Steven Moffat had originally been hesitant {{to bring back the}} Ice Warriors, worrying that they were seen as [...] "the default condition for what people thought of as rubbish Doctor Who monsters— things that moved very, very slowly and spoke in a way that <b>meant</b> <b>you</b> couldn't hear a word they said." [...] Writer Mark Gatiss, however, was a fan of the Ice Warriors' stories and had been campaigning to bring them back. In a phone conversation with Moffat that was originally supposed to be about their show Sherlock, Gatiss pitched new and [...] "very clever ideas" [...] {{of what to do with}} the Ice Warriors, and Moffat agreed. What sold Moffat were the submarine setting and seeing what the Ice Warriors looked like underneath their suits. Gatiss felt that the Ice Warriors had a lot of gaps in their timeline and had not been featured in a while, which allowed a lot of room to explore them.|$|E

500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt <b>meant</b> <b>you</b> held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E
500|$|Dubbed an [...] "iconoclast" [...] by Boxoffice, Belle {{continues}} to garner media recognition {{for her role}} in Beauty and the Beast. Established as a cultural icon, the character maintains the distinction of being Disney's first feminist princess. Commentators believe that the character's role in Beauty and the Beast as one of Disney's first strong female characters is responsible for changing the way in which women would be depicted in subsequent animated films. According to Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast, [...] "being a Disney princess meant singing songs about how much you love combing your hair with a fork and giving away your voice if it <b>meant</b> <b>you</b> got to marry the guy with that dreamy chiseled jaw" [...] prior to Belle's arrival. The Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon ranked Belle among the four Disney Princesses responsible for breaking [...] "the bonds of convention." [...] About.com's David Nusair agreed that Belle successfully [...] "updated the princess formula for an entirely new generation." [...] The Atlantics Lindsay Lowe echoed Nusair's sentiment, citing Belle as the character responsible for ending Disney's [...] "history of ... docile heroines." [...] The Daily Campus Cathy Schmidt recognized Belle and Ariel as [...] "the beginnings of the more modern Disney princesses." [...] Writing for Virgin Media, Limara Salt believes that the character [...] "proved that audiences could {{fall in love with a}} brown-haired intellectual." [...] A survey conducted by Disney after the film's release determined that Belle's love of books inspired young women to read. Justin Humphreys of The Hook expressed, [...] "Belle remains a most successful princess because people can relate" [...] to her. Elina Bolokhova of Parenting believes that Belle's [...] "bravery and independence helped redefine the meaning of a Disney princess." [...] According to Justine McGrath of Teen Vogue, Belle has [...] "become one of the most popular classic Disney princesses of all time." [...] Commending her intelligence and lack of vanity, the character was placed at number one on E!'s ranking of the Disney Princesses, while Cosmopolitan ranked her fourth. In the magazine's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses", Seventeen ranked Belle fifth. Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked the character fifth, praising her love of reading. A reader poll conducted by BuzzFeed also determined that Belle is the most popular Disney Princess, having garnered 18% of votes. Belle is the fifth most successful Disney Princess in terms of box office revenue, with Beauty and the Beast having grossed over $350 million. However, Belle was the lowest-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2013, with sales of less than $7,000 despite the fact that she is often cited as a customer favorite.|$|E

While waiting backstage to go on, Jimmy finds himself in another argument with Lorrell as {{to the nature of}} their relationship and when, or if, Jimmy will tell his wife about their affair ("Ain't No Party"). Lorrell is in tears as Jimmy takes to the stage to perform, and turns to Deena for support. As Jimmy pleads to Lorrell through his music ("I <b>Meant</b> <b>You</b> No Harm"), Deena tries to help Lorrell successfully resolve her situation, and Michelle convinces the artistically frustrated C.C. to go find his sister and reconcile with her ("Quintette"). Midway through [...] "I <b>Meant</b> <b>You</b> No Harm", Jimmy falls apart and decides that he [...] "can't sing any more sad songs." [...] Desperate to keep his set going, Jimmy launches into a wild, improvised funk number ("The Rap"), dropping his pants during the performance.
