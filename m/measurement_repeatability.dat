40|$|Abstract—A {{method of}} {{improving}} coating thickness <b>measurement</b> <b>repeatability</b> {{of the ball}} crater method is proposed. The improvement is realized by using image processing techniques to measure the radii of crater circles from a microscope image. While traditional methods use {{a limited number of}} operator-selected points on a circle edge to calculate the radius value, the new method measures the radius by fitting a circle to all edge points of a crater circle edge, which is automatically extracted from the microscope image of the crater by image processing techniques. This eliminates the randomness introduced by human operators in the traditional methods and improves the <b>measurement</b> <b>repeatability.</b> Experimental results confirm the feasibility of our method and its potential in improving the <b>measurement</b> <b>repeatability</b> and increasing measurement accuracy of the ball crater method. Traditional methods of measuring the radii of the circles are subjective as they involve the use of human operators. For example, one method (two point method) is to move the sample stage by a micrometer drive in a direction normal to a line on the microscope eyepiece reticles and record the readings of the micrometer at two positions, where the line becomes the tangent of the circle [2]. The subtraction of the two readings provides the diameter of the circle. These two positions are defined by the operator. The other method (three point method) is to calculate the radius by using the coordinates of three points on the circle [2]. In the latter method, the locations of the three points are chosen by the operator.
