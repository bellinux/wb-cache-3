40|$|An {{analytic}} {{model for the}} token bus protocol with the consideration of <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> has been proposed in this dissertation. Analysis of the performance {{is done in the}} aspects of average message delay and normalized throughput or channel utilization;The problem of analyzing a working token bus system, which often requires maintenance of logical ring, became a new topic in local area network field. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> of token bus protocol have been overlooked in most performance analyses. They need to be defined clearly and quantified properly to be considered in the performance analysis;This problem of <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> is investigated indirectly in this dissertation. First, an {{analytic model}} for normal operational mode is developed. This model is an unique one {{in the sense that it}} contains a variable whose value depends on the <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> implemented in the network. Later, the quantified delays due to <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> are reflected back in to the normal case model to complete the analysis;The first half of the dissertation includes definitions of <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> and their quantifications and an analytic model development and performance analysis comprises second half of the dissertation;The result of the performance analysis with certain assumptions shows considerable increase in average message delay in the system varying from 3. 8 % to 5744 % in the worst case. The importance of considering <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> on network performance is clearly demonstrated by the result obtained in this research;The analytic model developed is a flexible model which can encompass the effects of <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> in the token bus protocol...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the safety of}} a V-bar hopping manoeuvre which forms part of the final stage in autonomous space rendezvous. This manoeuvre is controlled by thrusters: we assume these inputs are perfect impulses and model the system in a hybrid automaton framework. We {{consider the}} operation of the system under bounded parametric uncertainties, e. g. thruster misalignment, and use the concept of Barrier <b>function</b> <b>certificates</b> to assess system safety. This methodology provides an efficient tool for the systematic investigation of the safety property and does not rely on Monte-Carlo simulations. In particular, the existence of a Barrier <b>function</b> <b>certificate</b> guarantees that all trajectories of the system starting from a given initial set do not enter a predefined unsafe region under any possible combination of parameter deviations. Such a Barrier <b>function</b> <b>certificate</b> can be constructed efficiently using the Sum of Squares (SOS) decomposition and semi-definite programming (SDP) ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> is an {{important}} part of any organization that possesses tangible assets. Whether it is machinery, buildings, equipment, or others, maintenance of these assets are vital to enable them to deliver as intended. In this thesis the focus is on maintenance of industrial production machinery and equipment. The literature on the topic of industrial maintenance is extensive, and there are lots of different frameworks and strategies proposed to enhance the performance of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> In this thesis the model of the Maintenance Loop, developed by the Norwegian Oil Directorate in the late 90 s, are used to assess the performance of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> at Benteler Automotive Farsund. The model divide the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> into 11 elements. For these 11 elements, the current status, problems and challenges, and finally, improvement potentials and future goals were identified. The results show that a thorough review of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> like the one performed in this thesis will reveal much information and several minor improvement potentials not visible by the naked eye. From the results of this thesis it can also be seen clearly how important it is to have a properly <b>functioning</b> Computerized <b>Maintenance</b> Management System (CMMS) at hand, and how important good communication is to be able to work efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Introduction This Recommendation {{identifies}} the <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> {{to be controlled}} by means of the CCITT-MML. The CCITT-MML (man-machine language) is intended to handle the functions required to manage telecommunication systems, e. g. via a telecommunication management network (TMN) (see Recommendation M. 30). The man-machine interface (MMI) enables the exchange of information between users and systems encoded in MML. Interaction between the users and the controlled systems is based on a repertoire of inputs, outputs, special actions and man-machine interaction mechanisms, including dialogue procedures. This Recommendation deals with the specification and control of <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions.</b> The tests appropriate to particular <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> remain as described in the relevant M-series Recommendations. When defining MML-functions the tasks which need to be performed (jobs) are first identified, in order to derive system functions to be controlled. The relationship betwee...|$|R

Being a part of such development programs, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> tries to be more precise in their doings and more cost-efficient in order to increase their value contribution. However, as a company only is one of many customers to the various suppliers of systems, machines and equipment being used, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> will remain a sub optimized small part of the various  product populations. The lack of information and knowledge from the complete product populations hampers development and makes all efforts to optimize maintenance in individual company organizations more or less meaningless. The key to improvement is the ongoing experience and the knowledge developed from use of a whole product population.

40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{products}} and services, companies are using various tangible assets such as production equipment and facilities. The goal of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> is to maintain these assets so they operate safely, efficiently and economically. This function includes technical, administrative and management activities, carried out {{in order to keep}} company’s assets in a state, or restore these to a state, in which they can perform the required functions. The activities should be planned and carried out in a way that allows for obtaining the required technical condition, availability, meets the safety requirements for humans and the environment, ensures quality of delivered products and services, and secures the anticipated service life of individual devices. Both effectiveness and efficiency of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> are very important to each company trying to operate with profit. As follows from the recent research, the performance of <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> in most of the studied companies around the world is in general unsatisfactory, and the underlying reasons of the subnormal behavior are not sufficiently identified, understood and described.   The result of research presented in this thesis is an improvement support system based on an explanatory model of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> This model shows the mechanisms interconnecting the motivations, intents and rationale behind the involved actors, entities and maintenance activities, and in this way gains understanding of how, and in what way the total performance of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> is affected, thereby supporting improvement decisions. As maintenance cost is a sharply increasing part of the operational costs, it is an evident target for operational and managerial improvement.

40|$|The {{performance}} and competitiveness of manufacturing companies {{is dependent on}} the reliability, availability and productivity of their production facilities. To ensure the plant achieves the desired performance, maintenance managers need a good track of performance on maintenance process and maintenance results. This can be attained through development and implementation of a rigorously defined performance measurement framework and indicators that are able to measure important elements of <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> performance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that performance indicators are not defined in isolation, but should be the result of a careful analysis of the interaction of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> with other organisational functions, most evidently with the production function. In this paper, a conceptual framework that provide guidelines for choosing <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> performance indicators is proposed. It seeks to align maintenance objectives with manufacturing and corporate objectives, and provides a link between the maintenance objectives, maintenance process/efforts and maintenance results. Based on this conceptual framework, performance indicators of the maintenance process and maintenance results are identified for each category. Maintenance Performance measurement Indicators...|$|R

40|$|Thermoelectric {{power plants}} {{consist of a}} set of {{critical}} equipment that require high levels of availability and reliability. Due to this, maintenance of these physical assets is gaining momentum in industry. Maintenance is considered as an activity that contributes to improving the availability, efficiency and productivity of each piece of equipment. Several techniques have been used to achieve greater efficiencies in maintenance, among which we can find the lean maintenance philosophy. Despite the wide diffusion of lean maintenance, there is no structured method that supports the prescription of lean tools applied to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> This paper presents the experience gathered in two lean maintenance projects in thermoelectric power plants. The application of lean techniques was based on using a previously developed multicriterial decision making process that uses the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to carry out a diagnosis and prescription tasks. That methodology allowed the prescription of the appropriated lean techniques to resolve the main deficiencies in <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> The results of applying such lean tools show that important results can be obtained, making the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> in thermoelectric power plants more efficient and lean...|$|R
