5|$|By {{the time}} of the bombing, Nellie Kehoe had become chronically ill with what resembled tuberculosis, for which there was no {{effective}} treatment or cure. Her frequent hospital stays <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the family's debt. Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and homeowner's insurance payments months earlier.|$|E

25|$|She {{began to}} take opiates for the pain, {{laudanum}} (an opium concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use {{from an early age}} <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter <b>have</b> suggested this <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|When Poland {{entered the}} Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin {{reminded}} General Kasprzycki of the Polish {{role in the}} dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. According to historian Paul N. Hehn, Poland’s annexation of Teschen <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the British and French reluctance to attack the Germans with greater forces in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it {{from the rest of}} Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E

5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{appeared}} {{briefly as}} a film actor and model during his 40-year career with the AP, which ended in 1979. He spent his later years working in display advertising, and answering letters and other requests made by assassination researchers. Altgens and his wife Clara died in 1995 {{at about the same}} time in their Dallas home. Both had suffered from long illnesses, and police said poisoning by a malfunctioning furnace also <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the historic Shoshones, {{but it is not}} well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
50|$|Completion {{of the car}} {{was very}} far behind. The car was {{ultimately}} able to pass all parts of tech inspection in time {{to be the very}} last car to run endurance. The chain fell off in the next to last lap of the event (second driver) due to the retaining clip on the master link falling off. This car had a chain which rubbed a friction surface on an interfering chassis tube, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> knocking the clip off.|$|R
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was that the pilot flew too low whilst trying to descend out of icing conditions. A navigational error <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the accident.|$|R

5|$|He held six consulships during Vespasian's reign {{but only}} one of these, in 73, was an {{ordinary}} consulship. The other five were less prestigious suffect consulships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January. While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> his later reservations about its relevance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
50|$|Mulock {{retired from}} {{politics}} in 1905 due to rheumatism and neuritis exacerbated by overwork, but {{the movement of}} his political views to the left <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> his decision.|$|R
50|$|The {{inability}} to prove paternity {{of a child}} biologically <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the absence or ambiguity in the Constitution regarding a child's rights to having his/her needs met by his/her father.|$|R
30|$|Admittedly, {{as there}} are bounds {{to the number of}} days worked, ranging from half a day to 7 days, this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> partly <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the lower {{inequality}} of days worked.|$|R
5|$|Nunn {{obtained}} {{the first eight}} years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park. During his teenage years, he gave himself a hernia while lifting a heavy piece of farm equipment. This, combined with his father's health history, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> back pain issues that plagued him {{for most of his}} life. In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Bowling Green Business University, now Western Kentucky University.|$|E
5|$|Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three {{kings of}} England and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the legal {{treatise}} attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his {{acceptance of gifts}} from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases. Osbert {{was one of a}} group of men who are considered the first signs of a professional judiciary in England.|$|E
5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> {{the abandonment of}} these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may {{have played a role in}} these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
50|$|Anchorage, Alaska, {{reporter}} Craig Medred {{pointed out}} in a January 2015 article in the Alaska Dispatch News that mushrooms which McCandless collected, photographed, and consumed <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> his death.|$|R

5000|$|Those three streams all flow {{together}} {{at what was}} to be Collingwood's site, and such glowing reports about the quick success of this [...] "far-out district" [...] <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the decision to found the town.|$|R
5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} had two lights; {{the lower}} a fixed white {{light and the}} upper a quick flashing white light, showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed light with no flashes detectable. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the grounding, at Cefn Sidan, of the La Jeune Emma, bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Joséphine de Beauharnais.|$|E
5|$|These factors <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the {{gap between}} All Black tours of the British Islesthey next toured in 1924.

25|$|Given {{that the}} bards {{depended}} on aristocratic support to survive, {{and that this}} power and patronage was shifting towards the new English rulers, this thorough condemnation of their moral values <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> their demise as a caste.|$|R
50|$|Josef Friedrich Kohl of Würzburg University {{and several}} German {{scientists}} claimed that makara {{is based on}} dugong instead, based on his reading of Jain text of Sūryaprajñapti.
