5000|$|The most {{important}} factor on a jig grinder is the dual-spindle configuration. The <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> is roughly positioned with between 1" [...] or 2" [...] of travel for setup, and then the [...]100" [...] of outfeed is used during machine operation to outfeed into the work. A spacer bar may be used between the grinder and <b>main</b> <b>spindle,</b> allowing large (9" [...] radius or larger) work to be completed. The <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> has {{a wide range of}} speeds to ensure proper grinder feed rates are maintained.|$|E
5000|$|A {{machine tool}} may have several spindles, {{such as the}} {{headstock}} and tailstock spindles on a bench lathe. The <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> is usually the biggest one. References to [...] "the spindle" [...] without further qualification imply the <b>main</b> <b>spindle.</b> Some machine tools that specialize in high-volume mass production {{have a group of}} 4, 6, or even more main spindles. These are called multispindle machines. For example, gang drills and many screw machines are multispindle machines. Although a bench lathe has more than one spindle (counting the tailstock), it is not called a multispindle machine; it has one <b>main</b> <b>spindle.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{new design}} of tapered roller {{bearings}} (TRB) for <b>main</b> <b>spindles</b> for high-performance cutting (HPC) or heavy roughing applications is presented. The bearing's key features {{to increase the speed}} rating are an outer ring rib, additional means of lubrication and ceramic rollers. First results of test rig experiments show that its speed rating is considerably higher than that of standard TRBs while calculations indicate that its stiffness and load rating are superior to conventional spindle bearings (SPB). Measured runout values of the new TRB and a reference SPB indicate that regarding accuracy the new TRB concept can be applicable for <b>main</b> <b>spindles...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{calculate}} the dynamic behavior of <b>main</b> <b>spindles,</b> local stiffness and damping properties of their machine elements are required. While the stiffness of spindle bearings is thoroughly investigated and their damping behavior was measured for selected types, {{there are only}} approximate stiffness and no damping values available for floating bearing elements. Therefore in this paper stiffness and damping properties of a slide and a linear bushing are determined by measurement, compared and validated...|$|R
5000|$|On 26 January 2015 an Enstrom 280FX crashed at Erie, Colorado, {{following}} {{the separation of}} its main rotor blades, killing both the student and instructor on board. The accident {{was caused by a}} failure of the <b>main</b> rotor <b>spindle</b> {{as a result of a}} crack. The accident resulted in the issuance of an Emergency Airworthiness Directive by the US Federal Aviation Administration on 12 February 2015 grounding more than 300 helicopters. The AD requires a magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks in the <b>main</b> rotor <b>spindle</b> in aircraft with more than 5,000 hours and requires replacing the spindle if cracked.|$|R

50|$|Temperature {{control is}} crucial, because the surface must be {{accurate}} on distance scales {{shorter than the}} wavelength of light. Temperature changes of a few degrees during machining can alter {{the form of the}} surface enough to have an effect. The <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> may be cooled with a liquid coolant to prevent temperature deviations.|$|E
50|$|The {{headstock}} (H1) {{houses the}} <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> (H4), speed change mechanism (H2,H3), and change gears (H10). The headstock {{is required to}} be made as robust as possible due to the cutting forces involved, which can distort a lightly built housing, and induce harmonic vibrations that will transfer through to the workpiece, reducing {{the quality of the}} finished workpiece.|$|E
40|$|Deep {{holes are}} {{bored with the}} meter, millimeter, and {{micrometer}} level diameters in engineering. Examples of such holes with large 100 -millimeter-level diameters and meter-level lengths are the rotation shafts of jet engines, generators and cannons. Holes with normal 10 -millimeter-level diameters and lengths of several hundred millimeters are used for the <b>main</b> <b>spindles</b> of machines, the small cylinder in plastic injection molding, the tube sheet for heat exchanger, and guns. To measure such components the proposed measurement system consists of a measurement head in order to scan hole wall, a laser interferometer for measuring surface parameters of the hole and an optical device at the backside for detecting attitude of the measurement head. As a result of experimental analysis, {{it is observed that}} deephole having small diameter and longlength can be measured automatically by the new developed measurement system...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the same}} date the FAA issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive 68-19-07. The {{directive}} {{has since been}} amended twice and now requires the following action: (a) Before further flight, remove <b>main</b> rotor blade <b>spindles</b> P/Ns S6110-23325-1, S6110-23325-2, and S6112-23025-1 that either have been [...] "salvaged" [...] in accordance with procedures set forth in paragraph entitled [...] "Salvage of Spindle" [...] contained in Sikorsky Aircraft Overhaul Manual for the pertinent helicopter model, or have accumulated 3000 or more hours' time in service on the effective date of this AD, and replace with blade spindles of the same part number {{that have not been}} [...] "salvaged" [...] and that have less than 3000 hours' time in service.(b) Replace <b>main</b> rotor blade <b>spindles</b> P/Ns S6110-23325-1, S6110-23325-2, and S6112-23025-1, that have not been [...] "salvaged" [...] and have less than 3000 hours' time in service on the effective date of this AD, before the accumulation of 3000 hours' time in service with <b>main</b> rotor blades <b>spindles</b> of the same part number that have not been [...] "salvaged" [...] and have less than 3000 hours' time in service.(c) Before further flight, remove from service <b>main</b> rotor blade <b>spindles</b> P/N's S6110-23325-1, S6110-23325-2, and S6112-23025-1, serial numbers AX51, AX54, F2148, F2444, F2485, F2207, F1406, F1416, F1415, F1399, B-35, and F2451.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, as many Swiss lathes {{incorporate}} a secondary spindle, or 'sub-spindle', they also incorporate 'live tooling'. Live tools are rotary cutting tools that are {{powered by a}} small motor independently of the spindle motor(s). Live tools increase the intricacy of components that can be manufactured by the Swiss lathe. For instance, automatically producing a part with a hole drilled perpendicular to the main axis (the axis of rotation of the spindles) is very economical with live tooling, and similarly uneconomical if done as a secondary operation after machining by the Swiss lathe is complete. A 'secondary operation' is a machining operation requiring a partially completed part to be secured in a second machine to complete the manufacturing process. Generally, advanced CAD/CAM software uses live tools {{in addition to the}} <b>main</b> <b>spindles</b> so that most parts that can be drawn by a CAD system can actually be manufactured by the machines that the CAD/CAM software support.|$|R
50|$|The {{cross-slide}} (3) {{rides on}} the carriage {{and has a}} feedscrew that travels {{at right angles to}} the <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be engaged, through a gear train, to the feed shaft (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the cross-slide. On most lathes, only one direction can be engaged at a time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} chucking {{machine is}} very similar to an automatic screw machine, except it handles larger work, which due to its size is more often chucking work and less often bar work. The Fay automatic lathe was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a screw machine is limited to around 80 mm practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to 300 mm chucks. The chucks are air-operated. Many of these machines are multispindle (more than one <b>main</b> <b>spindle).</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{path was}} pioneered by {{brothers}} Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 {{a machine that}} we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employeesâ€”the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{shrink fit}} chucks {{are widely used}} in high {{performance}} machining where excellent concentricity and high torque transmission are required. It was reported that in those milling operations, severe damage of tools, workpieces, and also machine tools occurs due to an extraction of the milling tool out of the shrink fit chuck during the process. Although, theoretically the interference fit assembly should withstand certain process forces, milling tools are apparently pulled out under special process conditions. The resulting increase of the cutting depth often leads to tool overload and breakage. So far, the phenomenon of tool extraction could not be explained. This paper presents an experimental approach of {{the investigation of the}} phenomenon of axial tool extraction. Therefore, a unique type of test rig for <b>main</b> <b>spindles</b> and tool interfaces is used. Experimental investigations on dynamic force and torque combinations leading to tool extraction are described. Results show, that the holding force is not only affected by geometrical parameters of the shrink fit chuck, but also by the applied dynamic load...|$|R
5000|$|The runner {{stone is}} {{supported}} by a cross-shaped metal piece (rind or rynd) fixed to a [...] "mace head" [...] topping the <b>main</b> shaft or <b>spindle</b> leading to the driving mechanism of the mill (wind, water (including tide) or other means).|$|R
50|$|The rind is {{affixed to}} the top of the <b>main</b> shaft or <b>spindle</b> and {{supports}} the entire weight of the runner stone, which can be as much as several tons. The rind is necessary because the grain is fed through the runner stone's central hole, so the spindle cannot be inserted through it like a cartwheel on an axle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> is {{generally}} hollow to allow long bars to extend {{through to the}} work area. This reduces preparation and waste of material. The spindle runs in precision bearings and is fitted with some means of attaching workholding devices such as chucks or faceplates. This end of the spindle usually also has an included taper, frequently a Morse taper, to allow the insertion of hollow tubular (Morse standard) tapers {{to reduce the size}} of the tapered hole, and permit use of centers. On older machines ('50s) the spindle was directly driven by a flat belt pulley with lower speeds available by manipulating the bull gear. Later machines use a gear box driven by a dedicated electric motor. A fully 'geared head' allows the operator to select suitable speeds entirely through the gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Most CNC Swiss-style lathes today use one or {{two main}} {{spindles}} plus {{one or two}} back spindles (secondary spindles). The <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> is used with the guide bushing for the main machining operations. The secondary spindle is located behind the part, aligned on the Z axis. In simple operation it picks up the part as it is cut off, and accepts it for second operations, then ejects it into a bin, eliminating {{the need to have}} an operator manually change each part, {{as is often the case}} with standard CNC turning centers. This makes them very efficient, as these machines are capable of fast cycle times, producing simple parts in one cycle (i.e., no need for a second machine to finish the part with second operations), in as little as 10-15 seconds. This makes them ideal for large production runs of small-diameter parts.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{accuracy}} of machining which is changed by a rise in temperature of <b>main</b> <b>spindle.</b> The machine tool and cutters used in this experiment were a bed-type milling machine and end mills made of high speed steel respectively. The following conclusions were obtained. 1. In the case of high revolution number, the temperature of <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> has risen remarkably for an hour. Since a dislocation of <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> and a error of cutting surface increase with rise in temperature of it, a predrive is required. 2. The predrive had better be done in higher revolution number than used cutting condition.

40|$|This article predicts {{lifetime}} of {{high cycle fatigue}} loading using Chaboche-Lemaitre damage model. The Chaboche-Lemaitre damage model takes into account mean stress effect as well as compressive stresses effect, making crack to close. In the this paper, a numerical algorithm is offered to integrate this model implicitly and the obtained algorithm is implemented as a user material subroutine of the ABAQUS finite element software. To reduce computation time, Jump-in-Cycles procedure is used based on fatigue loading simulation. To verify the proposed algorithm, a V-notched specimen is chosen under a fatigue loading with different stress ratios, and its lifetime is compared with experiments.

5000|$|The {{bridge is}} {{hydraulically}} controlled. 2 wedge cylinders lock {{the bridge and}} raise the overhanging edge in place at road level. When the bridge is to be opened, from the control box up at bridge deck level, the bridge operator, who is with Parks Canada, lowers all 4 gates to block traffic from entering the bridge deck. The operator withdraws the 2 wedge cylinders which brings the bridge down a few inches and balanced onto a circular rail track. This movement also takes {{the weight of the}} bridge off the West side bridge bearings. Once the limit switches sense the wedge cylinders are fully retracted the operator can swing the bridge which is performed by 2 large hydraulic cylinders below the bridge {{on either side of the}} <b>main</b> bridge <b>spindle.</b> The hydraulic power unit has 2 main pumps which can be run independently or together, and one small backup pump to be run off a generator if need be.|$|R
50|$|The {{cellular}} {{spindle apparatus}} includes the spindle microtubules, associated proteins, which include kinesin and dynein molecular motors, condensed chromosomes, and any centrosomes or asters {{that may be}} present at the spindle poles depending on the cell type. The spindle apparatus is vaguely ellipsoid in cross section and tapers at the ends. In the wide middle portion, known as the spindle midzone, antiparallel microtubules are bundled by kinesins. At the pointed ends, known as spindle poles, microtubules are nucleated by the centrosomes in most animal cells. Acentrosomal or anastral spindles lack centrosomes or asters at the spindle poles, respectively, and occur for example during female meiosis in most animals. In this instance, a Ran GTP gradient is the <b>main</b> regulator of <b>spindle</b> microtubule organization and assembly. In fungi, spindles form between spindle pole bodies embedded in the nuclear envelope, which does not break down during mitosis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} assembly process of main structural components in CA 6140 lathe, 3 D models for those components were established with CAD software UGNX 6. 0.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to design and {{fabricate}} a micro spindle turning (micro lathe) attachment with a micro EDG. The <b>main</b> hollow <b>spindle</b> of the former is positioned horizontally (can also be vertically, if required), located over two tungsten carbide V-bearings and steel ball as end-thrust bearing on a carbide support. This can be rotated about the horizontal axis by a balanced miniature DC motor via a belt-pulley system, reducing the spindle speed to about 3000 rpm (can also be either decreased or increased continuously). This spindle system may also be used as an attachment to any NC table of any type of EDM through its motor housing structure, to receive motions in the horizontal plane. The spindle accomodates micro collets on the free end for holding jobs from 0. 5 to 2 mm diameter. To ensure a compact mono block design with minimal components and low stray capacitance in the system, the entire housing and support structure is of single piece made of ABS plastic. The design and fabrication of a compact wire feeding mechanism for micro EDG ensures in situ processing of the micro tool on the spindle. Travelling wire is used as the tool electrode and moves around a carbide wire guide. The wire tension and speed are controlled using a spring loaded friction pad and directly driven wind-up system. The supply and wind-up spools, both are of insulating material sandwiching the friction pad and mounted on a shaft. A precision miniature geared (balanced epicyclical) DC servomotor drives the shaft. An insulating bracket developed n an FDM (RPT) system is used to hold the motor and shaft in place. A metallic tailstock centre supports the shaft at the other end. Horizontal and vertical pulleys are used to guide the wire perpendicularly and move it around the wire guide. The entire setup is mounted on a edge as opposed to problems of wire lag and vibration expereinced in wire EDM. The concept of the development is to incoporate both the systems to any configuration for micro EDMing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|At {{the onset}} of cell {{division}} microtubules growing from spindle pole bodies (SPB) {{interact with each other}} to form the mitotic spindle enabling proper chromosome positioning and segregation. However, the exact mechanism of microtubule dynamics and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) underlying spindle assembly is still not well understood. We developed an in vivo method to observe spindle assembly in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by inducing depolymerization of already formed and grown spindles by subjecting the cells to low temperatures, followed by subsequent repolymerization at a permissive temperature. We observed that microtubules pivot, i. e., perform angular movement around the SPB in a random manner, exploring the intranuclear space. Eventually microtubules extending from opposite SPBs come into contact and establish an antiparallel connection thus reassembling the spindle. Mutant approaches revealed that deletion of ase 1 and klp 5 did not prevent spindle reassembly, however introduced aberrations during the spindle formation. Amazingly, cut 7 p showed direct colocalization with microtubule overlap during spindle reassembly. Abrogation of cut 7 p led to inability to form a functional spindle. Thus, cut 7 p is the <b>main</b> regulator of <b>spindle</b> formation in fission yeast. None of the mutant strains affected microtubule pivoting, confirming that microtubule pivoting is a random movement unrelated to MAPs...|$|R
40|$|Single (individual) bivalents in cultured Drosophila melanogaster primary spermatocytes were {{detached}} from the spindle with a micromanipulation needle {{and placed in the}} cytoplasm. Such bivalents are prevented from rejoining the spindle by a natural membrane barrier that surrounds the spindle, but they quickly orient as if on a spindle of their own and the half-bivalents separate in anaphase. Serial section electron microscopy shows that a mini-spindle forms around the cytoplasmic bivalent, i. e., the microtubule density {{in the vicinity of the}} bivalent is much greater than in other cytoplasmic regions. This microtubule population cannot be accounted for solely by kinetochore nucleation and/or capture of microtubules. Furthermore, the mini- spindles frequently form at odd angles to the <b>main</b> <b>spindle,</b> so that at least one pole has no relationship to the poles of the <b>main</b> <b>spindle.</b> We conclude that a bivalent, or factors that become associated with the bivalent as a result of the manipulation, can either stabilize microtubules or promote their assembly. The bivalent activates latent microtubule organizing centers, or alternatively, polar organizing material has been passively transported from the <b>main</b> <b>spindle</b> to the cytoplasm by the micromanipulation procedure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Spindles {{underwent}} a 12 -fold elongation before anaphase B was completed during the closed mitoses of micronuclei in Paramecium tetraurelia. Two <b>main</b> classes of <b>spindle</b> microtubules have been identified. A peripheral sheath of microtubules with diameters of 27 - 32 nm {{was found to}} be associated with the nuclear envelope and confined to the midportion of each spindle. Most of the other microtubules had diameters of ~ 24 nm and were present along the entire lengths of spindles. Nearly all of the 24 -nm microtubules were eliminated from spindle midportions (largely because of microtubule disassembly) at a relatively early stage of spindle elongation. Disassembly of some of these microtubules also occurred at the ends of spindles. About 60 % of the total microtubule content of spindles was lost at this stage. Most, perhaps all, peripheral sheath microtubules remained intact. Many of them detached from the nuclear envelope and regrouped to form a compact microtubule bundle in the spindle midportion. There was little, if any, further polymerization of 24 -nm microtubules after the disassembly phase. Polymerization of microtubules with diameters of 27 - 32 nm continued as spindle elongation progressed. Most microtubules in the midportions of wellelongated spindles were constructed from 14 - 16 protofilaments. A few 24 -nm microtubule...|$|R
40|$|Pospiviroidae, {{with their}} <b>main</b> {{representative}} potato <b>spindle</b> tuber viroid (PSTVd), are replicated via a rolling circle mechanism by the host-encoded DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (pol II). In the first step, the (+) -strand circular viroid is transcribed into a (â€“) -strand oligomer intermediate. As {{yet it is}} not known whether transcription is initiated by promotors at specific start sites or is distributed non-specifically over the whole circle. An in vitro transcription extract was prepared from a non-infected potato cell culture which exhibited transcriptional activity using added circular PSTVd (+) -strand RNA as template. In accordance with pol II activity, transcription could be inhibited by Î±-amanitin. RTâ€“PCR revealed the existence of at least two different start sites and primer extension identified these as nucleotides A 111 and A 325. The sequences of the first 7 nt transcribed are very similar, 105 GGAGCGA 111 and 319 GGGGCGA 325. GC-boxes are located at a distance of 15 and 16 nt upstream, respectively, in the native viroid structure, which may act to facilitate initiation. The GC-boxes may have a similar function to the GC-rich hairpin II in the (â€“) -strand intermediate, as described previously. The results are compared with the corresponding features of avocado sunblotch viroid, which belongs to a different family of viroids and exhibits different transcription initiation properties...|$|R
30|$|In {{the upper}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract, carcinosarcomas are frequently {{observed in the}} esophagus [2]. However, gastric carcinosarcoma is extremely rare [7] and has been less frequently reported. Therefore, the histogenesis and progression of this tumor remain unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed [11]. The first is the biclonal origin hypothesis, which states that carcinosarcomas originate from two different tumor cell clones. The second is the monoclonal origin hypothesis, which states that the carcinosarcoma may originate from a stem cell, which is capable of undergoing both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. The tumor in our case probably originated as an epithelial tumor because there was an adenocarcinoma identified in the mucosa of the stomach. However, the tumor cells were mainly intravenous {{inside and outside of}} the stomach wall and the <b>main</b> component was <b>spindle</b> cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the sarcomatous components were partly positive for cytokeratin CAM 5.2. It is known that sarcoma can be occasionally positive for epithelial markers; therefore, positive staining for some epithelial markers does not prove that sarcomatous components originated as carcinomatous components. In our case, the sarcomatous components were partly positive for epithelial makers and there was a transitional area between the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. A similar case was reported in the past [7]; therefore, we suggest that the tumor originated in the mucosa of the stomach as an epithelial tumor and later transformed into a carcinosarcoma. As such, our findings support the hypothesis that carcinosarcomas may originate from a stem cell.|$|R
