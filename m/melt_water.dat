5|$|These {{measurements}} {{cannot be}} made accurately in the Arctic summer {{due to the}} presence of pools of <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> which cover significant areas of ice and which the satellite cannot distinguish from open water. For this reason the project does not provide data between May and September each year.|$|E
5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. <b>Melt</b> <b>water</b> from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E

The fraction of river runoff (f (R)) was high in the upper 50 m of the water column and decreased with depth and latitude. The signals of the river runoff were confined to water depths above 200 m. The total amount of river runoff in the Canada Basin was higher than that in other arctic seas, indicating that the Canada Basin is a main storage region for river runoff. The penetration depth of the sea-ice <b>melted</b> <b>water</b> was less than 50 m {{to the south of}} 78 A degrees N, while it was about 150 m to the north of 78 A degrees N. The total amount of sea-ice <b>melted</b> <b>water</b> was much higher to the north of 78 A degrees N than to the south of 78 A degrees N, indicating the sea-ice <b>melted</b> <b>waters</b> accumulated on the ice edge.

5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial <b>melt</b> <b>water),</b> and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.|$|E

25|$|During deglaciation, the <b>melted</b> ice <b>water</b> {{returns to}} the oceans, thus sea level in the ocean {{increases}} again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the <b>melted</b> ice <b>water</b> {{is not the same}} everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the <b>melted</b> <b>water</b> and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation.|$|R
25|$|The {{severity}} of the flooding was attributed to unusually high monsoon rains, the shedding off of equally unusually large amounts of <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> from the Himalayas, and the widespread cutting down of trees (that would have intercepted rain water) for firewood or animal husbandry.|$|E
25|$|For an {{intermediate}} drilling c. 390 m, the drill was installed 25 m {{below the surface}} {{at the bottom of}} the Dye 3 radar station. Some 740 seasonal δ18 cycles were counted, indicating that the core reached back to 1231 AD. Evident in this coring was that as <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> seeps through the porous snow, it refreezes somewhere in the cold firn and disturbs the layer sequence.|$|E
25|$|Colbeck {{offers an}} {{overview}} of the five friction processes of skis on snow. They are the: 1) resistance due to plowing of snow out of the way, 2) deformation of the snow over which the ski is traveling, 3) lubrication of the ski with a thin layer of <b>melt</b> <b>water,</b> 4) capillary attraction of water in the snow to the ski bottom, and 5) contamination of the snow with dust and other non-slippery elements. Plowing and deformation pertain to the interaction of the ski, as a whole, with the snow and are negligible on a firm surface. Lubrication, capillary attraction and contamination are issues for the ski bottom and the wax that is applied to reduce sliding friction or achieve adequate grip.|$|E
50|$|The Lenore Caves {{were formed}} by the {{plucking}} of basalt from {{the walls of the}} coulees by the rush of <b>melt</b> <b>waters</b> and are geologically different from most caverns. They were later used as shelters by prehistoric man.|$|R
50|$|The Rokuanvaara {{formation}} {{was formed}} {{at the end}} of the Wisconsin glaciation period, when fine-grain soil was washed into the region by <b>melting</b> <b>waters.</b> In 1956 the Rokua National Park was established to protect and to preserve the region.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 14,000 years ago, {{following}} the melting of the glaciers, the Great Bay estuary was formed. The glacial <b>melt</b> <b>waters</b> contributed to rising ocean waters, which flooded {{the land and}} filled the river valleys that make up Great Bay today.|$|R
500|$|The {{salt content}} of the upper levels of the lake is about 50 times that of glacial <b>melt</b> <b>water.</b> Salinity {{increased}} below , with sodium ion concentration and electrolytic conductivity more than doubling. The lake is highly alkaline (pH 10.4) down {{to a depth of}} below this depth, pH drops, reaching the slightly acidic value of 6.1 at maximum depth. The proportion of methane in the sediment at the lake bottom is the highest recorded for any lake in the world, according to NASA scientists.|$|E
500|$|The Pamirs {{mountain}} range located primarily in Tajikistan, has approximately eight thousand glaciers, {{many of which}} are in a general state of retreat. During the 20th century, the glaciers of Tajikistan lost [...] of ice. The [...] long Fedchenko Glacier, which is the largest in Tajikistan and the largest non-polar glacier on Earth, retreated [...] between the years 1933 and 2006, and lost [...] of its surface area due to shrinkage between the years 1966 and 2000. Tajikistan and neighboring countries of the Pamir Range are highly dependent upon glacial runoff to ensure river flow during droughts and the dry seasons experienced every year. The continued demise of glacier ice will result in a short-term increase, followed by a long-term decrease in glacial <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> flowing into rivers and streams.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the last}} Ice Age, <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> {{accumulated}} in the closed basins {{of what is}} now south-central Oregon. [...] As a result, pluvial lakes covered much of Oregon’s high desert country. [...] This included the area around what is now Lake Abert. [...] During this period, the area was home to mammoths, bison, horses, camels, and mountain sheep. [...] The abundant wildlife drew prehistoric hunters to the area as well.|$|E
50|$|Melt ponds are {{pools of}} open water that form on sea {{ice in the}} warmer months of spring and summer. The ponds are also found on glacial ice and ice shelves. Ponds of <b>melted</b> <b>water</b> can also develop under the ice.|$|R

2500|$|The tins {{of cooking}} fuel cached along the return route {{were found to}} be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had {{vaporised}} part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this [...] "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.|$|E
2500|$|During the Ice Age, the {{sea level}} was some 200 metres {{lower than it}} is today. <b>Melt</b> <b>water</b> carried debris and flowed beneath the glacier under high pressure, to produce tunnel valleys, deeply incised water routes. At Clare it {{is as far as}} 110 metres below our present sea level. The valley was {{subsequently}} filled with boulder clay and gravel. [...] The ice sheet, which produced the chalky boulder clay, rolled upon a bed of glacial sand and gravel, and formed the flattened character of the area today.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{retreating}} glaciers {{of the last}} glaciation period of the Ice Age, <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> accumulated in the closed basins of what now is south central Oregon.

2500|$|Vanport was {{especially}} vulnerable to flooding, since it was built on reclaimed lowlands along the Columbia River. The Columbia Basin is a massive area encompassing seven U.S. states and British Columbia, Canada. The previous winter snowpack was 75 to 135% of normal. Above normal temperatures accompanied two major rainstorms May 19 to 23, 1948, and again May 26 to 29. Rainfall combined with <b>melt</b> <b>water</b> swelled the many tributaries feeding the Columbia in the days prior to the flood, creating high water levels {{not seen since the}} record flood of 1894. [...] The lowest point in Vanport was about [...] below the water level in the river.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{evidence}} {{in favour of}} glacial flow was known by the early 19th century, other theories of glacial motion were advanced, such as the idea that <b>melt</b> <b>water,</b> refreezing inside glaciers, caused the glacier to dilate and extend its length. As {{it became clear that}} glaciers behaved to some degree as if the ice were a viscous fluid, it was argued that [...] "regelation", or the melting and refreezing of ice at a temperature lowered by the pressure on the ice inside the glacier, was what allowed the ice to deform and flow. [...] James Forbes came up with the essentially correct explanation in the 1840s, although it was several decades before it was fully accepted.|$|E
50|$|Icicles form on {{surfaces}} {{which might}} have a smooth and straight, or irregular shape, which in turn influences {{the shape of an}} icicle. Another influence is <b>melting</b> <b>water,</b> which might flow toward the icicle in a straight line or which might flow from several directions. Impurities in the water can lead to ripples {{on the surface of the}} icicles.|$|R
50|$|Placement of {{heat trace}} cable on roofs or in gutters to melt ice during winter months.
