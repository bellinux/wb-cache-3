Initially, 1280 adult <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>mussels</b> (Mytilus galloprovincialis), 960 from a {{shellfish}} farm and 320 from natural beds, were collected over a one-year period. Water temperature, oxygenation and salinity were measured at each sampling. Mussels were measured and weighted to calculate the condition index and microscopically examined for the presence of haemocytic neoplasia. Haemocytic neoplasia was detected in 14 mussels (1. 1 %) with a higher prevalence in cultured mussels. Neoplastic cells singularly infiltrated the connective tissue, in small foci or diffusely. Necrosis and multifocal atrophy of digestive tubules were noticed in mussels with diffuse neoplasia, whereas severe haemocytic infiltration of connective tissue was seen in mussels with single neoplastic cells. Haemocytic neoplasia was more frequently observed in spring and autumn. The average condition index of mussels with haemocytic neoplasia was slightly higher than in healthy ones. This is the first report of haemocytic neoplasia in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>mussels</b> in the Northern Adriatic Sea.

Autoradiograms of gill DNA from animals of the industrial area showed a tract of unresolved adducts along the diagonal radioactive zone. Such adducts were detected at low but significant levels in different sampling periods only in mussels and fish collected at Porto Marghera. The presence of bulky aromatic DNA adducts in native mussels is consistent with previous results on the appearance of a weak adduct in gill DNA of Mytilus galloprovincialis treated with benzo(a) pyrene.

50|$|Marteilia refringens is a {{unicellular}} parasite {{affecting the}} digestive {{system of the}} flat oyster, Ostrea edulis.

Samples of mussels belonging to 5 batches of products, from 2 Depuration Centers, were collected before depuration (T 0), after 4 h (T 4) and at the end of depuration (T 8). Results showed an overall efficacy of the depuration in respect to E. coli moderate counts. A depuration for ~ 8 hours led to a rapid decline in the concentration, complying to the Food Safety Criteria of the Reg. (EC) 2073 / 2005. The decline in numbers of E. coli, does not correlate with the presence of naturally occurring Vibrios, which decline at an even slower rate.

The mussel’s meat salted in a brine with 4 % sodium chloride for 15 min in a mussel’s / brine ratio 1 : 2, dried at 60 - 65 oC for 13 min, and smoked at 65 - 80 oC for 17 min, with smouldering hard sawdust, 13 min, smoked at vacuum packed in pouches and cold stored at 2 - 3 oC. Steaming and smoking significantly (p 0. 05) on pH value. During storage of mussels meat for 90 days under the above mentioned conditions the total plate count increased by 1 log 10 cfu/g, the lactic acid bacteria count remained constant, the pH reduced by 0. 2 units, the TBA value slightly increased by 0. 2 mg of malonaldeyde/kg and the TVBN increased from 18 to 29 mg N/ 100 g. Based on sensory attributes the shelf-life of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>mussel’s</b> meat under the specified smoking procedure and storage conditions can be extended up to 70 days at 2 - 3 oC.

The exposure to sweeps did not produce any significant changes in the mussels' behaviour. Conversely, the specimens exposed to the low frequency band treatment showed significantly higher values of the following biochemical stress parameters measured in their plasma and tissues: glucose, total proteins, total haemocyte number (THC), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) expression, and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity.
