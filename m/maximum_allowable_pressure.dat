50|$|<b>Maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> {{operating}} <b>pressure</b> or MAOP {{refers to}} the wall strength of a pressurized cylinder such as a pipeline or storage tank and how much pressure the walls may safely hold in normal operation. The MAOP {{is less than the}} MAWP (<b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> working <b>pressure).</b> MAWP being the maximum pressure based on the design codes that the weakest component of a pressure vessel can handle. Commonly standard wall thickness components are used in fabricating pressurized equipment, and hence are able to withstand pressures above their design pressure. Design pressure is the maximum pressure a pressurized item can be exposed to. Due to the availability of standard wall thickness materials, many components will have a MAWP higher than the required design pressure. Relief valves are set at the design pressure of the pressurized item and sized to prevent the item under pressure from being over-pressurized. Depending on the design code that the pressurized item is designed, an over-pressure allowance can be used when sizing the relief valve. This is +10% for PD 5500, and ASME Section VIII div 1 & 2 (with an additional +10% allowance in ASME Section VIII for a fire relief case). ASME have different criteria for steam boilers.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{based on}} simple principles, Newcomen's engine was rather complex and {{showed signs of}} {{incremental}} development, problems being empirically addressed as they arose. It consisted of a boiler A, usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than 1 - 2 psi (0.07 - 0.14 bar) - the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking [...] "Great balanced Beam", the fulcrum E of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building, the engine being located in-house. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head F of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head D was suspended a piston P working in a cylinder B, the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston {{was surrounded by a}} seal {{in the form of a}} leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank C (or header tank) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a stand-pipe for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the analysis of a {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG) is to define energetic losses of the HRSG design and to provide an accurate estimate of investment cost with a model that is sensitive to thermodynamic and geometric changes in a HRSG. The backbone of the analysis is the requirement that the HRSG must satisfy a <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> loss on the exhaust side of the system. This pressure loss is an input to the analysis, and the HRSG is sized to meet this requirement.

30|$|The {{choice of}} rock failure models defines the {{magnitude}} of minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressures.</b> For example, applying the Mogi–Coulomb rock failure model, the minimum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressure</b> is much less compared to when either the Mohr–Coulomb failure model or the Hoek–Brown failure model is adopted (Elyasi and Goshtasbi 2015). Also, predicted mud windows are narrower and conservative with the Hoek–Brown model (Elyasi and Goshtasbi 2015). The failure criterion selected therefore has a prominent influence on the defined safe mud window. Due to its simplicity, the linear-elastic analysis {{is often used to}} predict the initiation of failure. In terms of stress, the onset of tensile or compressive failure happens when the respective tensile and compressive rock strength is exceeded. Whereas the criterion for tensile failure is defined by when the minimum effective stress is greater than the rock tensile strength, the criterion for compressive failure is determined by whichever compressive failure criterion is deemed appropriate (McLean and Addis 1990) (e.g. Mohr–Coulomb, Drucker–Prager and Hoek–Brown).|$|R
