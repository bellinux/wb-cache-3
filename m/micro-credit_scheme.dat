This paper researched livelihood strategies, credit systems and power relations in two villages from Belcheragh District, in Faryab Province, during summer 2008. Through the use of qualitative methods the study explored in-depth strategies such as remittances, agriculture and carpet weaving incomes, life-cycle activities, credit systems, including <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes</b> and the common local credit transactions, and finally, power networks. The study also explored how these strategies are changing in Afghanistan in the face of changes in the political, social and economic conditions. The study found that social networks, through which less privileged households gain access to credit, are exploitative in nature. Access to land and credit for the more privileged households allows them to also have a say in who gets what in the village, mainly <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes,</b> the local credit transactions and other livelihood incomes.

Design/methodology/approach – The study employed qualitative approach and exploratory perspective, using primary and secondary data obtained at beneficiary and institutional levels. Findings – The loan repayment rates were generally low for many of the schemes, and this confirms the problems of public sector lending, with implications for the sustainability of the schemes. Many reasons were given for the low repayment rates, among which were poor credit culture of the schemes managed by public sector and the attitudinal nature of Nigerians towards public funds. Practical implications – There is a need for policy makers, researchers and entrepreneurs to improve on the designing of <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes</b> in order to be sustainable.

We deliberately choose these respondents due to they are traditionally targeted by usurers (or rentenir in Indonesian) who lend money with high interest rate and penalties so, in many cases, it will makes them broke instead of having their business improve. The important issues in the model are how to generate the simulated data representing the real data, determination of required parameters and to find an optimal portion of profit share which is quite fair for the lender and the borrower. The model shows that the borrower will benefit from the scheme even though sometimes she has losses in particular days, and the lender will get good return as an investment return...|$|E

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{search for}} {{effective}} small-scale fisheries management regime, in Tanzania, {{has been an}} on-going process since independence in 1961. Different models were tried including centralized system of governance, use of cooperative groups and setting up of environmental committees in villages. Unfortunately, nothing much was realized and thus, over-capacity, over-fishing, illegal fishing practices and environmental degradation became prevalent. In view of this situation, the government adopted establishment of Beach Management Units in fishing villages. So far over 600 BMUs have been established in the country. The performance of many BMUs is mixed, however the lesson learned from the models developed in three districts; Rufiji, Mafia and Kilwa, provides frames of reference on requirements for successful introduction of fisheries co-management. The experience suggests that introducing fisheries co-management is a process moving through certain stages if the best results are to be achieved. First, threats or issues have to be identified followed by effective early action before focusing on group formation and dynamics. Other necessary dimensions are; education and training, resource management functions and extension service. The components {{have to be taken}} in combination rather than disjointedly.

So {{it is important to consider}} the ways in which a favorable initial response can be achieved.

The <b>micro-credit</b> <b>scheme</b> of Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, providing micro-loans to landless poor women in rural areas of Bangladesh, for instance, became a successful equitable and sustainable development initiative (Dowla 2006; Karim 2008; Khandker 2005; Mohiuddin 2000). A similar and successful approach is followed by the Pakistani micro-finance institution-Kashf Foundation that exclusively lends to women and increases their empowerment (Weber and Ahmad 2014). Because women are the central actors, particularly, of rural livelihood activities. Women centric income generating activities strengthen their role in sustainable development as indicated in the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations 2015). Ideally, poor people invest micro-loans in their micro-enterprises to generate income that ultimately help them to reduce their poverty (Karim and Osada 1998). Generally, microloans are directed towards funding both existing and start-up enterprises (Bayulgen 2008). While many microfinance institutions offer services such as training, savings facilities, family planning, health services and education (Karim and Osada 1998), interest rates of micro-loans are usually higher than those of commercial loans, but they are far below the interest rates of informal money lenders (Bayulgen 2008; Chowdhury and Chowdhury 2011). High interest rates are justified by the non-existence of any collateral, high administrative costs because of the provision of many small loans, as well as and the costs of accessing borrowers in rural environments (Hietalahti and Linden 2006; Mallick 2002). Generally, repayment records of micro-loans are high (Kono and Takahashi 2010), and consequently, default rates are often lower than in commercial lending. Grameen Bank, for instance, achieves repayment rates as high as 98 % compared to only 27 % for the Bangladeshi banks (Hudak 2012).|$|E

40|$|Farmers in over 50 {{communities}} in Nigeria s Middle Belt, often {{known as the}} food basket of the country, have successfully used Striga control methods to increase crop productivity and improve their livelihoods. The success {{is the result of}} a 4 -year programme, Participatory Research and Extension Approaches (PREA), conducted by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Striga infests about 40 % of arable land in the savannah regions of sub-Saharan Africa, threatening the livelihoods of more than 100 million people who depend on cereals and grains in the sub-region. A single Striga plant can produce over 50, 000 seeds, which are capable of remaining in the soil for more than 20 years until a susceptible plant is available to stimulate their development. Striga causes low yields of sorghum, maize, rice and pearl millet and, in some cases, total crop failure. In sub-Saharan Africa, maize yield loss attributed to Striga is estimated at US$ 7 billion annually. The PREA technology uses Striga-resistant maize varieties, which have doubled yields in farmers fields. These include ACR 94 TZE COMP. 5 -W, an early maturing variety; IWD-STR, an intermediate maturing variety; and ACR. 97 TZL COMP. 1 -W, a late maturing variety. Many farmers who had abandoned their farms because of Striga have now returned to farm their land. Funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), of the United Kingdom, the PREA project has also involved setting up community-based seed production. A number of farmers have gone into partnership with private seed companies in the area. A <b>micro-credit</b> <b>scheme</b> has helped small-scale farmers get started with Striga-free seed production.

40|$|Many {{development}} {{policies have}} been implemented {{with a focus on}} practical gender needs to improve women's lives in Bangladesh. However, these programmes have paid little attention to implementing women's strategic gender needs and consequently have failed to bring significant changes to poverty and malnutrition among rural women in Bangladesh. As an extension of economic development programmes the Grameen Bank micro-credit institution in Bangladesh provides credit to the rural poor, particularly women. It operates in {{more than half of the}} villages through loans disbursement to 2. 3 million members of whom 95 percent are women. The question to be raised is to what extent does the Grameen Bank credit scheme generate women's income activities with the prospect of empowering them against poverty and malnutrition. The major concern of my Ph. D. research is to examine the impact of Grameen Bank credit on empowering rural women socially and economically which, in turn, improves women's health and nutrition. The theoretical frameworks used for assessing the impact of credit activities on empowering women are drawn from the Harvard Analytical Framework (1980), Longwe's (1994) Women's Empowerment Assessment Framework, and Kabeer's (1998), using indicators to assess women's empowerment. The five specific dimensions are: (1) women's economic activities, (2) women's control over income, (3) access to and control over productive resources, (4) women's freedom of mobility, and (5) market access, all of which have been adapted and used to assess women's empowerment through credit activities. My research methodology consists of ethnographic field research, including in-depth interviews of women's experiences, participant observations and focus group discussion. I employ both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data, which was collected from December 1999 to April 2000. Two groups of women are considered in this study, those who were involved in the Grameen Bank credit activities, and those who did not access Grameen credit. A total of 144 participants, including Muslim and Hindu backgrounds and Grameen Bank staff, were involved in the study. The study found the majority of women have no control over their loans. Women hand over their loans to male family members to invest in more profitable male-dominated economic activities, beyond the domestic sphere. The result is that women have no say or little say in how their loan money is to be used and for what purposes. In addition, women who invest their loans in traditional female economic activities depend largely on males for marketing their products. It is also found that although women take loans, provide more energy and time, and bear the burden of re-payment, it is men who use their prevailing traditional power to buy productive assets in their own name and under their control. For the majority of women their lives have become more vulnerable and have slipped into deeper poverty and malnutrition. Factors such as women's restricted mobility, lack of market access, and rigid gender cultural practices are major obstacles to women's empowerment through credit activities. The study also found only a small minority of women have benefited from the Grameen <b>micro-credit</b> <b>scheme.</b> These women are mostly Hindu low caste widows, who have had market access and became involved in the production and management of male-managed economic activities. These activities increase women's negotiation skills, widen their knowledge and market information and enhance their courage and self-confidence in challenging patriarchal social structures in their community. In general, there are no significant differences between Grameen and non-Grameen Bank women in terms of control over income, market access, and control over productive assets. The nutritional status of women is assessed using: (a) body mass index, (b) food frequency questionnaire, and (c) 3 -day food consumption patterns. Nutritional adequacy and deficiency are assessed and compared with recommended dietary allowances in Bangladesh. Most of the Grameen Bank women are nutritionally deficient compared to non-Grameen women. Grameen Bank women's heavy workload and debt burden, lack of control over income and expenditure combined with gender disparity in household resource allocation, are viewed as critical in negatively impacting on women's health and nutritional status. The computer programme Epinfo version 6, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and Nutrition programmes were used to analyse data.

40|$|A decade on, a {{small town}} in north-west Kenya has become home to over 80, 000 {{refugees}}, writes Peter Browne DESPITE the intense midday heat, the Don Bosco Vocational Training Centre at the Kakuma refugee camp is teeming with activity. In one shed twenty young refugees are clustered around an old four-wheel drive truck, which they’ve pulled to pieces and almost finished reassembling. In another, a dozen masonry students are building small mudbrick walls with quiet concentration. Elsewhere in the camp, young refugees are learning dressmaking, tailoring, word processing, plumbing carpentry and agriculture. Walking through the leafy training compound it is almost possible to forget that Kakuma, a hundred kilometres from the Sudan border in arid north-west Kenya, {{has been one of the}} UNHCR’s most troubled camps. Its population - currently a little over 83, 000 - is not only much larger than the organisation considers manageable, but is more diverse and more volatile than many camps in Africa. And, like a growing number of camps across the continent, Kakuma has been experiencing the difficult transition from emergency settlement to a semi-permanent community with many of the characteristics of {{a small town}}. Established by the UNHCR in response to an influx of mainly Sudanese refugees in 1991, the camp quickly dwarfed the existing town, and its estimated population of 7000 members of the region’s Turkana people. With their traditional nomadic existence already disrupted by banditry and intensifying competition for land and resources, the Turkana were hostile to the newcomers - but also attracted by the growing economy of the camp. A decade later, an estimated 48, 000 local people live in and around Kakuma and have access to many of the services available to refugees. It’s hardly surprising that the transition from a small town of 7000 to a combined population of over 130, 000 has been characterised by violence - especially against women and girls collecting firewood outside the camp - and by conflict within the refugee communities. ‘Increasing incidents of inter-nationality and inter-ethnic fights, thuggery and banditry have resulted in a situation of hazard and risk,’ reported one UNHCR officer in 1999. Despite its growing permanence, the camp remained on emergency footing. But a slow transition was underway, and Don Bosco, an aid organisation run by the Salesian Brothers, played an important role alongside the Lutheran World Federation, which handles much of the day-to-day management of the camp on behalf of the UNHCR, and a range of other NGOs. Don Bosco’s <b>micro-credit</b> <b>scheme</b> provides in-kind assistance - bicycles, groceries, small pieces of equipment - to refugees starting their own businesses; the bicycles are used as taxis throughout the camp. Trained masons from the Don Bosco program are employed by World Vision to build mudbrick houses for refugees, replacing the makeshift shelters that have characterised the camp for much of its life. The figures suggest that the program is gathering pace. Last year 531 students were enrolled at Don Bosco’s three training centres at Kakuma; this year 1500 applied and 749 (including 65 Turkanas) were admitted. A turning point for the camp came in 2001, according to Br Jose Kaippananickal, who manages the Don Bosco program at Kakuma. In a blaze of publicity, the US government accepted a first group of just over 3000 of the ‘lost boys of Sudan’, the group of young, unaccompanied Sudanese who formed the original nucleus of the camp. Of course, the boys were ten years older by this time, and had formed relationships - not least through marriage - in the camp. Soon after they arrived in the US, according to Br Jose, funds began to flow back to Kakuma, accelerating the growth of the camp economy. Other camp residents benefit from a different source of funds - the ‘incentive payments’ made to the several thousand refugees who have jobs with the agencies operating in the camp. The Jesuit Refugee Service, for example, has 160 trained refugees providing counselling, childcare and other services. Although the payments are modest, they provide the money to shop at the remarkable diversity of shops and stalls that have sprung up in the camp’s markets. They also help lift these refugees and their families out of the absolute poverty they would suffer if they were forced - as many others are - to rely entirely on the rations provided by the World Food Program. For most of the past two years those rations have been below the World Health Organisation’s recommended daily minimum of 2100 calories, and often delivered in the form of a very narrow and monotonous group of foods. Last month, according to the UNHCR’s Kakuma Programme Officer, Khalid Shah, the WFP ration was providing 1800 calories a day. Partly filling the gap was a further 100 calories from the UNHCR’s programme funds, which have already been diminished by a reduction in donor funds for the organisation’s African operations. Serious funding problems have helped produce a situation at Kakuma in which the facilities and services needed in a longer-term settlement - from sanitation to schools - are uneven and uncertain. Kakuma is not alone in this respect. According to the UNHCR, long-term camps can also be found in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan and Algeria. Skills training programs have become a feature of many of these camps. In the case of Kenya, the existence of two large camps - Kakuma and, in the north-east, Dadaab - is a result of the former government’s controversial camp-confinement policy, which is likely to be relaxed somewhat under the new government. Although there are arguments for and against camps (as opposed to the alternative of ‘self settlement’, which also occurs, illegally, in Kenya) they’re likely to remain a feature of the refugee protection system in Africa. For refugees in the camps the options are limited. Repatriation is difficult or impossible. Resettlements places in the West are severely limited. Self-sufficiency is unlikely. So the key question for donor governments is how best to make life less desperate in these relatively new, artificial communities. Supporting the work of organisations like Don Bosco (whose work at Kakuma receives significant funding from the Australia refugee organisation, Austcare) and the Jesuit Refugee Service seems like a good place to start.

40|$|Gender {{inequality}} and poverty are two serious problems {{for developing countries}} {{where the majority of}} women have been victims of the cultural, socio-economic, political, and environmental impacts of development. The gender dimension of poverty focuses on the dilemma of women, their multiple roles as women and their roles in alleviating poverty. The literature on women and poverty abounds with numerous cases and other evidence of women's vulnerability and heavier economic and socio-cultural burden of poverty. Women are also known to be discriminated against in terms of economic safety, lack of basic needs support, work access, opportunities, and payment. Despite these factors, women have a greater sense of responsibility and are more accountable towards sustaining programs designed to alleviate poverty among the poor. In Indonesia, as elsewhere in the world, micro-credit is being used as a major vehicle which serves women for improving their wellbeing, reduce vulnerability, and also as a starter point to empower women. Using findings drawn from a study on the Indonesian Government policies and the implementation of two particular <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes,</b> namely Tabungan Kesejahteraan Rakyat (Takesra) and Kredit Keluarga Sejahtera (Kukesra). This thesis explores the two basic and especially important issues of poverty and women empowerment. Firstly, it views poverty within gender and sustainability perspectives, and secondly, evaluates the impacts of the <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes</b> under Takesra and Kukesra. The thesis argues that poverty reduction among women is consistent with the concept of gender and development which is particularly reinforced within the sustainability agenda. The conditions to do so, however, have internal and external constraints strongly manifested in the operation of the <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes.</b> The evidence from the empirical research conducted in three districts of Central Java, Indonesia - namely Brebes, Purbalingga and Cilacap - shows the first type of constraints to refer to weaknesses of the schemes themselves, such as incomplete and misdirected indicators for success, small size of available loans and long duration of repayment terms. The second refers to the socio-economic aspects of sustainability, including the economic conditions which do not allow market access to poor women and cultural manipulations which result in overburdens to women. Both diminish the role of the schemes as a poverty solution. From the analysis and lessons learned from best practices in other countries, it is suggested that the Indonesian Government policies need to be refocuses {{in order to deal with}} the internal and external constraints and allow for an advance to be achieved in poverty alleviation and women empowering. The Takesra and Kukesra schemes in a revised form based on the developed new model for micro-credit delivery, should continue to play a role in providing credit to poor women to encourage skill development and capacity building, support the process of women empowerment and potentially contribute towards a more sustainable society...|$|R

In these countries, social entrepreneurship has become the main policy used {{as part of the}} poverty eradication strategies. Based on this foundation, this paper work is formed with the aim to study the effect of the micro-credit financing of the AIM in creating a strong line of women-entrepreneurs. In particular, it seeks to(1) explore the current social entrepreneurship modelwhich usesAIM’s <b>micro-credit</b> financing <b>scheme,</b> (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the AIM micro-credit financing schemetowards women-entrepreneurs; and (3) manalyse the challenges and obstacles that are often faced by women entrepreneurs in relation to the current AIM <b>micro-credit</b> financing <b>scheme.</b> The study methodology involves the distribution of surveys to 1500 members of theAIM micro-credit financing schemethroughout Malaysia.

40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that climate variability {{and change in}} the Sahelian zone of Nigeria will have an overwhelming impacts on agriculture, land use, ecosystem and biodiversity. Recent years have seen adaptation come to the international climate debate. The focus is centered largely upon enhancing the capacity of developing countries such as Nigeria {{to adapt to the}} impacts of climate change. The paper discussed the role of extension in agricultural adaptation to climate change in the Sahelian zone of Nigeria. It identified the evidence of climate change in the Sahelian zone of Nigeria and described the adaptation strategies to the changing climate. The paper also explored the role of agricultural extension services in climate change adaptation. The challenges facing agricultural adaptation to climate change were also discussed. The paper recommended that efforts of the government should include; development of special rural <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes,</b> improved extension delivery and human capital developmen...|$|R
40|$|Temporary {{seasonal}} migration {{is an issue}} which is largely ignored in the standard rural-urban migration literature. Seasonal migration due to agricultural downturns is a com-mon phenomenon in developing countries. Using primary data from a cross-sectional household survey from the northwest part of Bangladesh, this study quantifies the fac-tors that influence such migration decisions. Among other results, we find that network effects {{play a significant role}} influencing the migration decision. Seasonal migration is a natural choice for individual suffering periodic hardship, however the strict weekly loan repayment rules of Micro-credit can have adverse effect on this process, reducing the abil-ity of borrowers to react to a shock. Our result suggest that poor individuals prefer the option of not accessing the the Micro-credit and opt for temporal {{seasonal migration}} dur-ing the lean period. The results have numerous potential policy implications, including the design of typical <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic systems - even {{of small}} size - remain {{unaffordable}} {{for the majority}} of rural inhabitants in developing countries. Solar fee-for service companies act like small utilities by providing an energy service against a small monthly fee. Fee-for service schemes enable users to spread the up-front cost of photovoltaic systems over a long period, and provide {{a solution to the problem}} of their long-term maintenance. Relying on field surveys in Zambia and South Africa – this chapter focuses on how sustainable rural electrification schemes with fee-for service concessions have been implemented and the difficulties that had to be overcome. Logistic and day-to-day management issues are analyzed. The respective advantages of small and large concessions schemes are presented. Some elements of the institutional framework needed for the massive scale diffusion of solar home systems are presented. Finally, the conditions of implementation of fee-for service schemes are compared to the ones of implementation of <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes</b> in the particular context of India...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 ies, gender mainstreaming and related women`s economic empowerment programs became an integral part of development programs and global disaster management. Gender―or more generally speaking social―justice is defined as its end goal, that is a condition in which diverse needs and interests are acknowledged and shared power relations are existent. Albeit the goal of social justice appears to be clear, subjective ideals may be diverse and contradictory, depending on personal stances, religious affiliations as well as on sociocultural contexts. How do theoretical approaches developed in western countries aid analysis of, and development of interventions for social problems within non-western contexts? In this article, I address this question by investigating which gender relations are endorsed by a disaster-stricken village community in Southeast Asia. The community helps to clarify what is possible when a group of several Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) works together on issues of social justice and gender issues using livelihood programs and <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes.</b> On the background of the empirical findings, I discuss shortcomings of western approaches...|$|R
40|$|Scaling-up {{adoption}} {{of renewable energy}} technology— such as solar home systems (SHS) —to expand electric-ity access in developing countries can accelerate the transition to low-carbon economic development. Using a national household survey, this study quantifies the carbon and distributional benefits of SHS programs in Bangladesh. Three key findings are generated from the study. First, dissemination of SHS brings about significant carbon benefits: the total carbon emissions avoided from replacing kerosene use for lighting by SHS in non-electrified rural households is equivalent to about 4 percent of total annual carbon emissions in Bangladesh in 2007. This figure increases to about 15 percent if grid-based electricity generation is used as the energy baseline to estimate the carbon avoided from SHS installation. Second, SHS subsidies in rural Bangladesh are progressive when the program is geo-graphically targeted. Third, SHS has market potential in many rural areas if <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes</b> are made available. The propensity to install SHS is very respon-sive to income, with a 1 percent increase in per capita income increasing the probability of installing SHS by 12 percent, controlling other factors...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{international}} significance attached {{to climate change}} adaptation, there remains {{a lack of understanding}} of the barriers that impede the effective implementation of adaptation strategies by households across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Better understanding of the vulnerability of agriculture-dependent households to climate variability requires exploration of the barriers that constrain the implementation of adaptation strategies. This paper uses case studies from northeast Ghana and a systematic literature review to assess the barriers that restrict effective implementation of climate adaptations in SSA. Results suggest that households are constrained by financial barriers, socio-cultural barriers, institutional barriers, technological barriers and a lack of information on climate change characteristics. We examine how the various barriers interact at different levels to influence the adaptation process. Findings highlight that the development of early warning systems, effective communication of climate information and an understanding of the local context within which adaptations take place, are necessary pre-requisites to enhance climate adaptations and rural livelihoods. Households need to be supported through the provision of <b>micro-credit</b> <b>schemes,</b> community empowerment and extension initiatives aimed at enhancing social networks within farming communities in order to reduce their vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change and variability...|$|R
