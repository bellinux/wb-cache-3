5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half was invested {{on research and development}} to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Hogg had {{previously}} suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression. She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, {{a specialist in}} the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials and}} {{modifications}} lasted <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> once she entered active service in October 1899, the ship became the flagship of Prince Heinrich in the I Squadron of the German Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and Sweden–Norway. In 1901, {{the ship was}} severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to design changes in later German battleships {{to make them more}} resistant to underwater damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism also triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire.

The council continued for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> eventually moved to other cities; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis, a successful agreement remained beyond their reach. They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{the third}} studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever. It was {{released}} on 25 March 2004, by the small Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced {{the sound of their}} first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. The creative process for Invisible Circles took <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band {{to some of the most}} important European rock festivals and to Central and South America.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was elected}} to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college. He {{graduated}} in June 1873, receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty-six courses {{in a class of}} twenty-one students. As a result of his libel case, he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him. At that time, the only way to become a lawyer in Indiana was to apprentice under a member of the Indiana bar association. His great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to Columbia City, Indiana, to live with his parents. Marshall read law in the Columbia City law office of Walter Olds, a future member of the Indiana Supreme Court, for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> was admitted to the Indiana bar on April 26, 1875.|$|E

5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> who {{were in favor of}} peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, many Transnistrian civil servants, {{including}} the police, {{employees of the}} public prosecutor's, and employees of the court system remained loyal to the government in Chişinău.

25|$|Fuller {{was not an}} {{engineer}} and {{did not realize that}} the site was a poor choice for a large camp because of its wet, low–lying location. The camp lacked sewers for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> the prairie on which it was built could not absorb the waste from thousands of humans and horses. The camp flooded with each rainfall. In the winter, it was a sea of mud when the ground was not frozen. When the camp opened, only one water hydrant worked. There was a severe shortage of latrines and medical facilities {{from the time of the}} camp's initial use through the period of incarceration of the first group of Confederate prisoners in mid–1862.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, two reporters for the Niagara Falls Gazette, David Pollak and David Russell, tested several {{sump pumps}} near Love Canal and found toxic {{chemicals}} in them. The Gazette published reports, once in October 1976 {{and once in}} November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons. The matter went quiet for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> was resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early 1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was led by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department followed suit and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages.|$|E

25|$|The {{journals}} of the reigns of George IV and William IV, extending from 1817 to 1837, {{were published in}} obedience to his directions almost ten years after his death. Few publications have been received with greater interest by the public; five large editions were sold in little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made on {{the mind of a}} competent observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he associated. Greville did not stoop to collect or record private scandal. His object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes which led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind him a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century. Greville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the Past and Present Policy of England in Ireland, in which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.|$|E
25|$|The Jerusalem Development Authority {{administered}} the Jerusalem City Walls Conservation Project {{in cooperation with}} the Prime Minister's Office and the Israel Antiquities Authority beginning in 2007. Within the framework of the project, by the summer of 2011 half of the Old City walls had undergone cleaning and restoration treatment. Six months of restoration work performed at Zion Gate culminated in a moving rededication ceremony in July 2008 attended by veterans of the Palmach, 468 years after the gate had originally been built. Two months of restoration work performed at Jaffa Gate were completed in April 2010, and an official rededication ceremony was held to mark the occasion, 472 years after the gate was first dedicated. The restoration of Herod's Gate was completed in June 2010, whereupon a reinauguration ceremony was held attended by the Old City's Nawar mukhtar, Abed-Alhakim Mohammed Deeb Salim. The restoration work at Damascus Gate, lasting <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> completed in August 2011, involved the reconstruction of part of a crenellated turret damaged in the Six-Day War. The project, lasting a total of five years, was declared complete in September 2012 after restoration work performed at Lions' Gate – the seventh and last gate to be restored – was concluded.|$|E
25|$|T. Keith Glennan {{had been}} {{appointed}} the first Administrator of NASA, with Hugh L. Dryden (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at {{the creation of the}} agency on October 1, 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA's Space Task Group, and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program. Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a retrorocket system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and landing on water. To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built. In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the U.S. space program an overly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the Defense Production Act), which meant that Mercury had to wait in line behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, a little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half after Sputnik was launched.|$|E
