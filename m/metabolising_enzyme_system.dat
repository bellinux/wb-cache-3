The clinicians and pharma-cists are therefore faced with the challenge of prescribing drugs in combinations that are likely to result in severe adverse effects or compromising treatment success. The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop a simple stand alone or net-work based experimental computational tool to assist doctors and pharmacists in detecting drug combinations likely to re-sult in undesirable metabolism based drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and offer alternate safe prescription options. The mechanism of most drug-drug interactions is through inhibition and induction of drug metabolising enzymes. Models for the prediction of reversible and irreversible inhibitors of the major drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>system,</b> cytochrome P 450, were used in developing the pharmacoinformatic tool. These models enable the prediction of likely in vivo drug-drug in-teractions from in vitro data. In vivo drug-drug interaction data from the literature was also loaded into the software to validate the system and to give clinical guidance on specific drug-drug interactions.

The clinicians and pharmacists are therefore faced with the challenge of prescribing drugs in combinations that are likely to result in severe adverse effects or compromising treatment success. The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop a simple stand alone or network based experimental computational tool to assist doctors and pharmacists in detecting drug combinations likely to result in undesirable metabolism based drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and offer alternate safe prescription options.

The prototypic tool was based on a Standard Query Language (SQL) database with DELPHI 6. 0 as the user interface. Its user friendly pages lead the doctor or pharmacist through drug combination entry functions and gives warning if an interaction is likely. Subsequent actions enable the operator to retrieve more information on the mechanism of interactions, the quantitative measure of the interaction, access to published abstracts on studies, and possible prescription options to minimise DDIs. The software currently has data for 50 drugs used in the design and focuses on the treatment of tropical diseases in addition to classical cases of drug-drug interactions involving other general classes of drugs. The tool can be distributed on Compaq Disk (CD) and be run on any Personal Computer (PC) on windows. We have successfully developed a pharmacokinetic- based tool with a potential to assist clinicians and pharmacists in detecting and rationalizing DDIs. The tool has proved very useful as a teaching tool on DDIs by using the more advanced functions that explore the performance of current drug-drug interactions prediction models. From the available literature, it is clear that more studies need to be done to establish the prevalence and mechanisms of DDIs in the treatment of infectious diseases. We are now adding more data, validating the tool and finally testing the acceptability of this tool among clinicians and pharmacists for routine use...|$|E

40|$|A wide interindividual {{variability}} in survival after cancer treatment is observed. This {{is attributable to}} many factors, including tumour and patient related factors. Genetic polymorphisms in drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> and drug transporters {{may be one of}} these factors. Drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> are responsible for the activation, inactivation and detoxification of many chemotherapeutic agents. Deficiencies in these enzymes may result in altered exposure (both extracellular and intracellular) to the chemotherapeutic agents, thereby influencing the efficacy of treatment. Drug transporters are important in the uptake and excretion of chemotherapeutic agents. Polymorphisms in drug transporter genes may influence the bioavailability and disposition of these agents. Studies have shown that {{variability in}} survival can (partly) be explained by polymorphisms in genes encoding drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> and drug transporters. This review will discuss the role of genetic polymorphisms in drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> and drug transporters in relation to survival after cancer treatment. The most important polymorphisms shown to influence survival after cancer treatment are polymorphisms in the genes encoding the phase II detoxification enzymes glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). It appears that GSTM 1 null and GSTT 1 null have a clear association with longer overall survival in patients with different malignancies who are treated with substrates for these GSTs (mostly alkylating agents and platinum compounds).

Baseline frequencies of gene variants involved in alcohol metabolism need to be established to aid the identification of suitable population-specific polymorphisms to genotype during molecular autopsies. The principal alcohol <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> include alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) – rs 1229984 G>A and rs 2066702 C>T in ADH 1 B, rs 671 G>A in ALDH 2, and rs 3813867 G>C, rs 2031920 C>T and rs 6413432 T>A in CYP 2 E 1 – were genotyped in 150 individuals from four South African populations: Xhosa, Zulu, South African white and South African coloured.

40|$|Presented at the 8 th International Symposium on Microsomes and Drug Oxidations in June 1990 Introduction: Infection with S. mansoni {{has been}} shown to alter hepatic drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels in mice {{although}} we have shown that hepatic drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> of male hamsters are not significantly affected as a result of infection. Considerable specie and strain dependent variations do exist, however,' in the pathology of and immune response to S. mansoni infection in animals. It is not known if animals of the same specie but of different strains respond similarly to S. mansoni infection in terms of their hepatic drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes.</b> This study was therefore performed to assess the effect of S. mansoni infection on hepatic drug metabolism in vitro in male BALB/c and CBA/H mice. Results and Discussion: The results in Table 1 show that alterations in hepatic drug metabolism in vitro due to infection with S. mansoni vary between male BALB/c and CBA/H mice. Infected BALB/c and CBA/H mice both showed decreased concentrations of cytochromes P- 450 and b 5, and a decreased rate of ethoxyresorufin metabolism. Only infected BALB/c mice, however, showed decreases in their NADPHcytochrome c reduce activity and in the rate of ethoxycoumarin metabolism, and an increase in the rate of 4 -nitroanisole metabolism. While the microsomal uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase activities were decreased in infected BALB/c and CBA/H mice, the cytosolic glutathione-S-transferase activities were decreased only in BALB/c mice as a result of infection. The reasons for the strain dependent difference observed here is not known. It is possible that various factors released in the circulation of animals infected with S. mansoni, such as interferons, interleukin-l, histamines etc, affect the activities of hepatic drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Strain dependent alterations in microsomal drug metabolism have also been reported for animals pretreated with inducers of interferon synthesis. Interstrain differences among infected animals in the release of immune modulators such as those described above may be responsible for the varying effects on the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes and their isozymes. Conclusions: It is concluded that the disposition of xenobiotics in experimental S. mansoni infected mice will vary depending on the mouse strain being used. Choice of an animal model for studies on the effect of schistosomiasis on drug metabolism should therefore be made carefully especially if extrapolation to humans is intended.

40|$|Cruciferous {{vegetables}} and their bioactive constituents {{have been shown}} to inhibit chemically induced colon cancer (IARC, 2004). However, the results of epidemiological studies have been inconsistent (IARC, 2004). This may reflect a lack of sensitivity of such studies. One factor that is often overlooked by epidemiological studies is the effect of processing. Processing may alter the content of the bioactive compounds present in cruciferous vegetables or their bioavailability. Cruciferous vegetables contain numerous bioactive compounds, but their anticarcinogenic properties have been mainly attributed to their content of glucosinolates (GLS). The breakdown of GLS to their bioactive products is largely dependent on the plant enzyme myrosinase, whereas the profile of products formed, depends on the parent GLS, conditions of hydrolysis and the presence of a cofactor, epithiospecifier protein (ESP). Thermal processing may inactivate myrosinase and ESP thereby altering the location and extent of GLS breakdown within the GI tract and the profile of breakdown products formed. This may in turn, determine whether cruciferous vegetables exert beneficial or detrimental effects. A pig feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of blanch-freezing on the ability of broccoli (600 g/d; 12 d) to influence putative intermediary biomarkers of colon cancer, including DNA damage in colonocytes, the xenobiotic <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzyme</b> (XME) <b>system,</b> the colonic microflora and SCFA concentrations. The consumption of raw broccoli (cv. Marathon) caused a significant 27 % increase in DNA strand breakage (measured by the „comet assay‟) in colonocytes (P= 0. 025), whereas blanched-frozen broccoli had no significant effect. Both broccoli diets had no significant effect on XME or the concentration of SCFA, but they caused an increase in the ratio of lactobacilli to coliforms of borderline significance (P= 0. 065). A second trial was conducted to further investigate the effect of raw broccoli consumption. Pigs were fed a different cultivar of raw broccoli (cv. Monaco) or raw carrots (cv. Nairobi). Carrots were fed to explore whether a raw vegetable high in antioxidants but devoid of GLS would influence colonocyte DNA damage. Results were similar to the first experiment, raw broccoli caused a significant 54 % increase in DNA strand breakage (P< 0. 001), whereas raw carrots had no significant effect; both raw vegetables caused {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of lactobacilli to coliforms (P< 0. 001, broccoli; P= 0. 002, carrots), but had no effect on other measures. These studies appear to be the first to report that raw broccoli consumption causes an increase in DNA strand breakage in colonocytes. Collectively, they suggest that the consumption of high intakes of raw broccoli may not be advisable.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are {{essential}} extracellular matrix molecules which regulate tissue flexibility, a parameter that is reduced in airways {{of patients with}} asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). We investigated the expression of GAG and their <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> in primary human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) obtained from healthy donors (controls) and patients with asthma or COPD. Total GAG synthesis was assessed by [3 H]-glucosamine incorporation. GAG were isolated, purified, fractionated by electrophoresis and characterised using specific GAG-degrading enzymes. Secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA) by ASMC from patients with asthma or COPD was significantly decreased compared with controls. RT-PCR analysis and western blotting revealed that this decrease was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of HA synthase- 1 and- 2 and a significant increase of hyaluronidase- 1. Furthermore, the expression of the HA receptor CD 44 was significantly decreased, whereas the receptor for HA-mediated motility was not expressed in asthma or COPD. Our results indicate that there is a decreased expression of HA in asthma and COPD associated with a synergistic regulation of HA <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> that may regulate the pathological airway remodelling in these lung diseases...|$|R

The olfactory neuro-epithelium is highly sensitive to chemicals and its direct microbiological environment. It {{also plays a}} role as an interface between the airways and the nervous system, and so it has developed several defence instruments for rapid regeneration or for the detoxification of the immediate environment. This review illustrates three of these defence mechanisms: regeneration of the epithelium, local production of <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> and xenobiotic transporters. Toxicants can inflict damage by a direct toxic response. Alternatively, they may require metabolic activation to produce the proximate toxicant. In addition to detoxifying inhaled and systemically derived xenobiotics, the local olfactory metabolism may fulfil multiple functions such as the modification of inhaled odorant, the modulation of endogenous signalling molecules {{and the protection of}} other tissues such as the CNS and lungs from inhaled toxicants. Finally, the permeability of nasal and olfactory mucosa is an important efficacy parameter for some anti-allergic drugs delivered by intranasal administration or inhalation.

At {{the end of the}} experiment, effects of the ionophore on serum creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase and selected drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities were investigated. Furthermore, liver, heart and quadriceps femoris muscle samples were submitted to morphological investigations.

As far as rat study is concerned, these results confirm heart and muscle as target organs of monensin toxicity.

For example, androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, DU- 145 and PC- 3, are relatively {{insensitive to the}} anti-proliferative action of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3. This appears {{to be due to}} increased 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 -metabolism, as a result of CYP 24 enzyme-induction, which in turn leads to decreased anti-proliferative efficacy. In the in vitro rat kidney mitochondria assay, the 2 -(4 -hydroxybenzyl) - 6 -methoxy- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-naphthalen- 1 -one (4) was found to be a potent inhibitor of Vitamin D 3 <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes</b> (IC 50 3. 5 μM), and was shown to be a more potent inhibitor than the broad spectrum P 450 inhibitor ketoconazole (IC 50 20 μM).

A marked induction of glutathione S- transferase and quinone reductase activities in liver was evident, {{as well as}} of glucuronosyl transferase and epoxide hydrolase activities and expression, but only at higher doses. Lung enzymes were not altered by the same treatment. In precision-cut rat liver slices glucoraphasatin caused a marked increase in epoxide hydrolase activity. Addition of myrosinase to form the isothiocyanate led to a marked rise in glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase and epoxide hydrolase activities and expression. Incubation of precision-cut rat liver slices with intact glucosinolates (glucoerucin and glucoraphanin) enhanced the O-dealkylations of methoxy- and ethoxyresorufin and elevated CYPl apoprotein levels; similar effects were observed in lung slices. Both glucosinolates increased hepatic epoxide hydrolase, glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase activities. Studies on the temporal induction of carcinogen-metabolising <b>enzyme</b> <b>systems</b> by glucosinolates and isothiocyanates in precision-cut rat liver slices indicated that a six- hour tissue exposure was required for induction of all enzymes to be manifested. The potential of the naturally-occurring R-sulforaphane to up-regulate carcinogen- <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzyme</b> in precision-cut rat liver slices and FAO cells was compared to that of S-sulforaphane; R -sulforaphane was superior in modulating these <b>enzyme</b> <b>systems</b> in both systems. Using the CALUX assay it was established that phenethyl isothiocyanate, erucin and sulforaphane were poor ligands to the Ah receptor.

As a positive control for induction of hepatic xenobiotic metabolism, rats were also fed diets containing 1457 and 10, 155 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Treatment with TB and BHT resulted in dose-dependent increases in relative liver weight. TB {{was found to}} be a mixed inducer of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) forms in the CYP 1 A and CYP 2 B subfamilies. The administration of high doses of TB resulted in the induction of 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and 7 -pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase activities, CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 B 1 and CYP 2 B 1 / 2 mRNA levels and CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 B 1 / 2 apoprotein levels. In contrast, BHT was a CYP 2 B form inducer, increasing 7 -pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase activity, CYP 2 B 1 and CYP 2 B 1 / 2 mRNA levels and CYP 2 B 1 / 2 apoprotein levels. Both TB and BHT induced GSH S-transferase activities towards a range of substrates. In addition, TB and BHT markedly induced GSTP 1 mRNA levels, but had only a small effect on GSTT 1 mRNA levels.

40|$|Pharmacogenomics is a {{new field}} where testing an {{individual}} can define either a risk status for an adverse event, or the rate of metabolism of a drug. This is achieved by the categorisation of the enzyme activity or documenting genetic polymorphisms of a <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The best example of risk status assessment is the recent finding that HLA-B typing a person can predict whether they {{are at risk of}} a severe skin reaction from the drug abacavir. Those patients showing HLA-B* 5701, who are being considered for abacavir therapy, can be prevented from developing potentially toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome by avoiding abacavir. The evidence for HLA-B typing for allopurinol and carbamazepine has also been described. Most other pharmacogenomic tests are of drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which can either be assessed using “probe” drugs and measuring a ratio of parent drug to metabolite, or, by genetic testing for polymorphisms of the genes. In practice, testing is usually done by molecular testing, but this typically does not detect all polymorphisms. This article briefly reviews the evidence for the utilisation of pharmacogenomics for antidepressant drugs, tamoxifen, codeine, warfarin, azathioprine, clopidogrel, omeprazole, tacrolimus and irinotecan. There are few pharmacogenomics tests being carried out in practice, as {{there has not been a}} wide appreciation of their use, and only limited evidence exists for many individual drugs. It is expected that utilisation will increase as more evidence becomes available and there is a wider understanding of the existing evidence by the medical profession...|$|R
