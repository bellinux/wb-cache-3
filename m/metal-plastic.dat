40|$|In this thesis, {{detailed}} comparative {{investigations into}} the effect of different storage conditions and durations onto the stability and resistance of <b>metal-plastics</b> compounds derived from surface conditionings have been presented. Shear-off-techniques were utilized to test the firmness of the compounds. Clogged Wirobond ® C and Wiron ® NT metal plates of different sizes were employed as test specimen. The clogging was accomplished by Compolute ® or PANAVIA F ® adhesives. An intermediate silicate layer was spreaded using either the Rocatec technology or a blow torch (pyrolysis conditions). In order to scrutinize {{the effect of the}} oral environment on the compound firmness, samples were exposed to an artificial aging process. The quality of the fracture was determined by visual evaluation of the fractured surfaces, with the presence of plastics on the sheared surfaces being the decisive criterion. In the following, a summary {{of the results of the}} underlying studies is given. All compound combinations exhibited the required minimal firmness of 5 MPa according to the ISO supplement 10477. Compolute ® adhesive in combination with the Rocatec technology assured the highest values. However, pyrolytic conditionings gave varying results depending on the adhesive employed. Generally, Compolute ® was shown to afford higher firmness values than PANAVIA F ®. The lowest values were obtained for the alloy primer compound using PANAVIA F ®. Furthermore, it was unambiguously proven that the spreading of an additional silicate-based intermediate layer allows the preparation of a highly stable <b>metal-plastics</b> compound that exhibits excellent resistance to hydrolysis conditions. Upon artificial aging, the adhesive power of the investigated <b>metal-plastics</b> compounds decreased dramatically. Consistently, the fractured surfaces did not show any remaining plastics residues. The other fractures featured varying fracture qualities leaving behind crescent-shaped notches in the plastics surfaces. The deformation of the adhesive geometry prior to fracture might account for this observed demolition of the plastics. The application of pyrolytic conditioning with a modified blow torch constitutes a convenient means for the onsite manipulation by the dentist, since the observed adhesion values are coequal to those derived from coventional adhesion methodologies...|$|R

40|$|There {{are various}} {{opportunities}} {{to improve the}} adhesion between polymer and metal in <b>metal-plastic</b> composites. The addition of a bonding agent which reacts with both joining components at the interfaces of the composite can enhance the bonding strength. An alternative method for the adjustment of interfaces in <b>metal-plastic</b> composites is the specific surface structuring of the joining partners in order to exploit the mechanical interlock effect. In this study the potential of using an adhesion promoter based on twin polymerization for <b>metal-plastic</b> composites in combination with different methods of mechanical surface treatment is evaluated by using the tensile shear test.

The challenge of simulating a modified <b>metal-plastic</b> composite with different core materials in forming sim-ulations as well as acoustic simulations using standard FE material models is treated in this article. Therefore, a new <b>metal-plastic</b> composite with steel face sheets and a modified Polyamid 6 core was developed.

For the men-tioned simulations the raw materials and the produced composites were characterised using different testing methods. The forming behaviour of the <b>metal-plastic</b> composites was investigated by folding with different radii. For rating the formability of the different composites the springback and the interface integrity were analysed. A significant influence of the core thickness and the core stiffness could be shown. The results of the performed FE simulations predict the experimental punch force displacement curves and the springback behaviour. The acoustic behaviour of the composite was investigated for different configurations of the core material. A steel plate of the same size was investigated as a reference model.

40|$|The global trends towards {{improving}} {{fuel efficiency}} and reducing CO 2 emissions {{are the key}} drivers for lightweight solutions. In sheet metal processing, this {{can be achieved by}} the use of materials with a supreme strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratio. Besides monolithic materials such as high-strength or light metals, in particular <b>metal-plastic</b> composite sheets are able to provide outstanding mechanical properties. Thus, the adaption of conventional, well-established forming methods for the processing of hybrid sheet metals is a current challenge for the sheet metal working industry. In this work, the planning phase for a conventional sheet metal forming process is studied aiming at the forming of <b>metal-plastic</b> composite sheets. The single process steps like material characterization, FE analysis, tool design and development of robust process parameters are studied in detail and adapted to the specific properties of <b>metal-plastic</b> composites. In material characterization, the model of the hybrid laminate needs to represent not only the mechanical properties of the individual combined materials, but also needs to reflect the behaviour of the interface zone between them. Based on experience, there is a strong dependency on temperature as well as strain rate. While monolithic materials show a moderate anisotropic behaviour, loads on laminates in different directions generate different strain states and completely different failure modes. During the FE analysis, thermo-mechanic and thermo-dynamic effects influence the temperature distribution within tool and work pieces and subsequently the forming behaviour. During try out and production phase, those additional influencing factors are limiting the process window even more and therefore need to be considered for the design of a robust forming process.

40|$|Today {{products}} need to {{have high}} functionality but low manufacturing costs. Integration of different materials {{together to make a}} single final product is the demand at present. Hybrid technology is the answer for the queries and interests sighted above. Preparation of <b>metal-plastic</b> hybrids by insert injection moulding offers a manufacturing route for multi-functional components in a few processing steps. Nowadays, bonds between metal and plastic are basically established using mechanical methods. However, bonding by chemical method is needed but it is difficult because metals and plastics exhibit different physical and chemical characteristics. Hence coupling agents are used to improve bonding between metal and plastic. Silanes are the most commonly used coupling agents for <b>metal-plastic</b> bonding. The main objective of this thesis was to study the bonding characteristic between steel substrate and silane layer. Different parameters of the silane treatment process affect the structure, uniformity and thickness of silane layer present on the metal surface. Therefore, variations in parameters for silane treatment like pH and concentrations of the silane solution and rinsing methods for maintaining the thickness of silane layer on the metal substrate were tested. Planar and cross-sectional samples were prepared in order test the bonding characteristics. These samples were observed under optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Certain samples were observed in x-ray photoelectron spectrometer and the results were computed. In order to aid these kinds of tests in future a simulation program was designed using CASINO simulation software. The results obtained from scanning electron microscope were consistent with the earlier published results. Developing a method to observe cross-sectional samples in a scanning electron microscope was difficult because of instability of the silane layer and previously used sample preparation methods. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the results obtained using scanning electron microscope. Simulation of experimental conditions was helpful to determine the conditions to be used in experiments. /Kir 1...|$|E
