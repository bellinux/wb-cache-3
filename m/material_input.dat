50|$|There are {{two ways}} to reduce the {{material}} consumption per unit of service, the <b>material</b> <b>input</b> (MI) of the product can be reduced or amount of service units (S) can be increased. <b>Material</b> <b>input</b> in the production phase can be reduced by using less energy or raw materials. Also transport chains can be rationalized. In the use phase the <b>material</b> <b>input</b> per unit of service can be reduced when amount of service produced is increased. For instance in case of a newspaper the <b>material</b> <b>input</b> can be reduced by using recycled paper instead of primary. <b>Material</b> <b>input</b> per reader decreases when the same paper is shared with several persons. High quality products and availability of spares potentially increase the service life of the product. When the service life of a product is increased, the material consumption per unit of time decreases. Usually services like car sharing also help to reduce MIPS values since fewer products are needed to produce the service for greater number of people.|$|E

50|$|<b>Material</b> <b>input</b> {{per unit}} of service (MIPS) is an {{economic}} concept, originally developed at the Wuppertal Institute, Germany in the 1990s. The MIPS concept {{can be used to}} measure eco-efficiency of a product or service and applied in all scales from a single product to complex systems. The calculation takes into account materials required to produce a product or service. The total <b>material</b> <b>input</b> (MI) is divided by the number of service units (S). For example, in case of a passenger car, the number of service units is the total number of passenger kilometres during the whole life span of the vehicle. The lower the <b>material</b> <b>input</b> per kilometre, the more eco-efficient is the vehicle. The whole life-cycle of a product or service is measured when MIPS values are calculated. This allows comparisons of resource consumption of different solutions to produce the same service. When a single product is examined, the MIPS calculations reveal the magnitude of resource use along the life-cycle and help to focus efforts on the most significant phases to reduce environmental burden of the product.|$|E
