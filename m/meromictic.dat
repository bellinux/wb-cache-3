25|$|Mono Lake has {{experienced}} <b>meromictic</b> periods in the past; this most recent episode of meromixis, {{brought on by}} the end of the water diversions, commenced in 1994 and had ended by 2004.|$|E
25|$|Originally a land-locked {{fresh water}} lake, the Black Sea {{was flooded with}} salt water from the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene. The influx of salt water {{essentially}} smothered the fresh water below it because a lack of internal motion and mixing meant that no fresh oxygen reached the deep waters, creating a <b>meromictic</b> body of water. The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters, provides an excellent testing site for deep water archaeological survey.|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish Lake is {{stratified}} {{into two}} layers, an oxygenated upper layer (mixolimnion) {{and a lower}} anoxic layer (monimolimnion). The oxygen concentration in the lake declines from about 5 ppm at the surface to zero at 15 meters (at the chemocline). Stratification is persistent and seasonal mixing does not occur. The lake is one of about 200 saline <b>meromictic</b> lakes that {{have been identified in}} the world. However most of these lakes are of freshwater origin. Permanently stratified marine lakes are unusual, but on Eil Malk and on other nearby islands there are eleven other apparently permanent stratified marine lakes.|$|E
25|$|Located at {{the fringe}} of George Town, {{at the foot of}} Penang Hill are two {{adjacent}} green areas – the Penang Municipal Park (popularly known as Youth Park) and the Penang Botanic Gardens, the latter being the oldest botanical garden in Malaysia. Penang Hill, despite encroaching development, remains thickly forested and lush in vegetation. The Relau Metropolitan Park was opened in 2003. Robina Beach Park is a park by the beach near Butterworth.Gazetted in 2003, the Penang National Park (the country's smallest at 2,562 hectares) at the northwestern tip of Penang Island boasts of a lowland dipterocarp forest, mangroves, wetlands, a <b>meromictic</b> lake, mud flats, coral reefs and turtle nesting beaches in addition to a rich diversity of birdlife. In addition to this, there are nature preserves in Bukit Relau, Teluk Bahang, Bukit Penara, Bukit Mertajam, Bukit Panchor, and Sungai Tukun.|$|E

500|$|The lake {{is covered}} with ice for 10–11 months in a year. A tidal channel links the lake with Crooked Fjord only {{seasonally}} for about 6–7 months in the year. The tidal channel has a width of [...] and is about [...] deep. Lake Burton is the only <b>meromictic</b> lagoon {{that is part of}} the Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 143, within East Antarctica, and access to the lake can only legally be obtained by a special permit and adhering to some strict regulations.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} reasons this type of {{eruption}} is very rare. [...] First, {{there must be a}} source of the CO2, so regions with volcanic activity are most at risk. [...] Second, the vast majority of lakes are holomictic, meaning their layers mix regularly. [...] Only <b>meromictic</b> lakes do not mix and remain stratified, allowing CO2 to remain dissolved. [...] There is estimated to be only 1 <b>meromictic</b> lake for every 1000 holomictic lakes. Finally, a lake must be quite deep to have enough pressure to dissolve large volumes of CO2.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unintended}} consequence of ending the water diversions was {{the onset of}} a period of [...] "meromixis" [...] in Mono Lake. In the time prior to this, Mono Lake was typically [...] "monomictic"; which means that at least once each year the deeper waters and the shallower waters of the lake mixed thoroughly, thus bringing oxygen and other nutrients to the deep waters. In <b>meromictic</b> lakes, the deeper waters do not undergo this mixing; the deeper layers are more saline than the water near the surface, and are typically nearly devoid of oxygen. As a result, becoming <b>meromictic</b> greatly changes a lake's ecology.|$|E
2500|$|Based upon thermal stratification, lakes are {{classified}} as either holomictic lakes or <b>meromictic</b> lakes. A <b>meromictic</b> lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix. The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen. In addition, the [...] layers of sediment {{at the bottom of}} a <b>meromictic</b> lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, dimictic lakes, warm monomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion. As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system.|$|E
2500|$|The park is [...] in size, and logs about 80,000 {{visitors}} per year. It {{encompasses the}} cliff, plunge basin and gorge {{of the ancient}} waterfall, {{and a number of}} secondary ravines and basins. Glacier Lake, which occupies the plunge basin of the former waterfall, is [...] in size and [...] deep; it is a rare <b>meromictic</b> lake in which the deep waters don't mix annually with the surface waters. [...] The surrounding limestone cliffs are [...] high. Hiking trails skirt a half-ring of cliffs surrounding the lake, as well as traversing the rugged limestone over which the old river flowed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meromictic</b> lakes {{are poorly}} mixed and anoxic {{bodies of water}} with strong {{vertical}} stratification. While <b>meromictic</b> lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water {{with the potential for}} euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. <b>Meromictic</b> lakes are infamous for limnic eruptions. These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of <b>meromictic</b> lakes. This can result in the release of immense concentrations of stored toxic gasses from the anoxic bottom waters, such as CO2 and H2S, especially from euxinic <b>meromictic</b> lakes. In high enough concentration, these limnic explosions can be deadly to humans and animals, such as the Lake Nyos disaster in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|There are <b>meromictic</b> lakes {{all over}} the world. The {{distribution}} appears to be clustered, but {{this may be due}} to incomplete investigations. Depending on the exact definition of [...] "meromictic", the ratio between <b>meromictic</b> and holomictic lakes worldwide is around 1:1000.|$|E
50|$|Salsvatnet is a <b>meromictic</b> lake, {{meaning that}} the water is {{permanently}} stratified, often without oxygen in the lower depths (bottom water) due to density gradient {{and a lack of}} turnover. A <b>meromictic</b> lake often preserves records of the geologic past. The lower layer of the lake is highly saline and as a result denser than the higher levels of water. Other <b>meromictic</b> lakes in Norway with old seawater in the lower depths include Kilevann, Tronstadvann, Botnvatnet, Rørhopvatnet, and Rørholtfjorden.|$|E

50|$|The {{layers of}} {{sediment}} {{at the bottom}} of a <b>meromictic</b> lake remain relatively undisturbed because there is little physical mixing and few living organisms to agitate them. There is also little chemical decomposition. For this reason, cores of the sediment {{at the bottom of}} <b>meromictic</b> lakes are important in tracing past changes in climate at the lake, by examining trapped pollen grains and the types of sediments Proxy (climate).|$|E

50|$|Sunfish Lake is a small, 25 hectare <b>meromictic</b> lake located north-west of Waterloo, Ontario in {{the village}} of St. Agatha in {{northern}} Wilmot Township, and is the source of Laurel Creek. It is one of a few <b>meromictic</b> lakes in Ontario, that is, its deep bottom waters (21 metres or 70 feet) are totally devoid of oxygen. The surface and bottom layers do not mix, and the lake is vulnerable to environmental damage.|$|E
50|$|The most {{favorable}} lakes {{for the development}} of purple sulfur bacteria are <b>meromictic</b> (permanently stratified) lakes. <b>Meromictic</b> lakes stratify because they have denser (usually saline) water in the bottom and less dense (usually fresh water) nearer the surface. If sufficient sulfate is present to support sulfate reduction, the sulfide, produced in the sediments, diffuses upward into the anoxic bottom waters, where purple sulfur bacteria can form dense cell masses, called blooms, usually in association with green phototrophic bacteria.|$|E

50|$|While it {{is mainly}} lakes that are <b>meromictic,</b> the world's largest <b>meromictic</b> basin is the Black Sea. The deep waters below 50 metres (150 feet) do not {{mix with the}} upper layers that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water. The Caspian Sea is anoxic below 100 metres (300 feet). The Baltic Sea is {{persistently}} stratified, with dense, highly saline water comprising the bottom layer, and large areas of hypoxic sediments (see Baltic Sea hypoxia).|$|E
50|$|Lac Pavin is a <b>meromictic</b> {{crater lake}} {{located in the}} Puy-de-Dôme {{department}} of France, between Besse-en-Chandesse and Super-Besse. It gives its name to a cheese: Pavin cheese.|$|E
50|$|Green Lake is {{the larger}} of the two lakes in Green Lakes State Park, which lies about 9 mi east of {{downtown}} Syracuse in Onondaga County, New York. Round Lake is the smaller lake located west of Green Lake. Both lakes are <b>meromictic,</b> which means no seasonal mixing of surface and bottom waters occurs. <b>Meromictic</b> lakes are fairly rare; they have been extensively studied, in part because their sediments can preserve an historical record extending back thousands of years, and because of the euxinic (anoxic, sulfidic) conditions which can form in the deep water.|$|E
50|$|Lower Mystic Lake is a <b>meromictic</b> lake, {{which means}} that the lake has a deep layer of water that rarely, if ever, mixes with its top waters. As a consequence, the sediments at the bottom of Lower Mystic Lake {{accumulate}} in annual layers (or varves) that have been nearly undisturbed for a thousand years. Such varves in <b>meromictic</b> lakes preserve an historical record somewhat like tree rings do. In the case of Lower Mystic Lake, the varves have been used by Mark Besonen and his collaborators to study the historical incidence of hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all lakes undergo {{mixing of}} their deepest waters with their surface waters {{at least once}} a year. This mixing does not occur for Green Lake and Round Lake. They are rare, <b>meromictic</b> lakes. Waters deeper than about 55 feet (18 m) do not mix with the surface waters; as a consequence, they are {{essentially}} devoid of oxygen, and are rich in calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. The <b>meromictic</b> character of the lakes is due both to their relative depth compared to their area, and to the influx of mineral rich ground waters.|$|E
50|$|Lake Cadagno (Italian: Lago di Cadagno) is a <b>meromictic</b> {{lake in the}} Piora valley (canton of Ticino), Switzerland. As {{one of a few}} <b>meromictic</b> {{lakes in}} Europe, it is the object of {{numerous}} scientific studies. The Piora valley - located in the Gotthard massif (central Swiss Alps) in the Southern part of Switzerland near Airolo at an altitude of 2000 m above sea level - is a landlocked alpine valley whose scientific value has been recognized for more than two centuries. In the past, the lake was used as a reservoir.|$|E
