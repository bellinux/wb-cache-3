500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the {{character}} development and the storylines in Tron: Legacy. Writing for The New Yorker, Bruce Jones commented that the audience didn't connect {{with the character}}s, as they were lacking emotion and substance. [...] "Disney may {{be looking for a}} merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film," [...] remarked Jones, [...] "but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script." [...] Likewise, USA Today journalist Claudia Puig found Tron: Legacy to resonate with [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "unimaginative, even obfuscating" [...] dialogue, and that [...] "most of the story just doesn't scan". As Dana Stevens from Slate summed up, [...] "Tron: Legacy is the kind of sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to put <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. I confess I may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee." [...] Although he proclaimed the plot of Tron: Legacy and its predecessor to be spotty, Ian Buckwater of NPR was lenient of the latter film due to its youth-friendly nature. In contrast to negative responses, Michelle Alexander of Eclipse adored the plot of Tron: Legacy, a reaction that was paralleled by Rossiter Drake from 7x7, who wrote that it was [...] "buoyed" [...] by its [...] "sometimes convoluted, yet hard to resist" [...] story. Metros Larushka Ivan-Zadeh complained about the underdeveloped plot, saying [...] "In 2010, issues surrounding the immersive nature of gaming and all-consuming power of modern technology are more pertinent than ever, so it's frustrating the script does nothing with them." [...] However, she conceded that [...] "it's the best 3D flick since Avatar and a super-groovy soundtrack by Daft Punk nonetheless makes for an awesome watch".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, Warner Bros. {{chose to}} produce, seeing {{similarities}} in the concept with Batman Begins. Arthur Conan Doyle's estate had some involvement in sorting out legal issues, although the stories are {{in the public domain}} in the United States. Neil Marshall was set to direct, but Guy Ritchie signed on to direct in June 2008. When a child at boarding school, Ritchie and other pupils listened to the Holmes stories through dormitory loudspeakers. [...] "Holmes used to talk <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> every night when I was seven years old," [...] he said. Therefore, his image of Holmes differed from the films. He wanted to make his film more [...] "authentic" [...] to Doyle, explaining, [...] "There's quite a lot of intense action sequences in the stories, [...] sometimes that hasn't been reflected in the movies." [...] Holmes' [...] "brilliance will [...] into the action", and the film will show that his [...] "intellect was as much of a curse as it was a blessing". Ritchie sought to make Sherlock Holmes a [...] "very contemporary film as far as the tone and texture", because it has been [...] "a relatively long time since there's been a film version that people embraced".|$|E
