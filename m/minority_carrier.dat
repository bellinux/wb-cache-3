25|$|Exposure of the {{transistor}} to {{ionizing radiation}} causes radiation damage. Radiation causes {{a buildup of}} 'defects' in the base region that act as recombination centers. The resulting reduction in <b>minority</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetime causes gradual loss of gain of the transistor.|$|E
25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce <b>minority</b> <b>carrier</b> injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from <b>minority</b> <b>carrier</b> storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} {{explanation for}} collector current is {{the concentration of}} <b>minority</b> <b>carriers</b> in the base region. Due to low level injection (in which there are much fewer excess carriers than normal majority carriers) the ambipolar transport rates (in which the excess majority and <b>minority</b> <b>carriers</b> flow at the same rate) is in effect determined by the excess <b>minority</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R

2500|$|To {{minimize}} {{the percentage of}} carriers that recombine before reaching the collector–base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's <b>minority</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetime. In particular, {{the thickness of the}} base must be much less than the [...] of the electrons. The collector–base junction is reverse-biased, and so little electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons that diffuse through the base towards the collector are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region of the collector–base junction. The thin shared base and asymmetric collectoremitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two separate and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.|$|E
2500|$|Shockley, {{angered by}} not being {{included}} on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build {{a different sort of}} transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design {{would be more likely to}} be commercially viable. The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture. Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of <b>minority</b> <b>carrier</b> injection. On February 13, 1948 another team member, John N. Shive, built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. Shive's invention sparked Shockley's invention of the junction transistor. A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich' structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were [...] "mixture of cooperation and competition." [...] He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his [...] "hand was forced" [...] by Shive's 1948 advance. Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the [...] "sandwich" [...] transistor, and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7, 1949.|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been found that anti-Stokes photoluminescence {{can be observed in}} degenerately n-doped indium phosphide nanowires, when exciting directly into the electron gas. This anti-Stokes mechanism has not been observed before and allows the study of carrier relaxation and recombination using standard photoluminescence techniques. It is important to know if this anti-Stokes photoluminescence also occurs in bulk semiconductors as well as its relation to carrier recombination and relaxation. Here we show that similar anti-Stokes photoluminescence can indeed be observed in degenerately doped bulk indium phosphide and gallium arsenide and is caused by <b>minority</b> <b>carriers</b> scattering to high momenta by phonons.
