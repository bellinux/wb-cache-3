They were used for official notes about the Vindolanda camp business and personal affairs of the officers and households. The largest group is correspondence of Flavius Cerialis, prefect of the ninth cohort of Batavians {{and that of his}} wife, Sulpicia Lepidina. Some correspondence <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> civilian traders and contractors; for example Octavian, the writer of Tablet 343, is an entrepreneur dealing in wheat, hides and sinews, but this does not prove him to be a civilian.|$|E
5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> the sharp turn in the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of human skin into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking.|$|E
5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E

30|$|While the {{increase}} in part-time employment among older men in west Germany and older women in both regions <b>may</b> be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> restrictions on early retirement and the labor market reforms in the observation period, as described in Sect.  2, {{it is not clear}} why this apparently did not affect part-time employment of older men in east Germany. To some extent, this <b>may</b> be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the stronger increase in male full-time employment in east compared to west Germany.

25|$|A similar {{outbreak}} {{took place}} at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2005. The local epidemiology of C. difficile may offer clues on how its spread <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> the time a patient spends in hospital and/or a rehabilitation center. It also samples the ability of institutions to detect increased rates, and their capacity to respond with more aggressive hand-washing campaigns, quarantine methods, {{and the availability of}} yogurt containing live cultures to patients at risk for infection.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} led to {{the hypothesis}} that typical expectancy shifts were displayed more often by those who attributed their outcomes to ability, whereas those who displayed atypical expectancy {{were more likely to}} attribute their outcomes to chance. This was interpreted that people could be divided into those who attribute to ability (an internal cause) versus those who attribute to luck (an external cause). Bernard Weiner argued that rather than ability-versus-luck, locus <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> whether attributions are made to stable or unstable causes.|$|E

25|$|The {{carnitine}} {{content of}} seminal fluid {{is directly related}} to sperm count and motility, suggesting that the compound might be of value in treating male infertility. Several studies indicate that carnitine supplementation (2–3 grams/day for 3–4 months) may improve sperm quality, and one randomized, double-blind crossover trial found that 2 grams/day of carnitine taken for 2 months by 100 infertile men increased the concentration and both total and forward motility of their sperm. The reported benefits <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> increased mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation (providing more energy for sperm) and reduced cell death in the testes.|$|E
25|$|PAC use can be {{complicated}} by arrhythmias, infection, pulmonary artery rupture and {{damage to the}} right heart valve. Recent studies in patients with critical illnesses, sepsis, acute respiratory failure and heart failure suggest that use of the PAC does not improve patient outcomes. This clinical ineffectiveness <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> its poor accuracy and sensitivity, which have been demonstrated by comparison with flow probes across a sixfold range of Q values. Use of PAC is in decline as clinicians move to less invasive and more accurate technologies for monitoring hæmodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Lake Superior {{has fewer}} {{dissolved}} nutrients relative to its water volume {{than the other}} Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an oligotrophic lake. This {{is a result of}} the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed. However, nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century. They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health; but this steady, long-term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup. It <b>may</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle, but researchers are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake's ecology.|$|E
