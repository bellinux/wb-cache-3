5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> demineralization and thus <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|Cysts of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> adverse {{environmental}} factors than the vegetative cells; in particular, they are twice as resistant to UV light. They are also resistant to drying, ultrasound and gamma and solar irradiation, but not to heating.|$|E
5|$|Different AtPeps {{may allow}} A. thaliana to {{distinguish}} between different pathogens. When inoculated with a fungus, oomycete and a bacterium, the increases in AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen. A. thaliana overexpressing AtProPep1 was <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> the oomycete Phythium irregulare.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. Patterns of {{resistance}} to antimicrobial agents were studied in 193 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from hospital patients. Strains isolated from patients with malignant disease were significantly <b>more</b> often <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> sulphonamide, trimethoprim, gentamicin and methicillin than were strains from other sources. Susceptibility to various P-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides was investigated in members {{of the two most}} frequent species: Staphylo-coccus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. S. huemolyticus strains were not only <b>more</b> often <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> methicillin than S. epidermidis strains (respectively 8 1 % and 17 %) but they were <b>more</b> highly <b>resistant</b> (mean MICs respectively 85 and 19 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. haemoly-ticus strains were highly <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> nine other 8 -lactam antibiotics, whereas methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains showed both lower levels and a narrower spectrum of cross-resistance. Resistance to methicillin in members of both species was “heterogeneous”, i. e., only a minority of cells in a culture showed significant resistance. Almost all gentamicin-resistant strains were sensitive to netilmicin and amikacin; rifampicin, vancomycin and teicoplanin were also highly active in uitro...|$|R
5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> attack by carbonic acid {{and they can}} therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} Psilocybe semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. Other Psilocybe species known to produce sclerotia include Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe caerulescens. Sclerotia are also produced when the species is grown in culture.|$|E
5|$|Plants grown under UVB light are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> insect {{herbivory}} {{compared with}} plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants {{are exposed to}} a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E
5|$|The Spinks {{variety of}} avocado, Persea {{americana}} 'Spinks', {{was developed by}} William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a University of California at Berkeley and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> freezing than other avocados. They also {{proved to be the}} second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.|$|E
50|$|In some applications, {{for example}} {{prosthetic}} {{devices such as}} artificial joints, it is desired to have surfaces very <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> both chemical corrosion and wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As {{in the case of}} tool steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the surface to make it <b>more</b> chemically <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> corrosion.|$|R
25|$|Game Paks are {{far more}} durable than compact discs, the latter of which must be {{carefully}} used and stored in protective cases. It also prevents accidental scratches and subsequent read errors. While Game Paks are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> than CDs <b>to</b> physical damage, they are sometimes less <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> long-term environmental damage, particularly oxidation (although this can be simply cleaned off) or wear of their electrical contacts causing a blank or frozen screen, or static electricity.|$|R
50|$|Because relays {{are much}} <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> than {{semiconductors}} <b>to</b> nuclear radiation, they {{are widely used}} in safety-critical logic, such as the control panels of radioactive waste-handling machinery.

5|$|The bark {{of other}} {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> bacterial attack.|$|E
5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1671 a malaria {{epidemic}} broke out, leading to additional complications. The epidemic was devastating to numerous hajduk families, the natives being <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> malaria; thus, part of the settlers moved to Ližnjan and Premantura, while others left to return to Dalmatia. Pivljanin and Njegošević lived in Premantura. In 1673, Pivljanin and his followers included 34 households, 18 of which lived in towns; 8 in Premantura (Promontore), 8 in Mutvoran (Momorano) and one in Peroj (Peroi); his followers consisted {{of a total of}} 157 individuals, 89 adults and 68 minors, 75 males and 82 females.|$|E
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} <b>to</b> characterize metal <b>resistant</b> bacteria around a wastewater treatment plant. Sediment samples were collected from the Town Branch wastewater treatment plant near Lexington Kentucky, both where the effluent discharges and approximately 10 m upstream. Plate counts for heterotrophic bacteria <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> zinc, cobalt and cadmium were performed. Preliminary results suggest that there are <b>more</b> bacteria <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> zinc than either cadmium or cobalt at both sampling sites. However, no differences were found between sites. While requiring confirmation, the latter suggests that wastewater treatment plants may not be a source of heavy metal resistant bacteria...|$|R
30|$|Prescribed fire is {{a primary}} tool used to restore western forests {{following}} {{more than a century}} of fire exclusion, reducing fire hazard by removing dead and live fuels (small trees and shrubs). It is commonly assumed that the reduced forest density following prescribed fire also reduces competition for resources among the remaining trees, so that the remaining trees are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> (<b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> survive) in the face of additional stressors, such as drought. Yet this proposition remains largely untested, so that managers do not have the basic information to evaluate whether prescribed fire may help forests adapt to a future of more frequent and severe drought.|$|R
5000|$|The anterolateral {{papillary}} muscle more frequently receives two blood supplies: left anterior descending (LAD) artery {{and the left}} circumflex artery (LCX). It is therefore <b>more</b> frequently <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> coronary ischemia (insufficiency of oxygen-rich blood). On the other hand, the posteromedial {{papillary muscle}} is usually supplied only by the PDA. [...] This makes the posteromedial papillary muscle significantly more susceptible to ischemia. The clinical significance {{of this is that}} a myocardial infarction involving the PDA is more likely to cause mitral regurgitation.|$|R
5|$|Sea {{trials and}} {{modifications}} {{lasted more than}} a year, and once she entered active service in October 1899, the ship became the flagship of Prince Heinrich in the I Squadron of the German Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and Sweden–Norway. In 1901, the ship was severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to design changes in later German battleships to make them <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> underwater damage.|$|E

Black Down is a moorland area, with its steeper slopes covered in bracken (Pteridium) and its flatter summit in heather (Calluna) and grasses rather than the pasture which covers much of the plateau. The main body of the range is an extended plateau, 6–8km (4–5miles) wide and generally about 240metres (800ft) above sea level.|$|E
5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{affects the}} sea turtle's metabolic rate. Lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15°C (55 and 59°F). The loggerhead {{takes on a}} floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10°C. However, younger loggerheads are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E
