40|$|Let {{me begin}} with some {{practical}} examples of experience rating. a) Swiss Automobile Tariff 1963 — Within each tariff-position there are 22 grades: — The new owner of a car starts at grade 9 — The basic premium is determined {{on the basis of}} objective characteristics of the risk and essentially depends on the horse-power classification of the car — The 22 grades are experience-rated as follows: For each accident one rises three grades and for each accident-free year one falls one grade. A driver who has I accident in every 4 years hence remains within four adjacent grades. b) Sliding Scale Premiums in Reinsurance Excess of Loss Contracts often stipulate that: The rate of premium to be applied to the subject premium volume is determined {{at the end of the}} cover period as follows: subject to a minimum of 0, 04 and a maximum of 0, 08 c) Participation in <b>Mortality</b> <b>Profit</b> in Group Life Insurance A group life insurance covers the members of the group on a one year term basis. It is often agreed that at the end of the year mortality profits are given back to the group according to the formula refund = x% gross premiums — y% claims (where x < y) All these examples fall under the heading "Experience Rating”. What do they have in common? Definition: A system by which the premium of the individual risk depends upon the claims experience of this same individual ris...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} finding hedging strategies in an incomplete market. We study the Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition of a life insurer’s liabilities (involving stochastic <b>mortality</b> and financial <b>profit</b> sharing), splitting them into a component that can be hedged on the financial market and a component that cannot. Using Malliavin calculus tools, we obtain an explicit formula for each part, and therefore a complete probabilistic description of both components of the liabilities (the hedgeable and non-hedgeable). In addition to the optimal risk-minimizing “hedging" strategy, it allows to compute various business-related quantities, such as e. g. the risk margin (as defined in Solvency II) associated with the balance sheet. Two different models for the financial asset available for investment are considered. This paper {{addresses the}} problem of finding hedging strategies in an incomplete market.

40|$|Annuity {{insurers}} {{were making}} losses by underestimating mortality improvement. If the same projection fault occurs for term assurance policies, life insurers writing term assurance policies {{were likely to}} {{have benefited from the}} improving <b>mortality</b> and the <b>profit</b> could be significant in comparison with annuities. This dissertation uses quantitative research method by developing cash flows for term policies and using the moneys worth ratio and profit ratio to test the policys profitability. The result shows that life insurers writing term assurance policies have benefited from the improving mortality. In particular, term policy for older lives has shown significant profit. In addition, life insurers have benefited more from long term policies than short term, policies for elders benefited more than for the young, and policies for nonsmokers benefited more than for combined policies (nonsmokers and smokers) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the possible ecological and economic effects of sea lice from salmon farms on wild salmon populations and fisheries. A bioeconomic model is developed incorporating an age-structured population dynamics model of wild pink and chum salmon with mortality caused by farm-derived sea lice. Our model incorporates capture fisheries under two management policy scenarios. Results {{suggest that the}} ecological and economic effects are minor when the sea lice induced mortality rate is below 20 %, while they can be severe if the mortality is greater than 30 %. Sea lice have greater ecological and economic impacts on pink salmon than on chum salmon. The impact of farm lice epizootics on wild salmon is greater under a fixed exploitation rate than under a target escapement policy. As a result, a precautionary principle should be adopted, and appropriate management schemes and policy strategies should be developed to minimize these effects.

40|$|Mortality plays a {{major role}} in {{determining}} profitability of egg type layers, as it is a function of culled and dead birds. Negative association between <b>mortality</b> and net <b>profit</b> has been reported. Higher mortality and culling were reported to be due to severe outbreaks of infectious/non-infectious diseases, accidental deaths, substandard health and management practices and poor quality of chicks and feed. Newcastle (ND), Infectious bursal disease (IBD), yolk sac infections and coccidiosis were found to cause maximum mortality (over 30 %) in egg type layers. Infectious laryngotracheitis (IL) caused mortality within the range of 0. 81 - 20 % in layers. Cannibalism was also reported to be a major cause of death in egg type layers. A drop of 10 - 40 % in egg production was found with the incidence of infectious coryza, E. coli, mycoplasmosis, coccidiosis, egg prolapse and aflatoxicosis. Salmonellae were abundantly found in bedding material of chicken (42 %), drinkers (36 %), feed (28 %) and water tanks (17 %) of the poultry farm. Maintenance of a healthy environment in a poultry shed, protection of birds from extreme climatic conditions, maintenance of standard hygiene measures and antibiotic therapy, were reported as key factors in the reduction of losses due to diseases and mortality in egg type layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} find out the effect of different light intensities on the production performance of broiler chickens. One hundred and fifty broiler chickens were randomly divided into 15 equal experimental units. Three experimental units (replicates) were randomly assigned to each of the five experimental groups. Light treatment T 1 (20 lux at first week and 5 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group A, T 2 (20 lux at first week and 10 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group B, T 3 (20 lux at first week and 20 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group C, T 4 (20 lux at first week and 30 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group D, T 5 (20 lux at first week and 40 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group E. Results indicated a non-significant effect of light intensity on body weight and feed consumption whereas, feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by light intensities. The birds in group A showed significantly better FCR and fetched more <b>profit.</b> <b>Mortality</b> rate was the highest (13. 33 %) in the birds kept under group E. It can be concluded that energy savers (Compact florescent) may be used in broiler chickens production at same intensities as provided by other light sources for economical provision of light...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of 2, 146 feedlot cattle in 17 feedlot tests from 1988 to 1997 {{was conducted to}} determine the impact of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) on veterinary treatment costs, average daily gain, carcass traits, <b>mortality,</b> and net <b>profit.</b> Morbidity caused by BRD was 20. 6 %. The average cost to treat each case of BRD was $ 12. 39. Mortality rate of calves diagnosed and treated for BRD was 5. 9 % vs.. 35 % for those not diagnosed with BRD. Average daily gain differed between treated and non-treated steers during the first 28 days on feed but {{did not differ from}} 28 days to harvest. Net profit was $ 57. 48 lower for treated steers. Eighty-two percent of this difference was due to a combination of mortality and treatment costs. Eighteen percent of the net profit difference was due to improved performance and carcass value of the non-treated steers. Data from 496 steers and heifers in nine feedlot tests were used {{to determine the effects of}} age, weaning, and use of modified live virus or killed vaccines prior to the test to predict BRD. Younger calves, non-weaned calves, and calves vaccinated with killed vaccines prior to the test had higher BRD morbidity than those that were older, weaned, or vaccinated with modified live virus vaccines, respectively. Treatment regimes that precluded relapse resulting in re-treatment prevented reduced performance and loss of carcass value. Using modified live virus vaccines and weaning calves 30 days prior to shipment reduced the incidence of BRD...|$|R
