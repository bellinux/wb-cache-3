5|$|Timetoget started {{negotiations}} with the Swedish company BK Tåg to try to establish a cooperation that would allow Swedish engineers to be used. At the same time, the <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders,</b> who owned 11% of the company, demanded that they could take over NSB's shares without compensation, and that all debt to NSB be deleted. Arne Wam responded by stating that NSB wanted to liquidate the company. NSB therefore offered to purchase all shares in the company at par value, despite the company not having any net assets.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the company}} has expanded, opening new stores of its own and {{acquiring}} competitors. In 2010, Triumph International acquired Beldona, the leading Swiss distributor of lingerie, and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States. In the latter country, Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer Journelle and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Since then, company stocks have no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, {{and the company is}} wholly owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families.|$|E

On the other hand, owners who serve as managers {{will be more likely}} to pursue their own interests, possibly at the expense of the interests of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders.</b>|$|E

40|$|This case {{examines}} ethics {{issues related}} to the misrepresentation of facts in loan collateral certifications. These issues are faced by an employee and a <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder.</b> Both individuals are CPAs, and the <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> is also a CMA. The case provides a challenge for students because the <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> is not an employee, therefore some sections of the AICPA Code of Conduct do not apply. The case is based on the actual events within a small, closely-held manufacturing company. The case is applicable for either undergraduate or graduate accounting classes. 1 All names, dates, and identifying details have been disguised...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} explaining the emergence and viability of coalitions among shareholder activists. The formation of coalitions for purposes of shareholder activism is generally unexpected from a theoretical perspective. Potential shareholder activists typically rely on the exit mechanism rather than becoming {{actively involved in the}} governance of corporations, and they tend to be in a prisoner’s dilemma type of situation, which has a non-co-operative outcome. Moreover, unless co-operation can be expected from others, no individual shareholder will make costly contributions to a coalition. Still, <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalitions exist. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a model that accounts for the emergence and viability of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalitions. Two ideal-typical <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalitions are developed: the offensive <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalition, and the defensive <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalition. These are based primarily on contractual theory (transaction cost economics, agency theory and property rights theory) and take form under the assumption that economic ends alone motivate actors. The offensive <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalition emerges to seize an opportunity to increase share price by means of voice; it is led by a coalitional entrepreneur who carries all costs, thereby inducing co-operation from passive <b>shareholders.</b> The defensive <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalition emerges to safeguard the members’ investments from risks of expropriation, which arise from increasing costs of using the exit mechanism; it is characterised by widespread active participation, since free riding further increases the risk of being expropriated. The model integrates the ideal types with results from three case studies of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalitions. These case studies show that under certain conditions, coalition members act as if they consider the effects of their actions on their reputation within networks of shareholders; this has implications for a coalition’s emergence and viability. The case studies further show that controlling shareholders, under certain circumstances, will tend to act as if they consider the effects of their actions on their public image as perceived by relevant (present or future) stakeholders; this places a shareholder coalition in a different bargaining position...|$|R

25|$|The main Ultra Energy team {{immediately}} re-formed as Ballard Research, {{taking over}} offices {{directly across the}} street from the Ultra ones. Ballard started calling old contacts in the oil industry, looking for companies that might be interested in diversifying their energy holdings. Shell was interested and kept the company afloat for a time, but dropped their interest when one of the <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> held out. In mid-1981, Amoco decided to take over the rechargeable side of the company, and paid off most of the company's local debts. Now solvent, the company quickly started looking for applications for their technology, and won contracts with the Canadian Forces to further develop their single-use long-life battery. This led to a successful production line producing thousands of cells for the U.S. and Canadian militaries.|$|E
