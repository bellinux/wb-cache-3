500|$|Wondering {{why he has}} {{not seen}} any of his GE colleagues, Jack's office {{assistant}} Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film I Am Legend, [...] "You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!" [...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order {{to figure out what}} is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of [...] (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her [...] "future husband", Liz, who speaks in a Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with [...] "Cool Runnings, man! Bobsled!" [...] This is a reference to the comedy movie Cool Runnings (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team made their debut in the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song [...] "Fuck the Pain Away" [...] by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.|$|E
2500|$|We're staying put here, {{but we are}} pinned down. We can't move.(...) They {{must have}} 200 around us now. They've been {{throwing}} rifle grenades at us; I {{think there may be}} mortars, I don't know. They came along very quickly and very close, and then they retreated. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> waiting until the APCs [...] come along and they think they'll lose less casualties that way.|$|E
2500|$|The Vegas eRace {{was heavily}} {{promoted}} {{in the days}} before the event. The series's first champion Nelson Piquet Jr. (NextEV NIO) spoke of his excitement for the eRace and believed Formula E combining the worlds of simulation and real-life racing was a positive step: [...] "I think this is going to be really fun with all the drivers together." [...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t really know what to expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know. If all you do is race on simulators at home, then <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pretty good!” Hans-Jürgen Abt, the team principal of Audi Sport ABT, felt the Vegas eRace was [...] "a good example" [...] of how the series was moving farther than several other sporting championships: [...] "For more than six decades, we have been racing in motorsport on all of the world’s race tracks – but this event is a total first for us." ...|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} railway {{stations}} exist: abandoned and defunct. The latter still exist while {{the status of}} abandoned railway stations <b>is</b> uncertain. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> totally demolished, <b>maybe</b> not.|$|R
60|$|A few {{scattered}} {{schools of}} albacore {{appeared in the}} channel in July. But these were soon caught or chased away by the market boats. Albacore-fishing was poor in other localities {{up and down the}} coast. Many of the Jap fishermen sold their boats and sought other industry. It was a fact, and a great pleasure, that an angler could go out for tuna without encountering a single market boat on the sea. Maybe the albacore did not come this year; <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> mostly all caught; <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> growing shyer of boats; at any event, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> scarce, and the reason seems easy to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "This beats me!" [...] {{she said}} once, after an interval. [...] "Where are we, Nell? Those men up there are Mormons. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> abducting us!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, you'd better {{question}} the girl," [...] said the station-master carelessly. [...] "I dare say she'll {{be able to}} explain--she's got a tongue of her own, that's certain. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> out of boys of the brand you wanted." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{back of the}} box reads [...] "Perhaps it was a form {{of protest}} against bottled Ketchup, or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{provoked}} by acid rain." [...] However they came into awareness, tomatoes have become killers that cannot be destroyed by mankind's weapons. The tomatoes can only be trapped by building brick wall.|$|R
60|$|Hendricks slowed down. He {{lifted his}} fieldglasses {{and studied the}} ground ahead of him. Were they there, someplace, waiting for him? Watching him, the way his men had watched the Russian runner? A chill went up his back. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> getting their guns ready, {{preparing}} to fire, the way his men had prepared, made ready to kill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, stow it, Shadow!" [...] {{cried the}} senator's son. [...] "Let's get busy {{and try to}} find out what this means. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> back at the school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have read}} something, it is true; but I {{had thought it}} was a story. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> wronged and have no other way to help themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in real life," [...] said Cecily, [...] "but {{in stories}} it's {{just as easy}} to make them {{handsome}} as not. I like them best that way. I just love to read a story where the heroine is beautiful as a dream." ...|$|E
50|$|During surgery, Jenny's {{temperature}} breaks. House {{talks with}} Kelly, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Chase and they realize her temperature {{could have been}} gone since {{the day before and}} that she hasn't vomited since being admitted. House goes to the OR and turns off Jenny's pacemaker. Nothing happens. All that's left of her symptoms are her delusions. Kelly wonders if <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> prompted by the physical symptoms. House thinks it was just the opposite and orders several treatments.|$|R
5000|$|A {{first attempt}} at the series, in 1991, starred Lou Rawls in a never-aired pilot. [...] "ABC liked the idea but not the execution, I guess," [...] his successor, Hal Linden, said the {{following}} year. [...] ""So they hired a new producer, Scott Brazil, who rewrote it, recast it and got me on board." [...] Linden speculated that his casting came from the character being [...] "a former musician and bandleader performer, and so <b>am</b> I. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going on that." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, in Hip Hop, {{today the}} term break refers to any segment of music (usually four {{measures}} or less) {{that could be}} sampled and repeated. A break is any expanse of music that is {{thought of as a}} break by a producer. In the words of DJ Jazzy Jay, [...] "Maybe those records breaks are sampled were ahead of their time. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> made specifically for the rap era; these people didn't know what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> making at that time. They thought, 'Oh, we want to make a jazz record'".|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] I muttered back. [...] "Why {{should they}} be giving it to us? Besides, {{there is no room}} on the Snark for it. We could not eat a tithe of it. The rest would spoil. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{inviting}} us to the feast. At any rate, that they should give all that to us is impossible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. That is good. I need to work. We'll talk of it later. ... But {{just yet}} I can't {{tell you why}} I came to Kayenta, what I want to do, how long I shall stay. My {{thoughts}} put in words would seem so like dreams. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> dreams. Perhaps I'm only chasing a phantom--perhaps I'm only hunting the treasure {{at the foot of}} the rainbow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course all {{the other}} fish darted away in great fright, but Mr. Heron didn't mind. He settled himself in great contentment, for now he was less hungry. By and by some foolish tadpoles came wriggling along. 'I'll just try {{catching}} one of them for practice. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> good to eat,' thought Mr. Heron, and just as before darted his head and great bill downward and caught a tadpole.|$|E
6000|$|... "They sailed up the lake, so Jack Harper says. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> might <b>be</b> puttin' in {{the time}} around the islands. Sometimes these sportsmen don't care to come home at dark, but want the fun of camping out over night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly, {{although}} I {{might want}} to do that later on. But I was thinking that a good many of those workmen didn't seem to be satisfied with their job. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> only too glad to shift." ...|$|R

60|$|They {{have nothing}} to do with the play, but they come on {{immediately}} after anything very sad has happened and make love. This is why we watch sad scenes on the stage with such patience. We are not eager for them to be got over. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very uninteresting scenes, as well as sad ones, and they make us yawn; but we have no desire to see them hurried through. The longer they take the better pleased we are: we know that when they are finished the comic lovers will come on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, so many {{foolish and}} childish persons {{have gone to}} the other world. Death is not the {{beginning}} of wisdom. I am an old man, Serviss, and already many of my loved ones are dead. I should like to believe they are still sentient, and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> I am German. The blood of Kant is in my veins." [...] He seemed to be speaking partly to himself. [...] "I do not dogmatize so gladly as I once did. As I do not know the essence of matter, it would be folly for me to assume to fathom the depth of spirit. The essential hopelessness of science is coming to render me humble. Spiritualism certainly is a comfortable belief. I would gladly embrace it if I could. I suspend judgment. This desire for another life may be only a survival of a more unreasoning time, something we will outgrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are no {{chips on}} the table," [...] Sitka Charley explained. [...] "The men are playing with markers. That means {{the roof is}} the limit. One man play yellow markers--maybe one yellow marker worth one {{thousand}} dollars, maybe two thousand dollars. One man play red markers. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> worth five hundred dollars, maybe one thousand dollars. It {{is a very big}} game. Everybody play very high, up to the roof. How do I know? You make the dealer with blood little bit warm in face." [...] (I was delighted.) [...] "The lookout, you make him lean forward in his chair. Why he lean forward? Why his face very much quiet? Why his eyes very much bright? Why dealer warm with blood {{a little bit in the}} face? Why all men very quiet?--the man with yellow markers? the man with white markers? the man with red markers? Why nobody talk? Because very much money. Because last turn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worried to death, though they've {{kept secret}} about it.

It's {{peculiar}} stuff, that clay, for what they want it for, an' you don't find it everywhere. Them experts that reported on Chavon's pit made {{one hell of a}} mistake. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>was</b> lazy with their borin's. Anyway, they slipped up on the amount of clay <b>they</b> <b>was</b> in it. Now don't get to botherin'. It'd come out somehow. You can't do nothin'." ...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the facts}} {{mentioned}} in the comic are present and developed in the TV series first season. There are some details which are slightly different though. The comic {{it is supposed to}} be based on Mattel's Max Steel Sourcebook and since the creative control of the TV series changed three times due to the bankruptcy of the two initial animation studios, it is possible that few of the hints mentioned in the comic never had a chance to be developed in the series, or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> discarded in favor of further development of the characters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonder if {{they rode}} {{down to where}} we left the houseboat?" [...] he asked himself. [...] "She must be somewhere in this vicinity. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> have only <b>been</b> fooling us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are bad men," [...] she replied. [...] "Some of {{my people}} {{do not believe that}} there are such creatures. But we have a legend--a very old, old legend, that once the men from there came across to Grabritin. They came upon the water, and under the water, and even in the air. They came in great numbers, so that they rolled across the land like a great gray fog. They brought with them thunder and {{lightning}} and smoke that killed, and they fell upon us and slew our people by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands. But at last we drove them back to the water's edge, back into the sea, where many were drowned. Some escaped, and these our people followed--men, women, and even children, we followed them back. That is all. The legend says our people never returned. Maybe they were all killed. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> still there. But this, also, is in the legend, that as we drove the men back across the water they swore that they would return, and that when they left our shores they would leave no human being alive behind them. I was afraid that you were from there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The mystery is," [...] {{the elder}} continued, [...] "why they {{should want to}} do it in the way they do it. Are they merely going somewhere and must get there in the {{shortest}} time possible, or are they arriving on a wager? If they are taking a pleasure drive, what a droll idea of pleasure they must have! <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> trying to escape Black Care, but they must know he sits beside the chauffeur as he used to sit behind the horseman, and they know that he has a mortgage in his pocket, and can foreclose it any time on the house they have hypothecated to buy their car. Ah!" [...] The old man started forward with the involuntary impulse of rescue. But it was not one of the people who singly, or in terrorized groups, had been waiting at the roadside to find their way across; it was only a hapless squirrel of those which used to make their way safely among the hoofs and wheels of the kind old cabs and carriages, and it lay instantly crushed under the tire of a motor. [...] "He's done for, poor little wretch! They can't get used to the change. Some day a policeman will pick me up from under a second-hand motor. I wonder what the great Daniel from his pedestal up there would say if he came to judgment." ...|$|E
6000|$|However {{mean your}} life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it {{and call it}} hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is {{reflected}} from {{the windows of the}} almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not want society. If I were confined to a corner of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my thoughts about me. The philosopher said: [...] "From an army of three divisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought." [...] Do not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and meanness gather around us, [...] "and lo! creation widens to our view." [...] We are often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of Croesus, our aims must still be the same, and our means essentially the same. Moreover, if you are restricted in your range by poverty, if you cannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are but confined to the most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It is life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being a trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Either {{the natives}} have no fish to sell, or rather exchange," [...] the captain said, [...] "for, of course, money {{is of no}} use to them, or <b>they</b> <b>are</b> afraid of us. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> have <b>been</b> massacring some shipwrecked crew, and believe we are a ship-of-war come down to punish them. At any rate, they seem {{determined}} not to show." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paul McCartney {{remembers it}} differently: George Martin {{was used to}} drummers being very 'in time', because all the big-band session drummers he used had {{a great sense of}} time. Now, our Liverpool drummers had a sense of spirit, emotion, economy even, but not a deadly sense of time. This would bother {{producers}} making a record. George took us to one side and said, 'I'm really unhappy with the drummer. Would you consider changing him?' We said, 'No, we can't!' It was one of those terrible things you go through as kids. Can we betray him? No. But our career was on the line. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to cancel our contract… ...|$|R
