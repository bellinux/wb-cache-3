50|$|Peercoin's major {{distinguishing}} feature {{is that it}} uses a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work system. The proof-of-stake system was designed to address vulnerabilities that could occur in a pure proof-of-work system. With bitcoin, for example, {{there is a risk}} of attacks resulting from a monopoly on <b>mining</b> <b>share.</b> This is because rewards from mining are programmed to decline exponentially, which may decrease the incentive to mine. As miners decline, the likelihood of a monopoly increases, which leaves the network vulnerable to a 51% attack (a 51% attack is when a single entity possesses over half the <b>mining</b> <b>share,</b> which would allow this entity to theoretically double-spend a transaction involving their coins). With a proof-of-stake system, new coins are generated based on the holdings of individuals. In other words, someone holding 1% of the currency will generate 1% of all proof-of-stake coin blocks. This has the effect of making a monopoly more costly, and separates the risk of a monopoly from proof-of-work mining shares.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that asset returns are not normally distributed, especially during volatile economic circumstances {{such as those}} seen during the global financial crisis. Yet portfolio optimisation is often based on lower order moments of mean and standard deviation, which do {{not take into account}} the tail of a distribution. The mining industry can be extremely volatile during times of economic downturn. We compare extreme risk in <b>mining</b> <b>share</b> portfolios from each of the world’s seven leading mining areas using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) which measures those risks beyond traditional Value at Risk (VaR) metrics. We also show how CVaR, as opposed to traditional standard deviation measures, can be used to optimise mining portfolios and minimise extreme risk. We compare CVaR across two different periods and find that relative risk ranking between countries changes as volatility changes.

40|$|The {{informal}} sector in Zimbabwe {{is among the}} most buoyant sector yet contributes marginally to tax revenue collection. There are views that taxation evasion is huge due to lack of knowledge and information and heavy costs of compliances resulting from their varieties and sizes. There seems to be a consensus that African governments and their tax authorities have to put more effort to bring the {{informal sector}} into the tax bracket. The aim of the study is to identify the impact of informal sector growth on tax performance in Zimbabwe based on time series analysis of data from 1985 to 2013. The study also seeks to observe if informal sector growth increase tax revenue. Identifying the relationship between informal sector growth and tax performance will help out to improve the tax base hence economic development.. Econometrics views 7 (e-views 7) was used to estimate a log linear model for tax performance in Zimbabwe. The study established that although the informal sector growth has a positive coefficient its contribution to tax revenue is insignificant. moreover there are other variables which significantly contribute to tax revenue which includes share of <b>mining,</b> <b>share</b> of manufacturing and share of construction. The study recommends that Government should prioritise the formalisation of the informal sector. Therefore efforts needed by governments are to widen the tax base and will greatly increase revenue leading to a reduction in the reliance on donor funding and also on incidences where governments are forced to increase taxes on basic commodities. Informal sector has a significant employment, income generation potential and stimulation of social economic growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{power of}} computer technology does not dispense {{with the need to}} extract meaningful in- formation out of data sets of ever growing size, and indeed typically exacerbates the complexity of this task. To tackle this general problem, two methods have emerged, at chronologically different times, that are now commonly used in the scientific community: data mining and complex network theory. Not only do complex network analysis and data <b>mining</b> <b>share</b> the same general goal, that of extracting information from complex systems to ultimately create a new compact quantifiable representation, but they also often address similar problems too. In the face of that, a surprisingly low number of researchers turn out to resort to both methodologies. One may then be tempted to conclude that these two fields are either largely redundant or totally antithetic. The starting point of this review is that this state of affairs should be put down to contingent rather than conceptual differences, and that these two fields can in fact advantageously be used in a synergistic manner. An overview of both fields is first provided, some fundamental concepts of which are illustrated. A variety of contexts in which complex network theory and data mining have been used in a synergistic manner are then presented. Contexts in which the appropriate integration of complex network metrics can lead to improved classification rates with respect to classical data mining algorithms and, conversely, contexts in which data mining can be used to tackle important issues in complex network theory applications are illustrated. Finally, ways to achieve a tighter integration between complex networks and data mining, and open lines of research are discussed. Comment: 58 pages, 19 figure...|$|E

40|$|Throughout history, {{capital markets}} have {{been central to}} {{innovation}} {{and the development of}} new industries, job creation, low unemployment, wealth accumulation, reducing income inequality, improving living standards, and promoting economic growth. In perfect capital markets, firms can easily raise funds for profitable investments. However, market frictions, such as agency costs, liquidity constraints, and asymmetric information, can lead to underinvestment. In this dissertation, I study the financing decisions of firms in a young industry in an environment where securing capital was difficult. Following the 1859 discovery of gold and silver in Nevada, mine owners incorporated in San Francisco and issued stock. Interestingly, firms had the right to levy assessments on their shareholders. An assessment is a request for additional capital and failure to pay resulted in the loss of shares. Firms relied heavily on assessments to finance their operations. I claim that assessments were more than a peculiar feature of stock ownership; the method of financing addressed particular challenges, making it easier to secure capital. To evaluate my claim, I construct a dataset of assessments levied, daily stock prices, and other relevant data. I use regression analysis and narrative evidence from a credible local newspaper to determine which variables influenced levies and how assessments addressed financing frictions. Collecting capital over several periods and limiting the loss to share ownership helped in reducing the agency costs of free cash and making mining securities attractive investments. For investors of the San Francisco <b>mining</b> <b>share</b> market, private information and assessments may also affect stock ownership. Because firms voluntarily provided reports to local newspapers, some investors may have information on the prospects of the mine prior to publication. An investor's willingness to pay assessments may also influence the timing of purchase or sale. I use stock transfer data from a major mining company to measure the effect that assessments and private information had on the propensity to sell. Share ownership was geographically diverse, the propensity to sell varied across investors, and {{there is some evidence that}} the timing of sales by investors from the Bank of California may be driven by private information. In addition, I examine whether the market predicted reasonable returns in a setting where active trading in mining securities was fairly new and investors are more likely to speculate. One interesting feature of the firms in my sample is that they owned adjacent mining claims along the vein of the Comstock. I consider the effect of reported strikes on the stock price of firms with adjacent and non-adjacent mines. The results suggest that, on average, the market predicted returns consistent with rational behavior...|$|E
