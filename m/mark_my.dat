500|$|Chotiner {{had worked}} on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular {{governor}} {{did not want to}} be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I <b>mark</b> <b>my</b> ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|E
500|$|Several {{authors and}} artists have {{depicted}} {{the event in}} their respective works. African-American novelist James Baldwin wrote of the riot, which occurred {{on the same day}} as his father's funeral and his nineteenth birthday, in Notes of a Native Son. [...] "It seemed to me", Baldwin wrote, [...] "that God himself had devised, to <b>mark</b> <b>my</b> father's end, the most sustained and brutally dissonant of codas". In a commentary piece for The New York Times, Langston Hughes called the chapter [...] "superb", and particularly quoted Baldwin's observation that [...] "to smash something is the ghetto's chronic need". Hughes wrote [...] "The Ballad of Margie Polite", a poem on the riot published in New York Amsterdam News. According to Laurie Leach in her 2007 article published in Studies in the Literary Imagination, the poem [...] "seems to honor rather than censure Polite for her role as a catalyst" [...] Ralph Ellison drew upon his experiences covering the riot for the New York Post as inspiration for the [...] "theatrical climax" [...] of Invisible Man, winner of the 1953 National Book Award.|$|E

500|$|Among {{contemporary}} reviews, Time magazine declared [...] "Something" [...] to be {{the best}} track on Abbey Road, while John Mendelsohn wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his 'Something,' some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it." [...] Writing in Saturday Review magazine, Ellen Sander described [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "certainly {{one of the most beautiful}} songs George Harrison has ever written" [...] and added: [...] "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood." [...] In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as [...] "a real quality hunk of pop" [...] with a [...] "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison [...] "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of [...] "Something": [...] "It's a song that grows on you, and <b>mark</b> <b>my</b> words, it will – in a big way!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Life of William Marshal, {{which dates}} to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, {{one of the}} richest and most {{influential}} barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the Life has Walter say in reply [...] " [...] 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but <b>mark</b> <b>my</b> words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" [...] This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of John, says of Walter that [...] "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems." ...|$|E

500|$|During 1897, Dunne {{sometimes}} set {{his sights}} overseas, discussing Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Dooley noted that while the sun never set on her domains, the original owners did not get to [...] "set" [...] there either, [...] "bein' kept movin' be the polis [...] ". Late that year, Dunne moved to the Chicago Journal as managing editor and Mr. Dooley began to comment at his new venue in early 1898. Dunne had been limited at his old position by Kohlsaat's insistence that his papers support President McKinley's efforts to settle differences with Spain over Cuba short of war. [...] At the Journal, where the journalism was yellow and shrill appeals for war the norm, Dunne labored under no such inhibitions. He had always turned away praise of the Dooley pieces from those aware of his authorship, wishing {{to be known as}} a serious writer. Because of the dialect, the Dooley columns were more difficult for him than writing editorials and columns in plain English. He had ended his last Dooley piece at the Post with the barkeeper bidding farewell, locking the saloon door (as Dunne put it) [...] "perhaps for the last time", possibly meaning that Dooley was done. Dooley had been depicted as in favor of war against Spain in the Post, and Dunne favored military intervention to free Cuba. [...] On February 19, 1898, four days after the USS Maine sank in Havana harbor, Dunne restored Dooley to his arsenal against the Spanish. [...] Fanning wrote of Mr. Dooley's subsequent howls for war: [...] "bandoning his usual stance as a cool and neutral ironist, Mr. Dooley becomes one more loud, irrational voice expressing cruelly simplified hatred of Spain and anger at President McKinley. These new pieces mark the low point in the Dooley canon, for in them Dunne shatters the persona that he has built up s had moderated his position, even if the Journal had not. [...] On April 16, Dunne had Dooley paint a mocking portrait of Fitzhugh Lee, the U.S. consul in Havana whose belligerent reports were fueling the drive to war, in a column printed while the Journal editorial page was praising Lee. But the real breakthrough was after the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1. That a battle had taken place was known, but as the American commander, Admiral George Dewey, was believed to have severed the cable lines, no word came to the United States, and the nation waited in suspense, fearing defeat. [...] Then, news that Dewey had destroyed the dilapidated Spanish fleet arrived, but the details, and the fate of Dewey and his ships and men, were unknown. Before word came from Dewey that he had not lost a ship or man appeared the May 7 Mr. Dooley piece, [...] "On His Cousin George", that is the admiral, for [...] "Dewey or Dooley, 'tis all th' same". Dooley predicted that [...] "he'll write home and say he's got the islands; and he'll turn them over to the government and go back to his ship, and Mark Hanna'll organize the Philippine Islands Jute and Cider Company, and the revolutionists'll wish they hadn't. That's what'll happen. <b>Mark</b> <b>my</b> word." ...|$|E

[...] Murfreesboro's mayor, Ernest Burgess, called Robertson's claims [...] "so ridiculous they do not deserve a response." [...] Opposition was also fanned by a local newspaper, the ultra-conservative Rutherford Reader, which published numerous anti-Islamic articles. After protests from readers over these, some of its advertisers boycotted the newspaper. As the barrage of criticism from right-wingers continued, the ICM received a series of threatening and offensive anonymous telephone messages.|$|E

[...] On the trip to Detroit following spring training, the Tigers played an exhibition game in Cincinnati. [...] Coffman combined with All-Stars Schoolboy Rowe and Tommy Bridges for a shutout. [...] Despite his performance against Cincinnati, Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane told him after the game, [...] "We are sending you to Toledo." [...] After unsuccessfully arguing that he had earned a spot on the Tigers' roster, Coffman told Cochrane, [...] "I'll go to Toledo, but <b>mark</b> <b>my</b> word, I'll be back up in less than 30 days."

2500|$|The {{shield of}} Pius X's {{coat of arms}} is charged in two basic parts, as it is per fess. In chief (the top part of the shield) shows {{the arms of the}} Patriarch of Venice, which Pius X was from 1893 to 1903. It {{consists}} of the Lion of Saint Mark proper and haloed in silver upon a silver-white background, displaying a book with the inscription of PAX TIBI MARCE on the left page and EVANGELISTA MEUS on the right page. Pax tibi Marce Evangelista Meus is the motto of Venice and is Latin for Peace to you, <b>Mark,</b> <b>my</b> evangelist. This motto refers to Venice as the final resting place of Saint Mark. This differed from the arms of the Republic of Venice by changing the background color from red to silver even though that did not conform to heraldic rules. [...] Previous Patriarchs of Venice had combined their personal arms with these arms of the Patriarchate. [...] The same chief {{can be seen in the}} arms of the later popes who were Patriarchs of Venice upon election to the See of Rome, John XXIII and John Paul I. Renditions of this part of Pius X's arms depict the lion either with or without a sword, and sometimes only one side of the book is written on.|$|E
2500|$|On Piazza Umberto I (or Piazza Jaringhi) is the Chiesa di San Marco Evangelista [...] (Church of St. Mark the Evangelist). Originally this chapel {{or small}} church {{was known as}} the chapel of the Madonna dei Sette Dolori (Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows). It served as the family chapel of the {{powerful}} Rossi family, one branch of which occupied the adjacent palace, the Palazzo Pitassi-Rossi. This chapel also used to be the home of a rare 14th-century painted wooden statue of the Madonna and Child that belonged to the Pitassi-Rossi Family. Since 1924, this statue has been {{in the collection of the}} Palazzo Venezia in Rome. With the destruction of the original 16th Church of San Marco in the early 20th century, the chapel was expanded, rededicated, and now serves as the seat of the Confraternita' della Santa Croce. The 1930s era facade of sculpted stone consists of a miniature rose window, a portal crowned by the Rossi coat-of-arms and a mosaic of St. Mark's Lion with the words Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus (Peace be to you <b>Mark</b> <b>my</b> Evangelist). The church also contains the processional half-bust statue of San Marco Evangelista used on April 25 each year, and an 18th-century painting of the Madonna dei Sette Dolori in which the Rossi family coat-of-arms is depicted.|$|E
