40|$|Organosulfates are {{important}} organosulfur compounds present in atmospheric particles. While the abundance, composition, and formation mechanisms of organosulfates have been extensively investigated, {{it remains unclear}} how they transform and evolve throughout their atmospheric lifetime. To acquire a fundamental understanding of how organosulfates chemically transform in the atmosphere, this work investigates the heterogeneous OH radical-initiated oxidation of sodium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (CH 3 SO 4 Na) droplets, the smallest organosulfate detected in atmospheric particles, using an aerosol flow tube reactor at a high relative humidity of 85  %. Aerosol mass spectra measured by a soft atmospheric pressure ionization source (Direct Analysis in Real Time, DART) coupled with a high-resolution mass spectrometer showed that neither functionalization nor fragmentation products are detected. Instead, the ion signal intensity of the bisulfate ion (HSO 4 −) {{has been found to}} increase significantly after OH oxidation. We postulate that sodium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> tends to fragment into a formaldehyde (CH 2 O) and a sulfate radical anion (SO 4 •−) upon OH oxidation. The formaldehyde is likely partitioned back to the gas phase due to its high volatility. The sulfate radical anion, similar to OH radical, can abstract a hydrogen atom from neighboring sodium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> to form the bisulfate ion, contributing to the secondary chemistry. Kinetic measurements show that the heterogeneous OH reaction rate constant, k, is (3. 79  ±  0. 19)  ×  10 − 13  cm 3 molecule − 1  s − 1 with an effective OH uptake coefficient, γ eff, of 0. 17  ±  0. 03. While about 40  % of sodium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> is being oxidized at the maximum OH exposure (1. 27  ×  10 12 molecule cm − 3  s), only a 3  % decrease in particle diameter is observed. This can be attributed to a small fraction of particle mass lost via the formation and volatilization of formaldehyde. Overall, we firstly demonstrate that the heterogeneous OH oxidation of an organosulfate can lead to the formation of sulfate radical anion and produce inorganic sulfate. Fragmentation processes and sulfate radical anion chemistry {{play a key role in}} determining the compositional evolution of sodium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> during heterogeneous OH oxidation...|$|R

These reactions of <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> which are much more rapid than its hydrolysis, are insensitive {{to the nature of}} the attacking nucleophile, with a Brønsted βnuc value of − 0. 01. Experiments at elevated temperatures indicate a rate constant of 2 × 10 − 11 s− 1 for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> at 25 °C (t 1 / 2 = 1, 100 y), corresponding to a rate enhancement of ≈ 1011 -fold by a human alkylsulfatase.

The magnitude of that value, involving release of the strong acid HSO 4 −, helps to explain the need for harnessing the free energy of hydrolysis of two ATP molecules in activating sulfate for the biosynthesis of sulfate monoesters. The “energy-rich” nature of monoalkyl sulfate esters, coupled with their marked resistance to hydrolysis, renders them capable of acting as sulfating or alkylating agents under relatively mild conditions.

40|$|Rationale: Fruit and {{vegetables}} are claimed to have beneficial effect on human health mostly due to their high polyphenol (PP) content. (1) Regular consumption is protective against age related diseases and different forms of cancer (2). As PP are largely metabolized both by the human organism and gut microbiota, identification of the forms of metabolites and the kinetics of their appearance into the circulation is essential for understanding their possible bioactivity in humans. Methods: In order to evaluate absorption and transformation of apple polyphenols, a human single-dose crossover controlled blind experiment was designed. In 2 different sessions 12 subjects were supplemented with apple juice (1 g/l total PF) or polyphenol enriched apple juice (4 g/l total PF). Urine and plasma samples were collected at different time points and analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Results: Scarcely metabolized polyphenols were recognized as potential biomarkers. These compounds showed two different kinetic patterns. Epicatechin <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> ferulic acid sulfate and phloretin glucuronide reached their maximal concentration 1 hour after apple juice supplementation. While, the <b>methyl,</b> <b>sulfate</b> and glucuronide conjugates of valerolactons had their peak concentration 5 hours after the supplementation.

Conclusion: Untargeted metabolomics allowed identification of biomarkers of apple consumption and demonstrated that an increase in polyphenol intake corresponds to an increase of circulating metabolites within the limits of ‘normal’ consumption. Thus, if the beneficial effects of these compounds are confirmed, it might prove beneficial to increase their plasma concentration by increasing their intake or choosing polyphenols richer food...|$|R

Organosulfates have, however, proved analytically challenging to quantify, due to lack of authentic standards and the complex sample matrix in which organosulfates are observed. This study presents a sensitive and accurate new analytical method for the quantification of organosulfates based upon ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) with the aid of synthesized organosulfate standards. The separation is based upon hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with an amide stationary phase that provides excellent retention of carboxy-organosulfates and isoprene-derived organosulfates. The method is validated using six model compounds: <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> ethyl sulfate, benzyl sulfate, hydroxyacetone sulfate, lactic acid sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate.

Spike recoveries averaged 98 ± 8 % for extraction by ultra-sonication and 98 ± 10 % for extraction by rotary shaking.

A major focus was the relationship between the choice of the anion and the effectiveness of the treatment. The synthesis of a range of 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ionic liquids with strongly hydrogen-bond basic anions was accomplished. Selected, process-relevant physicochemical properties were measured, such as the Kamlet-Taft solvent polarity, hygroscopicity and thermal stability. It was shown that 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate is not stable at 120 °C, while other ionic liquids e. g. 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate exhibit very good long-term thermal stability. It was shown that hydrogen-bond basic 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ionic liquids attract more than stoichiometric quantities of water when exposed to air, suggesting that ionic liquid pretreatment under anhydrous conditions is difficult to achieve. Dissolution of air-dried wood chips in 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ionic liquids was attempted. It was shown that the large particle size and the moisture contained in the biomass hamper complete dissolution. The hydrogen-bond basicity of the ionic liquid, described by the Kamlet-Taft parameter ß, was correlated with the ability to expand as well as partially and anisotropically dissolve wood chips.

For this purpose, we have used the ammonium and imidazolium families of ILs, such as diethylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (DEAP), tributylammonium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (TBMS), triethylammonium 4 -aminotoluene- 3 -sulfonic acid (TASA), and 1 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Mim]Cl). To investigate the molecular interaction between azopolymer and ILs, we have used the following spectroscopic methods of analysis: UV-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and confocal Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we have developed new photosensitive materials by combining polymer with ILs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{behavior}} of atmospheric aerosols, particulate matter {{suspended in the}} atmosphere, is also related to climate change. Heather Allen {{is part of a}} national multidisciplinary group of researchers involved in the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (CAICE) who study the effects of atmospheric aerosols. [...] Allen studies the surfaces of cloud systems and their electric fields, to better understand thunderstorms, lightning strikes and the effects of microdroplets on clouds and fogs. With Lisa Van Loon, she has examined the {{behavior of}} sulfuric acid and methanol, found as aerosols in the upper atmosphere. Together they can form <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> a compound that attracts water droplets and supports cloud formation. While sulfuric acid can reflect light and heat, clouds tend to trap light and heat in the atmosphere. The interplay between sulfuric acid and atmospheric temperature change is therefore more complex than originally thought.|$|R

Lipid peroxidation of liver and brain mitochondria was induced by Fe 2 +–Vit C in vitro. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) colorimetry {{was used to measure}} the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Mouse liver mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) was induced by calcium overload in vitro and spectrophotometry was used to measure it. The scavenging activities of APS on superoxide anion (O 2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH), which were produced by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) —N-Methylphenazonium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (PMS) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) –Fe 2 + system respectively, were measured by 4 -nitrobluetetrazolium chloride (NBT) reduction and Fenton reaction colorimetry respectively. The Na 2 S 2 O 3 titration method was used to measure the scavenging activities of APS on H 2 O 2. APS could inhibit TBAR...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ammonium salt, [2 -(methacyloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (MAOTMA), {{was adopted}} to modify {{montmorillonite}} (MMT) via the cationic exchange process in an acidic environment and a success-ful enlargement of MMT lamellar spacing from 1. 18 to 1. 39 nm was identified by x-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Accordingly, UV-curable epoxy nanocomposite resins containing various amounts of MAOTMA-modified MMT were prepared {{with the aid}} of a planetary mechanical milling process. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a uniform dispersion of exfo-liated MMT lamella in epoxy matrix, leading to the dis-tinct improvements on thermal stability and thermal expansion property of nanocomposite samples. Calcium (Ca) test indicated that the good dispersion of MMT fillers in polymer effectively suppresses the moisture permeation in sample matrix. More than twofold increment on reten-tion time of 5 % Ca hydrolysis and 20 % improvement on the permeation kinetic parameters were observed in the nanocomposite sample containing 8 wt % MMT in com-parison with the pristine epoxy sample.
