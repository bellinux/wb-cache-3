40|$|International audienceIdentification of {{electrical}} appliance usage(s) from the <b>meter</b> <b>panel</b> power reading {{has become an}} area of study on its own. Many approaches {{over the years have}} used signal processing approaches at a high sampling rate (1 second typically) to evaluate the appliance load signature and subsequently used pattern recognition techniques for identification from a previously trained classifier(s). The proposed approach tries to identify the usage of high power consuming appliance(s) by using the aggregate power consumption at 10 minutes interval from the <b>meter</b> <b>panel.</b> The novelty of the approach lies in using a time series windowing approach which gives addition information about an aggregate power state. The usage of hour of the day as input to the systems also takes into account the temporal behavior of residential users. The usage of Multi-label classification approach for identification is also new for this domain. The model is tested over the IRISE data set and the results are encouraging. Due to its low sampling rate with time stamped aggregate power at 10 minutes scale as the only input from the user, the proposed approach is both practical and affordable...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Constrained with {{structures}} of the <b>meter</b> <b>panels,</b> the automatic measurements {{are required to take}} different ways. In this paper, a new approach to the automatic measurement of voltmeter with a cylindrical panel and nonlinear scale is presented. Firstly, one real-time image captured by a camera is processed to locate the region of the pointer and the scales. Secondly, according to the shape features of the dial, a 5 × 1 filter is adopted to reduce the noises, then a thinning algorithm is applied to extract the framework of the pointer and the scales, and a thinning correction algorithm is used to compensate for the slight deflection of pixels. Thirdly, a method for cylindrical rectification is used to compute the precise position of the pointer and the scales. Finally, error sources are discussed. Experimental results show that this system is of speediness and errorless and can meet the engineering requirements...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the fabrication and 3 -point flexion testing of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite face/aluminum honeycomb core sandwich panels. Specimen sandwich panels were fabricated with three honeycomb types (3. 18 mm, 4. 76 mm, and 6. 35 mm cell size) and three panel radii (flat, r = 1. 6 m, r = 1. 3 m). The curved sandwiches were fabricated normally with the core in the W-direction. The tensile mechanical {{properties of the}} CFRP 2 × 2 twill fabric face laminate were evaluated (modulus, strength, Poisson’s ratio). The measured values are comparable to other CFRP fabric laminates. The flat sandwich 3 -point flexion test core shear strength results were 11 - 30 % lower than the manufacturer published data; the test set-up used may be the cause. With a limited sample size, the 1. 3 <b>meter</b> <b>panel</b> curvature appeared to cause a 0. 8 - 3. 8 % reduction in ultimate core shear strength compared to a flat panel...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the fusion of a {{television}} people <b>meter</b> <b>panel</b> and a magazine readership/product usage survey in Mexico. During the process, two different methods of data fusion [...] - unconstrained and constrained statistical matching [...] - were evaluated {{on a number of}} criteria: computational complexity, donation frequency, sample sizes, matching success rates, preservation of audience and incidence levels, together with a number of individual-level and aggregate-level diagnostic tools. Collectively, these results provide a detailed look into the inner workings of data fusion. We do not advocate the inherent superiority of either constrained or unconstrained matching. So our discussion will focus on how to make decisions based upon the trade-offs among various factors in a given situation, and this will therefore be of interest to researchers everywhere. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASES We report here the results of the fusion of two databases in Mexico. The first database is the television people panel operated by IBOPE AGB Mexico. We will refer to this database by the acronym TAM (for Television Audience Measurement). This TAM database contains household tuning and viewing by persons age 4 or older on a continuous basis.

40|$|Use of {{renewable}} energy sources in New Zealand such as photovoltaic (PV) panels has been increasing {{over the last few}} years. The Thames energy group is planning to explore the possibility of using a more sustainable energy. Alkhaldi Mohammed, a Wintec student did a study to install 327 kw PVs system over the Thames hospital roof which has an area of 2950 m, 2 and another Wintec student Alnajrani Hassan, did a study to install 11064 KW PV systems with an area of 99576 m 2 to cover the needs of Thames domestic houses. However, with Thames being near the coast, and surrounded by forest, there were some environmental issues affecting the PV output, such as dust which accumulated from pollen and sea salt. This project was to maintain the PVs to generate power at high efficiency. The i 7 cleaner robot which was initially designed to clean houses was studied and new software was developed to be able to efficiently work on PV panels. Then the robot structure will be developed by the mechanical team next semester so that it will be ready to use. The developed software reduced the cleaning time for a 1 x 2. 20 <b>meter</b> <b>panel</b> from eight minutes to two minutes by setting a path {{on the surface of the}} PV panels for the robot, instead of just a semi random movement. Whereas the old software could clean 11 panels in 90 minutes, the new program can clean 37 panels in the same time...|$|E
