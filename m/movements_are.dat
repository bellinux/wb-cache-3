5|$|The cantata {{is written}} in seven movements, with a {{symmetrical}} form: {{the first and last}} <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> for chorus and orchestra; the second and sixth <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> recitatives; the third and fifth <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> arias in two parts with da capo repeats only for the instrumental ritornello; and the central fourth movement is an accompanied solo. The metrical English translations below of the texts of the first six <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> by Henry Sandwith Drinker; and that of the seventh movement (chorale) is from the 1722 Psalmodica Germanica of John Christian Jacobi and Isaac Watts.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of the six}} quartets in the set {{has four}} movements, and in each case the <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> ordered in a {{conventional}} fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as its shape and <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> well disguised. The Queensland variety is quite easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety is quite troublesome to maintain.|$|E
50|$|The piece follows {{standard}} concerto form. The first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> brisk and in sonata form, {{the second}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow, {{and the third}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> fast. The length of the concerto is approximately 29 minutes.|$|R
40|$|The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{not against}} globalization, it opposes to the {{negative}} effects caused by globalization. The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an expanding social movement of protest. With democratic master framework, the anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> highly decentralized, and its organizations and groups ally loosely. The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a disparate and divided movement, and its members have varies motivation and different goals although anti-corporate globalization is the main target of anti-globalization movements. Furthermore, the anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> facing some serious challenges...|$|R
50|$|The {{intent of}} the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> to obtain public support (money and votes) to elect officeholders who would repeal these liberal statutes. Ultimately, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. In retrospect, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> part of the ongoing culture war.|$|R
5|$|Scouting and Guiding <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{divided into}} sections by age or school grade, allowing activities to {{be tailored to}} the maturity of the group's members. These age divisions have varied over time as they adapt to the local culture and environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{music has}} an often dance-like character. All recitatives, the {{majority}} of the solo <b>movements,</b> <b>are</b> secco, accompanied only by the continuo. Most of them are followed by an aria performed by the same voice type.|$|E
5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this is particularly prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> usually abrupt and irregular and present during both rest and sleep.|$|E
5000|$|In most of Beethoven's four-movement sonatas, {{the third}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in [...] and in ternary form, {{while the second}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow and in a {{different}} key from the other movements. In this sonata, {{the second and third}} movements have switched roles, where the second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the ternary scherzo and trio, while the third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the slow <b>movement</b> in the tonic minor.|$|R

50|$|This <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a choral song {{of praise}} to Nicolas, briefly recounting several {{different}} {{stories of his}} mercy, charity, and kindness. Most of this <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> written homophonically, with a brief canonic section towards the end. This <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> strongly tonal, in G-Major.|$|R
5|$|All <b>{{movements}}</b> <b>are</b> {{written in}} D major, but Reger often modulates. The movements follow each other without a break. A short instrumental introduction, marked , {{leads to the}} fourth movement. Reger achieves a unity of form by including material (both text and music) from the first movement to the later ones.|$|E
5|$|Although its <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> poorly known, tagging {{patterns}} {{indicate that}} the smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries. It can venture well into freshwater past brackish areas. In 1964 a school of toadfish {{were found in the}} Lang Lang River at the South Gippsland Highway—34km (21mi) from Western Port Bay and well beyond tidal areas.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Seisho Maru {{served as}} an army transport, but sources {{reporting}} her <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> incomplete. It is known that {{she was one of}} some 20 ships that departed Takau as part of three combined convoys—TASA-17, TE-03, and No. 82—in mid-April 1944.|$|E

5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> mapped to the {{direction}} the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach {{performed}} 18 cantatas composed by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach, a court musician in Meiningen. He then set {{some of the}} texts himself, including this cantata, written probably by Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. They follow a pattern: seven <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> divided in two parts, both beginning with biblical quotations, Part I from the Old Testament, Part II from the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of the show's animation style, Stan is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an autumnal waltz, {{reminiscent}} of Prokofiev's ballet Cinderella, while the third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an expressive and singing slow movement.|$|R
50|$|The <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{political}} in nature {{from the very}} beginning. The Deoband school was opposed to the movement as Aligarh <b>Movement</b> <b>was</b> pro British.|$|R
5000|$|The modern <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{not just}} for males. “Friar” is an {{exclusively}} male term, while the emerging <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> majority female and includes families.|$|R
5|$|People {{from the}} {{overpopulated}} western highlands and the underdeveloped north {{are moving to}} the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment. Smaller <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations {{in the south and}} east. Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{training}} goals {{pursued in}} conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training. In aikido, pushing or extending <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction {{can be applied to}} general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.|$|E
5|$|The {{music is}} concertante and virtuoso {{for both the}} trumpet and the soloist. The first aria and the {{concluding}} Alleluja are {{in the style of}} an Italian concerto. Dürr observes that the five <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> in five different musical forms: concerto, monody, variation, chorale fantasia and fugue. The scoring is richest in the outer movements (with the trumpet), and reduced to just continuo in the central aria.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>{{movement}}</b> <b>is</b> in sonata form. This {{movement has}} one of the bounciest, happiest melodies to be found in his violin sonatas. The second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in a theme and variations form. This <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> more somber than the opening movement, being at a slower tempo and having a more subdued melody.|$|R
50|$|The Tanka <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{a militant}} agrarian {{struggle}} {{on behalf of}} the Hajong tribal people in Mymensingh District, East Bengal (initially in India, later East Pakistan) 1942-1950. The <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> parallel, but distinct from, the Tebhaga movement in other parts of Bengal. The Hajong <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> inspired by the struggles of Moni Singh.|$|R
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is considered}} sedentary {{and does not}} migrate, though its <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> not well known. Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria they are thought to move into more open areas outside the breeding season. Some populations may be locally nomadic, following availability of water.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. A chorale movement, {{which ends}} {{most of his}} cantatas originally conceived for church use, is here penultimate movement, followed by the only chorus. The first <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> for the soloists: recitatives, a duet and an aria. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book by Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbols for common time (4/4) and alla breve (2/2). The instruments are shown according to type (winds and strings), while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{first and}} last are set for choir, while the inner <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> set for soloists, in a sequence of aria – chorale – recitative – aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: two oboes (Ob), oboe da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), violoncello piccolo (Vp) and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 26 minutes.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{effects of}} the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> the {{creation}} of the Federation of Slavic Sokols (the Sokol <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> highly supportive of Neo-Slavism).|$|R
50|$|The outer <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} from the harpsichord piece with added tutti sections. The middle <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> expanded from the organ piece to four voices.|$|R
50|$|Ordinarily, {{the first}} and third {{movements}} of a concerto are in fast tempi, while the second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow. Here, the first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> on the slow side, and the second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> unequivocally fast. In terms of character, the second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> scherzo-like. Few concerti include a scherzo, but Walton's Viola Concerto seems to have been modeled on Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto, which Walton admired. Prokofiev's concerto also has a scherzo for its second movement as well as a relatively slow-moving first movement.|$|R
