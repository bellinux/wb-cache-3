Furthermore, induction of resonant vibration on imbedded implants by an impulse-forced hammer, detection of the vibration signal by an acoustic microphone, and subsequent signal processing by fast Fourier transformation are described [19].|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{experimental study}} has been conducted to investigate the effect of polypropylene fiber on the shrinkage of cement-stabilized macadam. By means of the <b>micrometer</b> <b>gauge</b> method and the strain gauge method, the dry shrinkage coefficient and thermal shrinkage coefficient of cement-stabilized macadam were measured respectively. The results indicate that polypropylene fiber can effectively decrease the average dry shrinkage coefficient and average thermal shrinkage coefficient of cement-stabilized macadam. The average dry shrinkage coefficient of long curing period is smaller than that of short curing period, while the average thermal shrinkage coefficient of long curing period is much larger than that of shot curing period. When the fiber volume fraction is not beyond 0. 1 %, the average dry shrinkage coefficient and average thermal shrinkage coefficient are gradually decreasing {{with the increase in}} fiber volume fraction. Furthermore, polypropylene fiber appears to be highly effective in controlling dry and thermal shrinkage cracking of cement-stabilized macadam. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{if any of}} six endodontic solutions {{would have}} a softening effect on resorcinol-formalin paste in extracted teeth, {{and if there were}} any differences in the solvent action between these solutions. Forty-nine single-rooted extracted teeth were decoronated two mm coronal to the CEJ, and the roots sectioned apically to a standard length of 15 mm. Canals were prepared to a 12 mm WL and a uniform size with a # 7 Parapost drill. Teeth were then mounted in a cylinder ring with acrylic. The resorcinol-formalin mixture was placed into the canals and was allowed to set for 60 days in a humidor. The solutions tested were 0. 9 % sodium chloride, 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite, chloroform, Endosolv R®, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, and 70 % isopropyl alcohol. Seven samples per solution were tested and seven samples using water served as controls. One drop of the solution was placed over the set mixture in the canal, and the depth of penetration of a 1. 5 mm probe was measured at 2, 5, 10, and 20 min using a dial <b>micrometer</b> <b>gauge.</b> A repeated-measures ANOVA showed a difference in penetration between the solutions at 10 min (p= 0. 04) and at 20 min (p= 0. 0004). At 20 min, Endosolv R®, had significantly greater penetration than 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite (p= 0. 0033) and chloroform (p= 0. 0018); however, it was not significantly better than the control (p= 0. 0812). Although Endosolv R®, had statistically superior probe penetration at 20 min, the softening effect could not be detected clinically at this time...|$|E

40|$|For {{monitoring}} of the engine power of fishing vessels permitted for fishery in the plaice box with engine power of 300 HP or less at sea three different portable power measurement systems are developed and tested. A system measuring the twist of the propeller shaft by two divisible gearwheels mounted on the shaft worked well at shafts with roller bearing at {{both sides of the}} measured interval of 100 – 300 mm length. Only at a very few fishing vessels this system is applicable and therefore for monitoring purposes not suitable. The application of a commercial available system measuring the stress at the surface of the shaft was simplified for application by non experts. The torque is measured by strain gauges. The calibration of the system, measuring and recording of the power is done by a PC automatically. A small polished facet on the shaft protected against oxidation is needed for easy and quick application. In this case the system can be used by technical personnel of supervision boats for {{monitoring of}} the engine power at sea in a short time. A third power measurement system determinates the torque by measuring the displacement of two supports clamped on the shaft at a distance of 100 mm. The displacement is measured by a <b>micrometer</b> <b>gauge</b> mounted on one of the supports. Readout of the rotating gauge display is possible taking advantage of stroboscopic effect. The system needs no conditioning of the shaft and can be used by non technicians. The development is not finished until now and some additional investigations and tests are required.

40|$|Abstract Background Freshwater {{cyanobacteria}} {{are common}} inhabitants of recreational waterbodies throughout the world; some cyanobacteria can dominate the phytoplankton and form blooms, {{many of which}} are toxic. Numerous reports in the literature describe pruritic skin rashes after recreational or occupational exposure to cyanobacteria, but there has been little research conducted on the cutaneous effects of cyanobacteria. Using the mouse ear swelling test (MEST), we sought to determine whether three toxin-producing cyanobacteria isolates and the purified cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin produced delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions. Methods Between 8 and 10 female Balb/c mice in each experiment had test material applied to depilated abdominal skin during the induction phase and 10 or 11 control mice had vehicle only applied to abdominal skin. For challenge (day 10) and rechallenge (day 17), test material was applied to a randomly-allocated test ear; vehicle was applied to the other ear as a control. Ear thickness in anaesthetised mice was measured with a <b>micrometer</b> <b>gauge</b> at 24 and 48 hours after challenge and rechallenge. Ear swelling greater than 20 % in one or more test mice is considered a positive response. Histopathology examination of ear tissues was conducted by independent examiners. Results Purified cylindrospermopsin (2 of 9 test mice vs. 0 of 5 control mice; p = 0. 51) and the cylindrospermopsin-producing cyanobacterium C. raciborskii (8 of 10 test mice vs. 0 of 10 control mice; p = 0. 001) were both shown to produce hypersensitivity reactions. Irritant reactions were seen on abdominal skin at induction. Two other toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena circinalis) did not generate any responses using this model. Histopathology examinations to determine positive and negative reactions in ear tissues showed excellent agreement beyond chance between both examiners (κ = 0. 83). Conclusion The irritant properties and cutaneous sensitising potential of cylindrospermopsin indicate that these toxicological endpoints should be considered by public health advisors and reservoir managers when setting guidelines for recreational exposure to cyanobacteria. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this in vitro study was to establish the antimicrobial efficacy {{and the effect of}} different activation methods on the smear layer at the coronal level of straight root canals of four different root canal irrigation solutions. The four irrigation solutions were 3. 5 % sodium hypochlorite liquid (NaOCl), 2 % sodium hypochlorite gel, chlorhexidine gluconate liquid and a mixture of 100 mg doxycycline capsules with 2 ml sterile water. ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS: The surfaces of four agar plates were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and divided into four equal quadrants. Ten microlitres of each test solution was dispensed onto the four filter paper disks on each agar plate. The antibacterial activity of materials was apparent from circular clear inhibition zones forming around the filtration paper. The diameters of these inhibition zones were measured using a <b>micrometer</b> <b>gauge.</b> EFFECT ON SMEAR LAYER: Access cavities were prepared on fifty, extracted, single rooted, human teeth and the root canals prepared with rotary files. The teeth were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10) and each group irrigated with a different irrigation solution. Different activation methods were used in the coronal portion of each root canal. The solutions were activated in the canals using one of the following methods: a 30 gauge needle (Control), a sonic scaler tip, and a rotary brush. After sampling, the roots of the treated teeth were fractured and prepared for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) according to standard methods. The one-way ANOVA test was used to determine whether there were any statistical significant differences between the different groups. The average zones of inhibition for 3. 5 % NaOCl, 2 % NaOCl, 2. 5 % chlorhexidine and doxycycline were 2. 7 mm, 2. 0 mm, 11. 2 mm and 12. 4 mm respectively. Sterile water, 3. 5 % NaOCl and 2 % NaOCl had no significant effect on the smear layer. However, when chlorhexidine and doxycycline solutions were activated with a rotary brush, 90 and 80 per cent of the observed surfaces were free of smear layer respectively. Doxycyline and 2. 5 % chlorhexidine demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis and removed most of the smear layer when the solutions were activated with a rotary brush...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{geometrical}} specifications {{is becoming more}} and more difficult due to the latest developments in ISO GPS (Geometrical Product Specification) Standards, and at the same time, students’ learning habits are evolving and theoretical courses on standardized specifications are not attractive. Metrology laboratory work is much more appealing and highlights the difficulties encountered in interpreting specifications and the inherent method uncertainties. Nevertheless, metrology activities require an expensive metrology laboratory equipped with CMMs. In order to carry out real hands-on experiments, Bordeaux University is designing a virtual laboratory framework. It is integrated into Moodle (an L. M. S., Learning Management System) as a new activity to establish a link with other Moodle learning activities (courses, tests, etc.) and to ensure student tracking. A first prototype of the virtual laboratory is dedicated to dimensional and geometrical metrology with simulated traditional measuring devices (<b>gauge,</b> <b>micrometer,</b> dial indicator, etc.) and Coordinate Measuring Machines.

40|$|October, 1966 was the {{starting}} date of "Quality and Reliability Year" for British Industry. The author believes that, after the design stage, the greatest contribution to quality and reliability lies {{in being able}} to maintain close dimensional control during the manufacturing process. This investigation was carried out with the intention of providing the engineering industries in the Teesside area with a realistic picture of the accuracy of engineering measurements carried out in the workshops and inspection departments of the respective individual firms. The results follow the general pattern set by two similar investigations carried out by the National Physical Laboratory, (N. P. L.), some years ago, but indicate a wider spread of individual errors about the mean size, and correspondingly larger standard deviation. It also indicates that very few firms in the area possess much more sophisticated equipment than <b>micrometers,</b> dial <b>gauges,</b> and slip gauges, and even these are, in the main, neglected and badly maintained. Optical instruments are almost non-existent. The operatives estimation of their accuracy of measurement varies from the N. P. L. findings in that a number are more optimistic, but in general there is a wider and more uniform spread of opinion. The firm's assessments of their employees' capabilities also tend to be optimistic, and in some cases suggest that they do not possess a great deal of knowledge about the ability of their workmen. Another disturbing aspect is the comparison between standard deviation and the tolerances laid down in B. S. 1916, "Limits and Fits for Engineering". This shows that either the tolerances specified by the British Standard are unrealistic, or that industry in this area has difficulty in working to tolerances closer than I. T. 7. The investigation has shown that working conditions, and the training of operatives in principles of metrology, leave much to be desired, although the latter point appears to be being remedied since the investigation took place...|$|R
40|$|The {{dimensions}} of technical products are often of major importance for t heir proper functioning. Dimensional tolerances define {{how much the}} true dimensions may deviate from the aimed dimensions. Dimensional quality c ontrol ensures that the dimensional properties of the product comply wit h the tolerances. For single and non-complex products instruments like v ernier calipers and <b>micrometer</b> screw <b>gauges</b> can be used, while for more complex inspection tasks and series measurements usually coordinate meas uring machines (CMMs) are used. Because measurement devices also show measurement errors, a measurement result will never be exact. This means {{there will always be}} a measurement uncertainty that should be take n into account while evaluating conformance of products to tolerances. I f measurement uncertainty is neglected, this can result in false rejecti on or false acceptance of products, with possibly far-reaching consequen ces. Reliable measurement uncertainties are indispensable for unambiguou s evaluation of tolerances. Measurement uncertainty determination for coordinate measuring machines is difficult because of the many unce rtainty contributors (CMM hardware errors, temperature, measurement stra tegy, [...] .) that are involved. Therefore conventional uncertainty calcula tion methods, based on analytical propagation of standard uncertainties, can not be applied. Measurement uncertainty determination based on Mont e Carlo simulations is a valuable alternative to conventional uncertaint y calculation methods. These methods can cope much better with the compl exity of CMM measurements. This thesis describes four contributio ns to the determination of measurement uncertainties for feature measure ments on CMMs by means of Monte Carlo methods: When considering measurement uncertainties for feature measurements on C MMs, the influence of feature form deviations is often neglected because feature form deviations are not known in advance and hence difficult to model or to account for. Form deviations of features, like e. g. circles, lines, planes and cylinders, can have an important influence on the me asurement uncertainty, particularly if only a limited set of points is s ampled. Neglecting the influence of form deviations results in less reli able or wrong uncertainty statements, that may lead biased acceptance or rejection of parts. This thesis describes a method to determine the inf luence of feature form deviations on the measurement uncertainty. The measurement accuracy of a CMM varies over the measurement volume. Th is is mainly related to the geometric errors of the CMM in combination w ith the Abbe-offsets to the scales. This thesis presents a method to mod el the geometric errors of a CMM. It is based on the kinematic model of the CMM and simulated motion errors of the different axes. In contrast t o other approaches the proposed method does not need an error mapping of the CMM. The only input needed for this method are the scale positions and a valid ISO 10360 - 2 specification of a CMM. This thesis also elaborates an uncertainty determination method to combi ne the influence of feature form deviations and CMM hardware errors on t he measurement uncertainty for feature measurements. This method relies on a two-step Monte Carlo method: a first step to determine the form dev iation uncertainty, a second step to determine the uncertainties of the other feature parameters. Measured features are often used to construct part coordinate systems (P CS) or other features (e. g. a constructed point as intersection of two m easured lines). This means there will also be uncertainties associated w ith part coordinate systems and constructed features. Similarly there wi ll also be uncertainties related to measured geometrical tolerance value s (perpendicularity, parallelism, coaxiality, [...] .). Uncertainty evaluati on software (UES) for CMMs should take into account these derived uncert ainties. This thesis describes the implementation of an uncertainty eval uation software that takes into account the influence of feature form de viations and CMM hardware errors on measurement uncertainties of feature s and derived parameters. status: publishe...|$|R
