2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 31 January that Stein would leave Hibs for Celtic {{at the end}} of the 1964–65 season. Stein left Hibs in early March, after he had arranged for Dundee manager Bob Shankly to take the Hibs job. When Stein left, Hibs were near the top of the league and in the semi-finals of the 1964–65 Scottish Cup. Hibs had defeated Rangers in the quarter-final, in his last game as Hibs manager. They failed to win either competition, however, and Stein later admitted that [...] "leaving Hibs at that time was probably <b>my</b> <b>most</b> embarrassing <b>experience</b> in football".

Although it was a short-term exhibit, the topic deserves broader attention, thus I present it here.

60|$|Nature {{has taken}} more care than the fondest parent for the {{education}} and refinement of her children. Consider the silent influence which flowers exert, no less upon the ditcher in the meadow than {{the lady in the}} bower. When I walk in the woods, I am reminded that a wise purveyor has been there before me; <b>my</b> <b>most</b> delicate <b>experience</b> is typified there. I am struck with the pleasing friendships and unanimities of nature, as when the lichen on the trees takes the form of their leaves. In the most stupendous scenes you will see delicate and fragile features, as slight wreaths of vapor, dewlines, feathery sprays, which suggest a high refinement, a noble blood and breeding, as it were. It is not hard to account for elves and fairies; they represent this light grace, this ethereal gentility. Bring a spray from the wood, or a crystal from the brook, and place it on your mantel, and your household ornaments will seem plebeian beside its nobler fashion and bearing. It will wave superior there, as if used to a more refined and polished circle. It has a salute and a response to all your enthusiasm and heroism.|$|R

We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|R

You choose a new score with a challenging solo and you speak of the artistry implied. As it is placed on the student’s stand you notice a considered gaze. Within your words, through the language of your body moving, you search for mediation. You feel a disquiet stir within as you conduct and you sense compromise, a false bridge from practicality to intuition. You remember reading: “Teaching is a complex, dynamic, and socially constructed activity, sometimes impulsive, not always logical, often unpredictable, frequently intuitive, and invariably difficult to describe and interpret…. ” (Cole & Knowles, 2000, 63) As the practicalities of school schedule and routine press in, you watch, listen and wonder.
