25|$|Salam {{very early}} {{established}} a reputation throughout the Punjab and {{later at the}} University of Cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation (entrance) examination at the Punjab University. He won a full scholarship to the Government College University of Lahore, Punjab State. Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in Urdu and English literature in which he excelled. But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration. Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan's problems in mathematics, and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944. His father wanted him to join Indian Civil Service. In those days, the Indian Civil Service was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in the civil society. Respecting his father's wish, Salam tried for the Indian Railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests because he had worn spectacles since an early age. The results further concluded that Salam failed a <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> required by the railway engineers to gain a commission in Indian Railways, and moreover that Salam {{was too young to}} compete for the job. Therefore, Indian Railways rejected Abdus Salam's job application. While in Lahore, Abdus Salam went on to attend the graduate school of Government College University. He received his MA in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946. That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed a BA degree with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith's Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics. After finishing his degrees, Fred Hoyle advised Salam to spend another year in the Cavendish Laboratory to do research in experimental physics, but Salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory. Salam returned to Jhang, Punjab (now part of Pakistan) and renewed his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate.|$|E
5000|$|A forming limit diagram, {{also known}} as a forming limit curve, is used in sheet metal forming for {{predicting}} forming behaviour of sheet metal. The diagram attempts to provide a graphical description of material failure tests, such as a punched dome test. [...] In order to determine whether a given region has failed, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> is performed. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> is performed by placing a circular mark on the workpiece prior to deformation, and then measuring the post-deformation ellipse that is generated from the action on this circle. By repeating the <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> to generate a range of stress states, the formability limit diagram can be generated as a line at which failure is onset (see also formability).|$|E

5000|$|Just like in humans, the {{distribution}} of trabeculae in bird species is uneven, depending on the loading conditions. The bird with the highest density of trabeculae is the kiwi, a flightless bird. There is also uneven distribution of trabeculae within the similar species such as the Great spotted woodpecker or Grey-headed woodpecker. After examining a microCT scan of the woodpecker’s forehead, temporomandibulum, and occiput {{it was determined that}} there is significantly more trabeculae in the forehead and occiput. Besides the difference in distribution, the aspect ratio of the individual struts was higher in woodpeckers than in other birds of similar size such as the Eurasian Hoopoe or the Lark. The woodpeckers’ trabeculae are more plate-like while the hawk and lark have rod-like structures networked through their bones. The decrease in strain on the woodpecker’s brain has been attributed to the higher quantity of thicker plate-like struts packed more closely together than the hawk or hoopoe or the Lark. Conversely, the thinner rod-like structures would lead to greater deformation. A destructive <b>mechanical</b> <b>test</b> with 12 samples show the woodpecker’s trabeculae design has an average ultimate strength of 6.38MPa, compared to the lark’s 0.55MPa.|$|E
