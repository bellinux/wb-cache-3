2500|$|Artillery {{fire was}} {{exchanged}} {{by both sides}} in the afternoon and at 5:30p.m., two brigades of Brooks's division attacked {{on both sides of the}} Plank Road. The advance south of the road reached as far as the churchyard, but was driven back. The attack north of the road could not break the Confederate line. Wilcox described the action as [...] "a bloody repulse to the enemy, rendering entirely useless to him his little success of the morning at Fredericksburg." [...] Hooker expressed his disappointment in Sedgwick: [...] "my object in ordering General Sedgwick forward ... Was to relieve me from the position in which I found myself at Chancellorsville. ... In my judgment General Sedgwick did not obey the spirit of <b>my</b> <b>order,</b> and made no sufficient effort to obey it. ... When he did move it was not with sufficient confidence or ability on his part to manoeuvre his troops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Himmler's {{motive was}} to {{eliminate}} the Latvian Jews in Riga so that Jews from Germany and Austria could be deported to the Riga ghetto and housed in their place. [...] Similarly motivated mass murders of eastern Jews confined to ghettos were carried out at Kovno on October 28, 1941 (10,000 dead), and at Minsk, where 13,000 were shot on November 7 and an additional 7,000 on November 20. [...] To carry out this plan, Himmler brought Friedrich Jeckeln into Latvia from the Ukraine, where he had organized a number of mass murders, including Babi Yar (30,000 dead). [...] Jeckeln's crew of about 50 killers and supporting personnel arrived in Riga on November 5, 1941. [...] Jeckeln did not arrive with them, but went instead to Berlin where sometime between November 10 and November 12, 1941, he met with Himmler. [...] Himmler told Jeckeln to kill the entire Riga ghetto and to instruct Lohse, should he object {{that this was an}} order of Himmler's and also of Adolf Hitler's: [...] "Tell Lohse it is <b>my</b> <b>order,</b> which is also the Führer's wish".|$|E

2500|$|Butler censored New Orleans {{newspaper}}s. When {{editor of}} the Commercial Bulletin William Seymour asked Butler {{what would happen if}} the newspaper ignored his censorship, an angry Butler reportedly stated, [...] "I am the military governor of this state — the supreme power — you cannot disregard <b>my</b> <b>order,</b> Sir. By God, he that sins against me, sins against the Holy Ghost." [...] When Seymour published a favorable obituary of his father, who had been killed serving in the Confederate army in Virginia, Butler confiscated the newspaper and imprisoned Seymour for three months. He also closed The Picayune when it ran an editorial that he found offensive. Historian John D. Winters wrote that most of the newspapers [...] "were allowed to reopen later but were so rigidly controlled that all color and interest were drained away" [...] and that churches that planned a special day of prayer and fasting for the Confederacy were forbidden from doing so. Several clergymen were placed under arrest for refusing to pray for President Lincoln. The Episcopal churches were closed, and their three ministers were sent to New York City under military escort.|$|E
2500|$|OZAK was established, {{with its}} {{headquarters}} in Trieste, on 10 September 1943, by Adolf Hitler,"In addition to <b>my</b> (...) <b>order</b> of {{the commander of the}} Greater German Reich in Italy and the organisation of the occupied Italian area from 10 September 1943 I determine:The supreme commanders in the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast consisting of the provinces of Friaul, Görz, Triest, Istrien, Fiume, Quarnero, Laibach, and in the Prealpine Operations Zone consisting of the provinces of Bozen, Trient and Belluno receive the fundamental instructions for their activity from me. Führer's headquarters, 10 September 1943. The Führer Gen. Adolf Hitler". {{as a response to the}} Italian capitulation (8 September 1943) following the Allied invasion of Italy. It comprised the provinces of Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pula (Pola), Rijeka (Fiume) and Ljubljana (Lubiana). [...] The Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills, comprising the provinces of Belluno, South Tyrol, and Trentino, was established on the same day. Both operations zones formally belonged to the Italian Social Republic, which governed those areas of Italy not yet occupied by the Allies from Salò at Lake Garda. The name of the zone was a reference to the historical crown land of the Austrian Littoral.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, the Kangxi Emperor kept {{constant}} {{watch over}} Yinreng and {{became aware of}} his son's many flaws, while their relationship gradually deteriorated. In 1707, the emperor decided that {{he could no longer}} tolerate Yinreng's behavior, which he partially mentioned in the imperial edict as [...] "never obeying ancestors' virtues, never obliged to <b>my</b> <b>order,</b> only doing inhumanity and devilry, only showing maliciousness and lust", and decided to strip Yinreng of his position as crown prince. The Kangxi Emperor placed his oldest surviving son, Yinzhi, in charge of overseeing Yinreng's house arrest. Yinzhi, an unfavored Shu son, knowing he had no chance of being selected, recommended the eighth prince, Yinsi, and requested his father to order Yinreng's execution. The Kangxi Emperor was enraged and stripped Yinzhi of his titles. The emperor then commanded his subjects to cease debating the succession issue, but despite this and attempts to reduce rumours and speculation as to who the new crown prince might be, the imperial court's daily activities were disrupted. Yinzhi's actions caused the Kangxi Emperor to suspect that Yinreng might have been framed, so he restored Yinreng as crown prince in 1709, {{with the support of the}} 4th and 13th princes, and on the excuse that Yinreng had previously acted under the influence of mental illness.|$|E

2500|$|Three days {{following}} his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, Mussolini {{was taken to}} Germany {{for a meeting with}} Hitler in Rastenburg at his East Prussian headquarters. Despite public professions of support, Hitler was clearly shocked by Mussolini's disheveled and haggard appearance as well as his unwillingness to go after the men in Rome who overthrew him. Feeling that he had to do what he could to blunt the edges of Nazi repression, Mussolini agreed to set up a new regime, the Italian Social Republic ( [...] , RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic because of its administration from the town of Salò where he settled in just 11 days after his rescue by the Germans. Mussolini's new regime faced numerous territorial losses: in addition to losing the Italian lands held by the Allies and Badoglio's government, the provinces of Bolzano, Belluno and Trento were placed under German administration in the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills, while the provinces of Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola (now Pula), Fiume (now Rijeka) and Ljubljana (Lubiana in Italian) were incorporated into the German Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral."In addition to <b>my...</b> <b>order</b> of the commander of the Greater German Reich in Italy and the organisation of the occupied Italian area from 10 September 1943 I determine:The supreme commanders in the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast consisting of the provinces of Friaul, Görz, Triest, Istrien, Fiume, Quarnero, Laibach, and in the Prealpine Operations Zone consisting of the provinces of Bozen, Trient and Belluno receive the fundamental instructions for their activity from me.

See second document at http://www.karawankengrenze.at/ferenc/document/show/id/317?symfony=ad81b9f2cd1e66a7c973073ed0532df1 [...] In addition, the German army occupied the Dalmatian provinces of Split (Spalato) and Kotor (Cattaro), which were subsequently annexed by the Croatian fascist regime. Italy's gains in Greece and Albania were also lost to Germany, {{with the exception of the}} Italian Aegean Islands, which remained nominally under RSI rule. Mussolini opposed any territorial reductions of the Italian state and told his associates:I am not here to renounce even a square meter of state territory. We will go back to war for this. And we will rebel against anyone for this. Where the Italian flag flew, the Italian flag will return. And where it has not been lowered, now that I am here, no one will have it lowered. I have said these things to the Führer.|$|E
