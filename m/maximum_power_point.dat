This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>point</b> trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E

These modules perform <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracking (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features.

The method uses the lossless single-diode model (SDM) which is parameterized using {{the data of}} inflection and <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>points</b> of each panel. The reconstruction of power vs. voltage curve is obtained by one explicit equation, thus avoiding the use of recursive non-linear equations solver.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{approach}} for photovoltaic (PV) sources modeling based on robust least squares linear regression (LSR) parameter identification method. On the basis of experimental data of solar irradiance, cell temperature and voltage and currents at <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>points</b> for a given PV array, correlation functions among the considered quantities are defined. By implementing these functions in a Matlab ® Simulink model, accurate I-V characteristics for the considered array are obtained, managing only the solar irradiance. The method is validated comparing the computed and the experimental <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>points</b> (MPPs). Its effectiveness is proven to be better with respect of parameter identification methods based on discrete approaches and standard LSR method...|$|R

25|$|A {{solar cell}} may operate {{over a wide}} range of {{voltages}} (V) and currents (I). By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a short circuit) to a very high value (an open circuit) one can determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>point,</b> the point that maximizes VI; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation.

25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (<b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>point</b> trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E
