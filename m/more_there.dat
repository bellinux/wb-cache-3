5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much <b>more.</b> <b>There</b> is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and <b>more.</b> <b>There</b> was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways {{was in the}} process of buying 50 diesel locomotives from English Electric. In the Azores archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and <b>more.</b> <b>There</b> is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly <b>more,</b> <b>there</b> would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the interregnum, Ludlow Castle {{continued}} to be run by Parliamentarian governors, the first being the military commander Samuel <b>More.</b> <b>There</b> was a Royalist plot to retake the castle in 1648, but no other military activity took place. The most valuable items in the castle were removed shortly after the siege, and the remainder of the luxurious furnishings were sold off in the town in 1650. The castle was initially kept garrisoned, but in 1653, most of the weapons in the castle were removed on the grounds of security and sent to Hereford, then in 1655 the garrison was disbanded altogether. In 1659, the political instability in the Commonwealth government led to the castle being regarrisoned by 100 men under the command of William Botterell.|$|E
