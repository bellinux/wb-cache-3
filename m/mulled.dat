5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or <b>mulled</b> wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

25|$|Wassail is a hot, <b>mulled</b> punch often {{associated}} with Yuletide drunk from a 'wassailing bowl'. The earliest versions were warmed mead into which roasted crab apples were dropped and burst to create a drink called 'lambswool' drunk on Lammas day, still known in Shakespeare's time. Later, the drink evolved to become a <b>mulled</b> cider made with sugar, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, topped with slices of toast as sops and drunk from a large communal bowl. Modern recipes begin with a base of wine, fruit juice or <b>mulled</b> ale, sometimes with brandy or sherry added. Apples or oranges are often added to the mix, and some recipes also call for beaten eggs to be tempered into the drink. Great bowls turned from wood, pottery or tin often had many handles for shared drinking and highly decorated lids; antique examples can still be found in traditional pubs. Hence the first stanza of the traditional carol the Gloucestershire Wassail {{dating back to the}} Middle Ages.|$|E

40|$|O gênero Phyllanthus L. é o maior e mais diverso da família Phyllanthaceae, com aproximadamente 830 espécies que se distribuem {{principal}}mente nos trópicos de todo o mundo, das quais 200 ocorrem nos neotrópicos. Na América do Sul, o Brasil é o país que congrega o maior número de espécies, cerca de 100, das quais 40 % são encontradas nos estados da Região Sudeste do país, onde localiza-se o centro de diversidade do gênero no território nacional. A grande diversidade, alta representatividade e taxonomia ainda pouco estudada do grupo, mesmo no que se refere à circunscrição de suas espécies, justificam a realização do presente estudo. Deste modo, o principal objetivo deste trabalho foi levantar e analisar aspectos morfológicos e taxonômicos das espécies do gênero Phyllanthus na Região Sudeste do Brasil, contribuindo para o conhecimento do gênero no Brasil, bem como da biodiversidade brasileira. O trabalho inclui uma chave de identificação, descrições e comentários sobre a taxonomia, distribuição geográfica e ilustrações das espécies. Na Região Sudeste do Brasil foram encontradas 37 espécies do gênero: Phyllanthus acuminatus Vahl., P. acutifolius Poir ex Spreng., P amarus Schumach., P. angustissimus <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. arenicola Casar., P. augustinii Baill., P. avicularis <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. caparaoensis G.

Webster, P. subemarginatus <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. tenellus Roxb., P. umbratus <b>Müll.</b> Arg. e P. urinaria L. The genus Phyllanthus L. is {{the largest}} and most diverse of the family Phyllanthaceae with about 830 species that are spread mainly throughout the tropics, of which 200 are in the neotropics. From 100 species occurring in Brazil, where the genre is richest in South America, 40 % of them occur in the southern region of the country, where is located one of the centers of diversity of the genus. The great diversity, richness and taxonomy still little studied, even regarding the circumscription of their species, justifying this study. Thus, the main aim {{of this study was to}} survey and analyze morphological and taxonomic aspects of the genus in southern Brazil, contributing to the knowledge of Phyllanthus in the country as well to the Brazilian biodiversity. This study includes an identification key, descriptions and comments on the taxonomy, geographical distribution and illustrations of the species. In southeastern Brazil were found 37 species of the genus: Phyllanthus acuminatus Vahl., P. acutifolius Poir ex Spreng., P amarus Schumach., P. angustissimus <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. arenicola Casar., P. augustinii Baill., P. avicularis <b>Müll.</b> Arg., P. caparaoensis G.

25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and <b>mulled</b> wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern retsina. Romans were {{particularly interested in the}} aroma of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors of lavender and thyme, presumably as a reflection of the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E
25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and <b>mulled</b> over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E
25|$|In Roman {{times the}} type of {{viticulture}} practiced by the Greeks was their model {{for a long time}} and production included white wine. Rich Roman patricians organized banquets where the cost of the food was a sign of prestige. In the range of expensive products wine played a predominant role. The richest citizens built sumptuous villas in the Bay of Naples where the vine had been cultivated since its introduction by the Greeks. The aminum or ancient grape produced a sweet white wine produced as <b>mulled</b> wine resembling modern-day Madeira. The conquering of regions more and more to the north encouraged the Romans to cultivate the vine and to produce lighter and less sweet wines. It also encouraged them to seek new wild varieties adaptable to these distant areas where the Mediterranean varieties showed their limits. For example, vines were planted on the banks of the Rhine to provide the Legions with a healthy drink as opposed to water which was rarely drinkable. The wine was drunk cool in summer and warm in winter a practice which still continues in the 21st century.|$|E
