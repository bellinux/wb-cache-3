5|$|After Henry's death {{there was}} a pause in the {{conflict}} with France, during which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1920, the {{population}} of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> residents were immigrants who sought employment in the factories and mills and introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city. Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.|$|E
5|$|Charles Linza McNary (June 12, 1874February 25, 1944) was a United States Republican {{politician}} from Oregon. He {{served in}} the Senate from 1917 to 1944 and was Senate Minority Leader from 1933 to 1944. In the Senate, McNary helped to pass legislation {{that led to the}} construction of Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, and worked on agricultural and forestry issues. He also supported <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Deal programs {{at the beginning of the}} Great Depression. Until Mark O. Hatfield surpassed his mark in 1993, he was Oregon's longest-serving senator.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{like with}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Trade Theory models, {{the results of}} the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style {{appeared}} as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> churches, for example, {{were built in the}} gothic style as were a number of new villas. Most of the new civic and retail buildings however continued to be designed in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have a cohesive look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component.|$|E
5|$|Malvern's rapid {{urbanisation}} {{during the}} latter half of the 19th century spread eastwards and northwards from Great Malvern, the traditional town centre on the steep flank of the Worcestershire Beacon, and engulfed the manors and farms in the immediate area. It was often the farms, such as Pickersleigh (now known as Pickersleigh Court and previously known as Pickersleigh House), near Great Malvern, and the Howsells in Malvern Link which merged with Great Malvern in 1900 that gave their names to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> neighbourhoods. The urban agglomeration continued to spread, and by the middle of the 20th century had reached the suburban parishes of West Malvern, Malvern Wells, Newland, Madresfield, and Guarlford.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{television}} {{companies in}} the U.S. generally prefer to use 256-QAM to transmit HDTV. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> HDTVs with integrated digital tuners include support for decoding 256-QAM in addition to 8VSB for OTA digital. Cable television companies started carrying HDTV in 2003.|$|R

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, {{as they once}} had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{lies on the}} {{confluence}} of three rivers: the Dane, Croco and Wheelock. Three canals also pass through the town, the Shropshire Union, Trent and Mersey, and the Wardle canal, as well as three major roads, the A533, A54 and A530; Middlewich also has good motorway links to the nearby cities of Manchester and Liverpool. The town's population has doubled since 1970 despite {{a reduction in the}} number of manufacturing jobs in salt and textile manufacturing, suggesting that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> residents live in Middlewich for reasons other than local employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{hotel was}} not immensely {{profitable}} in its opening years; smaller than <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> hotels springing {{up in that}} period, it was not fashionable initially, and was resented {{by many of the}} London elite who considered it vulgar. It took £3628 in 1908, over a thousand pounds less than the previous year, and the hotel lost over £50,000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908, which led to the replacement of Elles with manager with Theodore Kroell and appointment of Charles Van Gyzelen as manager of the restaurant.|$|E

50|$|After VE day, {{all models}} {{earlier than the}} Mk. IIIG were {{declared}} obsolete, and ongoing work on <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> versions ended. In place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire series from Mk. VI to VIII came the Mk. IX, which was essentially a version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 cm Mk. VIII designed specifically for use on the E3/45 jet bomber, which after becoming B3/45, would finally emerge as the English Electric Canberra.|$|R
5|$|The {{newly built}} Australian National University was expanded, and sculptures and monuments were built. A new National Library was {{constructed}} within the Parliamentary Triangle, {{followed by the}} High Court and the National Gallery. Suburbs in Canberra Central (often referred to as North Canberra and South Canberra) were further developed in the1950s, and urban development in the districts of Woden Valley and Belconnen commenced in the mid and late 1960s respectively. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> suburbs were named after Australian politicians, such as Barton, Deakin, Reid, Braddon, Curtin, Chifley and Parkes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes. The portion of New England Route 14 from Barre to Burlington was assigned to U.S. Route 2, while the portion in New Hampshire was assigned to U.S. Route 4. This shortened Route 14 {{in the south to}} US 4/US 5 in White River Junction, and in the north to US 2 in the city of Barre. In 1935, the portion of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section of then Vermont Route 18. The old US 2 alignment was redesignated as US 302. VT 14 was extended northward several miles to East Montpelier, ending at the junction of newly relocated US 2 and Vermont Route 12.|$|E
5|$|Between the Acts of Union in the mid-16th {{century and}} the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, a period of great {{rebuilding}} {{took place in the}} Kingdom of England, of which Wales was now annexed, and this is reflected in the structures that were built within the Rhondda Valley. The fluctuating economic state of the late Tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and therefore producing higher profits. This profit was reflected in the new farm houses built in the Rhondda {{and for the first time}} an emphasis on domestic comfort became apparent in the design of the dwellings. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> farm buildings were simple structures consisting of two or three small rooms, though of a much sturdier and permanent quality than the Medieval platform houses. A popular style of building was the long-house, a building which combined the house and cowshed into a single building. By 1840, at least 160 farms existed in the Rhondda, but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few surviving buildings, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in Blaenrhondda, a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of Tynewydd and Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.|$|E

5|$|Saavedra {{began to}} lose {{political}} power from this point. The decree of Mariano Moreno that changed the military promotions, which was never derogated, began to bear fruit, even if Moreno {{was not in the}} Junta anymore. The army became more professional, and less based on militias. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> military authorities opposed Saavedra. The political crisis increased with the unfavourable military outcomes of the war: Belgrano was defeated at the Paraguay campaign, Castelli at the Upper Peru campaign, and the capture of Montevideo became increasingly difficult with the intervention of Portuguese troops supporting it. The many members of the Junta made the internal work difficult, as all measures were discussed by all members, hindering the swift reactions needed by the war. Saavedra left Buenos Aires at this point, and headed to the Upper Peru, to take command of the Army of the North. He thought that he could be of greater help as a military leader than facing the political struggles of Buenos Aires.|$|E
