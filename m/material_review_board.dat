The composite {{shell of the}} COPV shall be {{designed to meet the}} design life considering the time it is under sustained load. A Mechcanical Damage Control Plan (MDCP) shall be created and implemented that assures the COPV will not fail due to mechanical damage due to manufacturing, testing, shipping, installation, or flight. Proven processes and procedures for fabrication and repair shall be used to preclude damage or material degradation during material processing, manufacturing operations, and refurbushment. Selected NDI techniques for the liner and/or boss(es) shall be performed before overwrapping with composite. When visual inspection reveals mechanical damage or defects exceeding manufacturing specification levels (and standard repair procedures), the damaged COPV shall be submitted to a <b>material</b> <b>review</b> <b>board</b> (MRB) for disposition.

40|$|The Integrated Receiver/Decoder (IRD) {{currently}} {{used on the}} Space Shuttle was designed in the 1980 and prior time frame. Over the past 12 years, several parts have become obsolete or difficult to obtain. As directed by the Marshall Space Flight Center, a primary objective is to investigate updating the IRD design using the latest technology subsystems. To take advantage of experience with the current designs, an analysis of failures and a review of discrepancy reports, <b>material</b> <b>review</b> <b>board</b> actions, scrap, etc. are given. A recommended new design designated as the Advanced Receiver/Decoder (ARD) is presented. This design uses the latest technology components to simplify circuits, improve performance, reduce size and cost, and improve reliability. A self-test command is recommended that can improve and simplify operational procedures. Here, the new design is contrasted with the old. Possible simplification of the total Range Safety System is discussed, as is a single-step crypto technique that can improve and simplify operational procedures...|$|E
40|$|One {{chance to}} get it right—this is a basic tenet of {{pediatric}} imaging. Not only is speed crucial, but the images need to be reproducible. 1 Tomographic ultra-sound imaging (TUI) addresses both of these issues. TUI allows for a rapid 3 D sweep that {{can be divided into}} individual images using a defined number of slices and a particular slice thickness, similar to the process used in 3 D computed tomography (CT). This tool saves time from conventional volume ultrasound as it makes the generation of key images from the volume data set more efficient and repro-ducible. 2 The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the timesaving of TUI with neonatal neurosonogra-phy and discuss the potential impact of this applica-tion from the perspective of the patient, sonographer, and radiologist.

40|$|Smallsats are {{inherently}} more risky ventures {{than the traditional}} space mission. Concept, design, production and integration schedules tend {{to be much more}} demanding and the smaller budgets are severely scrutinized. Quality Assurance and Product Assurance are often targeted to keep the final costs in check. It is a common misconception that quality is difficult to quantify. Costs are often perceived to be large for increasingly shrinking benefits. There have been numerous attempts to establish the true cost of quality by simple breakdowns of process and non-conformance cost and many provide a good estimate of the cost, particularly in organizations with mature quality systems. The cost/benefit ratio or true value of quality is often in dispute; this paper will explore the real benefits to a space missions program of an appropriately tailored quality system. This paper also argues that one of the major keys to the success of a Smallsat program is the management of risk and the intelligent application of Quality Management principles. As with all engineering projects, normal risk management principles apply to Smallsat missions: risks must be clearly and comprehensively identified, risk mitigation strategies must be formulated and the risks must be managed through the life of the project. Prudent use of Quality Management can be an invaluable tool during the risk management process. The guiding principal must be to match the quality approach to the requirements; this implies that some requirements such as reliability and spacecraft life may require the usual rigor associated with normal high reliability applications. Other areas of the spacecraft design may claim qualification by heritage and possible delta qualification campaigns. Reduction of process in Quality Management is the easiest target for project managers but simple reduction must only be undertaken with an assessment of the risks. Challenging the independent decisions of the <b>Material</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board,</b> for example, may save some dollars in the short term but decisions based on quality criteria always endure. With intense cost and schedule pressures an independent quality voice is essential. The application of good Quality Management principles also applies to parts selection and {{there is a tendency to}} use Commercial Off The Shelf parts because of their enticing cost savings. An assessment of the true costs, quality and reliability of the parts has to be made to assess any inherent risks. With intelligent application, Quality Management can be a powerful and cost effective tool for risk management on a Smallsat program...|$|E

5000|$|Once {{a person}} is found not criminally {{responsible}} ("NCR"), {{he or she will}} have a hearing by a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> within 45 days (90 days if the court extends the delay). A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is established under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a [...] "significant threat to the safety of the public" [...] and, if so, what the [...] "least onerous and least restrictive" [...] restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.|$|R
