The most famous quip about this issue was uttered by John Ritter, who told the New York Observer when they asked him about the controversy: [...] "I've requested that Nickelodeon air both versions, edited and unedited, because sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don't" [...] (quoting an advertising jingle for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars). The incident was also brought up during a [...] "Celebrity Secrets" [...] comedy bit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the late 1990s, where a nervous-acting Ritter jokingly says [...] "Somebody asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that on purpose...", after taking a nervous sip of water, he responds [...] "You bet I did!" ...|$|E

During this time, Joseph Smith, also taught her about plural marriage in private conversations; he proposed that she become his spiritual wife on at least three different occasions. Zina declined the proposals out of her respect for Emma Smith and for traditional Christian monogamy, and because such a union would require secrecy.

However, she continued to feel concern that she had rejected God by rejecting Joseph, whom she considered a prophet and God's spokesperson. Later she recorded, [...] "I received a testimony for myself from the Lord of this work, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God before I ever saw him, while I resided in the state of New York, given in answer to prayer. I knew him in his lifetime, and know him to have been a great true man and a servant of God." [...] Smith wrote to her in October 1841 that he had [...] "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not establish that principle [...] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life." [...] She and Smith were married on October 27, 1841. [...] Her brother Dimick performed the ceremony. [...] By that time, Joseph was married to five other women, besides his first wife Emma: Fanny Alger, Louisa Beaman, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, Nancy Marinda Johnson Hyde, and Clarissa Reed Hancock.|$|E
