25|$|One of Port Adelaide's finest players {{during the}} Fos Williams era was John Cahill. He {{eventually}} became William's protégé and ultimately {{took over as}} coach in 1974. In 1975 a dispute between the Port Adelaide City Council and the SANFL {{over the use of}} Alberton Oval forced Port Adelaide to move its home matches to Adelaide Oval for two seasons. In 1976 Cahill would subsequently take Port Adelaide to its first Grand Final under his leadership against Sturt with an official attendance of 66,897, the record for football in South Australia. The actual crowd was estimated at 80,000, <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> official figure as Football Park ran out of tickets early and were forced to shut the gates 90 minutes before the bounce as people were being crushed on entry. Sturt won in an upset by 41 points.

The theatre was later described by an observer: [...] "...marvellous scene changes, majestic and grand appearances ... and a magnificent flying machine; you see, as if commonplace, glorious heavens, deities, seas, royal palaces, woods, forests...".

500|$|The {{version of}} the Euclidean {{algorithm}} described above (and by Euclid) can take many subtraction steps to find the GCD {{when one of the}} given numbers is <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other. A more efficient {{version of the}} algorithm shortcuts these steps, instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two (with this version, the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder). With this improvement, the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer. [...] This was proven by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, and marks the beginning of computational complexity theory. [...] Additional methods for improving the algorithm's efficiency were developed in the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} OK Computer {{coincided with the}} decline of Britpop. Through OK Computers influence, the {{dominant}} UK guitar pop shifted toward an approximation of [...] "Radiohead's paranoid but confessional, slurry but catchy" [...] approach. Many newer British acts adopted similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements; for example, the post-Britpop band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the fourth best-selling album of 1999 in the UK. Some in the British press accused Travis of appropriating Radiohead's sound. Steven Hyden of AV Club said that by 1998, starting with The Man Who, [...] "what Radiohead had created in OK Computer had already grown <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> band," [...] and that the album went on to influence [...] "a wave of British-rock balladeers that reached its zenith in the '00s".|$|E

500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the skull was the different-shaped teeth (heterodonty) for which the genus is named, which is {{otherwise}} mainly known from mammals. Most dinosaurs (and indeed most reptiles) have a single type of tooth in their jaws, but Heterodontosaurus had three. The beaked {{tip of the snout}} was toothless, whereas the hind part of the premaxilla in the upper jaw had three teeth on each side. The first two upper teeth were small and cone-shaped (comparable to incisors), while the third on each side was much enlarged, forming prominent, canine-like tusks. These first teeth were probably partially encased by the upper beak. The first two teeth in the lower jaw also formed canines, but were <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> upper equivalents. The canines had fine serrations along the back edge, but only the lower ones were serrated at the front. Eleven tall and chisel-like [...] "cheek"-teeth lined each side of the posterior parts of the upper jaw, which were separated from the canines by a large diastema (gap). The cheek-teeth increased gradually in size, with the middle teeth being largest, and decreased in size after this point. These teeth had a heavy coat of enamel on the inwards side, and were adapted for wear (hypsodonty), and they had long roots, firmly embedded in their sockets. The tusks in the lower jaw fit into an indentation within the diastema of the upper jaw. The cheek-teeth in the lower jaw generally matched those in the upper jaw, though the enamel surface of these were on the outwards side. The upper and lower teeth rows were inset, which created a [...] "cheek-recess" [...] also seen in other ornithischians.|$|E

2500|$|Chon Buri Water buffalo racing festival, Thailand In {{downtown}} Chonburi, [...] {{south of}} Bangkok, {{at the annual}} water buffalo festival held in mid-October. About 300 buffalo race in groups of five or six, spurred on by bareback jockeys wielding wooden sticks, as hundreds of spectators cheer. The water buffalo has always {{played an important role}} in agriculture in Thailand. For farmers of Chon Buri Province, near Bangkok, it is an important annual festival, beginning in mid-October. It is also a celebration among rice farmers before the rice harvest. At dawn, farmers walk their buffalo through surrounding rice fields, splashing them with water to keep them cool before leading them to the race field. This amazing festival started over a hundred years ago when two men arguing about whose buffalo was the fastest ended up having a race between them. That’s how it became a tradition and gradually a social event for farmers who gathered from around the country in Chonburi to trade their goods. The festival also helps a great deal in preserving the number of buffalo, which have been dwindling at quite an alarming rate in other regions. Modern machinery is rapidly replacing buffalo in Thai agriculture. With most of the farm work mechanized, the buffalo-racing tradition has continued. Racing buffalo are now raised just to race; they do not work at all. The few farm buffalo which still do work are <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> racers because of the strenuous work they perform. Farm buffalo are in the [...] "Buffalo Beauty Pageant", a Miss Farmer beauty contest and a comic buffalo costume contest etc..

2500|$|The {{leaves are}} usually large and imposing, often lobed or deeply cut, {{and may be}} more or less pinnate. They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other {{possible}} shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. An interesting quality of philodendrons is {{that they do not have}} a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped. Early in the life of the plant, but after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will have acquired the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species. The trigger for the transformation to adult leaves can vary considerably. One possible trigger is the height of the plant. Secondary hemiepiphytes start off on the dark forest floor and climb their way up a tree, displaying their juvenile type leaves along the way. Once they reach a sufficient height, they begin developing adult type leaves. The smaller juvenile leaves are used for the darker forest floor where light is in scarce supply, but once they reach a sufficient height in the canopy the light is bright enough that the bigger adult leaves can serve a useful purpose. Another possible trigger occurs in primary hemiepiphytes. [...] These philodendrons typically send their aerial roots downward. [...] Once their roots have reached the ground below, the plant will begin taking up nutrients from the soil, of which it had been previously deprived. As a result, the plant will quickly morph into its adult leaves and gain in size dramatically. Another interesting quality of philodendrons leaves is they are often quite different in shape and size even between two plants of the same species. As a result of all these different possible leaf shapes, it is often difficult to differentiate natural variations from morphogenesis.|$|E
