5000|$|IMTS systems {{typically}} had 25 {{watts of}} transmitter {{power at the}} mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal — unlike the older cellular car telephones that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. <b>Mobile</b> <b>installations</b> normally consisted of a [...] "head unit" [...] or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was lifted from the cradle {{and in this way}} seemed more like a landline telephone than a cellular handset. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, that was mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a multi-conductor cable usually around [...]5 inch thick. The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled {{in the body of the}} car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no [...] "on-glass" [...] antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. The antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile's battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile's battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car's horn and were switched to honk the horn as a ringer when receiving an incoming call if the user was away from the car at the time of the call.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Authentication and AuthorizationInternational audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a novel gait {{authentication}} mechanism by mining sensor resources on mobile phone. Unlike previous works, both built-in accelerometer and magnetometer {{are used to}} handle <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> issues, including {{but not limited to}} disorientation, and misplacement errors. The authentication performance is improved by executing deep examination at pre-processing steps. A novel and effective segmentation algorithm is also provided to segment signal into separate gait cycles with perfect accuracy. Subsequently, features are then extracted on both time and frequency domains. We aim to construct a lightweight but high reliable model; hence feature subsets selection algorithms are applied to optimize the dimension of the feature vectors as well as the processing time of classification tasks. Afterward, the optimal feature vector is classified using SVM with RBF kernel. Since there is no public dataset in this field to evaluate fairly the effectiveness of our mechanism, a realistic dataset containing the influence of <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> errors and footgear is also constructed with the participation of 38 volunteers (28 males, 10 females).

This paper presents and validates two mechanisms for supporting sensor mobility between different administrative domains. Firstly, EAP-Swift, an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) -based sensor authentication protocol is proposed that enables light-weight sensor authentication and key generation. Secondly, a mechanism for handoffs between wireless sensor gateways is proposed. We validate both mechanisms in a real-life study that was conducted in a smart city environment with several fixed sensors and moving gateways. We conduct similar experiments in an industry-based anechoic Long Term Evolution (LTE) chamber with an ideal radio environment. Further, we validate our results collected from the smart city environment against the results produced under ideal conditions to establish best and real-life case scenarios. Our results clearly validate that our proposed mechanisms can facilitate efficient sensor authentication and handoffs while sensors are roaming in a smart city environment...|$|E

40|$|An {{emergency}} operation {{in case of}} a tunnel fire can easily become a complex operation. The objectives are to save people in danger, save the tunnel and its installations as well as vehicles trapped inside the tunnel and also, if it’s possible and necessary, reduce the effects on the environment. The strategy and the tactics in an {{emergency operation}} are very much depending on the specific tunnel, the fire behaviour and the resources from the fire brigade. One of the key factors is to ventilate the tunnel in order to take the smoke away from the people in danger or to support the fire fighting operation. The possibilities to effectively ventilate the tunnel depend on the knowledge of the fire brigade, the available pre-installed or <b>mobile</b> <b>installations</b> and equipment for ventilation and the tactical approach chosen. In tunnels with only natural ventilation or to improve existing ventilation in tunnels, mobile fans can be used. The possibilities to redirect the flow are dependent of the capacity of the fans, the tunnel geometry and the counteracting forces from outside wind or the thermal buoyancy from the fire. In this paper the tactical approach with ventilation is further analysed and the possibilities and limitations are studied and discussed...|$|E
40|$|With {{an annual}} {{production}} of 10 million tonnes, construction and demolition waste {{is one of}} the most important waste streams in Flanders, Belgium. 95 % of this construction and demolition waste (CD&W) is processed into recycled aggregates. The amount of recycled concrete aggregates and the amount of mixed aggregates are about the same. In Flanders, Belgium there is a well developed recycling industry for CD&W, with more than 165 recycling companies on fixed locations and 44 certified <b>mobile</b> <b>installations,</b> most of which are SMEs. Recycled aggregates have evaluated towards a worthy alternative for natural aggregates. Their use should be looked at from a point of chain management and economic use of natural mineral. Therefore more applications with added value should be found for this kind of recycled aggregates that usually end up in low grade applications. This is the case for mixed recycled aggregates. Whilst a lot of research is done on using recycled concrete aggregates, less research is performed to find high grade applications for the use of mixed recycled aggregates. This paper shows that it is possible to produce an industrial competitive product. Mixed recycled aggregates (MRA) were used as a replacement of natural aggregates in the production of hollow and full concrete blocks. The aim of this research was to produce construction blocks with a high level of MRA with a quality similar to the standard products on the market. Up to 95 % of MRA was used in the production of full concrete construction blocks and up to 75 % in hollow concrete construction blocks. As a result of this research, 3500 hollow building bricks were produces in an existing building block manufacturing company. These blocks were used as an example in the “Centrum Duurzaam Bouwen “ (Centre of Sustainable Building) in Heusden-Zolder. This case proved the high added value of MRA in the production of building blocks. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a virtual reality application which requires a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation,</b> and the experience gathered during the preparation, realization, and execution of this project. Recently, high-end virtual reality (VR) has received much attention in the marketing field. Professional advertisement agencies are trying to exploit the fascination in this technology raised within the public. IGD was approached by such an agency and requested to prepare a high-quality VR application, serving as a marketing event for the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft / Union de Banques Suisses (SBG/UBS), the largest Swiss bank. SBG wanted to attract the Swiss youth in order to promote its Junior Bank Card. This event was held in twelve major Swiss cities during four weeks in May/June, 1994, with daily presentations. The time schedule and the marketing concept required a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation.</b> As "Cyberspace Roadshow" the event was advertised in newspapers and radio spots. This was world wide the first mobile, immersive, high-quality VR installation. The complete VR infrastructure was installed in a large truck. The presentations were performed inside the truck as well. The hardware infrastructure was comprised of an image generator (SGI Crimson/RealityEngine), VR peripherals (head-mounted display, data glove, body tracking systems), a sound generator (SGI Indigo), and a large, stereoscopic rear projection screen using polarizing light. Within such an immersive environment, approximately 40 persons can be involved. Wearing 3 D glasses the audience can experience stereoscopic viewing and follow, passively, what one active person is controlling by utilizing the VR devices. For this event IGD created several entertaining virtual worlds using its proprietary VR system. The main idea was that one active player is flying through a tunnel, approaching a switch room with three alternatives: riding through a jungle, playing musical instruments or exploring a space labyrinth.
