5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone, compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. Dopamine and serotonin were collected using <b>microdialysis,</b> and increases in dopamine and serotonin were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{push-pull}} cannula, <b>microdialysis</b> and in vivo voltammetry, fMRS is a {{non-invasive method}} for studying dynamics of biochemistry in an activated brain. It is done without exposing subjects to ionizing radiation {{like it is}} done in positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. fMRS gives a more direct measurement of cellular events occurring during brain activation than BOLD fMRI or PET which rely on hemodynamic responses and show only global neuronal energy uptake during brain activation while fMRS gives also information about underlying metabolic processes that support the working brain.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine's {{status as}} a {{serotonin}} transporter (SERT) inhibitor at clinical doses in humans is uncertain. A PET imaging study on rhesus monkeys found that atomoxetine occupied >90% and >85% of neural NET and SERT, respectively. However, both mouse and rat <b>microdialysis</b> studies have failed to find an increase in extracellular serotonin in the prefrontal cortex following acute or chronic atomoxetine treatment. Supporting atomoxetine's selectivity, a human study found no effects on platelet serotonin uptake (a marker of SERT inhibition) and inhibition of the pressor effects of tyramine (a marker of NET inhibition).|$|E
25|$|Although glucose {{is usually}} {{assumed to be}} the main energy source for living tissues, there are some {{indications}} that it is lactate, and not glucose, that is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species (the notable ones being mice, rats, and humans). According to the lactate-shuttle hypothesis, glial cells are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Because of this local metabolic activity of glial cells, the extracellular fluid immediately surrounding neurons strongly differs in composition from the blood or cerebro-spinal fluid, being much richer with lactate, as was found in <b>microdialysis</b> studies.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to traditional imaging modalities, {{there are several}} devices that help to monitor brain injury and facilitate research. <b>Microdialysis</b> allows ongoing sampling of extracellular fluid for analysis of metabolites that might indicate ischemia or brain metabolism, such as glucose, glycerol, and glutamate. [...] Intraparenchymal brain tissue oxygen monitoring systems (either Licox or Neurovent-PTO) are used routinely in neurointensive care in the US. [...] A non invasive model called CerOx is in development.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding its {{application}} in fluorescent sensing of glucose, the first glucose biosensor by fluorescence, which, as mentioned, {{was made in}} 1982 {{by means of a}} [...] competition assay for the binding site of ConA, was entrapped in a sealed <b>microdialysis</b> tube, in the same lab, namely of J Schultz, in 2001 another study was published using <b>microdialysis</b> fibres using a [...] ConA sensor but with different labels and using sephadex instead of dextran (the former being several orders of magnitude larger). After, Dr. Ballastardt joined BioTex as a senior scientist under Dr Roger McNichols, the chief scientist, where {{for the past seven years}} they have been testing the previously mentioned FAS sensor, which used the same [...] system in a dialysis tube. To be specific, the labelled protein was loaded with a P10 tip into a dialysis tube 200µm wide that had been sealed with cyanoacrylate (superglue) at one end with or without an optic fibre end inserted inside.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exception}} to the usage of placing the optic fibre transdermally {{is seen in the}} previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a premade oxygen sensor with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a <b>microdialysis</b> catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems. The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal optic fibre and controlled magnetically. [...] As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen sensing probe by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials, nanoparticle formulation and the creation of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Microdialysis</b> is a minimally-invasive {{sampling}} technique {{that is used}} for continuous measurement of free, unbound analyte concentrations in the extracellular fluid of virtually any tissue. Analytes may include endogenous molecules (e.g. neurotransmitter, hormones, glucose, etc.) to assess their biochemical functions in the body, or exogenous compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to determine their distribution within the body. The <b>microdialysis</b> technique requires the insertion of a small <b>microdialysis</b> catheter (also referred to as <b>microdialysis</b> probe) into the tissue of interest. The <b>microdialysis</b> probe is designed to mimic a blood capillary and consists of a shaft with a semipermeable hollow fiber membrane at its tip, which is connected to inlet and outlet tubing. The probe is continuously perfused with an aqueous solution (perfusate) that closely resembles the (ionic) composition of the surrounding tissue fluid at a low flow rate of approximately 0.1-5μL/min. Once inserted into the tissue or (body)fluid of interest, small solutes can cross the semipermeable membrane by passive diffusion. The direction of the analyte flow {{is determined by the}} respective concentration gradient and allows the usage of <b>microdialysis</b> probes as sampling as well as delivery tools. The solution leaving the probe (dialysate) is collected at certain time intervals for analysis.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of probes with {{different}} membrane and shaft length combinations available. The molecular weight cutoff of commercially available <b>microdialysis</b> probes covers a wide range of approximately 6-100kD, but also 1MD is available. While water-soluble compounds generally diffuse freely across the <b>microdialysis</b> membrane, the situation is not as clear for highly lipophilic analytes, where both successful (e.g. corticosteroids) and unsuccessful <b>microdialysis</b> experiments (e.g. estradiol, fusidic acid) have been reported. [...] However, the recovery of water-soluble compounds usually decreases rapidly if the molecular weight of the analyte exceeds 25% of the membrane’s molecular weight cutoff.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microdialysis</b> {{has also}} found {{increasing}} application in environmental research, sampling {{a diversity of}} compounds from waste-water and soil solution, including saccharides, metal ions, organic acids, and low molecular weight nitrogen. Given the destructive nature of conventional soil sampling methods, <b>microdialysis</b> has potential to estimate fluxes of soil ions that better reflect an undisturbed soil environment.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{scientific}} {{advances in}} making <b>microdialysis</b> probes {{smaller and more}} efficient, the invasive nature of this technique still poses some practical and ethical limitations. For example, {{it has been shown}} that implantation of a <b>microdialysis</b> probe can alter tissue morphology resulting in disturbed microcirculation, rate of metabolism or integrity of physiological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier. While acute reactions to probe insertion, such as implantation traumas, require sufficient recovery time, additional factors, such as necrosis, inflammatory responses, or wound healing processes have to be taken into consideration for long-term sampling as they may influence the experimental outcome. From a practical perspective, it has been suggested to perform <b>microdialysis</b> experiments within an optimal time window, usually 24-48 hours after probe insertion.|$|E

5000|$|To date, <b>microdialysis</b> is {{the only}} {{sampling}} technique that can continuously monitor drug or metabolite concentrations in the extracellular fluid of virtually any tissue. Depending on the exact application, analyte concentrations can be monitored over several hours, days, or even weeks. Free, unbound extracellular tissue concentrations are in many cases of particular interest as they resemble pharmacologically active concentrations at or close {{to the site of}} action. Combination of <b>microdialysis</b> with modern imaging techniques, such positron emission tomography, further allow for determination of intracellular concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Another {{research}} {{technique that}} was used in determining the function of the MFB was <b>microdialysis.</b> Reinforcing electrical stimulation of the MFB using this method has shown to cause a release in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Other <b>microdialysis</b> studies that have been performed have shown that the presence of natural reinforcers such as food, water, and a sex partner, have found to cause a release in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This shows that the electrical stimulation of the MFB causes a similar effect compared to natural reinforcers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microdialysis</b> {{may also}} be used to {{separate}} nanoparticles from the solutions in which they were formed. In such a separation, the eluate will consist of non-complexed reactants and components.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{constant}} perfusion of the <b>microdialysis</b> probe with fresh perfusate, a total equilibrium cannot be established. This results in dialysate concentrations that are lower than those measured at the distant sampling site. In order to correlate concentrations measured in the dialysate with those present at the distant sampling site, a calibration factor (recovery) is needed. The recovery can be determined at steady-state using {{the constant}} rate of analyte exchange across the <b>microdialysis</b> membrane. The rate at which an analyte is exchanged across the semipermeable membrane is generally expressed as the analyte’s extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency {{is defined as the}} ratio between the loss/gain of analyte during its passage through the probe (Cin−Cout) and the difference in concentration between perfusate and distant sampling site (Cin−Csample).In theory, the extraction efficiency of a <b>microdialysis</b> probe can be determined by: 1) changing the drug concentrations while keeping the flow rate constant or 2) changing the flow rate while keeping the respective drug concentrations constant. At steady-state, the same extraction efficiency value is obtained, no matter if the analyte is enriched or depleted in the perfusate. [...] <b>Microdialysis</b> probes can consequently be calibrated by either measuring the loss of analyte using drug-containing perfusate or the gain of analyte using drug-containing sample solutions. To date, the most frequently used calibration methods are the low-flow-rate method, the no-net-flux method, the dynamic (extended) no-net-flux method, and the retrodialysis method. [...] The proper selection of an appropriate calibration method is critically important for the success of a <b>microdialysis</b> experiment. Supportive in vitro experiments prior to the use in animals or humans are therefore recommended. [...] In addition, the recovery determined in vitro may differ from the recovery in humans. Its actual value therefore needs to be determined in every in vivo experiment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>microdialysis</b> {{technique}} has undergone much development since its first use in 1972, {{when it was}} first employed to monitor concentrations of endogenous biomolecules in the brain. Today's area of application has expanded to monitoring free concentrations of endogenous as well as exogenous compounds in virtually any tissue. Although <b>microdialysis</b> is still primarily used in preclinical animal studies (e.g. laboratory rodents, dogs, sheep, pigs), it is now increasingly employed in humans to monitor free, unbound drug tissue concentrations as well as interstitial concentrations of regulatory cytokines and metabolites in response to homeostatic perturbations such as feeding and/or exercise.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{microfluidics}} and miniaturized probes, low-flow push-pull sampling was developed in 2002. By using flow rates of ~50 nL/min, this technique minimizes tissue damage while providing finer spatial resolution than <b>microdialysis</b> sampling.|$|E
50|$|During retrodialysis, the <b>microdialysis</b> probe is perfused with an analyte-containing {{solution}} and {{the disappearance of}} drug from the probe is monitored. The recovery for this method can be computed as the ratio of drug lost during passage (Cin−Cout) and drug entering the <b>microdialysis</b> probe (Cin). In principle, retrodialysis can be performed using either the analyte itself (retrodialysis by drug) or a reference compound (retrodialysis by calibrator) that closely resembles both the physiochemical and the biological properties of the analyte. Despite the fact that retrodialysis by drug cannot be used for endogenous compounds as it requires absence of analyte from the sampling site, this calibration method is most commonly used for exogenous compounds in clinical settings.|$|E
50|$|When {{employed}} in brain research, <b>microdialysis</b> {{is commonly used}} to measure neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA) and their metabolites, as well as small neuromodulators (e.g. cAMP, cGMP, NO), amino acids (e.g. glycine, cysteine, tyrosine), and energy substrates (e.g. glucose, lactate, pyruvate). Exogenous drugs to be analyzed by <b>microdialysis</b> include new antidepressants, antipsychotics, and many other drugs that have their pharmacological effect site in the brain. Applications in other organs include the skin (assessment of bioavailability and bioequivalence of topically applied dermatological drug products), and monitoring of glucose concentrations in patients with diabetes (intravascular or subcutaneous probe placement). The latter may even be incorporated into an artificial pancreas system for automated insulin administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microdialysis</b> {{can produce}} {{crystals}} by salting out, employing {{high concentrations of}} salt or other small membrane-permeable compounds that decrease the solubility of the protein. Very occasionally, some proteins can be crystallized by dialysis salting in, by dialyzing against pure water, removing solutes, driving self-association and crystallization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microdialysis</b> takes {{advantage}} of a semi-permeable membrane, across which small molecules and ions can pass, while proteins and large polymers cannot cross. By establishing a gradient of solute concentration across the membrane and allowing the system to progress toward equilibrium, the system can slowly move toward supersaturation, at which point protein crystals may form.|$|E
50|$|Atomoxetine's {{status as}} a SERT {{inhibitor}} at clinical doses in humans is uncertain. A PET imaging study on rhesus monkeys found that atomoxetine occupied >90% and >85% of neural norepinephrine and serotonin transporters, respectively.

5000|$|Exchange of analyte {{across the}} {{semipermeable}} membrane and constant {{replacement of the}} sampling fluid with fresh perfusate prevents drainage of fluid from the sampling site, which allows sampling without fluid loss. <b>Microdialysis</b> can consequently be used without disturbing the tissue conditions by local fluid loss or pressure artifacts, which can occur when using other techniques, such as microinjection or push-pull perfusion.|$|E

50|$|Recently, twenty {{patients}} with cold contact urticaria (CCU) {{were included in}} a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. They received placebo, 20, 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods. The primary variable was change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT). Secondary variables were changes in pruritus, levels of histamine, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α collected by skin <b>microdialysis</b> and safety and tolerability of bilastine. At doses of 20 mg was highly effective (P < 0.0001) in reducing CTT. Up-dosing to 80 mg significantly (P < 0.04) increased its effectiveness. At this dose, 19 of 20 (95%) patients responded to treatment, with 12 of 20 (60%) becoming symptom free. Only one patient was refractory to treatment. <b>Microdialysis</b> levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1-3 h after cold challenge (4 °C) were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine.

50|$|Push-pull {{perfusion}} is an in vivo {{sampling method}} {{most commonly used}} for measuring neurotransmitters in the brain. Developed by J.H. Gaddum in 1960, this technique replaced the cortical cup technique for observing neurotransmitters. The advent of concentric <b>microdialysis</b> probes in the 1980s resulted in push-pull sampling falling out of favor, as such probes require less monitoring, and are less invasive than the higher flow rate push-pull probes (>10 microliter/min), which could result in lesions if flow is unbalanced.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microdialysis</b> has a {{relatively}} low temporal and spatial resolution compared to, for example, electrochemical biosensors. While the temporal resolution {{is determined by the}} length of the sampling intervals (usually a few minutes), the spatial resolution is determined by the dimensions of the probe. The probe size can vary between different areas of application and covers a range of a few millimeters (intracerebral application) up to a few centimeters (subcutaneous application) in length and a few hundred micrometers in diameter.|$|E
