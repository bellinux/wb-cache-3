25|$|Considered to be a <b>mental</b> <b>workspace</b> {{enabling}} {{temporary storage}} and retrieval of information, working memory {{is crucial to}} problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|E
40|$|The {{brain is}} a vastly complex and {{interconnected}} information processing network 1, 2. In humans, this network supports a <b>mental</b> <b>workspace</b> that enables {{a range of}} flexible cognitive abilities such as scientific and artistic creativity 3. A central theoretical and technical challenge facing neuroscience is to study the neural basis of the complex cognitive processes enabled by this network 1. Can such cognition be explained by activity in isolated brain regions, or does it require information processing that is distributed throughout the brain 4, 5 ? How does {{the flow of information}} between network nodes contribute to specific cognitive functions 6, 7 ? Current approaches have limited ability to answer these questions 8. Here we develop new multivariate methods to study information flow across the <b>mental</b> <b>workspace</b> network as participants manipulate visual imagery. We find that mental representations share a common format throughout the cortex and are driven by the distributed flow of information. Manipulation of mental representations also entails distributed processing but with sparser sharing and flow of information. Manipulation of visual imagery entails activity in a neural network extending throughout the cerebral cortex and associated structures 9. To investigate how this network functions in bot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Cognitive {{component}} analysis, {{defined as}} an unsupervised learning of features resembling human comprehension, suggests that the sensory structures we perceive might often be modeled by reducing dimensionality and treating objects {{in space and time}} as linear mixtures incorporating sparsity and independence. In music as well as language the patterns we come across become part of our <b>mental</b> <b>workspace</b> when the bottom-up sensory input raises above the background noise of core affect, and top-down trigger distinct feelings reflecting a shift of our attention. And as both low-level semantics and our emotional responses can be encoded in words, we propose a simplified cognitive approach to model how we perceive media. Representing song lyrics in a vector space of reduced dimensionality using LSA, we combine bottom-up defined term distances with affective adjectives, that top-down constrain the latent semantics according to the psychological dimensions of valence and arousal. Subsequently we apply a Tucker tensor decomposition combined with re-weighted l 1 regularization and a Bayesian ARD automatic relevance determination approach to derive a sparse representation of complementary affective mixtures, which we suggest function as cognitive components for perceiving the underlying structure in lyrics.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that older adults are especially susceptible to proactive interference (PI) {{and that this}} may contribute to age differences in working memory performance. In young adults, individual differences in PI affect both working memory and reasoning ability, but the relations between PI, working memory, and reasoning in older adults have not been examined. In the current study, young, old, and very old adults performed a modified operation span task that induced several cycles of PI buildup and release {{as well as two}} tests of abstract reasoning ability. Age differences in working memory scores increased as PI built up, consistent with the hypothesis that older adults are more susceptible to PI, but both young and older adults showed complete release from PI. Young adults ’ reasoning ability was best predicted by working memory performance under high PI conditions, replicating M. Bunting (2006). In contrast, older adults ’ reasoning ability was best predicted by their working memory performance under low PI conditions, thereby raising questions regarding the general role of susceptibility to PI in differences in higher cognitive function among older adults. The working memory system is often described as a <b>mental</b> <b>workspace</b> used for the temporar...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{accounts}} of pretense have been underdescribed {{in a number}} of ways. In this paper, we present a much more explicit cognitive account of pretense. We begin by describing a number of real examples of pretense in children and adults. These examples bring out several features of pretense that any adequate theory of pretense must accommodate, and we use these features to develop our theory of pretense. On our theory, pretense representations are contained in a separate <b>mental</b> <b>workspace,</b> a Possible World Box {{which is part of the}} basic architecture of the human mind. The representations in the Possible World Box can have the same content as beliefs. Indeed, we suggest that pretense representations are in the same representational ``code' ' as beliefs and that the representations in the Possible World Box are processed by the same inference and UpDating mechanisms that operate over real beliefs. Our model also posits a Script Elaborator which is implicated in the embellishment that occurs in pretense. Finally, we claim that the behavior that is seen in pretend play is motivated not from a ``pretend desire'', but from a real desire to act in a way that ®ts the description being constructed in the Possible World Box. We maintain that this account can accommodate the central features of pretense exhibited in the examples of pretense, and we argue that the alternative accounts either can't accommodate or fail to address entirely some of th...|$|E
40|$|To {{be capable}} of {{thinking}} creatively, a person must absorb information (such as form, shape, sound, etc) via {{one or more of}} the senses, and then reinterpret this information to form a novel idea, or an image in their minds. This task requires them to suppress their initial interpretations of the information that has entered through the senses, and rework the information into something new. As this task is performed in the mind, it requires a <b>mental</b> <b>workspace</b> in which the information can be manipulated in order to produce new ideas (just as an architect would require a drawing board to sketch his ideas). The study reported in this paper is an investigation into the role of working memory in supporting, and in constraining, the ability to think creatively. In order to ascertain whether there was a link between working memory capacity and ability to think creatively, and also to determine the nature of such a link, a total of thirty participants (twelve male, eighteen female) were individually presented with three tests designed to indicate their working memory capacity (namely, sentence span, digit span, and word span), and then asked to complete a mental synthesis task comprising of ten trials (devised as a measure of their ability to think creatively) in which their task was to mentally construct an image from sets of presented alphanumeric and geometric shape/ characters. The results of the present study showed that participants’ scores on the tests of working memory capacity were positively correlated to their scores on the mental synthesis task. In other words, those participants with greater working memory capacity seemed to show greater ability to think creatively then those with lower working memory capacitie...|$|E
