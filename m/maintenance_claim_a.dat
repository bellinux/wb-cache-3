40|$|Software <b>maintenance</b> <b>claims</b> <b>a</b> large {{proportion}} of organizational resources. It is thought that many maintenance problems derive from inadequate software design and development practices. Poor design choices can result in complex software that is costly to support and difficult to change. However, {{it is difficult to}} assess the actual maintenance performance effects of software development practices because their impact is realized over the software life cycle. To estimate the impact of development activities in a more practical time frame, this research develops a two-stage model in which software complexity is a key intermediate variable that links design and development decisions to their downstream effects on software maintenance. The research analyzes data collected from a national mass merchandising retailer on 29 software enhancement projects and 23 software applications in a large IBM COBOL environment. Results indicate that the use of a code generator in development is associated with increased software complexity and software enhancement project effort. The use of packaged software is associated with decreased software complexity and software enhancement effort. These results suggest an important link between software development practices and maintenance performance.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of unworthiness to inherit in Book 4 of the (new) Dutch Civil Code (2003) occasioned numerous {{interpretation and application}} challenges to Dutch courts, notaries and inheritance scholars. These challenges correspond greatly {{with many of the}} contentious issues regarding unworthiness to inherit in modern South African law. This article investigates certain aspects of the Dutch legal position with a view to commenting on, and suggesting solutions to, corresponding challenges in the South African context. Issues such as the effect of unworthiness to inherit on matrimonial property claims as well as <b>maintenance</b> <b>claims</b> against <b>a</b> deceased estate, the suitability and appropriateness for South African law of a “forgiveness provision” that eliminates unworthiness similar to the one included in the Book 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and the {{regulation of}} unworthiness to inherit in the context of euthanasia are analysed from a legal-comparative standpoint...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} {{time and money}} spent by various states investigating mounting financial problems in workers' compensation in recent years, {{we still do not}} know very much about the causes of the problems. An important reason for this has been that the debate in Australia has suffered from a number of misconceptions and lack of analytical rigour. This article outlines how some basic economics can provide a framework for analysing many issues in the workers' compensation debate. In doing so the analysis casts doubt on a number of conventional wisdoms, particularly the belief that employers pay for workers' compensation and the assumption that current levels of government involvement in worker disability insurance arrangements are justified. In addition, data from New South Wales are presented that suggest the main reason for increased costs is higher income <b>maintenance</b> payment per <b>claim.</b> <b>As</b> with overseas experience, higher benefit levels appear to give workers more incentive to stay away from work and make claims for injuries whose severity is harder to measure.

40|$|Currently, lack of {{preventive}} measure {{is the problem}} that implicates poor maintenance outcome. Scheduled <b>maintenance</b> is <b>claimed</b> as <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> strategy to tackle the problem. However, the effectiveness of scheduled maintenance can be greatly influenced by the length of predetermined maintenance interval. Thus, this paper aims to study the relationship between length of predetermined maintenance interval and maintenance performance. The literature review identifies the length of predetermined maintenance interval as an importance characteristic of scheduled maintenance strategy. A quantitative approach is adopted and carried out through questionnaire survey. Subsequently, descriptive analysis and correlation analysis are used to analyse the collected data. Then, research result demonstrates that the length of predetermined maintenance interval is significantly correlated to the maintenance performance. The length of predetermined maintenance interval {{must be considered in}} maintenance planning and execution. The research recommends continuous monitoring or regular inspection of building systems and components to identify their condition and update the length of predetermined maintenance interval regularly. Consequently, the effective maintenance execution helps to avoid systems failure occurs and optimises maintenance performance...|$|R
40|$|On 1 July 2007 section 17 of the Children’s Act 38 of 2005 {{came into}} operation.

This reduction in the age of majority had several repercussions for young dependent adults between the ages of 18 to 20.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 Freedom of testation {{is a well}} {{established}} principle in South Africa although there are certain restrictions thereto such as the creation of fideicommissa in regard to fixed property and statutory limitations such as the Maintenance of the Surviving Spouses Act 27 of 1990. It appears that a divorced spouse is in certain circumstances {{in a better position}} than the surviving spouse - a position that appears to be unsatisfactory. The Act brought about an improvement for the surviving spouse who has been disinherited or for whom there has not been sufficiently catered for where there is in fact a need for maintenance. The principle of the Act is based on the need for maintenance by the surviving spouse. It is clear from the Act that the executor has the power to enter into agreements with the surviving spouse, heirs and legatees in terms of which assets may be transferred contrary to the will of the deceased. His assets may be transferred to a trust or the assets may be burdened by certain restrictive rights imposed on them in which case the beneficiary and heir's rights to deal with them are limited. The <b>claim</b> of <b>a</b> surviving spouse ranks concurrent with the claim of minor children for maintenance but does not compete with <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> by creditors of the estate. Estate planners must at all times keep the will of the testator in mind. Should a surviving spouse be disinherited or have received insufficient inheritance to provide for <b>maintenance,</b> the <b>claim</b> of <b>a</b> surviving spouse may have a detrimental effect on the intention of the testator and estate plan of the deceased.

40|$|Die onderwerp wat in hierdie artikel bespreek word, is in die Suid-Afrikaanse reg relatief nuut en onontwikkeld. In hierdie artikel word verwysings na stieffamilieverhoudings beperk tot gevalle waar die biologiese ouer met haar of sy kinders in 'n huwelik of burgerlike vennootskap met 'n persoon wat nie 'n biologiese ouer is nie in 'n gemeenskaplike huishouding betrokke is. Sedert die beslissing van Heystek v Heystek, is hierdie aspek in Botha v Botha en in MB v NB in oënskou geneem. Die doel met hierdie artikel is om opnuut na die regsfundering van so 'n "aanspraak" binne die Suid-Afrikaanse reg te kyk. Die artikel word in vier hoofdele verdeel. Eerstens, sal die verskillende regsteoretiese funderings van die onderhoudsplig beskryf word. Daarna word die bespreking opgevolg deur 'n bondige bespreking van buitelandse reg, waarna die Suid-Afrikaanse reg as derde hoofdeel van nader beskou sal word. Die artikel word deur 'n slotbeskouing afgesluit. In {{this article}} the {{foundation}} of <b>a</b> step-child's <b>claim</b> for <b>maintenance</b> against <b>a</b> step-parent is investigated. Primarily three foundations for <b>a</b> child's <b>maintenance</b> <b>claim</b> are revealed namely the formalistic and status based justification; {{the best interests of}} the child justification; and the functional justification. The first mentioned justification does not apply as foundation for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>claim</b> of the stepchild against the step-parent because the step-parent is not the natural or putative parent. The second justification focuses on the economic needs of children and the economic dislocation they suffer when formerly relied support from a step-parent is lost. The last justification pays attention to the social reality of relationships rather than to the formal characteristics thereof. Two reasons are given why the last mentioned justification applies to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>claim</b> of step-children. One, harm and compensation may serve as basis for the liability to pay maintenance. Two, the case where the step-parent takes over the role of parent the in loco parentis principle may serve as a foundation. The comparative law investigation reveals that the majority of foreign country systems grounds the claim on the in loco parentis principle. Different foundations for the claim are found in South African case law. The fact that the parties are married makes them liable for the maintenance of the common household. Two foundational possibilities arise from this. One, the consortium of the marriage grounds the maintenance obligation which is without any foundation in our law. Two, the obligation is founded upon the purchase for household necessaries. In a legal theoretical sense this is unacceptable because there are fundamental differences between the capacity to purchase household necessaries and <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for <b>maintenance.</b> Section 28 (1) (b) and (2) of the constitution are tabled as foundation for the claim. The fact that the step-parent acts in loco parentis grounds the obligation. Lastly, de facto adoption is also forwarded as foundation. The call on different justifications creates confusion and results in different answers. The maintenance of a child must primarily serve to satisfy the financial needs of the child and should focus less on the psychic and psychological support of the child. However, the economic reliance of the child on the support should also not be ignored. Therefore a combination of the reliance based justification and the in loco parentis foundation is advocated which I think is achieved in the MB case where section 28 (1) (b) of the constitution in combination with the in loco parentis principle was applied.
