Later research proved the equipment was manufactured correctly, installed correctly, and similar to later successful factories; the difference {{was the lack of}} experienced operators, especially for boiling sugar in the vacuum pan. The two missing steps were an inadequate speed on the vacuum pump, and a <b>missing</b> <b>graining</b> step to produce sugar crystals. The operation was also likely abandoned due to the declining finances of the LDS Church and the Utah War of 1857, as well as Young's poor ability to handle criticism.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCompressive {{failure of}} brittle {{materials}} is driven primarily by crack growth from pre-existing {{flaws in the}} material. These flaws, such as grain boundaries, pores, preexisting cracks, inclusions and <b>missing</b> <b>grains,</b> are randomly spaced and {{have a range of}} possible shapes and sizes. The current work proposes a micromechanics-based model for compressive dynamic failure of brittle materials with circular pore flaws, which incorporates both the number density and the size distribution of flaws. Results show that the distribution of flaw sizes is very important, particularly at moderate strain rate, since analyses based solely on the mean flaw size overpredict strength. Therefore, in order to increase dynamic strength at low to moderate strain rates, it is most effective to control the presence of large flaws. At very high strain rates, however, crack growth is activated even in small flaws and therefore controlling the total number density rather than the size of the flaws is effective for increasing dynamic strength. Finally, the model shows that neglecting very small flaws in the pore population may not have significant effects on the results in many cases, suggesting that the model is a useful tool for identifying a minimum resolution required for experimental characterization of microstructure...|$|R

Objective {{of this study was to}} present biometrical options of overcoming the problem of <b>missing</b> values for <b>grain</b> yield in 22 maize trials (FAO 200) planted in 2001 in Osijek, Croatia. Although this year was favourable for maize production, total of 63. 6 % of trials had missing values. Method of least squares was used to estimate missing data. A simulated increasing of missing values (more than 5) affect the systematic increase of genotype mean squares. This method is useful if trials consist less than 10 % missing values, since the bias due, to overestimated genotype mean squares becomes intolerable...|$|R

The young man is discouraged because he believes it impossible to gather all of the grain {{from the ground and}} he lies down and falls asleep shortly.

Superconductivity arises at 23 K by Co substitution {{at the site}} of Fe atoms and upper critical field is estimated 102 T by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula. The flux-flow activation energy (U 0 /kB) varies from 3230 K and 4190 K in the field of 1 T and 9 T respectively. At 2 K, the Jc is found to be approximately 4 x 10 ^ 3 A/cm^ 2 and 0. 3 x 10 ^ 3 A/cm&^ 2 in zero and 6 T field, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows an amorphous region surrounding around most of the grains which is likely to be present in the form of amorphous and weak link grain boundaries in this compound. It seems that most of the current is hindered by <b>miss</b> aligned <b>grains,</b> amorphous grain boundaries and impurities, which are invariably found between the grains. Presence of the weakly linked granules and their weakly pinned intergranular Josephson vortices are responsible for both low Jc and the Arrhenius temperature dependence of resistivityComment: 10 pages, 10 figures, to be published in Supercond.

40|$|Mechanization of rice cultivation, {{including}} transplanting, {{is spreading}} in Bangladesh {{in order to}} reduce the cost of production, the need for labour and to increase productivity of rice cultivation. Quality seedlings are a key factor for the success of mechanical rice transplanting. Seeding density in the seedling tray has considerable influence on seedling quality, and hence on plant establishment and the percentage of missing hills in the field after transplanting. There are combined effects of seedling adjustment options of the rice transplanter and seedling density on number of plants per hills and percentage of <b>missing</b> hills. Rice <b>grain</b> size and shape in terms of length, breadth and length-breath ratio differs among rice varieties. Based on size and shape, rice grain can be classified as bold, medium and slender, long and extra long (Belsnio, 1992). This study, conducted during the irrigated dry season of 2013 - 14, aimed to identify the optimum seed rate for quality seedlings production to minimize the percentage of missing hills. In addition, suitable seedling adjustment option of the rice transplanter for different seedling densities were identified to maintain optimum numbers of seedlings per stock (plants/hill) by the rotary picker of the transplanter...|$|R
40|$|Detrital {{studies that}} utilise zircon U-Pb geochronology and fission-track (FT) thermochronometry {{are subject to}} a range of {{potential}} sources of bias that should be properly evaluated and minimised. Some of them are common to any single-grain mineral analysis (e. g., variable bedrock mineral fertility, hydraulic sorting during transport, selective grain loss during sample processing), whereas others are intrinsic to zircon, and are related to radiation damage and age discordance. In this article, we quantify the impact of intrinsic bias on detrital studies thanks to the analysis of modern detritus shed from the European Alps, and illustrate the general implications on geological interpretations. We show that detrital zircon U-Pb age distributions based on statistically robust datasets are highly reproducible and representative of the parent bedrock ages in the catchment. Arbitrary or selective removal of discordant grain ages can be minimised by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to identify an appropriate cutoff level. Loss of metamict (Î±-damaged) zircon has a minor impact on data representativeness, and is mainly controlled by regional metamorphism rather than by mechanical abrasion during river transport. Zircon FT grain-age distributions were found to have poor reproducibility, although age spectra are consistent with bedrock data. However, unlike the U-Pb datasets, U-rich zircon grains (> 1000 ppm) are systematically <b>missed,</b> and undatable <b>grains</b> may exceed 50...|$|R
40|$|Background: Obesity {{prevalence}} in United States {{children ages}} 2 - 19 {{years has been}} consistently high since 2003. 1 These children are at a greater risk for many chronic disease. Educating children {{on how to make}} healthful food choices, and using fun characters in a classroom setting may be one step to reducing the obesity rate. Objective: Increase knowledge about MyPlate and heathy eating in children in kindergarten through fifth grade. Design: After the development of a nutrition lesson, an expert panel reviewed and suggested changes. Once changes were made the lesson was delivered to second and third graders at a summer camp. Data were analyzed to determine if an increase in nutrition knowledge existed. Participants: Six members of an expert panel, 6 second graders, and 8 third graders. Statistical Analysis: Means and standard deviations of the expert panelâs rating were calculated. Percentages of students answering nutrition questions correctly were analyzed and compared from a pre- and post- evaluation. Results: The expert panel rated the lesson met the objectives, was age appropriate and clear, provided an overview of MyPlate, and followed the Experiential Learning Model. Second graders increased their ability to identify foods from the grain group (+ 16. 7 %) and protein group (+ 16. 6 %). Third graders increased their ability to correctly identify the number of food groups in a meal (23. 2 %), and identify the <b>missing</b> food group <b>grain</b> (12. 5 %) and vegetable (12. 5 %). Conclusions: The expert panel was a key component to developing the MyPlate lesson. A small increase in knowledge was seen through this lesson, students were engaged and learned about making healthy choices. Adviser: Julie Albrech...|$|R
