40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThis study was conducted to compare the suppressive effects of calcium carbonate and calcium citrate on bone resorption in early postmenopause. Calcium citrate is thought to be better absorbed. We therefore tested the hypothesis that calcium as citrate is more effective than calcium as carbonate in suppressing parathyroid hormone (PTH) and C-terminal telopeptide. Twenty-five healthy postmenopausal women were recruited in this double blind crossover study. The subjects were randomly allocated to receive either 1, 000 <b>mg</b> of elemental <b>calcium</b> as carbonate or 500 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> as citrate. They were given the alternate calcium dose 1 week later. Serum measurements of total and ionized calcium, phosphate, PTH, and CrossLaps were repeated 12 hours after each dose. Analysis of variance found no significant difference between measures for the two salts. Tests for equivalence indicated that 500 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> citrate may be superior to 1, 000 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> carbonate in raising serum total and ionized calcium (P = 0. 04 and 0. 05, respectively). For all parameters measured, 500 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> citrate was at least as beneficial as 1, 000 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> carbonate. Calcium citrate is at least as effective as calcium carbonate in suppressing PTH and C-terminal telopeptide cross-links, at half the dose. This may be because calcium as citrate is better absorbed than calcium as carbonate. If calcium citrate can be used in lower doses, it may be better tolerated than calcium carbonate. Sunethra D. C.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Strontium-specific {{extraction}} columns from Eichrom Technologies {{have been}} used for the determination of 90 Sr in wet deposition and in soil in our laboratory. For these determinations, the prepacked 2 -mL columns were tested for the breakthrough of strontium with 20 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> and 2 <b>mg</b> of strontium carrier as well as 40 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> and 2 <b>mg</b> of stron-tium carrier. The column was suitable for this method with the elution volumes we used for soil and wet deposition and with 20 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium,</b> but a breakthrough was observed with 40 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium.</b> Due to the low calcium concentration in wet dep-osition and soil, the 90 Sr analysis was possible with 2 -mL columns and specific elution volumes. For 90 Sr determination in milk samples, the calcium content of the milk is too high. Thus, the method was optimized by reducing the elution volumes to double the calcium concentration, which could be loaded onto the column without breakthrough. With these modifications, a lower limit of detection (LLD) of 0. 12 Bq/L could be obtained. A monitoring program of raw cow milk in Austria is con-ducted with regard to the commission recommendation on the application of Article 36 of the Euratom Treaty concerning the monitoring of the levels of radioactivity in the environment for the purpose of assessing the exposure of the population as a whole (2000 / 473 /Euratom). The defined reporting level of 90 Sr in milk is 0. 2 Bq/L.

40|$|Bone {{resorption}} {{follows a}} circadian rhythm that peaks at night, reflecting the circadian rhythm of serum parathyroid hormone. Our previous studies in early postmenopausal women have established that 1000 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> given at 9 p. m. reduced bone resorption markers overnight, but not during the day. In contrast, 1000 mg given as a divided dose (500 mg doses at 9 a. m. and 9 p. m. each) reduced bone resorption markers during the day, but not during the night. We have now evaluated {{the effect of}} 1500 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> given as a divided dose of 500 mg {{in the morning and}} 1000 mg in the evening on bone resorption. We studied 26 healthy women (median age 56 years) whose menopause was less than five years before. On two days, urine was collected from 9 a. m. to 9 p. m. (day collection), and from 9 p. m. to 9 a. m. (night collection); a further fasting (spot) urine sample was obtained at 9 a. m. {{at the end of the}} night collection. On the second day, 500 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> in the carbonate form was taken at 9 a. m. (at the start of the collection) and a further 1000 mg at 9 p. m. (at the start of the second night collection). Calcium supplementation decreased urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPyr/Cr) during the day (p = 0. 08) and night (p < 0. 05), as well as urinary pyridinoline (Pyr/Cr) both by day (p < 0. 05) and night (p < 0. 001). There were also decreases in urine hydroxyproline. We conclude that the acute administration of 500 <b>mg</b> of <b>calcium</b> in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening to early postmenopausal women suppresses bone resorption markers during both the day and night.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to assess whether the epidemiologic data support a relation between dietary calcium intake and blood pressure, to obtain a quantitative estimate of the difference in blood pressure for a given difference in dietary calcium intake, and to assess the public health implications. A meta-analysis of published data (January 1983 to November 1993) that investigated the association between dietary calcium intake and blood pressure in different populations around the world was performed. Of 63 population studies identified, 23 were suitable for a quantitative overview (total n = 38, 950). Unadjusted regression coefficients (95 % confidence intervals) were obtained. Pooled unadjusted regression coefficients (95 % confidence inter-vals) were then computed weighting each individual study by the inverse of its variance. Tests of heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis were carried out, and the possibility of publication bias was assessed. The regression coefficients ranged between- 9. 40 and 1. 63 mmHg/ 100 <b>mg</b> <b>calcium</b> for systolic blood pressure and between- 4. 90 and 0. 47 for diastolic blood pressure.
