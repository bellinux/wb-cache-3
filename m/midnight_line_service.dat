50|$|After a {{break of}} almost two months, Glorosia was stepped up in class for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 11 September. Starting at odds of 100/30 she stayed {{on in the}} closing stages without looking likely to win and {{finished}} third behind the favourite <b>Midnight</b> <b>Line</b> and Flawless. Seventeen days later the filly was moved up in class again for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse and started 10/1 fourth choice in the betting behind the Henry Cecil-trained pair Jibe and <b>Midnight</b> <b>Line</b> and the Michael Stoute-trained Exclusive. Dettori tracked the leaders before sending the filly into the lead two furlongs out. The race behind the leader became rather rough, with both Jibe and <b>Midnight</b> <b>Line</b> meeting interference as they attempted to obtain a clear run. Glorosia however, kept on well and stayed on well to win by three quarters of length from Jibe, with two lengths back to Exclusive in third.|$|R

5000|$|With Cape Verdi {{aimed at}} the Derby, the Henry Cecil-trained <b>Midnight</b> <b>Line</b> was made {{favourite}} for the Oaks ahead of Godolphin's Musidora Stakes winner Bahr, with Shahtoush starting at odds of 12/1. Kinane restrained the Irish filly {{in the early stages}} before moving forward in the straight and accelerating past <b>Midnight</b> <b>Line</b> and Bahr a furlong from the finish. As the favourite weakened, the closing stages of the race devolved into a contest between Shahtoush and Bahr, with the Irish filly prevailing by three quarters of a length. Shahtoush's finishing burst appeared to catch Bahr's jockey Frankie Dettori by surprise and Kinane's ride on the winner was described as a [...] "tactical masterclass" [...] by the Independent. Aidan O'Brien, who was winning the Oaks with his first ever runner at the course, explained Shahtoush's improvement by stating that she had been unable to show her best on firm ground in her previous race.|$|R
