40|$|Contemporary {{networks}} accommodate {{handling of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>priorities,</b> aiming to provide suitable QoS levels to different traffic classes. In {{the presence of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>priorities,</b> a scheduling algorithm is employed to select each time the next packet to transmit over the data link. Class-based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ) scheduling and its variations is widely used as a scheduling technique, since {{it is easy to}} implement and prevents the low-priority queues from being completely neglected during periods of high-priority traffic. By using this scheduling, low-priority queues have the opportunity to transmit packets even though the high-priority queues are not empty. In this work, the modeling, analysis and performance evaluation of a single-buffered, dual-priority multistage interconnection network (MIN) operating under the CBWFQ scheduling policy is presented. Performance evaluation is conducted through simulation, and the performance measures obtained can be valuable assets for MIN designers, in order to minimize the overall deployment costs and delivering efficient systems...|$|E

The question is how companies reduce their trade-offs to successfully compete on <b>multiple</b> competitive <b>priorities</b> simultaneously. We address this question by theorising that bundles of action programmes are needed to reduce trade-offs between competitive priorities. We examine four Swiss manufacturing plants and show how the selection of action programmes influences the simultaneous competition on <b>multiple</b> competitive <b>priorities.</b> We show that successful competition on <b>multiple</b> competitive <b>priorities</b> does not happen by accident but is achieved by aligning competitive priorities, action programmes, infrastructural/structural changes and contextual factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We report {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} class of call admission control (CAC) algorithms designed for servicing <b>multiple</b> <b>priority</b> classes in wireless networks {{with the goal of}} quality of service (QoS) satisfaction and reward optimization. By reward, we mean some sort of “value” obtained by the system as a result of servicing <b>multiple</b> <b>priority</b> classes. In this paper we design and evaluate the performance of a new algorithm, elastic threshold-based CAC, in terms of the maximum reward obtainable with QoS satisfaction from servicing <b>multiple</b> <b>priority</b> classes with distinct QoS requirements, and compare it with existing partitioning, threshold, and spillover CAC algorithms. We also develop a heuristic-based search method to determine the best threshold-value sets used for multiple service classes by sequentially adjusting these thresholds based on the total reward and rejection rate vs. QoS constraints of each service class. We demonstrate through test cases and simulation that elastic threshold-based CAC outperforms existing CAC algorithms for QoS satisfaction and reward optimization in solution optimality for serving multiple QoS service classes in wireless networks.

40|$|Buffered {{crossbars}} provide {{several advantages}} over unbuffered ones; {{one of them}} is that they can directly switch variable-size packets. The first part of this report considers several issues that arise when designing a variable-packet-size buffered crossbar with considerable Round-Trip Time: (1) we observe that an acknowledgment semantics for credits reduces the backpressure communication overhead and the storage of credits within the crossbar chip; (2) we show that cut-through can be implemented at the crosspoints and we discuss for a reasonable crosspoint buffer size under cut-through and store&forward; (3) we present a novel architecture for scheduling the operations at the contention points. The second part is concerned with the crosspoint queuing organization when handling <b>multiple</b> <b>priorities.</b> In buffered crossbars, separate buffers/queues (or lanes) per priority at each crosspoint are required to prevent HOL blocking and buffer hogging. In this report we propose a buffered crossbar that effectively supports <b>multiple</b> <b>priorities</b> with only two such lanes per crosspoint, even with no internal speed-up. Our method maps packets to crosspoint lanes using adaptive criteria, and dynamically changes the effective priority of crosspoint queues.

40|$|The IEEE 802. 6 {{standard}} for Metropolitan Area Networks {{does not provide}} <b>multiple</b> <b>priority</b> traffic for connectionless data services. A priority mechanism that was considered in earlier versions of the standard showed to be not effective. As of now, there exists no protocol for multiple access dual bus networks that is able to implement pre-emptive priorities and, at the same time, can satisfy minimal fairness requirements for transmissions at the highest priority level. In this study, a protocol with strictly pre-emptive priorities, i. e., a protocol that does not admit low priority traffic if the load from high priority traffic exceeds {{the capacity of the}} transmission channel, is presented. In addition, the protocol guarantees fairness for transmissions at the highest priority level. By introducing a general characterization of bandwidth allocation schemes for dual bus networks, existing priority mechanisms can be categorized according to the provided quality of service. The unique existence of a bandwidth allocation scheme for <b>multiple</b> <b>priority</b> traffic is shown with a full utilization of the channel capacity, with a fair distribution of bandwidth respective to traffic from a particular priority level and with pre-emptive priorities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{proposes a}} biased random key genetic {{algorithm}} (BRKGA) for solving a <b>multiple</b> <b>priorities</b> task scheduling problem. Generally, some chromosomes are initially generated by encoding as key vectors of real value between [0, 1] in BRKGA process. To obtain the solution, the chromosome {{has to be}} decoded. The <b>multiple</b> <b>priorities</b> task scheduling problem, which needs to schedule strips of Earth observation before sending the sequence to the satellite, is considered in this work. Strips are required from customers with different priorities and each strip has its own priority. The objective of this scheduling problem is to minimize the finishing date for taking all strips. For encoding, each gene in the chromosome represents each strip. The gene value of each strip is a real number in different intervals depending on the priority of related strip. Let si be a strip with priority P[i], where i ϵ { 1, 2,…, n} and P[i] ϵ { 1, 2,…, np}, n is number of strips and np is number of different priorities. Thus, gene values of strip si with priority P[i] is a real value in the interval [(P[i]- 1) /np, P[i] / np). For decoding, the sequence of strip acquisition {{can be obtained from}} the represented gene values. The strip with the lowest gene value is considered firstly. It is assigned in the sequence of strip acquisition as early as possible and it must also satisfy the constraints. Then, the strip with the next higher gene value is considered and it can be inserted to the available spaces of the sequence that satisfy the constraints. Moreover, the considered strip is assigned in the sequence as early as possible. Experiments are conducted on a realistic instance, which concerns strips with two different priorities.
