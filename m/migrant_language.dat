50|$|There is no {{consensus}} as to whether Brahui is a relatively recent language introduced into Balochistan or remnant of an older widespread Dravidian language family. According to Josef Elfenbein (1989), the most common {{theory is that the}} Brahui were part of a Dravidian invasion of north-western India in 3rd millennium BC, but unlike other Dravidians who migrated to the south, they remained in Sarawan and Jahlawan since before 2000 BC. However, some other scholars see it as a recent <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> to its present region. They postulate, that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from central India after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a Northwestern Iranian language, and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE. One scholar places the migration as late as the 13th or 14th century.|$|E

In particular, relatively little has been written about how Polish migrants describe or refer to ‘visible’ difference in terms of ethnicity, nationality, religion, class and gender. This reflects a broader tendency in migration studies to frequently overlook the production and transnational transfer of <b>migrant</b> <b>language.</b> In this article, I explore how Polish post- 2004 migrants to the northern English city of Leeds produce ‘the language of difference’ and how this <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> is passed on to non-migrants in Poland. I distinguish two types of language of difference – the language of stigma and the language of respect. I note that migrants construct both speech normativities through engaging with rhetoric existing in the Polish and/or the UK context as well as through developing ‘migrant slang’ of difference. I further argue that the language of stigma and the language of respect are transferred to Poland via the agency of migrants. The article draws upon a broader study of Polish migrants’ values and attitudes towards difference and the circulation of ideas between these migrants and their family members and friends in Poland. It contributes to emerging debates on Polish migrants’ encounters with difference and social remittances between the UK and Poland...|$|E

In this study we compared three groups of bilingual children in the Netherlands, aged 6 – 7 years, with a monolingual control group. We were specifically interested in testing whether the bilingual cognitive advantage is modulated by the sociolinguistic context of language use. All three bilingual groups were exposed to a minority language besides the nation’s dominant language (Dutch). Two bilingual groups were exposed to a regional language (Frisian, Limburgish), and a third bilingual group was exposed to a <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> (Polish). All children participated in two working memory tasks (verbal, visuospatial) and two attention tasks (selective attention, interference suppression). Bilingual children outperformed monolinguals on selective attention. The cognitive effect of bilingualism was most clearly present in the Frisian- Dutch group and in a subgroup of migrant children who were relatively proficient in Polish. The effect was less robust in the Limburgish-Dutch sample. Investigation of the response patterns of the flanker test, testing interference suppression, suggested that bilingual children more often show an effect of response competition than the monolingual children, demonstrating that bilingual children attend to different aspects of the task than monolingual children.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} bilingual {{education}} (BE) in migrant languages in Western Europe. In the Early Developments section, we {{will argue that}} educational arrangements targeting migrant languages initially arose from bottom-up initiatives for immigrant children. In the Major Contributions section, we will discuss the pioneering role of both the local and supranational levels in developing <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> programs and policies in mainstream schooling and promoting multilingualism as civic ideology. Although these initiatives focused on mother tongue instruction (MTI), BE came forward as an alternative approach, reaching a peak in the late 1970 s/early 1980 s and resulting in {{a limited number of}} local experiments in transitional BE. However, national states in Western Europe have been reluctant to include migrant languages in their language-in-education policies. BE in migrant languages has nowhere been able to establish itself as a fully valued teaching model. Notwithstanding this, two-way immersion models offering migrant languages are currently successful in Germany – as is pointed out in the Work in Progress section. Although practical problems can partially explain the difficult introduction of bilingual approaches in education for immigrants, the principal obstacle is the monolingual ideology that underlies educational and social integration policies and practices across Europe. A return to assimilation has resulted in dwindling official support of MTI/BE in many Western European countries in the past decade (Problems and Difficulties). In the final section, we will outline some Future Directions, of which the challenge of linguistic superdiversity of school populations for received language-in-education approaches is most important...|$|E
40|$|Migration entails {{adjustment}} and change, a process crystallized {{in the way}} language use patterns, proficiencies and identifications change. Although migrants are often bi/ multilingual, their language proficiency tends {{to be associated with}} fluency in the host language. Such a monolingual approach is fundamentally at odds with the ethnolinguistic diversity in migration contexts and has prevented a more holistic approach to the dynamic realities of bi/multilinguals. It has also perpetuated a view of linguistic proficiency as technical skill, judged according to idealized monolingual norms. Little is known of speakers' own notions of proficiency in their existing migrant languages (ML) and the impact on their socialpsychological makeup as their linguistic repertoire undergoes changes in use, function and status. This research investigated proficiency as a matter of conceptualization through its users, including its role for migrants' continued sense of self in the face of sociolinguistic discontinuities. A three-phase research design involving focus groups, a postal survey and follow-up interviews was used with a sample of migrants {{from a wide range of}} ethnolinguistic backgrounds. The study found evidence for a multidimensional conceptualization of <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> proficiency (MLP) with a complex range of underlying motivations and a strong emotional attachment to ML, revealing ML as a linguistic resource crucial for self-construction. The present study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of these matters to contribute to a socio-culturally grounded view of proficiency and self-concept to help reveal some of the complex processes associated with migrants' social, cultural and psychological wellbeing. The study proposes bi/multilingualism as a settlement target to facilitate this outcome and to foster a sense of self that accommodates multiple identities.

40|$|New Zealand’s {{increasingly}} heterogeneous population places manifold {{demands on}} the education sector to educate and integrate children who do not speak English. Children of migrant background attending early childhood settings are assumed to benefit in English language obtainment from attending early years educational facilities, but does the mere placement in such settings achieve the desired outcome? Limited research exists into how minority language children acquire English whilst attending preschool settings, how this impacts on their first language, or on how teachers support their second language development. There is little insight into what motivates teachers in their interactions and decision-making, how they adjust teaching content, and whether they engage in language-specific teaching activities at all. To address this gap, this study considers questions regarding the relationship between early childhood teachers’ knowledge of second language acquisition {{and the type of}} support they report implementing. I investigate educators’ views and reported practices, as well as the influence of professional training, institutional policies, and philosophies. This research used a qualitative perspective and was benchmarked against comparative reflections of my own teaching experience. The inductive methodology involved semi-structured interviews of early childhood practitioners, covering a selection of educational settings in the Wellington region that practise distinct philosophies. Results show that teachers rely on their centres’ philosophies and socio-cultural practices as per Te Whāriki - the New Zealand curriculum - in their work with minority language children. The consensus was that early childhood education is to prepare language foundations through emotional confidence and cultural capability, not to set iii academic standards, and children’s perceived natural ability to learn by osmosis is accorded much credence. These findings suggest that teachers’ knowledge regarding complex language and cognitive processes could be significantly improved. Furthermore, support for te reo Māori and Pasifika first languages in New Zealand notwithstanding, practices tend to facilitate institutionalized monolingualism. Future research in all <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> learning would add to the knowledge base about second language acquisition in New Zealand and the role of early childhood education in this dynamic.

40|$|Official trilingualism {{is often}} drawn upon to portray Luxembourg as a {{heterogeneous}} society {{with high levels}} of linguistic capital, where multilingualism is declared to be an asset both at individual and societal level. With the increased number and shifted geographic origin of migrants from refugee backgrounds new questions surface concerning the linguistic integration of these new arrivals, who are often incorrectly associated with zerolingualism and whose language capital is seldom perceived as a valuable asset. It has been argued that in contexts of forced migration one cannot talk of second or foreign language learning: migrants are not acquiring the language(s) of the mainstream society for the mere reason of approximating native speakers’ performances; these languages form part of their everyday lived experiences, hence they have to appropriate features that best suit their needs. Accordingly, their full linguistic repertoires constitute single integrated continua that include all the language resources they have learned and accumulated. In line with this and contesting the idea of zerolingualism, we maintain that through a wide variety of trajectories ranging from comprehensive learning to informal encounters with languages, migrants from refugee backgrounds have developed partial, truncated competences in several languages that have resulted in complex linguistic repertoires. Our contribution aims at investigating whether the recognition of multilingualism in Luxembourg entails the acknowledgment of the refugees’ full linguistic repertoires, or on the contrary, it remains limited to the appreciation of official trilingualism and proficiency in standard English. In our analysis we are going to rely on data collected {{in the context of a}} French language course for beginners, which is offered to newly arrived migrants by volunteer teachers. Besides commenting on the presence (or absence) of multilingual approaches, we seek to explore whether <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> features are acknowledged as useful resources and how, if at all, the class draws on the fluid use of all the languages present for both learning and functional purposes. On this note, we aim to determine what is more prominent in this context: the monoglossic perspective where languages are conceived in a linear and compartmentalised way or a repertoire-building approach based on awareness and positive attitudes towards teachers’ and learners’ multilingual repertoires...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{teaching}} beliefs of Chinese language teachers who migrated from China to Australia {{and who have}} been teaching in Chinese Community Languages Schools {{in the state of}} Victoria, Australia. The thesis argues that the teaching beliefs of these <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> teachers are strongly influenced by their previous learning and teaching experiences and that their choices of teaching content and practice in their current Australian classrooms reflect these beliefs. Because language is constructed within specific historical, cultural and social contexts among a specific social community in order to share, transmit, mediate and communicate thoughts, socio-cultural theory was chosen as the most appropriate framework for this research. The study was conducted with 18 teachers from 10 Chinese Community Languages Schools across Victoria, Australia. Twelve teachers agreed to participate in both interviews and in-class observations and six teachers agreed to participate only in the interviews. Data collection included 18 written questionnaires, followed by 18 initial interviews, 36 classroom observation recordings (three lessons for each of 12 teachers), 12 post-observation interviews and selected teaching materials. These data helped to consolidate the trustworthiness of this research. It was found that teaching beliefs about student engagement, students’ learning needs, their cultural competence and the language environment were given great importance by the Chinese migrant teachers. Participants' own learning experience, professional experience and the school context {{played a significant role in}} the formation of their teaching beliefs. Their Chinese educational backgrounds provided them with genuine teaching content, enriched their professional knowledge and also brought challenges in their current teaching practice in Australian classrooms. With the help of a socio-cultural framework, it was further analysed that the teaching beliefs were dynamic, contextual, and impacted by multiple factors in their social and cultural transformation process. At the same time, these migrant teachers’ identities as Chinese teachers in China, migrants in Australia and language teachers in Chinese Community Languages Schools have experienced a series of conflicts, adjustments, shifts and relocations. The results of this study are expected to contribute to Chinese community language teachers’ understanding of and reflections on their pedagogy and personal skills in Australian language classrooms, their professional development needs, closer communication and sharing with their colleagues and lastly, curriculum development in Chinese Community Language education programs. The research may also provide benefits for the wider teaching of Chinese in Australia. In addition, it is hoped that the results may point to future research in this and related fields...|$|E

40|$|For years, {{understanding}} {{the relationship between}} behaviour and cognition has been a central concern of research conducted in the social sciences. In fields as diverse as anthropology, business, medicine, and education it is widely accepted {{that the development of}} practice (as a type of behaviour), depends on a precise understanding of how thought gets carried into action. However, studies investigating the complex interplay between a learner’s cognition (i. e. thoughts, knowledge, beliefs, and feelings about L 2 learning) and their behaviour (i. e. language-related activity) are only recently garnering attention. In addition, only few studies have looked at this dynamic process with adult participants beyond the language learning classroom. Framed within the context of naturalistic language learning, this investigation explores the social construction of adult (over 30 years of age) L 2 learners’ cognition in an ESOL setting. Specifically it aimed to answer the following research questions: RQ 1. What are the prior language learning experiences of a group of adult migrant learners living in New Zealand? RQ 2. How have these prior language learning experiences influenced the construction and development of their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge (BAK) about language learning? RQ 3. What is their perceived need for English in their current socio-cultural context? RQ 4. How do adult <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> learners engage in language related activities beyond the classroom? RQ 5. How can this language learning behaviour be reflected in a model of language learner cognition? The study combined a longitudinal, ethnographic approach, with elements of narrative and case study inquiry. Six ‘recently arrived’ (Dunstan, Roz, & Shorland, 2004 a) Colombian migrants (five refugees; one immigrant) were asked to talk about and discuss both prior and current experiences learning and using an L 2. Through these lengthy in-depth, conversation-like interviews conducted in Spanish (the participants’ L 1), told over time, a nuanced picture of the participants’ L 2 -related cognition emerged. As a result, I was able to more clearly observe the dynamic process in which a language learner’s mental life both impacts and is impacted on by language-related activity throughout their day-to day interactions. The participants are seen engaging in the L 2 across a range of settings including at home, the doctor’s office, supermarkets and work. Moreover, in their accounts of this engagement we see change and revision (i. e. development) in their thinking about L 2 learning and themselves as language learners, as well as their feelings toward the L 2, other L 2 s and L 2 users. A single participant was selected as an exemplary case to examine in detail, and facilitate understanding of this development. A case study approach allowed for a more intricate exploration of how the interplay between thought, emotion, and context impacted on the learner’s approaches to language-related activities. Issues regarding readiness to interact in the L 2, intelligibility, language variety, and aversion to the ‘sound of English’ were seen as playing significant roles in the learner’s language development. This analysis resulted in the construction of a framework depicting language learner cognition in action. In terms of implications, this research supports the case for more qualitative research in SLA which centres learners’ perspectives of their L 2 related experiences, particularly when so much of what seems to be affecting learning is the learners understanding of themselves and their actions. It also argues that studies in L 2 cognition should focus their investigations on the developmental processes involved in the social construction of the mental factors which impact language learning and use. Finally, while belief studies in SLA are expanding the scope of their investigations – by looking to include more emotion and other affective factors, as well as by branching out into self-related constructs such as self-concept and self-efficacy in the foreign language domain – these studies remain limited in their almost microscopic view of learners’ mental lives. The picture of cognition I offer provides a more holistic understanding of this phenomenon which helps account at a macro-level for L 2 behaviour. The study also highlights the potential and power of data gathering methods which foreground the participants’ voices and ideas (i. e. in-depth, unstructured interviews told over time) – reminding us that it is important when looking for what drives language learning behaviour to consider what the learners feel and think...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 11178. 1 THESIS 11178. 2 This thesis {{examines}} the post-migratory lived language learning and socialization experiences of adult migrant learners of English {{who are members}} of an intercultural drop-in centre in Ireland. It proposes the use of learners? stories as relevant texts for promoting language and literacy learning for border-crossing students. This study draws on the work of scholars in the area of social learning to assemble a model of situated language learning to help adult migrant learners of English build their language skills by sharing their migration stories through social literacy practices. Social learning approaches and the research method of narrative inquiry are combined in this study as an innovative praxis of problem-posing pedagogical theory and collaborative methodology to foster meaning-making of lived experience and the construction of stronger English language identities for border-crossing learners. This thesis proposes that this praxis would benefit teachers and researchers in the field of second or other language learning by providing further insights into the challenges and opportunities presented to these learners while helping them address language conflicts and participate more fully in the host communities which are their new homes. The stories of the lived experiences of members of English literacy groups at the drop-in were collected in two phases {{over the course of a}} year using collaborative, problem-posing practices. The second phase included other members of the drop-in centre in a published storytelling project. Finally, follow-up narrative interviews were carried out with thirteen core members of the groups to expand their stories and reflect on their experiences of the whole project. The Introduction to this thesis presents an overview of the theories informing my research and the rationale for this study, which emerged from almost a decade of working with refugee and <b>migrant</b> <b>language</b> learners. Chapter One starts by describing the sociocultural context of this study with regard to migrant integration. It then describes the characteristics and uses of socially-situated approaches to language learning, suggests participation as a metaphor for learning, and proposes a model for situated learning and language identity work in collaborative communities. Chapter Two will outline the nature of narrative inquiry as a research method and describe the relationship and relevance of this approach to the issues facing this cohort of learners. This chapter will describe how narrative inquiry has been shown to help border crossers make meaning of their lived language socialization experiences, and how social learning theories and this research method can combine to help these learners build stronger English language identities. Chapter Three starts by describing the research sites and participants involved in the pilot and final sample of this inquiry. It outlines the research design for this study as a classroom-based social research, explains how learning theory and research method were combined to act as data collection tools and pedagogical instruments, and discusses some ethical considerations for working with marginalized groups. Chapter Four provides a detailed description of the pilot and final research sites and participants, and the application of narrative frames as data collection instruments. It presents the two phases of shared socially-situated storytelling, sharing and collecting, and provides a description of the follow-up narrative interviews. Chapter Five explains the approaches to the transcription of the audio interviews and the methods of coding and analysis of the various forms of handwritten, published and transcribed data using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. This chapter ends with a description of how the central themes and categories from the data were arrived at using cross-analytical thematic and temporal narrative methods. Chapter Six presents the results of my interpretation of the themes in the lived experiences of these border-crossing learners which emerged from the narrative cross-analysis of the data: (i) Displacement and Resettlement, (ii) Identity Work, (iii) Participation in Social Practices, and (iv) Trajectories and transformations. Chapter Seven presents the conclusions which I draw from my evaluations of these themes. These show that this form of inquiry can reveal the sources and effects of socially-mediated constraints or affordances across time and space, such as identity positioning and gender-mediated access to language learning resources and socialisation opportunities for these learners. Many of these learners seem to use their reflections on their storied experiences to identify and reflect on disruptions and transformations in their social and linguistic trajectories. In their reflections on sharing stories of lived language learning experiences, many learners showed they could draw meanings and identify outcomes for their social and linguistic identity growth and socialisation practices, and the value of participation and identity work as being coeval to learning is verified in many cases. Finally, the implications of situated narrative practices for teaching and researching with migrant learners are discussed...|$|E

Inspired by a range of writers thinking postcolonially and multi/trans-lingually, the authors draw on their own embodied migrant experience to argue for re-envisioning Europe’s borders through multiple languaging practices. “Languaging”, in this view, takes linguistic practices in a migrant context as an inherently prosthetic activity, whereby any dominant, national host language is inevitably subject to the subterranean rumblings of all the <b>languages</b> a <b>migrant</b> brings with her on her global journeys. Conceived as being saturated with prosthetic “absence(s) ”, <b>migrant</b> <b>languaging</b> practices rework cultural geography’s bounded, inward-looking, and security-fixated understanding of the language/territory nexus, the better to open a vital space for re-envisioning language’s everyday territories as sites for translational solidarity and becoming...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{perspectives}} of Greek origin people as regards their intention to maintain their ancestral culture within the Australian context of social values. This qualitative research study, influenced by Humanistic Sociology, analyses data collected through questionnaires from first and second generation parents and teachers of high school students, and identifies {{a shift in the}} cultural values of the Greek community in South Australia towards an equilibrium of shared Greek-Australian values. The researcher aims to demonstrate that Greek origin parents, educated in Australia, have incorporated social and cultural values of the dominant culture in their ancestral cultural system and proceeded {{to the creation of a}} new personal and ethnic group cultural system, which allows them to maintain a dual identity. This shift, indicative of the need to capture the advantages both cultural identities offer, emerges the logical question: What is the cultural prognosis for the third generation descendents of the Greek <b>Migrants?</b> Greek <b>migrants,</b> <b>language,</b> education, assimilatio...|$|R
5000|$|Though {{awareness}} for {{linguistic diversity}} {{is a policy}} target, the language rights of speakers of regional, minority, lesser-used and <b>migrant</b> <b>languages</b> are not legally protected. In the European Union, language policy {{is the responsibility of}} member states and European Union does not have a [...] "common language policy." [...] Based on the [...] "principle of subsidiarity", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages. The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning, most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 2007-2013. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states.|$|R
40|$|Teachers {{of migrant}} {{children}} experience {{a great many}} difficulties in trying to understand and resolve their pupils 2 ̆ 7 language problems. One basic problem is all too familiar: the teacher speaks English and the migrant child does not understand it or only understands it to some, rather limited, extent. Another problem area: the pupil picks up some English in the classroom, on the playground and {{out in the street}} but speaks it with a peculiar accent and peppers it with phonemic, grammatical and semantic errors. The child 2 ̆ 7 s deviations from the generally accepted patterns of English (i. e. the prevalent variety of English spoken in this country) originate {{in the language of the}} home, that is the child 2 ̆ 7 s vernacular. The English-speaking teacher is normally unfamiliar with the latter. Ideally, he or she would like to learn a foreign language spoken in the class but more often than not this is easier said than done. Very often there is not just one foreign language spoken in the class. Quite commonly there is a bunch of, say, Italian children mixed with Portuguese, Macedonians, Maltese, Greeks, Serbs, Croats, Turks, Burmese, Bengali, Lebanese and others. Such a Babel will of course discourage the most zealous teacher from learning one or another foreign language. Our teachers need some assistance in diagnosing and remedying their migrant students 2 ̆ 7 language problems. Mount Lawley College of Advanced Education being strongly involved in various aspects of migrant education, we not only recognized this need but also tried to do something about it in our linguistics courses by highlighting some salient features of the main <b>migrant</b> <b>languages</b> in contrast to English. The present Serbo-Croatian sketch is a makeshift summary of some of the problems arising from Yugoslav speakers 2 ̆ 7 hardships in learning or speaking English. Before completion, it was discussed with practising teachers who had had some experience with children from Yugoslav families. Considered useful, the booklet has now been made available to all interested. Like sketches of other <b>migrant</b> <b>languages</b> will hopefully follow...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis explores {{language}} {{attitudes and}} ideologies among migrant students of Basque in the Basque Autonomous Community of Spain. I aim {{to explore the}} contexts of language attitude formation in interaction, and how these attitudes in turn, reflect the underlying ideological indexicalities {{that contribute to the}} creation of social categories. The processes of attitude construction and ideologies that guide them are then influential and consequential for group identity formation, for instance, when migrant learners position themselves on the scale of belonging to ‘Basqueness’ understood as a group identity. In this project I analyse three areas in which this influence of ideologies on attitudes and identity construction was found particularly significant and consequential for migrant learners of Basque: the construction of space in which Basque group identity is embedded and based on Basque resources subjected to processes of scalar evaluation; the construction of authenticity in relation to speakers, language and spaces; {{as well as in the}} construction of Basque language as resources convertible into economic capital. All these three areas show that essentialist and constructionist discourses on minoritised languages and group identity intertwine in the representations of social categories, such as <b>migrants,</b> <b>language,</b> language speaker. This has consequences on the extent to which migrant learners position and identify themselves as belonging to ‘Basqueness’. This project is ethnographically oriented and the data comes from observations and participation in Basque classes for adult migrants, interviews with class participants and interviews with other Basque learners at various language centres throughout the Basque Autonomous Community, as well as from Basque public institutions’ publications with language course descriptions and campaigns directed at migrant Basque learners...|$|R
40|$|With a rich {{migration}} history, the Australian context {{has provided}} a fascinating and fertile landscape through which to explore the patterns of linguistic and sociolinguistic variation which arise when languages and cultures are transplanted from earlier, often bilingual, environments to a new English-dominant one. Drawing on extensive research undertaken in the Australian context, this chapter explores a range of linguistic and sociolinguistic features relevant to understanding language contact in a migrant setting, including facilitation of code-switching; pragmatic effects, {{such as the use}} of modal particles and discourse markers and address patterns; standardization and codification; pluricentric languages; diglossia and the role of language as a core value. In a number of cases it considers the relative role of and possible interaction between linguistic and social (and cultural) factors in governing language phenomena in Australia. In addition to the possible effect of the linguistic characteristics of specific <b>migrant</b> <b>languages,</b> we also look at the effect of the pre- and post-migration sociolinguistic and cultural contexts and how these might explain patterns of bilingual behaviour and language maintenance in Australia.

40|$|Currently, English {{is at the}} top and <b>migrant</b> <b>{{language}}s</b> at {{the bottom}} of the ‘foreign’ language hierarchy in Europe, the latter often being seen as a problem, especially in schools. The prestige of a language affects the prestige of its speakers, thus establishing a hierarchy not only of languages but also of cultural and social groups. This paper argues that ‘foreign’ language curricula in schools tend to contribute to the perpetuation of this hierarchy, which can have social implications. Empirical evidence collected among teenagers from multilingual areas in Berlin is used to argue that there may be other ways of thinking about language curricula. This is based on a comparative quantitative study of bilingually and monolingually taught students, which indicates that the status given to languages at school can affect the opinions of students, and influence the importance they attach to different languages. On the basis of this, the inclusion of migrant, or other locally spoken languages, is considered as a genuine option, and reflections are offered from three perspectives: language education, social integration and European language policy...|$|R
