5|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is usually}} due to insufficient dietary intake, {{but can be}} associated with <b>malabsorption,</b> acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses. Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with renal dysfunction.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{metformin}} {{has been}} associated with increased homocysteine levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial |authors=Wulffele MG, Kooy A, Lehert P, Bets D, Ogterop JC, Borger van der Burg B, Donker AJ, Stehouwer CD |volume=254 |issue=5 |pages=455â€“63|pmid=14535967 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01213.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118889232/HTMLSTART}} and <b>malabsorption</b> of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective <b>malabsorption</b> of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by <b>malabsorption.</b> Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do {{not suffer}} any more from overt zinc {{deficiency}} than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers {{may interfere with}} zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc <b>malabsorption.</b> Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and {{the most widely used}} indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, <b>malabsorption,</b> alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
25|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} such as cholestyramine can {{be effective}} in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid <b>malabsorption.</b> Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid <b>malabsorption</b> cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.|$|E
25|$|Tests were {{performed}} for food allergy and <b>malabsorption,</b> {{but not for}} intolerance. There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and <b>malabsorption</b> and perceived food intolerance, among those with IBS. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders.|$|E
25|$|Inborn {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} such as fructose <b>malabsorption.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal symptoms. This {{includes}} increased bowel movements, but <b>malabsorption</b> is unusual.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{pancreatitis}} {{often results}} in intestinal <b>malabsorption,</b> and can result in diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Gastro-intestinal {{reactions}} can {{be due to}} <b>malabsorption</b> {{or other}} GI Tract abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{digestive}} enzymes leads to difficulty absorbing nutrients with their subsequent excretion in the feces, a disorder known as <b>malabsorption.</b> <b>Malabsorption</b> leads to malnutrition and poor {{growth and development}} because of calorie loss. Resultant hypoproteinemia may be severe enough to cause generalized edema. Individuals with CF also have difficulties absorbing the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.|$|E
25|$|Occurrence in {{patients}} identified to be suffering symptoms of {{irritable bowel syndrome}} is not higher than occurrence in the normal population. However, due to the similarity in symptoms, patients with fructose <b>malabsorption</b> often fit the profile of those with irritable bowel syndrome. In some cases, fructose <b>malabsorption</b> {{may be caused by}} several diseases which cause an intestinal damage, such as celiac disease.|$|E
25|$|Fructose <b>malabsorption</b> {{may cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence or diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Avitaminosis. Avitaminosis {{caused by}} <b>malabsorption</b> in GSE {{can result in}} decline of fat soluble {{vitamins}} and vitamin B, as well as <b>malabsorption</b> of essential fatty acids. This can cause {{a wide variety of}} secondary problems. Hypocalcinemia is also associated with GSE. In treated GSE, the restrictions on diet as well as reduced absorption as a result of prolonged damage may result in post treatment deficiencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} {{consequences of}} fructose <b>malabsorption</b> include increased osmotic load, rapid bacterial fermentation, altered gastrointestinal motility, {{the formation of}} mucosal biofilm and altered profile of bacteria. These effects are additive with other short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates such as sorbitol. The clinical significance of these events depends upon {{the response of the}} bowel to such changes. Some effects of fructose <b>malabsorption</b> are decreased tryptophan, folic acid and zinc in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Bile salt <b>malabsorption</b> (primary {{bile acid}} diarrhea) where {{excessive}} bile acids in the colon produce a secretory diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Some myopathies {{may be the}} {{indirect}} result of <b>malabsorption</b> of fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin E.|$|E
25|$|Pernicious anemia (PA). Pernicious anemia is {{associated}} with GSE and is believed to result primarily from <b>malabsorption</b> phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Monash University in Australia {{developed}} dietary {{guidelines for}} managing fructose <b>malabsorption,</b> particularly {{for individuals with}} IBS.|$|E
25|$|Pancreatic {{insufficiency}} and <b>malabsorption</b> can {{be managed}} with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, such as pancrelipase supplementation and other related methods.|$|E
25|$|Xylose {{isomerase}} acts {{to convert}} fructose sugars into glucose. Dietary supplements of xylose isomerase may improve {{the symptoms of}} fructose <b>malabsorption.</b>|$|E
25|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} regarding vitamin B12 and iron <b>malabsorption,</b> but effects {{seem to be}} insignificant, especially when supplement therapy is provided.|$|E
25|$|Hypereosinophilia, the {{hallmark}} of allergic response, may be absent in up to 20% of patients, but hypoalbuminaemia and other abnormalities suggestive of <b>malabsorption</b> may be present.|$|E
25|$|People with {{untreated}} {{celiac disease}} often present sorbitol <b>malabsorption,</b> {{as a result}} of the small bowel damage. Sorbitol <b>malabsorption</b> is an important cause for persisting symptoms in patients already on a gluten-free diet. The sorbitol hydrogen breath test has been suggested as a tool to detect celiac disease because of a strict correlation between cut-off value and intestinal lesions. Nevertheless, although it may be indicated for research purposes, it is not yet recommended as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malabsorption</b> is the {{inability}} to absorb food fully, mostly from disorders in the small bowel, but also due to maldigestion from diseases of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Fructose <b>malabsorption</b> {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with hereditary fructose intolerance, a potentially fatal condition in which the liver enzymes that break up fructose are deficient.|$|E
25|$|Undiagnosed and {{untreated}} {{celiac disease}} often causes dental enamel defects {{and can be}} the only manifestation of the disease, in absence of gastrointestinal symptoms or <b>malabsorption</b> signs.|$|E
25|$|Fructose {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25â€“50g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose <b>malabsorption</b> absorb less than 25g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of fructose and sorbitol seems to increase <b>malabsorption</b> of fructose. Fructose {{that has not been}} adequately absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids. This abnormal increase in hydrogen may be detectable with the hydrogen breath test.|$|E
25|$|Several GI diseases, {{especially}} {{those associated with}} <b>malabsorption,</b> can cause recurrent mouth ulcers, atrophic glossitis, and angular cheilitis (e.g. Crohn's disease is sometimes termed orofacial granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone).|$|E
25|$|The small {{intestine}} can also become involved, leading to bacterial overgrowth and <b>malabsorption</b> of bile salts, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. The colon can be involved, {{and can cause}} pseudo-obstruction or ischemic colitis.|$|E
25|$|Anxiety is {{a common}} feature of GSE; {{treatment}} on a gluten-free diet is effective at reducing anxiety, some aspect {{of which may be}} due to <b>malabsorption</b> phenomena and cytokine activity (i.e. constant stress).|$|E
25|$|Mucosal EG (25â€“100%) is {{the most}} common variety, which {{presents}} with features of <b>malabsorption</b> and protein losing enteropathy. Failure to thrive and anaemia may also be present. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding may imply colonic involvement.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} can be {{the part}} of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and bile acid <b>malabsorption.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{role that}} fructans play in {{fructose}} <b>malabsorption</b> {{is still under}} investigation. However, {{it is recommended that}} fructan intake for fructose malabsorbers should be kept to less than 0.5nbsp&grams/serving, and supplements with inulin and fructooligosaccharide (FOS), both fructans, should be avoided.|$|E
