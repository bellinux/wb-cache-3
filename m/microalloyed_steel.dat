50|$|<b>Microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> {{is a type}} of {{alloy steel}} that {{contains}} small amounts of alloying elements (0.05 to 0.15%), including niobium, vanadium, titanium, molybdenum, zirconium, boron, and rare-earth metals. They are used to refine the grain microstructure or facilitate precipitation hardening.|$|E
50|$|Titanium nitride is also {{produced}} intentionally within some steels by judicious addition of titanium to the alloy. TiN forms {{at very high}} temperatures because of its very low enthalpy of formation, and even nucleates directly from the melt in secondary steelmaking. It forms discrete, micrometre-sized cubic particles at grain boundaries and triple points, and prevents grain growth by Ostwald ripening up to very high homologous temperatures. Titanium nitride has the lowest solubility product of any metal nitride or carbide in austenite, a useful attribute in <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> formulas.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{reinforcing}} bar of 500 MPa strength {{can be made}} from expensive <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> or by a quench and self-temper (QST) process. After the bar exits the final rolling pass, where the final shape of the bar is applied, the bar is then sprayed with water which quenches the outer surface of the bar. The bar speed and the amount of water are carefully controlled in order to leave the core of the bar unquenched. The hot core then tempers the already quenched outer part, leaving a bar with high strength but with a certain degree of ductility too.|$|E

5000|$|Dual-phase steel (DP steel) is a {{high-strength}} steel {{that has a}} ferritic-martensitic microstructure.DP steels are produced from low or medium carbon steels that are quenched from a temperature above A1 but below A3 determined from continuous cooling transformation diagram.This results in a microstructure consisting of a soft ferrite matrix containing islands of martensite as the secondary phase (martensite increases the tensile strength).Therefore, the overall behavior of DP steels is governed by the volume fraction, morpology (size, aspect ratio, interconnectivity, etc.), the grain size and the carbon content.For achieving these microstructures, DP steels typically contain 0.06-0.15 wt.% C and 1.5-3% Mn (the former strengthens the martensite, and the latter causes solid solution strengthening in ferrite, while both stabilize the austenite), Cr & Mo (to retard pearlite or bainite formation), Si (to promote ferrite transformation), V and Nb (for precipitation strengthening and microstructure refinement).The desire to produce high strength steels with formability greater than <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> led the development of DP steels in the 1970s.|$|E
