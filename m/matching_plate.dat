Its modern descendant in tableware is the two-handled cream soup bowl on <b>matching</b> <b>plate.</b> A small covered dish for sauce, called a saucière, could also {{take the form of}} a small tureen; it might be integral with its platter (illustration right), for ease in handling and to contain drips.|$|E
5000|$|On April 7, 1975, {{about two}} weeks after their disappearance, a witness in Manassas, Virginia, {{reported}} seeing two girls resembling Sheila and Katherine {{in the rear of}} a beige 1968 Ford station wagon. The witness stated that the girls were bound and gagged in the vehicle. The driver of the station wagon resembled the man in the publicly available sketch of the prime suspect. The witness further claimed that when the driver spotted the witness tailing him, he ran a red light and sped west on Route 234 towards Interstate 66 in Virginia. The station wagon had Maryland license plates with the possible combination [...] "DMT-6**." [...] The last two numbers are unknown due to the bending of the car's plate. The known combination was issued in Cumberland, Hagerstown, and Baltimore, Maryland at the time. This supposed sighting inspired a small army of mobile citizen band (CB) radio users to scour the area throughout the evening and into the night with a running commentary and chatter but without any tangible results. A search for <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> numbers failed to produce any information. Although this witness's report was at first treated as credible, and a media firestorm erupted because of it, it was later deemed [...] "questionable" [...] by police. [...] Despite its questionable nature, media continue to mention this report as credible.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a 50 Ω {{terminated}} or {{in other}} words transformerless bandpass matching network design methodology and an implementation example are presented. The real frequency techniques are powerful numerical methods to design wideband lossless two-port networks such as filters, matching networks and amplifiers. In these techniques, {{the value of the}} termination resistance of the designed network could not be yielded as 50 Ω by numerical package. Hence, a transformer is also required for 50 Ω termination which is not practical for high frequency applications. By employing the proposed procedure, it is guaranteed to obtain transformerless bandpass matching network. Also in this study a wideband suspended monopole antenna is examined. The proposed antenna consists of two major elements; Y-shaped impedance <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> and hemi-circular radiator. Moreover Y-shaped impedance <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> connected to a feeding probe excites the suspended hemi-circular radiator via air gap. Consequently, a transformerless bandpass matching network is designed to filter and expand the operational frequency bandwidth of the proposed antenna. It has been observed that ideal circuit and the layout of the matching network simulation have good agreement. Publisher's Versio...|$|E
30|$|Viable {{counts in}} faecal samples were {{mostly in the}} range of 108 cells per gram dry weight, with each faecal sample {{containing}} all targeted hydrolase producers although strictly anaerobic hydrolytically active bacteria were not quantified (Table  2). The counts for soil control samples were generally at least 1 – 2 logs lower than the counts in the corresponding faecal samples. In addition, clear differences in the proportions of specific hydrolase producers were evident (Fig.  2). Gong (2007) reported total and viable microscopic counts for cattle dung of about 1011  cfu/g (dry weight) and a <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> count for mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria of about 1010  cfu/g, with proteolytic bacteria present at about 108  cfu/g and both lipolytic, amylolytic and cellulolytic bacteria present at about 109  cfu/g. Viable plate counts established in this study for Nguni cow faeces were lower than those reported by Gong (2007), although similar relative proportions were observed for the hydrolase producers with the exception of cellulolytic microorganisms. The difference in viable counts per g of faeces might be due to the shorter incubation time for agar plates used and the typically poorer diet of the Nguni cow (Tada et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a triple-band dichroic surface design is detailed that is reflective in the Ka-band from 22. 5 to 27. 3 GHz and the Ku-band from 13. 7 to 15. 1 GHz, yet transparent in the S-band from 2. 0 to 2. 3 GHz, for all planes of incidence, and for all angles of incidence out to eta = 45 deg. The design is comprised of two gangbuster whole-surfaces separated by a distance, d, that is comparable to {{a fraction of a}} wavelength in S-band, and enhanced by the addition of a dielectric <b>matching</b> <b>plate.</b> The gangbuster array is comprised of tightly packed straight skewed dipole elements referred to as half-surfaces. Two of these half-surfaces are oriented orthogonal to each other and placed an array separation distance, s, apart to form the gangbuster whole-surface which allows any arbitrary plane of incidence. Results are given for the triple-band design with and without dielectric and conduction losses. The cross polarization properties of the dichroic surface was further investigated. It is shown that the reflection cross polarized component is dominated by the geometry of the front whole surface of the design (particularly the array separation s) and is never more than - 22. 5 dB in the frequency band 0 to 30 GHz. The transmission cross polarization component is dependent on both whole-surfaces and is never more than - 30 dB in the same frequency band...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{hydrodynamic}} characteristic size of polymer was proposed in this study, to characterize the size of aggregates of many polymer molecules in the polymer percolation process. The hydrodynamic characteristic sizes of polymers used in the target block S were examined by employing microporous membrane filtration method, and the factors were studied. Natural core flow experiments were conducted in order {{to set up the}} flow matching relationship plate. According to the flow <b>matching</b> <b>plate,</b> the relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer and pore throat radius obtained from core mercury injection data was found. And several suitable polymers for different reservoirs permeability were given. The experimental results of microporous membrane filtration indicated that the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer maintained a good nonlinear relationship with polymer viscosity; the value increased as the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer increased and increased as the salinity of dilution water decreased. Additionally, the hydrodynamic characteristic size decreased as the pressure increased, so the hydrodynamic characteristic size ought to be determined based on the pressure of the target block. In the core flow studies, good matching of polymer and formation was identified as polymer flow pressure gradient lower than the fracture pressure gradient of formation. In this case, good matching that was the pore throat radius should be larger than 10 times the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer in this study. Using relationship, more matching relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristic sizes of polymer solutions and the pore throat radius of target block was determined...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction of}} an all-sky galaxy catalogue, using SuperCOSMOS scans of Schmidt photographic plates from the UKST and POSS 2 surveys. The photographic photometry is calibrated using SDSS data, with results that are linear to 2 % or better. All-sky photometric uniformity is achieved by <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> overlaps and also by requiring homogeneity in optical-to- 2 MASS colours, yielding zero points that are uniform to 0. 03 mag. or better. The typical AB depths achieved are B_J< 21, R_F< 19. 5 and I_N< 18. 5, with little difference between hemispheres. In practice, the I_N plates are shallower than the B_J & R_F plates, so for most purposes we advocate the use of a catalogue selected in these two latter bands. At high Galactic latitudes, this catalogue is approximately 90 % complete with 5 % stellar contamination; we quantify how the quality degrades towards the Galactic plane. At low latitudes, there are many spurious galaxy candidates resulting from stellar blends: these approximately match the surface density of true galaxies at |b|= 30 deg. Above this latitude, the catalogue limited in B_J & R_F contains in total about 20 million galaxy candidates, of which 75 % are real. This contamination can be removed, and the sky coverage extended, by matching with additional datasets. This SuperCOSMOS catalogue has been matched with 2 MASS and with WISE, yielding quasi-allsky samples of respectively 1. 5 million and 18. 5 million galaxies, to median redshifts of 0. 08 and 0. 20. This legacy dataset thus continues to offer a valuable resource for large-angle cosmological investigations. Comment: Submitted to MNRAS. Data available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} for the response of moderately porous solids (no more than {approximately} 20 % void space) to high-strain-rate deformations. The model is consistent because each feature is incorporated {{in a manner that}} is mathematically compatible with the other features. Unlike simple p-{alpha} models, the onset of pore collapse depends on the amount of shear present. The user-specifiable yield function depends on pressure, effective shear stress, and porosity. The elastic part of the strain rate is linearly related to the stress rate, with nonlinear corrections from changes in the elastic moduli due to pore collapse. Plastically incompressible flow of the matrix material allows pore collapse and an associated macroscopic plastic volume change. The plastic strain rate due to pore collapse/growth is taken normal to the yield surface. If phase transformation and/or pore nucleation are simultaneously occurring, the inelastic strain rate will be non-normal to the yield surface. To permit hardening, the yield stress of matrix material is treated as an internal state variable. Changes in porosity and matrix yield stress naturally cause the yield surface to evolve. The stress, porosity, and all other state variables vary in a consistent manner so that the stress remains on the yield surface throughout any quasistatic interval of plastic deformation. Dynamic loading allows the stress to exceed the yield surface via an overstress ordinary differential equation that is solved in closed form for better numerical accuracy. The part of the stress rate that causes no plastic work (i. e-, the part that has a zero inner product with the stress deviator and the identity tensor) is given by the projection of the elastic stressrate orthogonal to the span of the stress deviator and the identity tensor. The model, which has been numerically implemented in MIG format, has been exercised under a wide array of extremal loading and unloading paths. As will be discussed in a companion sequel report, the CKP model is capable of closely <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> impact measurements for porous materials...|$|E

This detector exhibits extremely high, stable electron gains of 10 to the 8 th.
