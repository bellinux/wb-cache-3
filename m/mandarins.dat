5|$|Born into {{a family}} of <b>mandarins</b> from Hà Tĩnh Province, Phan {{continued}} his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor Tự Đức of the Nguyễn Dynasty, gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position {{that allowed him to}} criticise his fellow <b>mandarins</b> and even the emperor. As the head of the censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt <b>mandarins.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phan {{was born}} in the village of Đông Thái in the {{northern}} central coast province of Hà Tĩnh. Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking <b>mandarins</b> and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the Lê Dynasty. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates. All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became <b>mandarins.</b> Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan {{as an example of how}} an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding <b>mandarins</b> in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E

[...] There are important dissimilarities between Standard <b>Mandarin</b> and Beijing dialect <b>Mandarin</b> even as Beijing Mandarin's phonology is held {{to be the same}} as Standard Mandarin's. 2 Both southern and <b>Mandarin</b> features of syntax were mixed into Standard <b>Mandarin</b> while northern <b>Mandarin</b> is the main basis of Beijing <b>Mandarin</b> and this sets the syntax of Standard <b>Mandarin</b> and Beijing <b>Mandarin</b> apart.|$|R
5000|$|Philippine <b>Mandarin</b> (...) is {{a variety}} of Standard <b>Mandarin</b> Chinese widely spoken by Chinese Filipinos. It {{is based on the}} {{phonology}} of the Beijing dialect and the grammar of Vernacular Chinese, and is identical to the standard of <b>Mandarin</b> used in the Republic of China, Taiwan that is called [...] "Guoyu" [...] (...) [...] In terms of phonology, vocabulary and grammar, Standard Philippine <b>Mandarin</b> is similar to [...] "Guoyu" [...] (Standard Chinese in the Republic of China (Taiwan)) because almost all uses dictionaries and books from Taiwan. Many Chinese Filipino schools uses bopomofo (zhuyin fuhao) to teach the language. Philippine <b>Mandarin</b> uses the Traditional Chinese characters in writing and it is seen in the newspapers. Philippine <b>Mandarin</b> can be classified into two distinct <b>Mandarin</b> dialects: Standard <b>Mandarin</b> and Colloquial <b>Mandarin.</b> These two dialects are easily distinguishable to a person proficient in <b>Mandarin.</b> Standard <b>Mandarin</b> is like the standard language of Taiwan, while Colloquial <b>Mandarin</b> tends to combine <b>Mandarin</b> (...) and Min Nan Yu (...) or Southern Hokkien features.|$|R
25|$|Spanish, French and <b>Mandarin</b> are {{the only}} three foreign {{language}} courses that are offered, and American Sign Language is offered over the summer. In 2007-2008 an AP <b>Mandarin</b> course was added. Prior to the 2007-2008 school year, <b>Mandarin</b> classes ranged from <b>Mandarin</b> I to <b>Mandarin</b> V (honors). The <b>Mandarin</b> program was added in 1995-1996, when it replaced German.|$|R
5|$|During the war era, Nguyễn Ánh had {{maintained}} an embryonic bureaucracy {{in an attempt}} to prove his leadership ability to the people. Due to the incessant warfare, military officers were generally the most prominent members of his inner circle. This dependency on military backing continued to manifest itself throughout his reign. Vietnam was divided into three administrative regions. The old patrimony of the Nguyễn formed {{the central part of the}} empire (vùng Kinh Kỳ), with nine provinces, five of which were directly ruled by Gia Long and his <b>mandarins</b> from Huế.|$|E
5|$|The French {{officers}} {{recruited by}} Pigneau {{were used to}} train Nguyễn Ánh's armed forces and introduce their technological expertise to the war effort. Olivier de Puymanel {{was responsible for the}} construction of fortifications. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions was to ask the French officers to design and oversee the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel and 30,000 people were used to construct it in 1790. The townfolk and their <b>mandarins</b> were heavily taxed for the work, and the labourers were worked {{to the extent that it}} provoked a revolt.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new <b>mandarins</b> carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
50|$|Singaporean <b>Mandarin</b> can be {{classified}} into two distinct <b>Mandarin</b> dialects: Standard Singaporean <b>Mandarin</b> and Colloquial Singaporean <b>Mandarin.</b> These two dialects are easily distinguishable to a person proficient in <b>Mandarin.</b> Standard Singaporean <b>Mandarin</b> is the register of <b>Mandarin</b> used in more formal occasions in Singapore and can be heard on television and radio. It is also the form taught in all Singapore government schools, while Colloquial Singaporean <b>Mandarin</b> (Singdarin) is the form used by the general populace. They tend to infuse the language with many words from other Chinese dialects, Malay and English.|$|R
5000|$|Standard Singaporean <b>Mandarin</b> uses pure <b>Mandarin</b> words. Colloquial Singaporean <b>Mandarin,</b> on {{the other}} hand, uses loan words from other languages.

5000|$|Malaysian <b>Mandarin</b> (...) is {{a variety}} of <b>Mandarin</b> Chinese (官話) spoken in Malaysia by ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. Malaysian Chinese tend to {{perceive}} the <b>Mandarin</b> Chinese is a variation of Standard <b>Mandarin</b> (Putonghua); however, it is a <b>Mandarin</b> dialect in its own right. Its closest linguistic cousin is not Standard <b>Mandarin,</b> rather it is Singaporean <b>Mandarin,</b> the variety widely used in films like Tiger Woohoo 大日子(2010), Namewee's Nasi Lemak 2.0 and movies created by Singaporean movie director Jack Neo.|$|R
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his <b>mandarins,</b> and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company {{in partnership with}} the older and more experienced Michael Grubb, one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich <b>mandarins.</b>|$|E
5|$|The central {{administration}} at Huế {{was divided into}} six ministries: Public affairs, finance, rites, war, justice and public works. Each was under a minister, assisted by two deputies {{and two or three}} councillors. Each of these ministries had around 70 employees assigned to various units. The heads of these ministries formed the Supreme Council. A treasurer general and a Chief of the Judicial Service assisted a governor general, {{who was in charge of}} a number of provinces. The provinces were classified into trấn and dinh. These were in turn divided into phủ, huyện and châu. All important matters were examined by the Supreme Council in the presence of Gia Long. The officials tabled their reports for discussion and decision-making. The bureaucrats involved in the Supreme Council were selected from the high-ranking <b>mandarins</b> of the six ministries and the academies.|$|E

In this view, Chuanpu is, to a certain degree, similar to Taiwanese <b>Mandarin</b> and Singaporean <b>Mandarin,</b> which are influenced by Hokkien and other varieties.|$|R
5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was supercargo {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (outward journey) in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident supercargo in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron Prins Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton was {{to make sure that the}} Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the <b>mandarins</b> at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support a}} sizable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased castor sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn <b>mandarins</b> were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Duyet {{suffered}} {{another blow}} when Nguyen Van Thoai, an ally whom he appointed to run Cambodia for him died. The general nominated another subordinate to replace his colleague Nguyen Van Xuan, but Minh Mạng overruled him and instead appointed {{one of his}} <b>mandarins</b> Bui Minh Duc to the post. Although the emperor formally asked Duc to cooperate with Duyet, Minh Mạng then appointed Duc to the post of Minister of the Board of War, putting him above the general {{in the chain of}} command, effectively making Duyet irrelevant with regards to the running of the protectorate. In 1831, just before Duyet's death, Minh Mạng began to dismantle his military infrastructure and sending his component units to other parts of Vietnam, and sent a loyalist General Nguyen Van Khue to Gia Định, allowing him to dilute the viceroy's power. In addition, no government reports could be officially approved and sent to the capital until it was countersigned by civil officials sent south by the emperor. These moves against southern autonomy gradually increased the resentment and regionalist sentiments among the local population.|$|E

5|$|Phan was {{transferred}} to the Huế court {{as a member of the}} censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court <b>mandarins</b> were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Saigon, Nguyễn Ánh consolidated {{his power}} base and prepared {{the destruction of}} the Tây Sơn. His enemies had regularly raided the south and confiscated the annual rice harvests, so Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his defense. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions was to ask the French officers to design and supervise the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel, with 30,000 people mobilized for its construction in 1790. The townfolk and their <b>mandarins</b> were punitively taxed for the work; the laborers were worked so hard that they revolted. When finished, the stone citadel had a perimeter measuring 4,176 meters in a Vauban model. The fortress was bordered on three sides by pre-existing waterways, bolstering its natural defensive capability. Following the construction of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to sail down the Saigon River and try to recapture the cityits presence having endowed Nguyễn Ánh with a substantial psychological advantage over his opponents. Nguyễn Ánh took a keen personal interest in fortifications, ordering his French advisers to travel home and bring back books with the latest scientific and technical studies on the subject.|$|E
