50|$|The <b>halt</b> <b>does</b> {{not appear}} on the {{relevant}} 1928 Railway Clearing House junction diagram or in Jowett.|$|R
50|$|Around 1888, several <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> {{were put}} into {{operation}} along the line, including in Pinnow and Niederlandin.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time since the little party came to a <b>halt</b> <b>did</b> Nathan evince any {{interest}} in what was going on around him, and now he partially turned as if to speak.|$|R
6000|$|Have {{the elder}} races <b>halted?</b> <b>Do</b> they droop and end their lesson, wearied, over there beyond the seas? We {{take up the}} task eternal, and the burden, and the lesson, [...] Pioneers! O pioneers! ...|$|R
60|$|The return {{journey was}} {{accomplished}} without misadventure. They made no <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> than {{were required to}} rest their horses and, travelling principally at night, they reached La Rochelle without having encountered any body of the enemy.|$|R
60|$|Thus far my {{thoughts}} took me, as I rode, and where I have <b>halted</b> <b>did</b> they <b>halt,</b> and stupidly I went over their ground again, like one who gropes {{for something in}} the dark,--because never yet had I sufficiently cared--I had never cared.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} theorem {{shows that}} the functions computable by machines that always <b>halt</b> <b>do</b> not include extensions of all partial computable functions, which implies the first question above has a negative answer. This fact {{is closely related to}} the algorithmic unsolvability of the Halting problem.|$|R
60|$|Even then Hodder did not answer, but {{rose and}} held open the door. As {{he made his}} exit under the strange {{scrutiny}} of the clergyman's gaze the little vestryman was plainly uncomfortable. He cleared his throat once <b>more,</b> <b>halted,</b> and then precipitately departed.|$|R
50|$|Built as a halt by the Rhymney Railway in 1908 for {{recently}} introduced steam railmotors, some 50 {{years after the}} line first opened. Although very close, the <b>halt</b> <b>did</b> not serve the Brecon and Merthyr Railway which passed behind, {{on its way to}} Bargoed south Junction.|$|R
50|$|HALT {{is a test}} {{technique}} called test-to-fail, where a product is tested until failure. <b>HALT</b> <b>does</b> not help to determine or demonstrate the reliability value or failure probability in field. Many accelerated life tests are test-to-pass, meaning {{they are used to}} demonstrate the product life or reliability.|$|R
5000|$|A fourth, turnback, loop {{was added}} {{at the extreme}} western {{end of the street}} running section, west of Cleveland Bridge, in 1956 when the {{remainder}} of the street running section closed. Unlike the [...] "country" [...] section of the line, <b>halts</b> <b>did</b> not always coincide with loops.|$|R
60|$|Armstrong concurred, {{and they}} turned again upward toward Tacuzama. The trail was abrupt and precipitous, {{mounting}} through a dense forest. As night fell, dark and gloomy, Luis once <b>more</b> <b>halted.</b> Before them was a black chasm, bisecting the path {{as far as they}} could see.|$|R
50|$|Yaxley Halt {{railway station}} {{was located in}} Yaxley, Suffolk. It was midway along a branch line from Mellis to the {{terminus}} at Eye which opened in 1867. Yaxley <b>Halt</b> <b>did</b> not open until 20 December 1922 and closed in 1931 when passenger trains were withdrawn from the branch.|$|R
50|$|Cwmaman Colliery {{also had}} a railmotor service; there were halts at Black Lion Crossing, from 1903. The service was for workmen only at first, but in 1906 three <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> were opened and the service became public. It {{did not make a}} direct {{connection}} {{with the rest of the}} passenger network.|$|R
60|$|Once <b>more</b> Cummings <b>halts,</b> {{discharges}} his rifle, {{and then}} presses forward.|$|R
25|$|Work on {{the record}} was once <b>more</b> <b>halted</b> in January 2009 when Foreman {{embarked}} on a national tour with Fiction Family, a side project band involving Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. No further news was heard from Switchfoot again until late February, when the band announced they had finished selecting the final song list.|$|R
50|$|As {{are other}} halts along KTM Komuter lines, the Bank Negara halt is lined along two {{electrified}} railway tracks, each {{with one of}} the halt's two side platforms at either side of the track. However, accommodating railway lines located along a small valley, the halt and its platforms were required to be crammed into a limited amount of space, with one ticketing concourse placed at one edge of the valley. The Bank Negara <b>halt</b> <b>does</b> not feature a centralised ticketing concourse, but was rather designed with two, each intended for either platform. Accordingly, the <b>halt</b> <b>does</b> not feature a footbridge in itself, instead relying on a road bridge outside the stop as a crossing over the railway tracks and between two platforms. Owing to its lack of importance managing other responsibilities along the railway other than Komuter services, the halt only houses ticketing facilities for Komuter trains, including ticket counters and ticket vending machines, fare gates, and a small staff.|$|R
50|$|Prisoners {{destined for}} the prison were no longer {{conveyed}} by the route after 1930 except during and just after World War 2, as the Southern Railway route to Tavistock and a road connection were <b>more</b> convenient.Two <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> (King Tor and Ingra Tor) were opened (in 1928 and 1936 respectively) to counter competition from local bus services and encourage tourist traffic.|$|R
50|$|Some {{think that}} SCT and ADHD produce two {{different}} kinds of inattention: While those with ADHD can engage their attention but fail to sustain it over time, people with SCT seem to have difficulty with engaging their attention to a specific task. Accordingly, the attentional style in SCT may be <b>more</b> <b>halting</b> and sluggish, whereas in ADHD it is jumpy and flighty.|$|R

2500|$|Skoppum Station {{is located}} [...] from Oslo West Station at an {{elevation}} of [...] {{above mean sea level}} (AMSL).

It continues past three <b>more</b> <b>halts,</b> Langgrunn, Rørestrand and Steinsnes, before reaching Horten Station, located at [...] AMSL. In Horten there was a branch to the port.|$|R
50|$|Skoppum Station {{is located}} 99.54 km from Oslo West Station at an {{elevation}} of 39.0 m {{above mean sea level}} (AMSL). It passed Vestre Sande Station after 1.68 km before reaching Borre Station, located 3.53 km from Skoppum and at 25.9 m AMSL. It continues past three <b>more</b> <b>halts,</b> Langgrunn, Rørestrand and Steinsnes, before reaching Horten Station, located at 2.2 m AMSL. In Horten there was a branch to the port.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>halt</b> <b>did</b> {{not appear}} in public timetables. Its purpose was to bring workers {{to and from the}} remote colliery, but on at least one {{occasion}} a passenger special called to take children to and from a Sunday School outing at St Bees. Further research is needed to establish exactly when services to the halt ended, as Butt differs from Croughton et al., who state it was still being used in October 1923.|$|R
60|$|Little {{time was}} spent in the valley, but on {{ascending}} the mountain once <b>more</b> a <b>halt</b> was made for lunch.|$|R
60|$|Then {{it was he}} bethought {{himself of}} the Minute Boys, who were not {{absolutely}} needed in Cherry Valley after the hundred and fifty soldiers were quartered there, and, without knowing how {{they might be able}} to aid him in the almost hopeless task, he set off at full speed for our home, travelling by night as by day, with no <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> than were absolutely necessary in order to recruit his strength.|$|R
50|$|Villingen (Schwarzwald) station (officially called Villingen (Schwarzw) by Deutsche Bahn) {{is one of}} two {{stations}} in Villingen-Schwenningen in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. The other is Schwenningen (Neckar). In addition, there are five <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> (Haltepunkte). The station is located east of the old town of Villingen beyond the Brigach. It is located at 704 metres above sea level on the Black Forest Railway and it is the terminus of the Rottweil-Villingen railway.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to the Komuter halt during its time of opening, the STAR station was considerably more capable of handling larger numbers of passengers, with several ticket counters and ticket vending machines prepared in its ticket concourse when the station was unveiled to commuters. The station also features an island platform for its two adjoining tracks, instead of side platforms. Both segments of the station are linked by a footbridge, which, like the Komuter <b>halt,</b> <b>does</b> not accommodate disabled passengers as the footbridge is only accessible via staircases.|$|R
50|$|In {{the longer}} term the GWR's <b>halt</b> {{strategy}} <b>did</b> little to dissuade people from more convenient bus services. In 1957 British Railways closed the halt and withdrew passenger services from the line.|$|R
60|$|Vigorously, perseveringly, without rest or <b>halt,</b> <b>did</b> {{these two}} trappers pursue their way that night, with the keg slung on a pole between them. The stars glimmered {{down through the}} trees upon their path, as if they wished them success in their enterprise. It was all-important that they should reach the Indian camp before daybreak; so, {{although}} footsore and weary from their late exertions after a long day's march, they nevertheless ran steadily on at a long swinging trot, which brought them, to their inexpressible joy, much sooner than they had anticipated, to their journey's end.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports new {{findings}} on the price effect from trading halts- both voluntary and mandatory- over 2000 - 04 in an emerging share market, Malaysia. Based on our overall sample, trading halts lead to positive price reaction, increased volume, and increased volatility. We found evidence of information leakage resulting in {{a significant difference between}} voluntary and mandatory halts as well as the type of news released during halts to warrant such an impact. The duration of the halt has an isolated impact and is largely inconsequential. The frequency of <b>halts</b> <b>does</b> not seem to matter...|$|R

50|$|The {{imminent}} {{collapse of}} Nazi Germany in 1945 gravely affected all Gauligas. The Gauliga Niederrhein retained its single-division, ten-team format even for its last season, too, but after only having played one round, the league was <b>halted</b> and <b>did</b> not resume again.|$|R
