To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly <b>most</b> <b>everyone</b> goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart {{and then you have}} to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E

This was to be done not only to bolster its resistance against hydraulic uplift and earthquake forces, it also did well in screening it from public view.

June Shimonishi reviewing for School Library Journal, wrote that it [...] "delivers a fresh and entertaining take on all the standard sports clichés". She also said that its art is [...] "superb...with every inch filled with details and no gag left unseen". Zac Bertschy from Anime News Network (ANN) declared Eyeshield 21 [...] "defies convention" [...] by turning what most might consider [...] "a really ridiculously bad idea" [...] into [...] "something <b>most</b> <b>everyone</b> {{would be able to}} enjoy". Carlo Santos from ANN called it a [...] "typical sports story", writing that what make it an above average series are its characters and artwork. He also wrote that people who think American football is boring [...] "may change their minds after seeing the action sequences in Eyeshield 21." [...] Later, Santos said, [...] " [...] lot of familiar clichés show themselves" [...] in Eyeshield 21, and that [...] "he storyline also does a sloppy job of keeping track of the game...making it even less believable than it already is". However, overall, he considered the story has good art, action and pace, featuring [...] "pure sports storytelling at its finest".|$|E
500|$|According to numismatists William D. Hyder and R.W. Colbert, [...] "Borglum, {{to put it}} mildly, was a temperamental {{artist who}} managed to offend <b>most</b> <b>everyone</b> with whom he worked". They note that [...] "Borglum's past {{insolence}} had not left him in the good graces of the art community" [...] and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. [...] The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. [...] Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, {{which seemed to be}} only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. [...] Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed [...] "damn fool suggestions", but the Association threatened to fire him if he did not complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. [...] With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. [...] In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think <b>most</b> <b>everyone</b> was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|De Acosta has {{usually been}} {{described}} disparagingly, {{dismissed as a}} [...] "notorious lesbian" [...] who was a dishonest nuisance to her lovers and who consistently [...] "stalked" [...] Garbo. Garbo's biographers, for example, assess their relationship from Garbo's perspective in which Garbo is fundamentally blameless in their difficult relationship, a perpetual victim of de Acosta's alleged irksome behavior. But Robert A. Schanke, de Acosta's recent biographer, attempts, {{on the basis of}} extensive research, to provide an accurate picture of her. She was, Schanke acknowledges, flawed and imperfect, a complex woman who impaired several of her relationships and failed to achieve her professional and romantic aspirations. But he reveals her to have been an exceptionally lively, intelligent, and dynamic person who had many devoted friends. She was, he argues, a brave lesbian of her times and a person of integrity who remained kind and loyal to <b>most</b> <b>everyone</b> with whom she crossed paths. He suggests that the many denigrating portrayals of her may derive from the deep homophobia of her generation.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, New Girl was one {{of eight}} honorees in the [...] "most {{exciting}} new series" [...] category at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards, voted by journalists who had seen the pilots. Robert Bianco of USA Today considered New Girl [...] "fall's most promising new series" [...] and praised how Deschanel and Meriwether [...] "have shaped Jess into something we haven't quite seen before – {{a woman who is}} sweet yet crass, innocent yet sexy, beautiful yet clumsy, and brash yet irresistibly adorable." [...] However, he noted how [...] "Some people will be resistant to Deschanel's doe-eyed charm; others have a congenital need to insult anyone who <b>most</b> <b>everyone</b> else is praising, particularly if doing so gets them attention." [...] The Hollywood Reporter Tim Goodman saw the show as a [...] "mostly romantic comedy", and although Jess' adorability [...] "might seem like a thin premise, [...] Meriwether manages to make the situations funny and lets Deschanel channel her charm – a winning combination." [...] David Wiegand of San Francisco Chronicle would rather see the show tone down. He felt [...] "the show's fundamental setup isn't all that inspired, but it could work with smarter writing and better direction, especially with regard to Deschanel", who, in his opinion, overplayed Jess' weird habits [...] "to the point of overkill within the first 10 minutes of the show".|$|E
