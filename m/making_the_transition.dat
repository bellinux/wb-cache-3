Varney was replaced by Blake Clark. After Clark was cast to play Slinky Dog, the producers realized that Clark and Varney had coincidentally been close friends since they appeared in the 1989 film Fast Food, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> a lot easier.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities and building a public 18-hole golf course in northwest Forest Park. The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in Forest Park in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air pollution problems with little success, but damage to buildings and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a head with the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved the problem in December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E

[...] The LOD-ing algorithm reduces the geometrical complexity of a 3D object the further {{it is from the}} viewer and returns that lost complexity as the viewer gets closer to the 3D object, causing it to pop as it becomes suddenly more detailed. The LOD-ing algorithms can depend on more factors than just distance from the viewer, but it is often the primary factor that is considered.

(Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.)

The fighter squadrons flew the FJ-4B and AF-1E Fury, while the helicopter squadrons flew the UH-34 Seahorse. The following year, VMF-413 and HMM-762 were deactivated.

One such radio serial, Big Sister, {{featured}} actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera Blue Hills, which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was Autumn Affair (1958) featuring radio personality and Blue Hills star Queenie Ashton <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. Autumn Affair failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes.

25|$|The second Type 173 was {{designated}} Type 173 Mk 2 and allocated military serial XH379, {{and had a}} revised landing gear, with castoring front wheels and fixed rear wheels. It was also fitted with small stub wings at {{the front and rear}} to improve the cruise speed, the stub wings being removed after a few flights when the helicopter was used for Naval trials, and an unswept tailplane was added. As a result of the trials the Royal Navy showed an interest in ordering the type for carrier duties. In August 1956 the second prototype was leased to British European Airways for evaluation. The Mk 2 aircraft was destroyed in an accident during an air show at Filton in September 1956. The helicopter crashed into the ground nose first while <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from hover to forward flight. The crew escaped unharmed but the aircraft was written off.
