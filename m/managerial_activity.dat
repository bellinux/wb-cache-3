40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to further the {{understanding}} of the concept of leadership through an exploration of the relationship between two divergent streams of research within the behavioral approach to leadership. One behavioral approach, leadership from the establishment or traditional view, was represented by the dimensions of initiating structure and consideration, originating from the Ohio State leadership studies. The other behavioral approach, leadership viewed as <b>managerial</b> <b>activities,</b> was represented by three categories of activities. These categories were management functions, human resource management, and networking. ^ In exploring the relationship between the two behavioral approaches, a series of four stage hierarchical multiple regression procedures were performed to determine whether the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> approach explained additional variance in certain criterion variables beyond the variance accounted for by the leader behavior approach. In addition to the pilot study, two studies were conducted, differing in the format of the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> questionnaire, which was developed for this research. In study A, the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> approach, utilizing a questionnaire with a mixed standard scale format, explained unique variance for two dependent variables, supervisor influence on work unit overall effectiveness and subordinate commitment. In study B, utilizing a questionnaire with a behaviorally anchored scale format, the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> approach significantly accounted for an increment in R-square for two more dependent variables, work unit overall effectiveness and satisfaction with supervision. ^ The findings of the hierarchical regression/correlation analysis, the inverse relationship between the two behavioral approaches, and the redundancy findings of the canonical correlation analysis all supported the conclusion that a correctly specified model must include <b>managerial</b> <b>activities.</b> In addition, it was concluded that the explanation provided by the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> approach might be enhanced by a contingency model. ...|$|R

In the Canadian case, while none of the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> is related to success, traditional activities improve unit performance.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} in an Anglo and a Confucian-Asian nation how pressure is exerted on middle managers by their subordinate staff, and the <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> affected. Design/methodology/approach - In a survey, Australian (n= 251) and Singaporean (n= 340) health managers rated the degree of pressure exerted on them by subordinate staff to devote additional time to various <b>managerial</b> <b>activities.</b> They described the influence strategies employed. Findings - Ratings of the average pressure experienced regarding nine <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> were identical in both cultures. Australian managers reported significantly greater pressure affecting people and general organisational management. Singaporeans experienced more pressure affecting their quality and data management tasks. Australian subordinates used more direct-assertive and direct-persuasive influence strategies. Singaporeans employed more indirect-assertive tactics, particularly poor work performance. Research limitations/implications - The generalisability of the findings may be limited by having convenience samples from one occupational sector. Practical implications - The cultural differences found are relevant to the increasing numbers of multinational organisations and expatriate and migrant workers. The information will inform discussions on factors affecting the assignment of managers' priorities, which can be at variance with their aspirations. Originality/value - Managers' experiences of pressure from subordinates and how pressure is conveyed have been under-researched, particularly cross-culturally. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine many factors {{associated}} with family-owned businesses that lead to business success and profitability. The panel data used in this study came from the 1997 and 2000 waves of the National Family Business Study (NFBS). Many independent variables from the 1997 wave (e. g., age, gender, <b>managerial</b> <b>activities,</b> business size, home-based, business problems) were tested to predict business success and profitability (dependent variables), which were variables from the 2000 wave. Some of the descriptive analyses indicated that, compared to female managers, male managers perceived less business success, participated more in <b>managerial</b> <b>activities,</b> managed older businesses, experienced more business problems, and experienced fewer business cash-flow problems. Compared to businesses that are not home-based, home-based businesses reported less perceived business success, less business profitability, were smaller businesses, experienced fewer business problems, had fewer business liabilities, and had managers with poorer health and less education. Overall, the ordinary least squares regression analyses yielded results indicating that <b>managerial</b> <b>activities,</b> home-based businesses, business age, business problems, and business cash-flow problems were all statistically significantly associated with perceived business success.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of {{information}} resources and communication technologies, both traditional and electronic, by academic library directors. The purpose is to improve understanding of managerial behavior when using information resources and communication technologies within a shared information environment. Taylor's concept of an information use environment is used to capture the elements associated with information use and communication within the context of decision-making styles, managerial roles, organizational environments, and professional communities. This qualitative study uses interviews, observations, questionnaires, and documents. Library directors participating in the study are from doctoral-degree granting universities in the southwestern United States. Data collection involved on-site observations with a PDA (personal digital assistant), structured interviews with library directors and their administrative assistants, the Decision Style Inventory, and a questionnaire based on Mintzberg's managerial roles. Findings show the existence of a continuum in <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> between an Administrator and an Administrator/Academic as critical to understanding information use and communication patterns among library directors. There is a gap between self-perception of <b>managerial</b> <b>activities</b> and actual performance, a finding that would not have surfaced without the use of multiple methods. Other findings include the need for a technical ombudsman, a managerial-level position reporting to the library director; the importance of information management as an administrative responsibility; the importance of trust when evaluating information; and the importance of integrating information and communication across formats, time, and <b>managerial</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
