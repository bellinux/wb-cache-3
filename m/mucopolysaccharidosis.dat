25|$|Subjects with a <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> {{either do}} not produce enough {{of one of the}} eleven enzymes {{required}} to break down these sugar chains into simpler molecules, or they produce enzymes that do not work properly. Over time, these glycosaminoglycans collect in the cells, blood and connective tissues. The result is permanent, progressive cellular damage which affects appearance, physical abilities, organ and system functioning, and, in most cases, mental development.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> subtype, {{affected}} {{individuals may}} have normal intellect or have cognitive impairments, may experience developmental delay, or may have severe behavioral problems. Many individuals have hearing loss, either conductive (in which pressure behind the eardrum causes fluid from {{the lining of}} the middle ear to build up and eventually congeal), neurosensory (in which tiny hair cells in the inner ear are damaged), or both. Communicating hydrocephalus—in which the normal reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and causes increased pressure inside the head—is common in some of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Surgically inserting a shunt into the brain can drain fluid. The eye's cornea often becomes cloudy from intracellular storage, and glaucoma and degeneration of the retina also may affect the patient's vision.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it {{is reserved for}} patients with life-threatening diseases. As survival following the procedure has increased, its use has expanded beyond cancer to [...] autoimmune diseases and hereditary skeletal dysplasias; notably malignant infantile osteopetrosis and <b>mucopolysaccharidosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{distinct}} clinical {{types and}} numerous subtypes of the mucopolysaccharidoses have been identified. Although each <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) differs clinically, most patients generally experience {{a period of}} normal development followed by a decline in physical and/or mental function. (Note: MPS-V and MPS-VIII {{are no longer in}} use as designations for any disease.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The mucopolysaccharidoses {{are part}} of the {{lysosomal}} storage disease family, a group of more than 40 genetic disorders that result when the lysosome organelle in animal cells malfunctions. [...] The lysosome {{can be thought of as}} the cell's recycling center because it processes unwanted material into other substances that the cell can utilize. [...] Lysosomes break down this unwanted matter via enzymes, highly specialized proteins essential for survival. [...] Lysosomal disorders like <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> are triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, {{what appears}} to be the first case of Urbach–Wiethe disease was {{reported}} by Friedrich Siebenmann, a professor of otolaryngology in Basel, Switzerland. [...] In 1925, Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients. An official report of Urbach–Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe. Its original name of 'lipoidosis cutis et mucosae' was changed to 'lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae' due to Urbach's belief that the condition was due to abnormal lipid and protein deposits within the tissues. Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of <b>mucopolysaccharidosis,</b> amyloidosis, or even porphyria. [...] The discovery of the Urbach–Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach–Wiethe disease from these other conditions.|$|E
50|$|Deficiency of this enzyme {{results in}} the {{accumulation}} of undergraded substrate and the lysosomal storage disorder <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type IIID (Sanfilippo D syndrome). <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type IIID is the least common of the four subtypes of Sanfilippo syndrome.|$|E
