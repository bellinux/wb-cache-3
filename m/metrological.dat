Initially its prime <b>metrological</b> purpose was a periodic recalibration of national prototype metres and kilograms against the international prototype.|$|E

Liu Hui expressed all of his mathematical results in the form of decimal fractions (using <b>metrological</b> units), yet the later Yang Hui (c. 1238-1298 AD) expressed his mathematical results in full decimal expressions.|$|E

500|$|CGPM (General Conference on Weights and Measures / [...] )—The Conference meets {{every four}} to six years and {{consists}} of delegates of the nations who had signed the convention.

500|$|Communication of <b>metrological</b> {{information}} {{was one of}} the issues facing mid-seventeenth century savants; many discussed the possibility of scholarly communication using a so-called [...] "universal measure" [...] that was not tied to a particular national system of measurement. Mouton's ideas attracted interest at the time; Picard in his work Mesure de la Terre (1671) and Huygens in his work Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum (1673) both proposing that a standard unit of length be tied to the beat frequency of a pendulum.|$|E
500|$|In 2010 Marcus Foster of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation {{published}} a wide-ranging critique of SI {{in which he}} raised numerous issues ranging from basic {{issues such as the}} absence of the symbol [...] "Ω" [...] from most Western keyboards to the abstract issues such as inadequate formalism in the <b>metrological</b> concepts on which SI is based. The changes proposed in the New SI only addressed issues regarding the definition of the base units including new definitions of the candela and the mole—units that Foster argued were not true base units. Other issues raised by Foster fell outside the scope of the proposal.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{held the}} {{position}} of Director of Aeronautical Inspection throughout World WarII, his staff numbering more than 1,200 by 1945. A reorganisation of the directorate in 1940 had permitted qualified civilian engineers to be recruited for work that required increasing technical expertise, without them having to join the Air Force. In July the same year, Harrison proposed {{the construction of a}} series of test houses to help decentralise chemical, mechanical and <b>metrological</b> testing of materials used in the manufacture of munitions that previously had to go through either the Munitions Supply Laboratories or the National Standards Laboratory. The result was a major improvement in the speed of testing and, according to the official history of Australia in the war, [...] "a fuller use of the country's scientific and technical manpower". Harrison's daughter Greta joined the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, {{and by the end of}} the war was ranked flight officer.|$|E
2500|$|When using {{laboratory}} glassware for high precision measurements, {{such as in}} a testing laboratory, the <b>metrological</b> grade glassware becomes important. [...] The <b>metrological</b> grade the can {{be determined by the}} confidence interval around the nominal value of measurement marks and the traceability of the calibration to an NIST standard. Periodically {{it may be necessary to}} check the calibration of the {{laboratory glassware}}.|$|E
2500|$|This method {{typically}} uses a four-quadrant BSE detector. The microscope produces four {{images of}} the same specimen at the same time, so no tilt is required. The method gives <b>metrological</b> 3D dimensions {{as far as the}} slope of the specimen remains reasonable.|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, Michelson had {{the honor}} {{of being the first}} American to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics [...] "for his optical {{precision}} instruments and the spectroscopic and <b>metrological</b> investigations carried out with their aid".

2500|$|In Early Dynastic Sumer (c 2900–2300 BCE) {{metrology}} {{and mathematics}} were indistinguishable and {{treated as a}} single scribal discipline. [...] The idea of an abstract number did not yet exist, thus all quantities were written as <b>metrological</b> symbols and never as numerals followed by a unit symbol. [...] For example there was a symbol for one-sheep and another for one-day but no symbol for one. [...] About 600 of these <b>metrological</b> symbols exist, for this reason archaic Sumerian metrology is complex and not fully understood. [...] In general however, length, volume, and mass are derived from a theoretical standard cube, called 'gur', filled with barley, wheat, water, or oil. [...] The mass of a gur-cube, called 'gun2' {{is defined as the}} weight a laden ass can carry. [...] However, because of the different specific gravities of these substances combined with dual numerical bases (sexagesimal or decimal), multiple sizes of the gur-cube were used without consensus. [...] The different gur-cubes are related by proportion, based on the water gur-cube, according to four basic coefficients and their cubic roots. [...] These coefficients are given as: ...|$|E

5000|$|This {{criterion}} has two factors, {{the first}} factor is the spin noise reduction, i.e. how much the quantum noise in [...] is reduced relative to the coherent (unentangled) state. The second factor is how much the coherence (the length of the Bloch vector, [...] ) is reduced due to the squeezing procedure. Together these quantities {{tell you how much}} <b>metrological</b> enhancement the squeezing procedure gives. Here, <b>metrological</b> enhancement is the reduction in averaging time or atom number needed to make a measurement of a specific uncertainty. 20 dB of <b>metrological</b> enhancement means the same precision measurement can be made with 100 times fewer atoms or 100 times shorter averaging time.|$|E
