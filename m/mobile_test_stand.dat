40|$|Abstract—In {{the report}} the {{features}} of formation of radar images (RI) and optical images (OI) in the <b>mobile</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> of radio-vision systems (RVS) of a car are presented. The radio-vision system of a car (CRVS) of the millimeter-wavelength with frequency modulation is considered. Features of for-mation and processing of the radar-tracking image in CRVS are discussed, in particular: the sizes of the image, system of coordinates, primary and secondary processing of RI, re-quirements for speeds of transfer of figures in real time of processing, for subsystem of display of RI and synchroniza-tion. The structure of the <b>mobile</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> of CRVS is de-scribed. This stand consists of: CRVS, a video camera, the module of formation, recording and display of RI and of optical images, the module of control of a stand, the power supply unit. Features of formation and display OI are con-sidered, in particular: the coordination of scale and short-ening of images, creation of time synchronization at display and records of OI, and questions of synchronous fusion of RI and OI also. Keywords — features of formation and fusion of radar and opti-cal images, <b>mobile</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand,</b> radar image, radio-vision system of a car. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{accurate}} performance data {{is a common}} problem with most civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) power plant producers. The reasons for this are {{the small size of}} most of the manufacturers and the high price of precise wind tunnel testing and computer simulations. To overcome this problem at Dronamics Ltd., with support from the Department of Aeronautics of TU-Sofia, a <b>mobile</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> for evaluation of electric power plants for unmanned aircraft was developed. The stand may be used statically, or may be installed on the roof of an automobile. The measurement system of the stand is based on popular hardware that is used in radio controlled models and in general automation. The verification of the measurement system is performed by comparing static test results with data published by the manufacturer of the tested electric motor. Tests were carried out with 2 different types of propellers and the results were compared with published results for common propellers as well as with results of theoretical studies. The results are satisfactory for practical applications. The use of this type of test stands can be a cheap and effective alternative for research and development start-up companies like Dronamics...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on a swashplate compressor to determine the state of lubrication. Measurements of electrical resistance were taken as a primary measure of oil film lubrication at the sliding shoe/swashplate interface. Two additional sensors were used to indirectly determine the state of compressor lubrication. These included an acoustic emission sensor mounted {{on the outside of}} the compressor and a dynamic pressure transducer mounted in the swashplate cavity of the compressor. The compressor lubrication experiments were performed on a <b>mobile</b> air conditioning <b>test</b> <b>stand.</b> The loop was modified to control and measure steady oil return to the compressor. Steady oil circulation conditions were controlled to determine effects of oil circulation rate, compressor speed, and condenser air inlet temperature on compressor lubrication. Furthermore, liquid refrigerant slugging and dry oil start up tests and an oil shut off test were conducted to study severe oil lubrication conditions on the compressor. This thesis outlines the instrumentation used on the compressor to determine the state of lubrication. Also included are the steady oil circulation test results. A second thesis, written by Chappell [2000], describes the techniques used to control and measure oil circulation. In addition, the transient oil circulation test conditions are presented, including the start up conditions and the oil shut off test. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 9...|$|R

40|$|Recently, National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) {{has tested}} rocket engines with high pulse frequencies. This has {{resulted}} in the use of some of WSTF's existing thrust stands, which were designed for static loading, in tests with large dynamic forces. In order to ensure that the thrust stands can withstand the dynamic loading of high pulse frequency engines while still accurately reporting the test data, their vibrational modes must be characterized. If it is found that they have vibrational modes with frequencies near the pulsing frequency of the test, then they must be modified to withstand the dynamic forces from the pulsing rocket engines. To make this determination the <b>Mobile</b> Modal <b>Testing</b> Unit (MMTU), a system capable of determining the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of a structure, was used on the <b>test</b> <b>stands</b> at WSTF. Once the resonant frequency has been determined for a <b>test</b> <b>stand,</b> it can be compared to the pulse frequency of a test engine {{to determine whether or not}} that stand can avoid resonance and reliably test that engine. After analysis of <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> 406 at White Sands Test Facility, it was determined that natural frequencies for the structure are located around 75, 125, and 240 Hz, and thus should be avoided during testing...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{lubrication}} failures at the shoe/swash plate contact {{of automotive}} swash plate compressors will greatly enhance {{the reliability of}} the air conditioning system. Maintaining proper lubrication is not always possible during transient conditions. Therefore, a method for detection of lubricant loss is of great interest to the automotive industry. Three methods for detecting lubrication loss were examined: contact resistance, acoustic emission, and dynamic pressure oscillations. A <b>mobile</b> air conditioning <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> capable of recording many system parameters was used. Oil return to the compressor was monitored using an oil separator and a refrigerant/oil concentration sensor. Data were taken during steady oil return rates and after oil shut off. The electrical contact resistance between the shoe and swashplate was used to indicate changes in the lubrication conditions at this critical interface. Measurements were taken at two oil return rates, during steady oil return tests. Preliminary results show that the minimum contact resistance is independent of the steady oil flow rates tested. In addition to the contact resistance, an acoustic emission (AE) sensor and a dynamic pressure transducer (DPX) were used to monitor oil film breakdown after oil shut off. Preliminary data indicate that the DPX may be an early indicator of low oil circulation. Even after several hours of operation after oil shut off, the magnitude of the contact resistance indicated no oil film breakdown had occurred. It was determined that the AE sensor is probably not an adequate indicator of lubrication breakdown. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 9...|$|R
