25|$|After {{the end of}} World War I, {{grain and}} beef prices fell precipitously. In order to stave off {{creditors}}, Colter formed the Northern Arizona Land Company, which issued $450,000 in bonds, using all of the deeded acres as collateral. However, this proved {{to be only a}} stopgap measure, and by 1924 creditors began to foreclose on different parcels of property to satisfy the notes. By the early 1930s every piece of land had been foreclosed on. In 1935 the ranch was sold to William A. Spence. The new owner moved the commissary from what is now the intersection of 4th Street and School Bus Road, to its current position. With the wave of mechanized farming taking hold, Spence also constructed the <b>machine</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Four of {{the farm}} {{buildings}} located near the house comprise the core of structures built by Tosten Bonde during the 1870s and 1880s; Bonde's journal recorded the construction dates. [...] These structures include a gambrel-roofed barn, built in 1870 and remodeled {{at the turn of}} the 20th century; an 1883 <b>machine</b> <b>shed</b> that was later turned to a garage; an 1886 granary; and an 1887 milk house. [...] These buildings were included in the original nomination to the NRHP.|$|E
60|$|It is high summer, and our shed lies open {{at either}} end. On one hand is a steep {{mountain}} side down which there comes, now bridging a chasm, now a mere straight groove across a meadow, now hidden among green branches, the water-slide that brings our trees from the purple forest overhead. Above us, but nearly hidden, hums the <b>machine</b> <b>shed,</b> {{but we see}} {{a corner of the}} tank into which, with a mighty splash, the pine trees are delivered. Every now and then, bringing with him a gust of resinous smell, a white-clad machinist will come in with a basketful of crude, unwrought little images, and will turn them out upon the table from which we carvers select them.|$|E
50|$|As herd sizes {{increased}} {{there was}} more need to have efficient milking <b>machines,</b> <b>sheds,</b> milk-storage facilities (vats), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back.|$|R
50|$|Also on the {{property}} are the contributing brick kitchen, a dairy, a wash-house, two smokehouses, two sheds, a cool-storage building, a privy, a stable, a barn, a slave cabin, a corncrib, two <b>machine</b> <b>sheds,</b> a toolshed, a garage, a late 18th-century schoolhouse, and the family cemetery.|$|R

6000|$|There {{were two}} prisoners, Petty the ratcatcher, who had {{attempted}} some resistance {{and had been}} knocked down by Griff's horse, and a young lad in a smock-frock who had fallen {{off the wall and}} hurt his knee, and who blubbered piteously, declaring that them chaps had forced him to go with them, or they would duck him in the horse- pond. They were supposed to be given in charge to some one, but were lost sight of, and no wonder! For just then it was discovered that the <b>machine</b> <b>shed</b> was on fire. The rioters had apparently detached one of their number to kindle the flame before assaulting the house. The matter was specially serious, because the stackyard was on a line with the Rectory, at some distance indeed, but on lower ground; and what with barns, hay and wheat ricks, sheds, cowhouses and stables, all thatched, a big wood-pile, and a long old-fashioned greenhouse, there was almost continuous communication. [...] Clouds of smoke and an ominous smell were already perceptible on the wind, generated by the heat, and the loose straw in the centre of the farmyard was beginning to be ignited by the flakes and sparks, carrying the mischief everywhere, and rendering it exceedingly difficult to release the animals and drive them to a place of safety. Water was scarce. There were only two wells, besides the pump in the house, and a shallow pond. The brook was {{a quarter of a mile}} off in the valley, and the nearest engine, a poor feeble thing, at Wattlesea. Moreover, the assailants might discover how small was the force of rescuers, and return to the attack. Thus, while Griff, who had given amateur assistance at all the fires he could reach in London; was striving to organise resistance to this new enemy, my father induced the gentlemen to cause the horses to be put to the various vehicles, and employ them in carrying the women and children to Chantry House. The old Rector was persuaded to go to take care of his daughter-in-law, and she only thought of putting her girls in safety. She listened to reason, and indeed was too much exhausted to move when once she was laid on the sofa. She would not hear of going to bed, though her little daughter Anne was sent off with her nurse, grandpapa persuading her that Rosella and the others were very much tired. When she was gone, he declared his fears that he had sat down on Celestina's head, and showed so much compunction that we were much amused at his relief when Martyn assured him of having searched the carriage with a stable lantern, so that whatever had befallen the lady he was not the guilty person. He really seemed more concerned about this than at the loss of all his own barns and stores. And little Anne was certainly as lovely and engaging a little creature as ever I saw; while, as to her elder sister, in all the trouble and anxiety of the night, I could not help enjoying the sight of her beautiful eager face and form. She was tall and very slight, sylph-like, as it was the fashion to call it, but every limb was instinct with grace and animation. Her face was, perhaps, rather too thin for robust health, though this enhanced the idea of her being all spirit, as also did the transparency of complexion, tinted with an exquisite varying carnation. Her eyes were of a clear, bright, rather light brown, and were sparkling with the lustre of excitement, her delicate lips parted, showing the pretty pearly teeth, as she was telling Emily, in a low voice of enthusiasm, scarcely designed for my ears, how glorious a sight our brother had been, riding there in his glancing silver, bearing down all before him with his good sword, like the Captal de Buch dispersing the Jacquerie.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>Shed</b> (1940s): It was {{originally}} a granary but was {{converted into a}} <b>machine</b> <b>shed.</b> The original granary structure was probably built {{at the same time}} as the barn. To convert it to a <b>machine</b> <b>shed,</b> the elevator and south wall were removed. The alterations occurred during a period of historical significance, illustrating the transition from [...] "horse power" [...] to mechanization. This was made possible by using silos to store grain.|$|E

40|$|Iowa {{farmers can}} expect a near-record corn harvest this year. There are three grain storage options for farmers to handle the large {{expected}} harvest: store the grain temporarily on the farm, sell the grain under a credit sale contract, or store the grain in an elevator under a warehouse receipt. Store the grain temporarily on the farm. Indoor temporary storage, such as in <b>machine</b> <b>sheds,</b> pole buildings, or warehouses, is preferred over outdoor storage. The storage facility should have a flat cement floor or a 4 - to 6 -mil plastic vapor barrier to prevent soil moisture from moving into the grain. Grain should not be piled against walls unless the walls are reinforced. Most <b>machine</b> <b>sheds</b> are not designed for any load of corn on the side walls, but grain kits or freestanding bulkheads can be used. Silos or corn cribs {{also can be used}} as temporary grain storage with some modifications...|$|R

50|$|A {{fairly large}} tornado {{outbreak}} of mostly weak tornadoes {{occurred in the}} Central Plains, however four of the tornado were strong to violent. A destructive F3 passed near Parkers Prairie, Minnesota. Many irrigation systems were overturned, trees, power poles, and lines were snapped, and grain bins destroyed by the strong wind. An estimated 100 poles were broken off leaving nearly 1,100 people without power. Several farmsteads were heavily damaged or destroyed in the area, and 3 people were injured. A large and slow-moving F4 tornado occurred near Ruby, Nebraska. The tornado destroyed an entire farmstead, along with several propane and anhydrous ammonia tanks. Several vehicles were tumbled and tossed into a field across from the farm house. Barns, <b>machine</b> <b>sheds,</b> and outbuildings were destroyed as well. An F2 near Flensburg, Minnesota tore the roof off of a house and destroyed several outbuildings. A large half-mile wide tornado also touched down near Brainerd, Minnesota. The tornado tore roofs off houses and blew out exterior walls. Pole barns and sheds were destroyed, and windows were blown out. Thousands of trees were knocked down, and 41 head of livestock were killed as well. The Brainerd tornado was rated F2. Overall, the outbreak produced 36 tornadoes.|$|R
5000|$|Property {{damage in}} Del Rio was about $1 million, [...] with wind impacts mostly to roofs, mobile homes, signs, boats, windows, trees, and homes under construction, while some {{businesses}} and homes were flooded. In Frio County, a tornado spawned in the Dilley area toppled utility poles, destroyed several chicken houses, and blew {{the roof of}} a house 600 to 900 ft away. In addition, two farm houses were deroofed and several outhouses were damaged. Another tornado spawned nearby caused [...] "considerable" [...] damage to the Dilley Civic Center, destroyed <b>machine</b> <b>sheds,</b> unroofed outbuildings, and felled many electrical poles. Throughout Dilley, there was $250,000 in property damage and $350,000 in crop losses. An estimated $50,000 was inflected to property in Eagle Pass. Strong winds in George West caused damage to 90% of trees, some houses, and cotton crops. Damage estimates in the city range from $250,000-$500,000. In Gregory, property losses was about $1 million, while there was about $25,000 in damage to crops.

500|$|Since {{the tornado}} {{remained}} over mostly open terrain, damage was relatively light – although still significant in isolated locations – {{in comparison to}} its extreme intensity. Surveys from the National Weather Service revealed that structures in its path sustained EF3-level damage at most. The Oklahoma City West Livestock Market {{was described as a}} [...] "war zone," [...] sustaining extensive damage. Several large steel-frame warehouse type buildings were destroyed at that location. Multiple large brick buildings at the nearby Canadian Valley Technology Center were heavily damaged or destroyed, and a large metal wind turbine prop blade was thrown [...] into the side of a daycare building on the property. Damage totals at that location alone were estimated at up to $40 million. One farmstead, consisting of a large barn, a cattle barn, three <b>machine</b> <b>sheds,</b> granaries and the owner's home, was also completely destroyed. Several other rural homes were destroyed, and large amounts of gravel was blown off of gravel roads in the area, with only the dirt underneath left at some locations. Several large metal electrical transmission poles were downed, trees were snapped and defoliated, and multiple vehicles were tossed from roadways in the area.
