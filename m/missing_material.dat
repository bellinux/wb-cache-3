5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to <b>missing</b> <b>material.</b> Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E

He worked for several high-tech firms in the Washington, D.C. area, including TRW, ICA and Logicon Process Systems. At about this time, several teenaged girls disappeared in and around that area. He later moved to Florida and began working in 1983 at Harris Corporation in Palm Bay, Florida.|$|R
40|$|Chemists and {{material}} scientists have often {{focused on the}} properties of previously reported compounds, leaving out numerous unreported but chemically plausible compounds that could have interesting properties. For example, the 18 -valence electron ABX family of compounds includes the half-Heusler subgroup, and features examples of topological insulators, thermoelectrics and superconductors, but only 83 out of 483 of these possible compounds have been made. Using first-principles thermodynamics we have examined the theoretical stability of 400 unreported members and predict that 54 should be stable. 15 previously <b>missing</b> <b>materials,</b> now predicted stable, were grown in this study; X-ray studies agreed with the predicted crystal structure in all 15 cases. Among the characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals. This integrated process-prediction of functionality in unreported compounds followed by laboratory synthesis and characterization-could be a route to the systematic discovery of hitherto <b>missing,</b> realizable functional <b>materials...</b>|$|R

But before this rasterization occurs, workers in the prepress department confirm the incoming materials {{to make sure they}} are ready to be sent to the RIP. This is an important step because it prevents production delays caused by <b>missing</b> <b>materials</b> or improperly prepared materials. Once the incoming materials have passed the pre-flight check, they are ready to be put into production and sent to the RIP.|$|R
