5000|$|In the 1930s, the {{toxicity}} associated with PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, including polychlorinated naphthalenes, was recognized {{because of a}} variety of industrial incidents. Between 1936 and 1937, there were several medical cases and papers released on the possible link between PCBs and its detrimental health effects. In 1936 a U.S. Public Health Service official described the wife and child of a worker from the Monsanto Industrial Chemical Company who exhibited blackheads and pustules on their skin. The official attributed these symptoms to contact with the worker's clothing after he returned from work. In 1937, a conference about the hazards was organized at Harvard School of Public Health, and a number of publications referring to {{the toxicity}} of various chlorinated hydrocarbons were published before 1940. In 1947 Robert Brown reminded chemists that Arochlors were [...] "objectionably toxic. Thus the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>concentration</b> for an 8-hr. day is 1 mg/m3 of air.

Therefore, the present work is a part of a continuations researcher of the processes in natural waters containing humic substances at the influence of pulsed electrical discharges in a layer of iron pellets. It is shown that the main stage of water purification process of humic substances during treatment by pulsed electric discharge in the layer of iron granules is a difficult process including several stages such as formation of iron oxyhydroxide colloid particles, sorption and coagulation with humic macromolecules substances, growth of particle dispersed phase and precipitation.
