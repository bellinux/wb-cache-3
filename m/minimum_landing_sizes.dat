40|$|In the North Sea, Scottish vessels target haddock, cod, whiting, monkfish, saithe, and {{flatfish}} in a mixed whitefish trawl fishery. These species mature {{at different}} sizes and hence have {{a range of}} <b>minimum</b> <b>landing</b> <b>sizes.</b> Their different shapes and swimming capabilities imply different selection characteristics when escaping from trawl gear. However, they are often caught at the same time on the same grounds. Optimal exploitation can only be achieved by ensuring that the selection of each species varies appropriately with length during the fishing process. This paper describes one part of a large European project to develop species-selective trawl gear to improve the exploitation pattern of North Sea cod, while maintaining the catch of other important commercial species. A gear suit-able to the Scottish mixed whitefish fishery was fitted with a horizontal panel in the tapered part of the net to separate species into an upper and lower compartment. Trials were conducted on research vessels to measure separation performance for nine species in different light conditions, at different towing speeds, and with different lengths of panel. Most haddock, whiting, and saithe pass above the panel, whereas most cod, flatfish, and monkfish pass below it. Towing speed and panel length had no significant effect on separation.

In each area, five species constituted the majority of the marketable catch (> 97 %) : sardine (Sardina pilchardus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), round sardinella (Sardinella aurita), bogue (Boops boops) (in both areas), mackerel (Scomber japonicus; in the Aegean Sea) and picarel (Spicara smaris; in the Ionian Sea). Discarded quantities were on average 4. 6 % and 2. 2 % of the total catch in terms of weight in the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. Discards on the marketable ratio fluctuated over years and seasons without showing any particular trend. At the species level, sardine and mackerel were seldom discarded while large amounts of anchovy were discarded only during its recruitment period (autumn), when juvenile fish dominate the population. The discarding ratio for bogue, picarel and round sardinella ranged from zero to total discarding because they constitute a supplementary source of income for the fishers. Discarded fish comprised mainly small individuals for all species considered with the exception of round sardinella. However, the lengths at which 50 % of the individuals were discarded were generally small, often smaller than the species <b>minimum</b> <b>landing</b> <b>sizes.</b> Geographical coordinates and marketable catch explained part of the variability of the discarded quantities, as revealed by generalized additive models.

Here, we assess small-scale spatial variation in size at maturity over a year to identify the seasons that increase error in visual maturity estimates. We compare and contrast results from methods used in the literature to estimate maturity for B. undatum. Monthly, B. undatum samples were obtained from Welsh fishers between May 2013 and May 2014 from eight sites at four locations (n = 5080). All whelks were sexed, weighed, and measured, and up to 60 whelks from each location were assessed for maturity (n = 1659). Mature whelks were found in all months, with a peak in reproductive activity through summer and early autumn, followed by the onset of spawning in November. Size at maturity varied between sexes and sites, and ranged from 51 to 76 mm TSL. Whelks caught in shallow waters (0 - 10 m) matured at a smaller size than those from deeper waters (up to 60 m). Length frequency varied at each site suggesting that a single increase in MLS would impact fishers disproportionately. No methodology trialled was found without inherent errors when used in isolation, though a combination of methods proved ideal. The seasonal variation in maturity estimates suggested that assigning maturity is increasingly difficult outside annual reproductive periods and that prespawning is the ideal time to undertake visual gonad assessments for whelks...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of mesh configuration from 55 mm diamond to 55 turn square mesh on the size selectivity of four by-catch species (the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and the blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou) commonly captured in the crustacean fishery off the Portuguese south coast, were evaluated. Selectivity parameters for blue whiting, the most abundant species in the catches, were estimated taking into account between-haul variation, while for the remaining species, captured in much lower quantities, the selectivity estimates were based on pooled data by length class for all hauls within the same cod end. Length at 50 % retention, L- 50, was found to increase with mesh size and with the change in mesh configuration for all the studied species. For blue whiting trawling depth and cod end catch were found {{to play a role in}} between-haul variation by increasing L- 50 as well. The results suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 - 70 mm would be advisable to be compatible with the <b>minimum</b> <b>landing</b> <b>sizes</b> (MLSs) of 29 mm carapace length and 27 cm total length for red shrimp and hake, respectively, while it would greatly reduce the amount of discards, particularly those for blue whiting, that accounted for approximately 50 % of the total catch weight.

The increase in mesh size had a small but significant effect on size selectivity for the three species, while the change in mesh configuration led to a much more pronounced increase in the selectivity parameters. For horse mackerel, the L 50 estimates ranged from 14. 4 to 16. 0 cm in the diamond mesh cod ends-values that are close to the minimum landing size of 15 cm. For hake, L 50 of 17. 0 and 18. 3 cm were estimated for the 70 and 80 mm diamond cod ends respectively, while for the axillary seabream the L 50 estimated was 13. 9 cm for the 80 mm diamond mesh cod end.

Alternate hauls {{were used to assess}} the selectivity of 36 -mm square-mesh codend. Selectivity of sorting grids was assessed using a double codend in which fish that escaped through the grid were captured in the lower codend while other fish were guided into the upper codend. The mean selection length (L 50) for European hake was 18. 5 cm and that for the Atlantic horse mackerel was 14. 0 cm with the 36 -mm square-mesh codend. These values are close to their current <b>minimum</b> <b>landing</b> <b>sizes</b> (20 cm for hake and 12 cm for horse mackerel). The sorting grid with 20 -mm bar spacing showed L 50 value of 13. 3 cm for hake, suggesting that a larger grid-spacing would be needed to obtain sufficient sorting performance. Similarly, for Atlantic mackerel the estimated L 50 of 14. 3 cm indicates that larger grid spacing is required to attain an L 50 that would be close to the current MLS (18 cm). For Atlantic horse mackerel and red mullet, the L 50 obtained with the sorting grid with 20 -mm bar spacing was close to the MLS of these species (the MLS of red mullet is 11 cm). The selectivity of the sorting grid with 15 -mm bar spacing was generally very poor. Size-selection performance of sorting grids was assessed {{for the first time in}} the local fisheries. In order to effectively improve size-selection, seasonal and depth-dependent differences between target and by-catch species must be taken into account, which is a good indicator of the difficulty of implementing a single mesh size or grid spacing in the Mediterranean demersal trawl fishery...|$|E

The {{success of}} fishery {{management}} ultimately {{depends on the}} approach of implementation. Past fishery management has relied largely on technical regulations. Examples for such command-and-control measures include detailed gear prescriptions, restrictions on the days-at-sea spent fishing and vessel capacity, and <b>minimum</b> <b>landing</b> <b>sizes.</b> Resource economists have argued in favor of incentive-based approaches, such as individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems and harvesting fees. For a fishery with multiple ecological and economic interactions, neither of the two approaches can assure a first-best solution in general. A central question thus is, {{which of the two}} approaches is more effective and efficient with respect to the objectives of ecosystem-based management. Here, we focus on intra-specific ecological and technical interactions which arise within an age-structured fishery. We use an age-structured ecological-economic optimization model of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery to quantify and analyze the effects of gear regulations and total allowable catches, as they have been applied since the mid 1980 s, as well as alternative, incentive-based systems, i. e. tradable quotas. We find that gear restrictions have not been effective and that the gradual increase of mesh sizes may even have been detrimental, as total allowable catches have been set as ineffectively high levels. Setting total allowable catches at sufficiently restrictive levels could have achieved an efficient outcome. Tradable quotas in terms of numbers of fish would achieve a similarly effective outcome in ecological terms, and would be economically preferable, because no technical restrictions are needed. We discuss possibilities to extend our results to multi-species fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} are {{an important}} fisheries sector in Greece and the Mediterranean. They are characterized by high heterogeneity and a multitude of particularities. The management of small-scale fisheries requires taking into account biological {{as well as social}} and economical elements. In the present study, a typology of Greek small-scale fisheries was developed based on biological, social and economical parameters. Consequently, the study focused in the Patraikos Gulf, where elements such as the fishing activity of the local fleet, catch and catch per unit of effort, species composition, discards and length composition of individuals caught were examined. The prefectures of Greece were stratified considering the number of fishermen and local dependence on fisheries and interviews of fishermen were carried out. The multitude of fishing gears and target species and the intense spatial heterogeneity was confirmed. The major activity pattern identified was seasonal (20 days of activity in summer, 13 in winter), however local particularities arose. The main metiers practiced were identified as combinations of fishing gear, target species, area and season. Concerning socio-economical elements, the fishermen generally had low education, high average age, tendency to remain in their place of birth and the profession is attached to the family. The fishermen were categorized into three dependence groups, based on the percentage of income originating from fisheries. Significant differences were identified among these groups considering variables such as mean fishermen age, vessel size, days of activity and income from fishing. Consequently, the small-scale fisheries of the Patraikos Gulf were studied using data from sampling of fishing operations. The catch weighted about 12 kg per operation on average and a total of 102 species were recorded. A methodology for the identification of metiers using a limited dataset, {{as is often the case}} in the Mediterranean, was developed. The metiers identified showed significant differences in catch quantity and composition and were grouped in meta-metiers to facilitate fishing activity sampling schemes. The study of discards revealed three reasons for discarding: low commercial value (78 % of discards), destruction of the catch before gear retrieval (5 %) and bad handling of the catch on board (17 %). High discard ratio was recorded for the longline and small-size mesh trammel net metiers. Using data of individual length per species, comparisons were carried out among metiers and seasons that in most cases revealed significant differences. The study of the effect of <b>minimum</b> <b>landing</b> <b>sizes</b> legislation showed a low percentage of undersized individuals regarding both the legislation currently in effect and the proposed one by the Roadmap for the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union, but exceptions arose for certain species.
