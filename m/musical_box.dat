The most successful act has been the Canadian-French band The <b>Musical</b> <b>Box</b> that have been officially endorsed by the band and had Hackett and Collins perform as guests with them. Gabriel has taken his children to see the <b>Musical</b> <b>Box,</b> so [...] "they could see what their father did back then", while Hackett has said [...] "They not only manage to sound, but look virtually identical".|$|E
500|$|The magician Henry Evans {{suggested}} the accordion feat was Home playing a <b>musical</b> <b>box,</b> {{attached to his}} leg. Skeptic Joseph McCabe wrote that Home may have placed a <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> in his pocket or on the floor. According to McCabe [...] "the opening and shutting of the accordion could be done by hooks, or loops of black silk. So with the crowning miracle, when Home withdrew his hand, and the accordion was seen suspended in the air, moving about in the cage (under the dark table). It was probably hooked on to the table." [...] The 19th-century British medium Francis Ward Monck was caught using a music box in his séances that he had hidden in his trousers. The fraudulent medium Henry Slade also played an accordion while held with one hand under a table.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{movie of}} the game was {{produced}} before the corresponding track [...] "Dark Dawn" [...] was, and Mitsuda had to rearrange his composition after realizing some parts were out of synch with the frames by about {{a minute and a}} half. The choral track, titled [...] "The Beginning and the End", was performed by a 41-voice choir named The Great Voices of Bulgaria and features lyrics written by Tetsuya Takahashi. His lyrics were translated from Japanese to English then to Bulgarian for the recording. Joanne Hogg sang in English on [...] "Stars of Tears" [...] and [...] "Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~". The latter took Mitsuda [...] "an awfully long amount of time" [...] just to compose the demo version. Masato Kato wrote the original lyrics for the two songs, and Hogg arranged them so that they would fit the melodies better and sound more Celtic. As with most of his previous soundtracks, Mitsuda composed a <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> arrangement of one of the main themes; in Xenogears case, the track [...] "Distant Promise" [...] is the <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> version of [...] "Small Two of Pieces".|$|E

The performance of the song featured a navy theme. The track was also on the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–02), where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> on the stage as a ballerina, to perform the song in a medley with [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and [...] "Sometimes", right after the performance of [...] "Overprotected". Spears also performed the song on several television appearances, including at the Top of the Pops Germany in 2000, and at The Today Show.

[...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] has been performed by Spears on four tours. On her first big tour, ...Baby One More Time Tour, she sang the song seated on a staircase, while on her second tour, Crazy 2k Tour, the performance of the song included a full dance segment. On 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, Spears performed [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] wearing pajamas and slippers, with a dance segment near the end. [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] was performed for the last time on Dream Within a Dream Tour, where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> on the stage as a ballerina, to perform the song in a medley with [...] "Lucky" [...] and [...] "Sometimes", right after the performance of [...] "Overprotected". Spears also performed [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] on Disney Channel in Concert in 1999. The performances were recorded and included on Spears' first home video release, Time Out with Britney Spears.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a woman dressed in an 18th-century white nightgown who talked to the {{audience}} briefly before disappearing. There was a video introduction in which different people told their dreams. At {{the end of the}} video, Spears appeared sleeping in a bubble. A platform with a wheel attached rose several feet above the ground, and she appeared strapped to it while wearing a black ensemble. She started rotating in a similar way to a target girl while starting to perform [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] with her dancers. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was performed next with Spears captured by her dancers. She left the stage for a costume change while her dancers performed. [...] "Overprotected" [...] was performed next with Spears (dressed in a futuristic version of one of Elvis Presley's jumpsuit) surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her hair growing as the song went along. In the next section, a giant <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> was raised, and Spears emerged from the middle as a ballerina to perform [...] "Born To Make You Happy". She tore off her tutu and put on a long white satin cote to perform [...] "Lucky" [...] while confetti was shot. The medley ended with a performance of [...] "Sometimes" [...] for which she donned a bathrobe.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it was a thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a <b>musical</b> <b>box,</b> echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E

2500|$|Wentzel {{was often}} {{asked how he}} managed to put his {{subjects}} at such ease while photographing them. [...] He observed that he read as many ethnographic studies of a region as possible, to avoid making culturally insensitive errors. He also tried {{to pick up a}} few words of the local language, and be as courteous as possible. He said that he often made friends with the people he was photographing. [...] "After we got to be friends, I would just back up and take the picture. That was a good part of my technique," [...] he said. He also brought a small <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> along with him, which helped to ease suspicion and win friends (especially among children). His choice of equipment also influenced his style. Wentzel told an interviewer in 1999 that, while in Africa, he used only lightweight 35 mm film cameras such as a Nikon or an Olympus OM-2. For more formal portraits, however, he used an 85mm portrait lens and Kodachrome film. When printing his photographs, he preferred the Ilfochrome process (which turned photographic slides into prints) and the gelatin silver print process.|$|E

2500|$|Never Say Never {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic gave the album {{four out of}} five stars and noted it a [...] "better, more adventurous record than her debut," [...] adding: [...] "Brandy wisely decides to find a middle ground between Mariah Carey and Mary J. Blige — it's adult contemporary with a slight streetwise edge. [...] delivery has improved and her subdued vocals can make mediocre material sound convincing. Still, what makes Never Say Never a winning record is the quality songs and production." [...] Daryl Easlea from BBC Music felt that the collection of smooth, mid-paced jams provided a snapshot of commercial R from the era. He described Never Say Never [...] "as the epitome of a mixed bag. However, given that a lot of R in the late 90s sounds like an ornate <b>musical</b> <b>box</b> revolving, the album is an intelligent brew that deviates sufficiently from that template and plays to Brandy and executive producer Rodney Jerkins's considerable strengths." [...] The Spokesman-Review critic Richard Harrington was positive with the album, writing: [...] "Brandy is co-writer on six of the album's 14 songs and no matter their achievement lyrically, she finds herself grown-up and confident, without taking any false steps." ...|$|E

50|$|In the 14th century, Flanders {{introduced}} a mechanical bell-ringer {{controlled by a}} rotating cylinder. Similar designs appeared in barrel organs (15th century), musical clocks (1598), barrel pianos (1805), and <b>musical</b> <b>boxes</b> (ca.1800). A music box is an automatic musical instrument that produces sounds {{by the use of}} a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or lamellae) of a steel comb. They were developed from <b>musical</b> snuff <b>boxes</b> of the 18th century and called carillons à musique. Some of the more complex boxes also have a tiny drum and/or bells, in addition to the metal comb.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{automatic}} musical devices {{can be traced}} back many centuries, and the use of pinned barrels to operate percussion mechanisms (such as striking bells in a clock) was perfected long before the invention of the piano.

50|$|Musical boxes: Several {{manufacturers}} introduced <b>musical</b> <b>boxes</b> that utilised interchangeable steel disks {{that carried}} the tune. The principal players were Polyphon, Symphonion (in Europe) and Regina (in the United States). Each manufacturer used its own unique set of disc sizes (which varied depending on the exact model purchased). This assured that once the purchaser had bought his music box, he had to buy the music discs from the same manufacturer.|$|R
