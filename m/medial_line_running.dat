50|$|It {{is similar}} to Marumba dyras and Marumba sperchius, but the body and wings are a deeper tint {{and there is no}} {{distinct}} <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> <b>running</b> over the length of the body. The lines on distal half of the forewing upperside are indistinct and the two spots near the tornus are minute. The hindwing upperside spots are also small.|$|E
50|$|Wingspan {{is about}} 22m. White moth with fuscous palpi. Fore wings irrorated {{with a few}} black scales and with two minute cell-specks. There are traces of a <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> angled below the costa. The postmedial <b>line</b> <b>running</b> out to two angles below costa and one on vein 3. A rufous brown band found beyond it with waved outer edge and {{terminating}} in a black patch. Traces of a pale submarginal rufous line. Hind wings with slightly waved antemedial line. Black cell-speck present. Postmedial slightly sinous line, with pale rufous band beyond it. A crenualte marginal line.|$|R
50|$|The {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} by the following characters: a black broad subbasal line is present on the forewing, the forewing <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> is broad at the anterior half and very narrow and dot-like at posterior half. The outer margin of the forewing <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> forms an almost right angle below M3.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are cinnamon buff with whitish basal and antemedial fascia and slightly darker <b>medial</b> and postmedial <b>lines.</b> The {{base of the}} hindwings is silvery white, crossed by an antemedial cinnamon buff shade from the cell to the inner margin. This shade is connected with the <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> by a similar narrow shade. The <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> is edged with white distally and the space beyond it is cinnamon buff.|$|R
50|$|The {{species name}} {{is derived from}} the toothed antemedial and <b>medial</b> <b>lines</b> on the forewing.|$|R
50|$|Kouphichnium is an ichnogenus {{that has}} been {{attributed}} to limulids (horseshoe crabs). Kouphichnium fossils resemble the footprints of birds, sometimes in conjunction with a <b>medial</b> <b>line,</b> and were initially thought to be bird or pterosaur tracks. The footprints are now believed to be the imprints of specialized limulid appendages, called pushers, terminating in four plates, used to push against the sediment. The <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> is left by the animal's telson.|$|R
50|$|The thorax has a grey <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> which widens posteriorly and is {{continued}} {{onto the}} abdomen as two widely separated {{but not very}} distinct bands. Each of these is bordered dorsally {{by a series of}} dots (that are sometimes interconnected) and a distinct brown <b>medial</b> <b>line.</b> The tegula is olive green with a golden-yellow <b>medial</b> <b>line.</b> The forewing upperside ground colour is buff with olive green bands and lines. The first to third postmedian lines start distinct but disappear later. The first line is heavier than lines two and three, but the fourth is the strongest. This line runs almost straight from the inner margin to the apex. The fifth postmedian line is diffuse and runs parallel to the fourth. The hindwing upperside is basally black. The median band is broad, pinkish-orange and the basal and distal edges are even.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. Adults are dark purplish grey, the wings irrorated with bright scales. There is a nearly straight <b>medial</b> rufous <b>line</b> and curved postmedial line. The hindwings have a nearly straight <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> and obliquely curved postmedial line. Both wings have a pure white cilia, {{with a dark}} line at base.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 50 mm. The forewings are white, irrorated with ferruginous scales and a ferruginous <b>medial</b> <b>line.</b> The hindwings have hardly any ferruginous tinge.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 36 mm. The forewings have the subbasal line broken up into two spots. There is a pale discocellular lunule and the <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> is angled outwards above the inner margin, {{so that it}} approaches or joins the oblique line and also gives off a fascia to join the antemedial line. There is a brown fascia connecting the submarginal with the marginal band above the middle. The submarginal band on the hindwings sends a spur inwards along vein 2 towards the <b>medial</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 12 mm. The forewings are silvery white with a scarlet <b>medial</b> <b>line</b> from below the costa {{to the inner}} margin. The hindwings are silvery white.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} heavy {{rail lines}} include the Blue Line, {{which is a}} former trolley <b>line</b> <b>running</b> from Revere to downtown Boston; the Orange Line, which was converted from an elevated <b>line</b> <b>running</b> from Roxbury to Malden; and the Red <b>Line,</b> <b>running</b> from Cambridge to both Ashmont or Braintree.|$|R

2500|$|Nine {{additional}} hatchings, {{published by}} Marcus Vulson de la Colombi√®re in 1639, {{were intended to}} represent other colours, although none of them correspond with regular heraldic tinctures, and {{they have never been}} used in British armory.

50|$|Running {{across the}} outside of the {{occipital}} bone are three curved lines and one <b>line</b> (the <b>medial</b> <b>line)</b> that runs down to the foramen magnum.

The inferior nuchal line runs across the mid-point of the <b>medial</b> nuchal <b>line.</b> The area above the highest nuchal line is termed the occipital plane and the area below this line is termed the nuchal plane.|$|R

25|$|The first <b>line,</b> <b>running</b> from {{downtown}} Salt Lake City south to Sandy, {{was completed in}} 1999. The second line {{from downtown}} to the University of Utah was completed in 2001 and extended in 2003. An extension to the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub was completed in April 2008. In August 2011, two extensions to South Jordan and West Valley City were completed. With the opening of these two extensions in 2011, the TRAX lines were renamed as colors instead of destinations, with the Blue <b>Line</b> <b>running</b> from the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub to Sandy, the Red <b>Line</b> <b>running</b> from the University of Utah Medical Center to the Daybreak community in South Jordan, and the Green <b>Line</b> <b>running</b> from the intermodal hub to the West Valley Intermodal Hub.|$|R
