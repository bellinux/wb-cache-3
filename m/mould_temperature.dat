40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> and holding {{pressure}} {{on the structure of}} neat and beta-nucleated isotactic polypropylenes. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene was modified with a beta-specific nucleator based on N,N'-dicyclohexylnaphthalene- 2, 6 -dicarboxamide in the concentration of 0. 03 wt. %. From both the original material (alpha-iPP) and the beta-nucleated material (beta-iPP), dog bone-shaped test specimens were injection-moulded, using two sets of processing parameters. In the T-set the <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied within the range of 40 - 120 degrees C in 10 degrees C steps, while in the beta-set the holding pressure was changed from 5 to 13 MPa in 1 MPa steps. Other processing parameters were kept on the same level. Polarized-light microscopy showed a strong effect of <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> on the morphology of alpha-iPP specimens; the skin thinned out and the spherulite size increased with <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> rise. On the other hand, in the case of alpha-iPP only the skin thickness was correspondingly affected, while the spherulite size remained virtually constant, independent of the <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> changes. At the same structure level, both alpha-iPP and beta-iPP specimens were insensitive to holding pressure variations. Polymorphic composition derived from wide-angle X-ray scattering displayed similar range of changes induced by variations of the processing parameters for both materials. The increase of <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> positively influenced the crystallinity and the P-form content, particularly in the skin of specimens. On the contrary, higher holding pressure depressed the crystallinity proportionally within the bulk of specimens. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this study,two selected PU foam and fabric materials typically used for bra cup moulding were examined.

The results reveal that cup heights are greatly affected by the use of foam and/or fabric-foam laminated materials.

The sugar cane pulp has been previously alkalinised, dried, and milled and the particles had been classified in a range of grain sizes. Experimental assays were performed, varying the proportion of the resin and the reinforcement and the size of the cane pulp fibre, keeping the pressure and <b>moulding</b> <b>temperature</b> constant. These composites were characterised according to physical and chemical properties, through test bodies produced in moulds according to ASTM standards. The experiments performed showed that the use of sugar cane pulp as reinforcement in polymeric composites represents an option for reducing costs in industrial applications, thus suggesting a significant industrial applicability of the product...|$|R
