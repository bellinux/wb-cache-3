The director and actors had 2 shifts (12 hours per shift). The Day shift is from {{seven in the morning}} till seven in the evening. The Night shift is from seven in the evening work till seven in the morning and many actors didn't really sleep for <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> weeks.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} many {{alternate}} versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would {{hit a home run}} for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would [...] "try to knock you another homer, <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> today". Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth's three home runs had actually saved the boy's life, as claimed by the newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Esch {{returned}} for the Symbols album, which {{was released in}} 1997 and featured Abby Travis and Skinny Puppy's Nivek Ogre. Symbols reached No.137 on the Billboard 200. Its first track, [...] "Megalomaniac", was featured in the film , {{and was the first}} song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay. [...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story of what went wrong. There were <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars. That was something I was not going to do again." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1973, Sellers and Milligan {{were among}} the comedians who formed part of Harrison's social circle at his Friar Park estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. This period coincided {{with the end of}} his {{marriage}} to Pattie Boyd, who has described their home as [...] "a madhouse" [...] during their final year together. Harrison became reacquainted with Smith through longtime Beatles aide Terry Doran. Harrison admired Smith as [...] "a wonderfully eccentric person", a quality that had similarly inspired him about Sir Frank Crisp, the original owner of Friar Park. Author Dale Allison suggests that Smith became a court jester figure for Harrison, who wrote the song [...] "His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)" [...] as a tribute to Smith. In his autobiography, Harrison terms the composition [...] "a piece of personal indulgence, like some other of my songs about things nobody else knows or cares about, except <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> people".|$|E
500|$|Power was {{recorded}} in Los Angeles at DJ Evil E's home, which was known as Syndicate Studios West. Ice-T described how Syndicate Studios West was set up with a board connected to speakers to resemble a car stereo system so they could test how tapes would sound. A closet in the home was converted into a booth to record the vocals. Afrika Islam noted that recording at his home meant the group had no time constraints while recording the album. Ice-T stated that recording {{it did not take}} a long time saying: [...] "The recording was fast" [...] and that he recorded every record he's made in [...] "a matter of a month, <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> at the most". Power was mixed at Entourage Studios in Los Angeles by Mark Wolfson. Some tracks feature guest vocalists, such as Donald D and Hen-Gee on [...] "The Syndicate". Donald D was a DJing partner of Afrika Islam in the 1970s while Hen-Gee is DJ Evil-E's brother. The vocals on [...] "I'm Your Pusher" [...] are credited to Pimpin' Rex, who Ice-T mentioned was [...] "one of my buddies, a real live pimp".|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} the go-ahead {{to work on}} the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named [...] "Superduperman"; Moore said, [...] "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take [...] "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm"; the writer said his intention was to create [...] "a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density". The writer came up with the character names and descriptions, but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather [...] "did it at odd times [...] spend <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> or three weeks just doing sketches." [...] Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because [...] "you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{thing that}} made the {{decision}} easy was {{that if we were}} to ship the game anyway and try to fix the problem later, some people were gonna get screwed. And that was wrong. It might not have been very many people - <b>maybe</b> one or <b>two.</b> But it would have bothered us the rest of our lives. Maybe not - <b>maybe</b> just <b>two</b> years. We'd be sitting around today: [...] "Damn, wonder when the next person's gonna call?" [...] It was so clear that there was one decision that led down the road of eternal damnation. The other was {{to spend a lot of}} money and do the right thing - and never make the same mistake again.|$|R

500|$|Still needing {{only one}} victory to clinch the division, the Buccaneers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in O.J. Simpson's final home game. It was {{the second year in}} a row that the Buccaneers lost to a 49ers team that entered the game with a 1–13 record. The 49ers scored first, as Jeris White slipped while {{covering}} receiver Mike Shumann, leaving Shumann open for a 19-yard touchdown reception. The offense's single touchdown, a 19-yard pass from Doug Williams to Jimmie Giles, was a season low, while injuries to Mike Washington and Cedric Brown left the Buccaneers' secondary vulnerable. Mike Rae again saw duty at quarterback in the fourth quarter, with the game out of hand. Williams, who tearfully accepted blame for the loss, threw five interceptions that left McKay considering either benching him or avoiding pass plays. McKay also criticized the offensive line's blocking, saying that he [...] "saw (Ricky) Bell make some long runs, <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> or three inches". Under pressure of needing to win one game, the Buccaneers' tension ("state of shock", according to McKay) was noticeable to 49ers players. The loss dropped the Buccaneers into a 1st-place tie with the surging Chicago Bears in the NFC Central.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz three days after another script idea fell through. [...] Spotnitz noted that [...] "Darin Morgan had left the show but was going to {{contribute}} an episode. And we realized at the eleventh hour that it wasn't going to happen, and we were stuck with nothing. John, Vince and I broke that story in <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> days. We split up the acts, wrote it in probably another two days, and gave the crew something to prep before Christmas break. That was the worst ever." [...] Carter ended up rewriting the script over the holiday. The initial cut ended up being too long, resulting in a scene introducing Scully's older brother Bill Scully, played by Pat Skipper, being removed. The character, still played by Skipper, would eventually make his first appearance in the fourth-season finale [...] "Gethsemane". The scene which would have established the character was intended to echo a similar scene in the second season episode [...] "One Breath", which featured Don S. Davis as Scully's father. Both scenes featured the actors standing over a supine Scully, wearing white United States Navy dress uniforms. Also deleted from the episode was a kiss between Mulder and Scully, {{which would have been}} the first in the series' run. This was an ad-lib on Anderson and Duchovny's part, and was removed from the episode as it was something Chris Carter felt he wanted to make use of in the series' film adaptation. Such a kiss was eventually deferred to season six's [...] "Triangle".|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, we usually told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he did. So much of that is his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, <b>maybe</b> <b>two,</b> where we said 'We'd like you to keep closer to the programmed drums,' but he had a lot of say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the six-week {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Laid at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, in early 1993, the band performed jam sessions at their Manchester rehearsal room {{in order to}} form songs.

[...] For {{the first few years of}} the band's career, [...] "from three hours of cacophony would come <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> minutes of semi-coherence," [...] which would ultimately [...] "be the seed of which [...] would attempt to repeat and refine and eventually reveal to the public."

Lewis would later talk of the album's delay and Smith's involvement, describing the original release dates as rough guides. Following Lewis' performance at BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Smith revealed that the album was 80% complete, [...] "We've got the key tracks and we're very close." [...] Describing the process as {{a stark contrast to}} previous albums Spirit and Echo, Smith said that when you work with many producers [...] "you end up with <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> or three radio songs and not necessarily the album sales you want."

Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums cause her to [...] "run overtime", leaving little time to plan for other such projects. She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Nicky Ryan said Enya received an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform a single concert in Japan. In 2016, Enya spoke {{about the prospect of}} a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after And Winter Came...

2500|$|Monk had {{disappeared}} from the scene by the mid-1970s and made {{only a small number}} of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: [...] "On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> words. He didn't say 'Good morning,' 'Goodnight,' 'What time?' Nothing. Why, I don't know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn't communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly." [...] A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: [...] "Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles : he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to understand that if, by chance, you ask him something, he'll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you." [...] Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.|$|E
