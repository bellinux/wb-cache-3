25|$|On 16 October 1942 Primrose Hill sailed from Glasgow a <b>mixed</b> <b>cargo</b> {{including}} 3,000 tons of coal, 1,796 tons {{of general}} cargo, war material and 11 aircraft. She {{was as a}} member of convoy ON-139 for Takoradi on the Gold Coast and Apapa in Nigeria. The convoy dispersed, and at 2118 hrs on 29 October she was northwest of the Cape Verde Islands when UD-5, a submarine that the Kriegsmarine had captured from the Dutch Navy after the surrender of the Netherlands, fired two torpedoes at her. One missed but the other hit Primrose Hill in her engine room killing the second engineer, a greaser and a fireman, and setting the fuel oil in her bunkers on fire. Two of her lifeboats and a number of liferafts were destroyed by the concussion of the blast.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1960, Francisco Morazan began {{what was}} to be her last voyage from Miami, Florida. She sailed to Montreal and Toronto, where she {{unloaded}} a cargo of phosphates. Francisco Morazan then sailed to Chicago, arriving there in mid-November. At Chicago, 1,118 tons, 10 cwt of <b>mixed</b> <b>cargo</b> was loaded, destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. The cargo included aluminium, baled hair, bottle caps, canned chicken, castings, chemicals, Gilsonite, hides, lard, machinery, phosphate, scrap metal, solder dross, tinplate, and toys. Francisco Morazan departed Chicago on 28 November. Fog on Lake Michigan slowed her progress and a problem with the feed pump for the boiler required the ship to be stopped while the pump was repaired. This meant Francisco Morazan was now in a race to leave the Great Lakes before the system closed to navigation on 3 December.|$|E

6000|$|H.B.M.S. Tempest, which arrived {{yesterday}} at this port, brings [...] Captain Trent and four {{men of the}} British brig Flying Scud, cast [...] away February 12th on Midway Island, and most providentially rescued [...] the next day. The Flying Scud was of 200 tons burthen, owned in [...] London, and has been out nearly two years tramping. Captain Trent [...] left Hong Kong December 8th, bound for this port in rice and a small [...] <b>mixed</b> <b>cargo</b> of silks, teas, and China notions, the whole valued at [...] $10,000, fully covered by insurance. The log shows plenty of fine [...] weather, with light airs, calms, and squalls. In lat. 28 N., long. [...] 177 W., his water going rotten, and misled by Hoyt's [...] "North Pacific [...] Directory," [...] which informed him there was a coaling station on the [...] island, Captain Trent put in to Midway Island. He found it a literal [...] sandbank, surrounded by a coral reef, mostly submerged. Birds were [...] very plenty, there was good fish in the lagoon, but no firewood; and [...] the water, which could be obtained by digging, brackish. He found [...] good holding-ground off {{the north end of}} the larger bank in fifteen [...] fathoms water; bottom sandy, with coral patches. Here he was detained [...] seven days by a calm, the crew suffering severely from the water, [...] which was gone quite bad; and it was only on the evening of the 12th [...] that a little wind sprang up, coming puffy out of N.N.E. Late as it [...] was, Captain Trent immediately weighed anchor and attempted to get [...] out. While the vessel was beating up to the passage, the wind took a [...] sudden lull, and then veered squally into N., and even N.N.W., [...] driving the brig ashore on the sand at about twenty minutes before [...] six o'clock. John Wallen, a native of Finland, and Charles Holdorsen, [...] a native of Sweden, were drowned alongside, in attempting to lower a [...] boat, neither being able to swim, the squall very dark, and the noise [...] of the breakers drowning everything. At the same time John Brown, [...] another of the crew, had his arm broken by the falls. Captain Trent [...] further informed the Occidental reporter that the brig struck [...] heavily at first bows on, he supposes upon coral; that she then drove [...] over the obstacle, and now lies in sand, much down by the head, and [...] with a list to starboard. In the first collision she must have [...] sustained some damage, as she was making water forward. The rice will [...] probably be all destroyed: but the more valuable part of the cargo is [...] fortunately in the afterhold. Captain Trent was preparing his [...] long-boat for sea, when the providential arrival of the Tempest, [...] pursuant to Admiralty orders to call at islands in her course for [...] castaways, saved the gallant captain from all further danger. It is [...] scarcely necessary to add that both the officers and men of the [...] unfortunate vessel speak in high terms of the kindness they received [...] on board the man-of-war. We print a list of the survivors: Jacob [...] Trent, master, of Hull, England; Elias Goddedaal, mate, native of [...] Christiansand, Sweden; Ah Wing, cook, native of Sana, China; John [...] Brown, native of Glasgow, Scotland; John Hardy, native of London, [...] England. The Flying Scud is ten years old, and this morning will be [...] sold as she stands, by order of Lloyd's agent, at public auction, for [...] the benefit of the underwriters. The auction will take place in the [...] Merchants' Exchange at ten o'clock.|$|E

50|$|William Salthouse was a 251-tonne barque {{designed}} and built for trade by Salthouse and Co. of Liverpool, a prominent merchant, in 1824. It served as a trading vessel delivering <b>mixed</b> <b>cargoes</b> from Britain to its colonies in the West Indies and India for 17 years before being sold to Green and Co. of Liverpool. Green and Co. {{were aware of the}} colony at Melbourne's struggle to establish itself as self-sustaining and recognized it as a potentially profitable investment for trade. The economical incentives are most likely what prompted William Salthouses change of trade destination to Montreal and onto Port Phillip. On 27 March 1841 William Salthouse departed London en route to Montreal, where it arrived safely on 26 May 1841. After clearing Montreal customs on 17 June 1841, the vessel set sail on open water for Melbourne by mid-July loaded with mainly flour and salted provisions, but also carrying whiskey, wine, cider, vinegar, and nails.|$|R
5000|$|Tankers {{were first}} {{used by the}} oil {{industry}} to transfer refined fuel in bulk from refineries to customers. This would then be stored in large tanks ashore, and subdivided for delivery to individual locations. The use of tankers caught on because other liquids were also cheaper to transport in bulk, store in dedicated terminals, then subdivide. Even the Guinness brewery used tankers to transport the stout across the Irish Sea.Different products require different handling and transport, with specialised variants such as [...] "chemical tankers", [...] "oil tankers", and [...] "LNG carriers" [...] developed to handle dangerous chemicals, oil and oil-derived products, and liquefied natural gas respectively. These broad variants may be further differentiated with respect to ability to carry only a single product or simultaneously transport <b>mixed</b> <b>cargoes</b> such as several different chemicals or refined petroleum products. Among oil tankers, supertankers are designed for transporting oil around the Horn of Africa from the Middle East. The supertanker Seawise Giant, scrapped in 2010, was 458 m in length and 69 m wide. Supertankers {{are one of the}} three preferred methods for transporting large quantities of oil, along with pipeline transport and rail.|$|R
