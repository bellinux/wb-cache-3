40|$|This paper {{provides}} a chronological {{account of the}} evolution of the concept and policy of reproductive health and its initial entry, and subsequent exclusion, from UN declarations. In the 1990 s effective lobbying by sexual and reproductive rights activists established reproductive health for all as a UN goal. However, at the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Assembly</b> of 2000 and in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an ‘unholy alliance’ of the Holy See and a handful of conservative Muslim governments managed to keep reproductive health off the agenda. This was successful political manoeuvring for the short-term, but the alliance fell apart {{and the power of the}} theoretical and empirical case in support of reproductive health saw it return to the MDGs in 2005. The moral standing of religious institutions, such as the Holy See, is undermined by such opportunistic, short-term political behaviour and, in particular, the ambiguous legal status of the Holy See at the UN is called into question. ...|$|E

40|$|Malaria {{currently}} kills up to 3 {{million people}} per year worldwide, {{most of them}} children in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet the disease is utterly treatable and highly preventable. Now, {{the international community has}} vowed as part of its Millennium Development Goals to make appropriate investments and interventions to bring this scourge under control. These goals, adopted by world leaders at the United Nations <b>Millennium</b> <b>Assembly</b> in September 2000, represent a commitment to reducing extreme poverty and diseases such as malaria sharply by 2015. Among other objectives, the eight development goals call for reducing by half the rates of extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 and reducing childhood mortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three fourths relative to their 1990 levels. The goals also target the control of the great pandemic diseases — human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In 2002, the high-income countries, including the United States, made a commitment to substantially increasing their aid to poor countries in order to meet these ambitious but achievable targets, though the actual flow of aid has not yet increased markedly...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyIncluye CD-ROM con anexo estadísticoThis {{report is}} {{the outcome of}} a joint effort by the {{specialized}} agencies of the United Nations system in Latin America and the Caribbean that began in 2005 with the regional report entitled "The Millennium Development Goals: A Latin American and Caribbean Perspective (United Nations, 2005). All the agencies participated in its preparation, in particular UNIFEM, PAHO, UNFPA and ECLAC, the lastmentioned as coordinating agency. On the basis of the most recent data available at the time of preparation, the report focuses attention on the progress made in meeting Goal 3, (Promote gender equality and empower women), emphasizing its link with target 1 of Goal 1 (Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day). In view of the dual aspect of Women's empowerment —as an end in itself and as a necessary pre-condition for the fulfilment of the other Goals— the report examines the changes in the official indicators, together with a set of complementary and additional indicators for the region that serve to illustrate more fully the genderbased inequalities and forms of discrimination prevailing in various spheres. The report identifies and discusses four critical challenges that must be faced in order to progress towards full compliance with Goal 3 : achieving gender parity in access to decision-making, acknowledging unwaged work, eliminating violence against women and enabling women to exercise their reproductive rights. The first chapter analyses the importance of the Millennium Development Goals in achieving gender equality, underlining the progress made and main challenges identified since 2005, the date of the most recent regional report on the Goals. In addition, the report maintains that these Goals should be seen as being integrated with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the outcomes of the world summit meetings of the 1990 s, which culminated in the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Assembly.</b> In a discussion comparing advances and indicators in respect of target 1 of the first Goal and of Goal 3, special attention is given to the link between poverty and the empowerment of women, and the relationship of both with time use, the exercise of reproductive rights, the elimination of violence and the achievement of democratic parity. The report also reviews recent progress on the basis of data from official indicators and other indicators available for most countries with regard to Goals 1 and 3. This report also reviews the current data and stresses the need to make better use of available sources, since the existing information appears to be underutilized. At the same time, the report stresses the importance of improving the collection, processing and analysis of data at the national level, and it recommends that gender statistics be integrated into statistical analyses. Since an available supply of data is an essential policy-making tool, the report especially advocates conducting time-use surveys and keeping an adequate record of the political participation of women, the exercise of reproductive rights and the impact of gender-based violence. Chapter II of the report examines four aspects of the autonomy and empowerment of women that represent major challenges for the achievement of greater progress on gender equality. The first is Women's unpaid work {{in the light of the}} data available since the early 1990 s, with an emphasis on the importance of the work of health-related care work —nearly always done by women— and the public policies that affect how women integrate their public and private lives. The authors present a more precise picture of the main factors limiting Women's economic autonomy and of the interrelationship between gender equality and poverty. In particular, this section stresses the importance of Women's economic autonomy in fulfilling Goal 1. The second aspect is the participation of women in national parliaments and in executive positions in national and local (municipal) governments. An analysis is presented of the empowerment of women in the public sphere. Thirdly, the report discusses the exercise of reproductive rights and access to reproductive health. Lastly, the authors demonstrate the importance of combating gender-based violence in order to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals in the region. The conclusions summarize the progress that has been made and offer a proposal for some general policy guidelines with a view to the achievement of the Goals...|$|E

The mandate of UN-Habitat is further derived from other internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations <b>Millennium</b> Declaration (<b>Assembly</b> resolution55/2), in particular the target on achieving a significant improvement {{in the lives of}} at least 100 million slum-dwellers by the year 2020; and the target on water and sanitation of the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which seeks to halve, by the year 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Through Assembly resolution 65/1, Member States committed themselves to continue working towards cities without slums, beyond current targets, by reducing slum populations and improving the lives of slum-dwellers.|$|R
40|$|INDUSTRIAL nations {{making up}} the G 8 group met in Okinawa in July 2000 and {{included}} on their agenda the issue of information technology for countries {{that appear to be}} substantially lagging behind in the Information Society. Appearing during the closing months of 2000 was the Okinawa Charter, which lays out some general paths for the G 8 nations to follow in alleviating the digital divide. Also in Tokyo, the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) held a summit on the information society and issued the Tokyo Declaration. In the Declaration, it mentions that member countries will do their best, in both domestic efforts and through international co-operation, to enable people in the Asia-Pacific region to have access to the Internet by the year 2005 to the greatest extent possible, including access from public facilities such as schools and post offices. There were other international and regional confer-ences, such as the UN <b>Millennium</b> General <b>Assembly</b> and ASEAN, which also laid the paths for bridging digital divide issues. Digital divide issues are about differential access to information and communication tech-nologies. Today, that usually means computers and the Internet. The divide is reflected in some recent ICT data from the UNDPs Agenda 21 : 276 million people worldwide are using the Internet; 200, 000 devices (computers) are being added each day to the Internet; 1. 5 billion web pages have been created; 2 million web pages are being added each day; However, 95 % of the worlds population is not participating in this activity...|$|R
40|$|On 8 September 2000, to {{mark the}} new <b>millennium,</b> the General <b>Assembly</b> of the United Nations adopted a set of {{fundamental}} values such as freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility known as sustainable development value. These sustainable development values are translated into several key objectives such as 60 millennium development goals regarding peace, development and environment, human rights, the vulnerable, hungry, poor and Africa which are set to be achieved with a deadline of 2015. Although these values have been declared 10 years ago, these values are relatively new to developing country perspective. Therefore, the average citizens of the developing countries are not {{fully aware of the}} notion of sustainable development value. Furthermore, the notion of sustainable development values greatly varies from country to country, culture to culture. Indeed, there are differences in perceiving these values from developed country and developing country perspective as well. So, there are two questions need to be answered: how to define SDV from the developing country perspective? And what are the relevant dimensions of sustainable development value that suit developing country perspective? This paper attempts to answer this research question. This paper utilized the qualitative methodology to gain in-depth understanding of the issue. 16 -in depth interviews were conducted in this regard. The interviews were then transcribed and analysed to understand the best ways to define sustainable development value from the developing country perspective. It is expected that developing countries, academicians and top countries leader will be benefiting from this research...|$|R
