40|$|Oats are {{a uniquely}} nutritious food as they contain an {{excellent}} lipid profile and high amounts of soluble fibre. However, an oat kernel is largely non-digestible and thus must be utilised in <b>milled</b> <b>form</b> to reap its nutritional benefits. Milling {{is made up}} of numerous steps, the most important being dehulling to expose the digestible groat, heat processing to inactivate enzymes that cause rancidity, and cutting, rolling or grinding to convert the groat into a product that can be used directly in oatmeal or {{can be used as a}} food ingredient in products such as bread, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and snack bars. Oats can also be processed into oat bran and fibre to obtain high-fibrecontaining fractions that can be used in a variety of food products...|$|E
30|$|In rice plants, the metals such as iron, zinc, {{magnesium}} etc. are translocated to {{the reproductive}} organs via xylem and phloem through {{different types of}} transporters viz. ZIP, IRT, YSL etc. During seed development and maturation an elevated amount of Fe, Zn etc. are transported {{in the form of}} Nicotianamine acid or Mugineic Acid chelated complex (Paul et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2009). However, the accumulation of calcium in the developing seeds is nearly constant, as it is considered to move preferentially in xylem and is generally immobile in phloem which may be related to its symplastic nature (Iwai et al. 2012). Although sufficient amount of metals (Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg etc.) are translocated into the rice seeds, still in its <b>milled</b> <b>form</b> (that is consumed) rice contain very low amount of iron (Lucca et al. 2001). This is attributed to {{the fact that most of}} these divalent cations are chelated by phytic acid and accumulates in the aleurone layer and embryo (which is removed during commercial milling) as inclusions in protein storage vacuoles (globoids), which cannot move into the inner endosperm (Brinch-Pedersen et al. 2007; Raboy 2009; Iwai et al. 2012; Paul et al. 2013). Moreover, the iron molecules chelated by phytic acid is not bioavailable (Jin et al. 2009), probably due to lack of phytase enzyme in the non-ruminants (Hegeman et al. 2001). Therefore, it is assumed that lower level of phytic acid in the aleurone layer will allow more iron to be present in the endosperm which will thereby supply more available iron for absorption by humans.|$|E

40|$|The design {{theory and}} method of <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter for double-helix screw of {{progressing}} cavity pump are presented. Through analyzing {{the shape and}} characteristic parameters of double-helix screw, the helicoids equation and axial curve equation of double-helix screw were established. According to the relative position relations between <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter and double-helix screw in the machining process, the geometric mapping relationship of screw coordinate system and <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter coordinate system was established by using the coordinate transformation theory. Based on noninstantaneous envelope method and the meshing conditions between <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter and double-helix screw, the contact line equations were established by minimum value method. By analyzing the machining errors caused by resharpening the <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter, the tooth back curve equation was established based on spiral of Archimedes, and the profile equation of <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter with constant back angle was got. On this basis, the <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> cutter of processing double-helix screw was designed, and the cutter head and tool post were manufactured, respectively. The measuring results have shown that this method can satisfy the requirements of machining accuracy for double-helix screw.
