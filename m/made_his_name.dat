5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, stiff competition was present in the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{was born}} in Italy and was ennobled by the Kingdom of Sardinia but {{lived and worked in}} France, {{creating}} a number of prestigious works for the royalist French government in the 1830s. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> by creating equestrian statues; one, of the Duke of Wellington, was erected in Glasgow in 1840. By the 1840s, however, his popularity in continental Europe was in decline. The French Revolution of 1848, which saw the final overthrow of the French monarchy, prompted him to resettle in London and seek new patrons among the British elite.|$|E
5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It explored {{what is now called}} the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross Ice Shelf. On the expedition, Ross discovered the Transantarctic Mountains and the volcanoes Erebus and Terror, named after his ships. The young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> on the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Between 1967 and 1970, Bob Dylan {{recorded}} and released {{a series of}} albums that incorporated country rock elements. All were produced by Bob Johnston. During the sessions for the final of these, New Morning, Dylan decided {{that he did not}} want to continue working with Johnston. Al Kooper did uncredited production work to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> with Joe Cocker, to assist in finding a new sound. Russell suggested that Dylan come with him to Blue Rock Studios in New York City to record some new material.|$|E
5|$|Pathan <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh. Swinging {{the ball}} both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 {{including}} several LBW {{decisions in the}} First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. He played in {{only one of the}} three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the St Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son – which {{at the time of their}} original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.|$|E

5000|$|He {{began his}} acting {{career in the}} Yiddish Theater District in 1913 and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> Broadway debut in 1915. [...] In 1923 <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>named</b> debut as E. G. Robinson in the silent film, The Bright Shawl. He played a snarling gangster in the 1927 Broadway police/crime drama The Racket, which led to his being cast in similar film roles. One of many actors who saw his career {{flourish}} in the new sound film era rather than falter, he made only three films prior to 1930, but left his stage career that year and made 14 films between 1930-1932.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{made his}} {{professional}} debut with Monaco in 1994. Good form {{led to an}} international call-up in 1998, after which he signed for the Serie A defending champions Juventus. A year later he signed for Premier League club Arsenal for £11million. It was at Arsenal that Henry <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as a world-class player. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. He won two league titles and three FA Cups at the club. In 2003 and 2004 Henry was runner-up for the FIFA World Player of the Year. He was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the FWA Footballer of the Year three times. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final.|$|E
5|$|Neilson {{started his}} career {{alongside}} his brother, Tony, at first Hertford Town and then Ware, before he earned a move to Cambridge City. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> in non-league as a goal-scoring winger {{and he came to}} the attention of a number of league clubs. He had trials with three of them and eventually won a move to League Two side Bradford City. He scored a goal on his full debut but Bradford soon changed manager and Neilson dropped back into non-league, first out on loan to Cambridge United and then signed by Crawley Town, having spent less than 12months with Bradford. Neilson spent a short but successful loan spell with Grimsby Town in 2012, and then joined Luton on a short-term contract in January 2013 before his release a few months later. He returned to Grimsby permanently before joining Whitehawk.|$|E
5|$|The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's {{political}} {{reputation in}} the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the Afrikaner Bond; he resigned as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger's handling of the affair <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> a household word across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as Olive Schreiner and Frank Harris, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, field guns and howitzers, primarily from Germany and France.|$|E

25|$|The lack of top-class facilities, though, didn't {{diminish}} his hunger or ambition. Despite not {{breaking through}} to the national team earlier, Babar <b>made</b> sure <b>his</b> <b>name</b> {{was always in the}} reckoning by consistently being among the wickets.|$|R
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E

The reviews were disappointing and may have discouraged him from writing in Irish again, but Dúil continues to be printed.|$|E
