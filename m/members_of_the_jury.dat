25|$|Preliminary {{hearings}} {{in the prosecution}} of 59 men suspected of {{taking part in the}} attack began in October 2007, but the trial was then delayed {{for more than a year}} as court officials sought to find a team of jurors.

Shubik, who as chairman did not cast a vote, refused to publicly comment on the affair, but BAFTA Chairman Richard Price stated that the ballot papers passed on to him by Shubik had shown four votes for Prime Suspect and three for G.B.H.. Price claimed that the ballot papers could not be recounted as they had subsequently been destroyed. No blame was ever attached to Shubik by the four judges, and it was to her that they had initially turned to raise the apparent discrepancy with BAFTA.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Lays politely refused Napoleon's {{invitation}} {{to join him}} on his expedition to Egypt. Nevertheless, the pair remained on friendly terms and between 1801 and 1802, Lays – who had often performed in Josephine's salons – became chief singer of the Chapel Napoleon had established at the Tuileries under the directorship of Giovanni Paisiello. As such, three years later, on 2 December 1804, Lays was the lead soloist in the music accompanying Napoleon's coronation as emperor. The ensuing celebrations culminated at the Hôtel de Ville on 16 December with Lays and Chéron singing the cantata Trasibule, specially written for the occasion by Henri-Montan Berton. In 1810, when Napoleon divorced Josephine and entered into a second marriage with the Austrian Archduchess Marie Louise, Lays was the obvious choice to perform at the wedding ceremony. Meanwhile, his stage activity continued unabated, and in 1807 he was also appointed {{to serve on the}} Opéra jury in charge of evaluating new works to be staged. Other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> came and went, but Lays remained in office continuously until 1815.|$|E
25|$|The EBU reintroduced televoting as an {{obligatory}} voting mode in all participating countries, which awarded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 {{points to}} their ten favourite songs, in ascending order. Countries {{voted in the}} same order as they had performed. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Russia were granted an exception to holding a televote as they cited that their telecommunications penetration was less than 80%. Polish broadcaster Telewizja Polska opted to use only SMS-voting. In the televoting/smsvoting household shall not be permitted to vote more than three times. All other countries planned to use a televote. This contest was also the first to introduce a computer-generated scoreboard which rearranged itself in order as the points were awarded. Broadcasters were required to assemble back-up juries that consisted of eight voting members, with age and gender equally distributed, in the case of televote failure {{on the night of the}} competition.

500|$|White's {{sentence}} was reduced {{due in part}} to the so-called Twinkie defense, a judgment that provoked outrage in the community. The [...] "Twinkie" [...] defense was presented by a psychiatrist to the jury, stating that White had a diminished capacity due to depression. The copious amounts of junk food White consumed are cited as a symptom of his mental state. The jury heard a tape recording of White's confession, which consisted of highly emotional ranting about the pressure he was under, and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> wept in sympathy for the defendant.|$|E
500|$|Section 4 {{creates the}} defence of public good, which applies both to prosecutions for {{publication}} of obscene materials {{and to the}} forfeiture proceedings described in Section 3. This allows for a valid defence if the defendant can show that {{the publication of the}} materials was justifiable as for the [...] "public good", which is defined as [...] "in the interests of science, literature, art or learning, or of other objects of general concern". Experts and their testimony are admissible for determining the value of such publications. This section was initially treated very strictly by trial judges, but this attitude was reversed after the 1976 trial of the book Inside Linda Lovelace, where the jury found the publishers not guilty despite the judge saying that [...] "if this isn't obscene, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> you may think that nothing is obscene". Three years later the Williams Committee recommended that restrictions on written pornography be lifted, and these restrictions have been largely abandoned.|$|E

500|$|On June 8, 1865, John Keene and Harry Slater, {{two men who}} had an {{unresolved}} quarrel {{from their}} days in Salt Lake City, spotted each other in Sam Greer's saloon on Helena's Bridge Street. Keene shot Slater in the head, killing him instantly. [...] Keene surrendered himself to Helena sheriff George Wood and freely admitted his guilt in the shooting. [...] A two-day trial ensued where some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> were known vigilantes from Alder Gulch. Since there was no official trial judge, Stephan Reynolds, a respected member of the Helena community, presided. [...] At {{the end of the}} trial, the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict and Keene was hanged from the lone pine tree just outside town. [...] The large tree, one of few that remained in proximity to Helena because most had been cut down for lumber, became known as the [...] "Old Hangman's Tree". [...] Although Keene's trial and execution was not considered vigilantism, the Helena community, similar to the Alder Gulch community in 1863, felt the need to establish a more reliable means of law and order.|$|E
500|$|The seated jury for White's trial {{consisted}} of white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused {{from the jury}} pool. Some of the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> cried when they heard White's tearful recorded confession, {{at the end of}} which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty. White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that he was not responsible for his actions, using the legal defense known as diminished capacity: [...] "Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood." [...] Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White's [...] mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the Twinkie defense. White was acquitted of the first degree murder charge on May 21, 1979, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five. He cried when he heard the verdict.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E
