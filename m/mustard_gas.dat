5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} <b>mustard</b> <b>gas</b> from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of <b>mustard</b> <b>gas,</b> he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of reviewNew {{literature}} from 2009 to 2012 regarding occupational constrictive bronchiolitis challenges textbook descriptions of this disease, formerly {{thought to be}} limited to fixed airflow limitation arising in the wake of accidental overexposure to noxious chemicals. Indolent evolution of dyspnea without a recognized hazardous exposure is a more common presentation. Recent findingsBiopsy-confirmed case series of constrictive bronchiolitis from US soldiers, Iranian survivors of sulfur <b>mustard</b> <b>gassing,</b> hospital-based studies, and flavoring-related cases document that indolent constrictive bronchiolitis cases can have normal spirometry or either restrictive or obstructive abnormalities. High-resolution computerized tomography studies can be normal or reflect air-trapping and mosaic attenuation on expiratory films. Thus, in the absence of noninvasive abnormalities, the diagnosis in dyspneic patients may require thoracoscopic biopsy in settings in which exposure risk has not been recognized. Many workers with occupational constrictive bronchiolitis stabilize with cessation of exposures causing bronchiolar epithelial necrosis. SummaryClinicians need a high index of suspicion for constrictive bronchiolitis in young patients with rapidly progressing exertional dyspnea, regardless of spirometric and radiologic findings. Identification of novel causes and exposure-response relations for known causes are needed to provide guidance for protecting workers at risk for this largely irreversible lung disease.

He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while {{it was on the}} front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. The barrage, using a mixture of high explosive and <b>mustard</b> <b>gas</b> shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering his sight, which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is {{the main}} {{pulmonary}} involvement resulting from sulfur <b>mustard</b> (SM) <b>gas</b> exposure that was used against Iranian civilians and military forces during the Iran-Iraq war. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and gastric micro-aspiration in SM gas injured patients with chronic pulmonary diseases and recurrent episodes of exacerbations. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was done at Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Gastric micro-aspiration and GER were assessed in the enrolled patients by assessing bile acids, pepsin and trypsin in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Results: Our result showed that bile acids {{were found to be}} high in 21. 4 % patients, and low in 53. 6 % of patients. Only in 16 % patients, no bile was detected in the BALF. Trypsin and pepsin were detected in BAL fluid of all patients. Conclusion: Most of BO patients after exposure to SM suffer GER, while none the etiologic factors of GER in post lung transplant BO are present. It would be hypothesized that GER per se could be considered as an aggregative factor for exacerbations in patients. Further studies will provide more advances to better understanding of pathophysiological mechanism regarding GER and BO and treatment...|$|R

In 1987, Libya began production of <b>mustard</b> <b>gas</b> at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli.

In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly <b>mustard</b> and nerve <b>gas</b> attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and <b>mustard</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Chemical weapons, {{which their}} history {{dates back to}} the first world war, refer to any factor that has direct toxic effects on human being, animals and plants. Iraqi regime used {{chemical}} weapons and various poisons during the imposed war against Iran of which <b>mustard</b> and nervous <b>gases</b> are examples that their effects are seen in victims even after passing many years. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross – sectional study was carried out in 2001 - 2002 to evaluate skin manifestations in 95 chemically wounded combatants of Lorestan province whom were exposed to the chemical weapons during the war. Data was collected by clinical examination and information recorded in a questionnaire. Findings: All of the studied cases with mean age of 39. 26 years old had skin manifestations among which the most common symptoms were itching, burning,dry skin, scaling. From view point of lesions, the most common signs were erythema (81 %), excoriation (87. 9 %) and pruritic papules (49. 5 %). Final diagnosis in 78 % of the patients was chronic dermatitis and in 7. 7 % of them was seborrhoeic dermatitis and in 8. 8 % both chronic and seborrhoeic dermatitis were observed. During exposure to chemical gases only 37. 9 % of these combatants had used special masks and 40 % had properly worn special clothes to protect themselves which covered their body completely, but rest of them had either used protection instruments improperly or had not used them at all. Most of the lesions were in trunk, lower extremities, abdomen, head and neck. 78 % of the cases had multiple lesions Conclusion: Regarding {{the results of this study}} all of the chemical wounded combatants of Lorestan province suffer from different degrees of skin lesions, although more than half of them were not aware of kind and nature of the chemical gases, but it is suggested to do further studies on long-term effects of these chemical gases...|$|R
