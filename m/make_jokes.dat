The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the Dowager Duchess's lack of discipline, Catherine became {{influenced}} by some older girls who candidly allowed men into the sleeping areas at night for entertainment. The girls were rewarded with food and wine and gifts. Catherine was not as well educated as some of Henry's other wives, although, on its own, her ability to read and write was impressive enough at the time. Her character has often been described as vivacious, giggly and brisk, but never scholarly or devout. She displayed great interest in her dance lessons, but would often be distracted during them and <b>make</b> <b>jokes.</b> She also had a nurturing side for animals, particularly dogs.|$|E

[...] However, she said, Eastwood does not <b>make</b> <b>jokes,</b> so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director Mike Nichols, whose delivery of a cutting remark, she said, made everyone laugh, including the target.

The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> about.|$|E

Cruise questions why they are able to do this, which leads to a monologue from Kyle, Jesus Christ, and Santa Claus explaining that the goo does not exist, and that threatening people with violence is the only true answer. In the censored version, this explanation is completely obscured by a continuous audio bleep.|$|E
500|$|In November 2007, the {{character}} {{was diagnosed with}} Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although he had {{been shown to be}} feeling sickly in the show for some time, he was wary of being tested. Even when forced into it by friend and colleague Maddy Young, he initially refused to so much as look at his results. Chambers explained: [...] "It's serious, but Sam's playing it down. Of course he's scared but he deals with it by just wanting to laugh it off and <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> about it". He speculated that the experience would force Sam to grow up and appreciate life more, as well as seriously consider the future of his daughter, Grace, and cease his philandering way with female staff.

500|$|In 1985, Pierce {{released}} {{a sequel to}} The Legend of Boggy Creek called [...] American International Pictures had been encouraging {{him to make a}} Boggy Creek sequel for years because they believed it would be financially profitable, but he was resistant to the idea. He did not participate in an earlier sequel, Return to Boggy Creek (1977), which was directed by Tom Moore, and did not like the final film. In his own Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues, Pierce starred as an anthropologist who brings three students on an expedition into the bayou to track down the creature. His son, Chuck Pierce, Jr., co-starred as Tim, one of the students. Pierce ultimately considered Boggy Creek II his worst film, believing his own role was too large and that he cast too many of his friends in supporting roles. Boggy Creek II was featured in a 1999 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a comedy television series in which the characters watch and <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> about bad films. The episode ultimately increased Pierce's visibility to a wider audience.|$|E
500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the project, de Campi read over 4000 pages of Archie comic books She drew {{inspiration}} for the story from the 1940s era of the series, when she says Archie Andrews' girlfriends Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge had [...] "more edge". Her scripts were subject to notes and tweaks from Archie Comics and Fox, but de Campi described both licensors as [...] "extremely mellow, pleasant and easy to work with". Fox's primary concern was why the Predator, {{who is known for}} choosing challenging prey, would be interested in teenagers, but a suitable explanation was included in the story. She expected some of the notes, such as being told, [...] "Alex, you can't <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> about child predation in an Archie book". Other times, she was surprised when she did not receive notes, such as her use of emojis for the Predator's speech. She was pleased when she got to add depth to Dilton Doiley, a character she feels is often overlooked in regular Archie comics. The choice of whether Archie Andrews would survive the series or not was changed several times during scripting, and a final decision was not made until the last draft of the script.|$|E
5000|$|The Soup <b>makes</b> <b>jokes</b> at the A&E TV Series, Steven Seagal: Lawman.

Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch Terrance and Phillip at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of Enya's [...] "Orinoco Flow". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, Death himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} episode {{included}} great lines, strong personality-driven comedy and good character moments, specially Tom's emotional {{reaction to his}} painting. Pierce said the Andy and Ron subplot was [...] "so well played that it threatens to usurp the mural storyline". Sandra Gonzalez particularly praised the [...] "murinal" [...] jokes about Jerry's mural, as well as Ron's claim that he ran a sheet metal factory when he was nine, and that [...] "Child labor laws are ruining this country."

But he particularly praised the character development in the main plot, in which [...] "each {{in their own way}} sticks to the purity of their uniquely screwy ideas". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student praised the entire cast, particularly Offerman and Pratt, who he said provide the show's two best characters. Sanders said the fact that the episode included a [...] "hilarious subplot" [...] involving both of them [...] "was more evidence that the writers have been listening to the fans".|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man was {{featured}} in a seventh season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a comedy television series. In the show, the human character Mike Nelson and his two robots friends, Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, are trapped in a satellite and forced by the mad scientist Dr. Forrester to watch bad films {{as part of an}} ongoing scientific experiment. In order to get through the experiment, Mike and the robots <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> mocking the film as they watch.

The Brute Man was the second episode of the seventh season, which was broadcast on Comedy Central on February 10, 1996. The description for The Brute Man in The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, a book by the cast and writers of the series, reads: [...] "A dark film about dark things.
