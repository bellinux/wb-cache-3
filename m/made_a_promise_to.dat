5|$|Since Louis had fathered no sons, the {{expectation}} that he would bequeath Hungary, Poland, and his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence to his daughters made them desirable spouses {{for members of the}} European royal families. Before Mary's first birthday, her father <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, that Mary would marry the emperor's second son, Sigismund of Luxembourg. Louis confirmed his promise in a deed in June 1373. Mary and Sigismund were closely related, because her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth of Poland, was the sister of his great-grandfather, Casimir III of Poland. Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6December 1374. The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis's promise of Mary's and Sigismund's marriage on 14April 1375.|$|E

25|$|Mulroney also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Quebecers, {{claiming}} that he would reform the constitution so that Quebec {{would be willing to}} endorse the Constitution, which it did not in 1982, unlike Canada's other provinces. To do this, Mulroney promised that he would give Quebec distinct society status and greater autonomy. This helped Mulroney garner substantial support from Quebec nationalists including Lucien Bouchard who joined the Conservatives {{claiming that}} providing Quebec with autonomy would be acceptable for Quebec to remain within Canada.|$|E

50|$|The protagonist regrets his affair, {{and states}} that he has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> not <b>to</b> cheat anymore. However, he still harbors deep temptation for Margie ("I know why she's there/I've been there before"), and — still having her {{telephone}} number — knows full well that she is often a client at the inn and is probably there as he speaks.|$|R
25|$|Buenaventura {{was offered}} various {{positions}} in government but politely declined them all until 1999, when Estrada once again offered him the position as BSP chief, {{in anticipation of}} Singson’s end-of-term departure. Buenaventura would later explain {{that he and his}} siblings had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> their late father that none of them would ever work in government. It was only after persistent convincing from Estrada himself and then finance secretary Jose Trinidad Pardo, a close adviser of the president and friend to Buenaventura himself, that Buenaventura was ultimately persuaded to accept the appointment to take over the BSP.|$|E

25|$|At Backlash, the {{original}} main event match was between Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H {{appeared to be}} out of the picture, as the annual WWE Draft took place eight days after WrestleMania and he was drafted to SmackDown. Almost immediately after the draft, the dethroned champion was traded back to Raw, and on March 29 he demanded that the intended match at Backlash be changed to Benoit and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff liked the idea of the match, but concluded with adding that he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Michaels for granting him a World title match at Backlash. To solve this, Bischoff booked a return Triple Threat match to serve as the main event for Backlash. Benoit emerged victorious by submission for the second consecutive pay-per-view, this time forcing Michaels to submit to a Sharpshooter. Benoit went on to hold the title until August 2004, losing it to Randy Orton at SummerSlam.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "tattling of many tongues" [...] in Virginia's Valentine poem was a {{reference}} to actual incidents. In 1845, Poe had begun a flirtation with Frances Sargent Osgood, a married 34-year-old poet. Virginia {{was aware of the}} friendship and might even have encouraged it. She often invited Osgood to visit them at home, believing that the older woman had a [...] "restraining" [...] effect on Poe, who had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> [...] "give up the use of stimulants" [...] and was never drunk in Osgood's presence.|$|E

500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{commented on}} the lack of guitar solos on St. Anger, a {{departure}} from what Metallica had done in the past: [...] "We wanted to preserve the sound of all four of us in a room just jamming. We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> ourselves that we'd only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E
500|$|Series of {{military}} reverses and detrimental relationships, which involved the Czech Přemyslids {{allied with the}} Veleti besides rivals, compelled Mieszko to seek {{the support of the}} German Emperor Otto I. After the contacts were made, Widukind described Mieszko as [...] "a friend of the emperor". A pact was negotiated and finalized no later than 965. The price Mieszko had to pay for the imperial protection was acceptance of the status of the emperor's vassal. He paid him tribute from the lands up to the Warta River and very likely also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> accept Christianity.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year the Hong Kong Sevens doubled as the Rugby Sevens World Cup. Serevi was Fiji's captain for the tournament. Before the tournament Serevi <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Fiji to [...] "bring back the Melrose Cup."

He also played for Fiji in the Japan and France sevens; the latter won by Fiji.|$|E

For the symmetric equilibrium, for given benefits of default, time-consistent default can be ruled out for sufficiently large committees. ...|$|R
500|$|Star player Cyclone Taylor had {{defected}} to Renfrew, and despite a salary war with Renfrew, Ottawa managed to re-sign their other top players, Dubby Kerr, Fred Lake and Marty Walsh for the 1909–10 season. On Taylor's first return in February 1910, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> score a goal while making a rush backwards against Ottawa. This led to incredible interest, with over 7,000 in attendance. A bet of $100 was {{placed at the}} King Edward Hotel against him scoring at all. Ottawa won 8–5 (scoring 3 goals in overtime) and kept Taylor off the scoresheet. Later in the season at the return match in Renfrew, Taylor made good on his boast with a goal scored backwards, although {{it was simply a}} goal scored on a backhand shot. This was the final game of the season, and Ottawa had no chance at the league title and did not appear to have put in an effort in a 17–2 loss, considered [...] "the worst trimming ever handed to a team wearing the Ottawa colors".|$|E
500|$|In a {{typically}} rowdy and disorderly public meeting, {{the citizens of}} Pawnee demand the fence be removed. Leslie meets with Lindsay, who condescendingly refuses to remove the fence and insults Pawnee in the process. Leslie, Tom and Ben (Adam Scott) attend an Eagleton town meeting to plead their case to its citizens. The Eagleton meeting is much different than those of Pawnee: it is a catered affair at a country club, where the citizens are wealthy and civil, but also snobbish and condescending. [...] Citing the poor maintenance of Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park, the Eagleton citizens prefer the fence stay up. Leslie reveals to Tom and Ben that she was offered the job of Eagleton parks director five years ago but turned it down, as she and Lindsay both <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> remain in Pawnee. [...] However, Eagleton then offered Lindsay the job and she accepted, thus turning her back on Pawnee and Leslie. Meanwhile, Ron becomes increasingly paranoid of Leslie's birthday plans, especially after he overhears April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) discuss outrageous party plans. When Ron asks Ann (Rashida Jones) about Leslie's last birthday bash for Ann and learns what a huge party she threw, Ron eventually becomes so paranoid that he resorts to sleeping in his office to avoid any potential surprises at home.|$|E
