5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of an ala is diversely and often vaguely described in folklore. A given ala <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a black wind, a gigantic creature of indistinct form, a huge-mouthed, humanlike, or snakelike monster, a female dragon, or a raven. An ala may also assume various human or animal shapes, {{and can even}} possess a person's body. It is believed that the diversity of appearances described {{is due to the}} ala's being a synthesis of a Slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of the central Balkans pre-Slavic population. In folk tales with a humanlike ala, her personality {{is similar to that of}} the Russian Baba Yaga. Ale are said to live in the clouds, or in a lake, spring, hidden remote place, forest, inhospitable mountain, cave, or gigantic tree. While ale are usually hostile towards humans, they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them, like dragons. In Christianized tales, St. Elijah takes the dragons' role, but in some cases the saint and the dragons fight ale together. Eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale, chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{that become}} {{infected}} experience hemorrhaging of their internal organs, skin, and muscle. Some fish show no external symptoms, but others {{show signs of}} infection that include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, bruised-looking reddish tints to the eyes, skin, gills and fins. Some infected fish have open sores that <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the lesions from other diseases or from lamprey attacks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1900s, some early {{research}} in animal cooperation {{focused on the}} benefits of group-living. While living in a group produces costs in the form of increased frequency of predator attacks and greater mating competition, some animals find that the benefits outweigh the costs. Animals that practice group-living often benefit from assistance in parasite removal, access to more mates, and conservation of energy in foraging. Initially, the most obvious form of animal cooperation was kin selection, but more recent studies focus on non-kin cooperation, where benefits may seem less obvious. Non-kin cooperation often involves many strategies that include manipulation and coercion, making these interactions more complicated to study. An example of manipulation is presented by the cuckoo, a brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nest of a bird of another species. That bird then is tricked into feeding and caring for the cuckoo offspring. Although this phenomenon <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> cooperation at first glance, it only presents benefits to one recipient.|$|E
25|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to address these questions and many others. The starting point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of particle physics can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. In string theory, one of the vibrational states of the string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

500|$|Having {{stood for}} more than 600 years with little alteration, the church was {{completely}} changed by four reconstructions and restorations in a 74-year period in the 19th century. [...] The last of these, in 1898, was the most substantial: it added a north aisle, much larger and taller {{than the rest of}} the building, and a vestry. [...] In the early 19th century, the building had been in better structural condition than many in Sussex—a survey in 1825 by Sir Stephen Glynn of the Ecclesiological Society noted that it was [...] "decently fitted up"—but rebuilding ancient churches was fashionable in the Victorian era, and the condition of a surviving medieval corbel suggests that the exterior walls were in poor condition. [...] The three earlier periods of restoration were 1824–25, 1856 and 1880–83. [...] During the third of these, a 13th-century wall painting of Christ in Judgement was discovered above the chancel arch, hidden under 30 layers of whitewash and the remains of two later paintings; it may be one of the oldest such murals in England, but it was repainted after its rediscovery. [...] In 1898, at the same time as the north-side extension, the outside walls of the west, east and south sides were coated with grey cement, probably to improve their structural condition; although this has been described as [...] "unsightly" [...] and [...] "kill the exterior stone dead", one historian has argued that because many medieval churches were rendered in this way, rather than having uncovered flint walls, it gives the impression of what a typical church of that era <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all later {{stated that}} they regretted {{the manner in which}} Best was sacked. Lennon {{admitted}} that [...] "we were cowards when we sacked him. We made Brian do it." [...] McCartney stated: [...] "I do feel sorry for him, because of what he could have been on to." [...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, whatever happened to the Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mann, {{born and}} raised in Virginia, was the {{daughter}} of Robert Munger and Elizabeth Munger. In Mann’s introduction for her book [...] "Immediate Family", she [...] "expresses stronger memories for the black woman, Virginia Carter, who oversaw her upbringing than for her own mother." [...] Elizabeth Munger was not a big part of Mann's life, and Elizabeth said “Sally <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> me, but inside she’s her father’s child.” Virginia (Gee-Gee) Carter, born in 1894, [...] raised Mann and her two brothers and was an admirable woman. “Left with six children and a public education system for which she paid taxes but which forbade classes for black children beyond the seventh grade, Gee-Gee managed somehow to send each of them to out-of-state boarding schools and, ultimately, to college.” Virginia Cater died in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{classical}} and modern forms, the alphabet has 19 consonant and 21 vowel letters. However, {{instead of being}} written sequentially like {{the letters of the}} Latin script, Hangul letters are grouped into blocks, such as [...] han, each of which transcribes a syllable. That is, although the syllable [...] han <b>may</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a single character, it is actually composed of three letters: [...] h, [...] a, and [...] n. Each syllabic block consists of two to six letters, including at least one consonant and one vowel. These blocks are then arranged horizontally from left to right or vertically from top to bottom. Each Korean word consists of one or more syllables, hence one or more blocks. The number of mathematically possible distinct blocks is 11,172, though there are far fewer possible syllables allowed by Korean phonotactics, and not all phonotactically possible syllables occur in actual Korean words. Of the 11,172 possible Hangul syllables, the most frequent 256 have a cumulative frequency of 88.2%; with the top 512, it reaches 99.9%.|$|E
