5|$|As Harvey's {{interests}} {{shifted to}} the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended {{and the number of}} visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosure</b> against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.|$|E

500|$|Frank {{has been}} {{involved}} in <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosure</b> bailout issues. [...] In 2008 Frank supported passage of the American Housing Rescue & Foreclosure Prevention Act, intended to protect thousands of homeowners from foreclosure. This law, , {{is considered one of the}} most important and complex issues on which he worked. In an August 2007 op-ed piece in Financial Times, Frank wrote, [...] "In the debate between those who believe in essentially unregulated markets and others who hold that reasonable regulation diminishes market excesses without inhibiting their basic function, the subprime situation unfortunately provides ammunition for the latter view." [...] Frank was also instrumental in the passage of , the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008, a measure that drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates. In 2007. Frank co-sponsored legislation to reform the Section 202 refinancing program, which is for affordable housing for the elderly, and Section 811 disabled programs. Frank has been a chief advocate of the National Housing Trust Fund, which was created as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and was the first affordable housing program to be enacted by the Congress since 1990.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1879, under a <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> {{what was}} left of the South Side Railroad was sold, and it was {{conveyed}} to the newly organized Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, which was immediately leased as the Montauk Division to the LIRR. In 1881, the line was extended east from Patchogue to Eastport by the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, connecting it to the Sag Harbor Branch, opening on July 17, 1881. This created a continuous rail line along the South Shore to Sag Harbor. It was thought that the line connecting the Main Line to Sag Harbor via Eastport could be abandoned, but residents got the LIRR to use the line as a cutoff for trains between the Main Line and the Montauk Division, and as a way for passengers to travel between the North and South Forks. This service was termed as a [...] "scoot". These trains ran from Greenport to Sag Harbor, and later to Montauk. In October 1889, the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad merged into the LIRR.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will analyze}} data of single-family {{residential}} <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosures</b> in designated local historic districts and similar comparable neighborhoods in Philadelphia, with {{the hypothesis that}} there will be fewer single-family residential <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosures</b> in the designated local historic districts versus similar comparable neighborhoods. This result would support existing research that has shown that local historic district designation can protect houses from wild fluctuations in market values and can add stability to a historic neighborhood’s housing market. Housing prices began to decline in late 2006 and early 2007 and foreclosure rates skyrocketed, however there have been relatively few studies conducted to assess who has been affected since that time and how these foreclosures have and will continue to affect the economy long-term, in addition to the lasting impact these foreclosures will have on neighborhoods and communities. In fact, there is no publicly-accessible national database of <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosures,</b> making research on the subject all that more difficult. There has not been a study undertaken to determine if local historic district designation has an impact on the occurrence of <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosures</b> in Philadelphia, let alone any other large city in the United States. With the issue of foreclosures as timely as it is, a study of this kind is pertinent and may encourage similar studies a...|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} we {{will focus on}} the {{features}} of the insolvency frameworks of Spain, France and the UK related to our hypothesis, namely, the choice between bankruptcy procedures and <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosures</b> and the choice of firms’ capital and asset structures.

For a more thorough analysis of the insolvency frameworks see Celentani et al. (2010, 2012) and Davydenko and Franks (2008).|$|R

30|$|Hence, <b>mortgage</b> <b>foreclosures</b> are an {{attractive}} alternative to bankruptcy, {{especially in the}} case of small firms. But, to make possible that a firm and their creditors use the mortgage system in case of financial distress, the firm’s capital structure must be biased towards mortgage loans and their asset structure must be biased towards assets—such as land and buildings—that can be pledged as mortgage collateral.|$|R
