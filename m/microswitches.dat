2500|$|A [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon with 150 rounds {{was fixed}} on the lower {{starboard}} side of the nose; it was fired by the pilot who had a primitive ring sight to use for aiming. The dorsal turret mounted two [...] Berezin B-20E guns with 400 rounds per gun and was capable of almost 360° of traverse; special <b>microswitches</b> prevented the gunner from firing into the bomber's tail. The turret was remotely controlled by the radio operator and was powered by electric motors for both traverse and elevation. The gunner and his gunsight used a small observation blister {{at the rear of}} the main crew compartment to lay the guns on their target. The sight automatically compensated for parallax between the gunner and the turret as well as the required amount of target lead and the shell's ballistics. The remote-control system offered several advantages including a smaller turret that had less drag, the guns could be fixed more rigidly to their mounts, the sight was not exposed to vibrations from firing and could track targets more smoothly and the gunner's comfort did not have to be sacrificed to optimize the performance of the turret. The major disadvantage, of course, was that the remote control system was exceedingly complicated for the period and prone to breaking down. The rear gunner was placed at the very tail of the Il-22 to optimize his field of fire in an electro-hydraulically powered Il-KU3 turret that mounted another NS-23 cannon. The turret could traverse a total of 140°, elevate 35° and depress 30°.|$|E

40|$|We taught 4 {{students}} with profound multiple disabilities {{to use a}} <b>microswitch</b> communication system to request a change in recreational stimuli during social interactions with nondisabled peers. In Study 1, we conducted a preference assessment {{across a range of}} stimuli for each student.

During the second study, 3 of the 4 students (a) learned to use the <b>microswitch</b> communication system to control stimulus presentation, (b) more clearly differentiated their time among stimuli, and (c) increased their level of general alertness. Study 3 extended the use of the <b>microswitch</b> communication system to social interactions with nondisabled peers.

50|$|Because {{hinge points}} are {{eliminated}} and the motion {{is due to}} stressing of a thin metal strip, <b>microswitches</b> are extremely reliable, operating for millions of cycles without failure.

40|$|A phenomenological {{approach}} is proposed to identify some effects occurring within {{the structure of}} the <b>microswitch</b> conceived for radio frequency application. This microsystem is operated via a nonlinear electromechanical action imposed by the applied voltage. Unfortunately, it can be affected by residual stress, due to the microfabrication process, therefore axial and flexural behaviors are strongly coupled. This coupling increases the actuation voltage required to achieve the so-called ‘‘pull-in'' condition. Moreover, temperature may strongly affect strain and stress distributions, respectively. Environmental temperature, internal dissipation of material, thermo-elastic and Joule effects play different roles on the <b>microswitch</b> flexural isplacement. Sometimes buckling phenomenon evenly occurs. Literature show that all those issues make difficult an effective computation of ‘‘pull-in'' and ‘‘pull-out'' voltages for evenly distinguishing the origin of some failures detected in operation. Analysis, numerical methods and experiments are applied to an industrial test case to investigate step by step the RF-microswitch operation. Multiple electro-hermomechanical coupling is first modeled to have a preliminary and comprehensive description of the <b>microswitch</b> behavior and of its reliability. ‘‘Pull-in'' and ‘‘pull-out'' tests are then performed to validate the proposed models and to find suitable criteria to design the RF-MEM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{dominance}} of surface tension over inertia in mi-croscale and favorable scale effect for electrostatic actuation allow electrostatically driven metal-droplet systems practical. Because of such potential advantages as low contact resistance, naturally bistable operation, and high switch density, the liquid-metal droplet switch {{is an excellent}} candidate for reconfigurable circuit interconnections. Following earlier droplet <b>microswitch</b> examples and related studies of metal-droplet behavior, we report the first functioning droplet switch directly integrated {{on top of a}} functional CMOS circuit. While the surface tension dominance makes the droplet switches practical as a mechanical system and also brings bistability, it also requires a high electric field to move the droplet. We implement the concept of physical surface modi-fication to lower the driving voltage to a value that a commercial CMOS process can provide. Unlike previous droplet switches, the reported device is planar-processed to allow the integration with the underlying CMOS circuits. The integrated switch is made functional by such provisions as self-limiting actuation and by optimizing the electrostatic force in the planar configuration and avoiding liquid-metal “flooding ” into surface patterns. A fabri-cation process for low driving voltage and high compatibility is developed to integrate the droplet switch on the custom-developed CMOS chip. A packaging method adapted from well-established microelectronic packaging isolates the active switch space from the surrounding environment. Low driving voltage (as low as 15 V) and millisecond switching speed are achieved by the current on-chip device. While the current device uses 150 m droplets for demonstration, additional theoretical and experimental results indicate that further miniaturization would lead to smaller devices and lower operation voltage.
