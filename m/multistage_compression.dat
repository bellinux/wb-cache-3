40|$|The {{economic}} viability of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) {{as a means}} of mitigating CO 2 emissions is significantly dependent on the minimisation of costs associated with the compression and transportation of the captured CO 2. This paper describes the development and application of a rigorous thermodynamic model to compute and compare power requirements for various <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> strategies for CO 2 streams containing typical impurities originating from various capture technologies associated with industrial and power emission sectors. The compression options examined include conventional multistage integrally geared centrifugal compressors, supersonic shockwave compressors and <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> combined with subcritical liquefaction and pumping. The study shows that for all the compression options examined, the compression power reduces with the increase in the purity of the CO 2 stream, while the inter-stage cooling duty is predicted to be significantly higher than the compression power demand. For CO 2 streams carrying less than 5 % impurities, <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> combined with liquefaction and subsequent pumping from ca 62 bar pressure can offer higher efficiency than conventional gas-phase compression. In the case of a raw/dehumidified oxy-fuel CO 2 stream of ca 85 % purity, subcritical liquefaction at 62 bar pressure is shown to increase the cooling duty by ca 50 % as compared to pure CO 2...|$|E

Compared to the Brayton cycle which uses adiabatic compression and expansion, the second Ericsson cycle uses isothermal compression and expansion, thus producing more net work per stroke.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{theory is}} presented for post-stall transients in <b>multistage</b> axial <b>compression</b> systems. The theory {{leads to a}} set of three simultaneous nonlinear third-order partial differential equations for pressure rise, and average and disturbed values of flow coefficient, as functions of time and angle around the compressor. By a Galerkin procedure, angular dependence is averaged, and the equations become first order in time. These final equations are capable of describing the growth and possible decay of a rotating-stall cell during a compressor mass-flow transient. It is shown how rotating-stall-like and surgelike motions are coupled through these equations, and also how the instantaneous compressor pumping characteristic changes during the transient stall process...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} to specificate the formation process of stress-strain state of {{buildings in the}} construction process is a new problem which requires including real production characteristics going beyond calculation models into calculation methods.

40|$|Abstract: For {{many years}} {{the authors have}} been {{investigating}} the use of twin screw machines to fulfil both the expansion and compression. One of potential advantages of screw machines over other types of positive displacement machine is their ability to perform both the compression and expansion functions simultaneously, using only one pair of rotors. A further feature {{is the use of}} the rotors which seal on both contacting surfaces so that the same profile may be used both for the expander and the compressor sections. By using the same profile for both, the compressor and expander rotors can be machined or ground in a single cutting operation and then separated by machining a parting slot in them on completion of the lobe formation. Moreover, in such a case, by proper location of the machine ports, pressure loads and thereby, mechanical friction losses will be less than if the two functions are performed in separate machines. Fields of application of such machines are replacement of the throttle valve in refrigeration and air conditioning plants, high-pressure application, fuel cells, <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> or expansion and, really, any other application where simultaneous compression and expansion are required. One example of such unusual, but convenient application is the compressor capacity control by partial expanding of compressed gas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to characterise the {{microstructure}} evolution of new-developed 27 Mn- 4 Si- 2 Al-Nb-Ti high-manganese steel in various conditions of hot-working. Design/methodology/approach: Flow stresses during the <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> test were measured usingthe Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. To describe the hot-working behaviour, the steelwas compressed to the various amount of deformation (4 x 0. 29, 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19). The microstructure evolution in successive stages of deformation was determined in metallographic investigations using light, scanning and electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Findings: The steel has austenite microstructure with annealing twins and some fraction of ε martensite plates in the initial state. The flow stresses are much higher in comparison with austenitic Cr-Ni and Cr-Mn steelsand slightly higher compared to Fe-(15 - 25) Mn alloys. The flow stresses {{are in the range}} of 200 - 400 MPafor the applied conditions of hot-working. Making use of dynamic and metadynamic recrystallization,it is possible to refine the microstructure and to decrease the flow stress to 350 MPa during the last deformation at 850 °C. Applying the true strains of 0. 23 and 0. 19 requires the microstructure refinementby static recrystallization. After the grain refinement due to recrystallization, the steel is characterisedby uniform structure of γ phase without ε martensite plates. Research limitations/implications: To fully describe the hot-working behaviour of the new-developed steel, further investigations in wider temperature and strain rate ranges are required.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of hot-working conditions on microstructure evolution and phase composition of new-developed high-manganese austenitic TRIP-type steels. Design/methodology/approach: The hot-working behaviour was determined in continuous and <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> tests performed in a temperature range of 850 to 1100 °C by the use of the Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. The processes controlling work hardening and removing it were identified by microstructure evolution observations in different stages of compression with the amount of true strain 4 x 0. 23. Phase composition of steels was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Findings: It was found that they have austenite microstructure with numerous annealing twins in the initial state. Continuous compression tests realized in the temperature range from 850 to 1050 °C with the strain rate of 0. 1, 1 and 10 s- 1 enabled determination of yield stress values and values of εmax deformations - corresponding to maximum flow stress. The investigated steels are characterized by high values of flow stress from 120 to 380 MPa. Results of the multi-stage compression proved that applying the true strain 4 x 0. 23 gives the possibility to refine the austenite microstructure. Research limitations/implications: To determine in detail the microstructure evolution during industrial rolling, the hot-working schedule should take into account real number of passes and higher strain rates. Practical implications: The obtained microstructure - hot-working conditions relationships and stress-strain curves can be useful in determination of power-force parameters of hot-rolling for sheets with fine-grained austenitic structures. Originality/value: The hot-working behaviour and microstructure evolution in various conditions of plastic deformation for new-developed high-manganese austenitic TRIP-type steels with Nb and Ti microadditions were investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to provide a {{reliable}} tool to simulate the stationary and transient operation performances in <b>multistage</b> axial <b>compression</b> systems, especially poststall behavior.

The source terms express the blade-flow interactions and are estimated by calculating the velocity triangles for each blade row.

The experiments {{were conducted to}} study the effect of pore pressure changes on the accumulation of damage (dilatant volumetric strain). The first experiment comprised five constant total stress tests in which the internal pore pressure was incremented during successive stages, while the externally applied axial and radial stresses were maintained constant. The second experiment comprised three constant effective stress tests in which the pore pressure and the externally applied axial and radial stresses were increased in equal increments in successive stages. Volumetric strain rates were determined {{both before and after}} the pore pressure changes were made in all tests.

Benefits include cost management (through reduced system footprint, required RF and SRF hardware, and associated infrastructure - including high power beam dumps and cryogenic systems), ease in radiation control (low drive beam exhaust energy), ability to accelerate and deliver multiple beams of differing energy to multiple FELs, and opportunity for seamless integration of <b>multistage</b> bunch length <b>compression</b> into the longitudinal matching scenario. Issues include all those associated with ERLs compounded by the challenge of generating and preserving the CW electron drive beam brightness required by short wavelength FELs.

40|$|Natural gas {{is stored}} as {{compressed}} natural gas (CNG) in heavy steel cylinders under pressures of 200 - 250 atm. However, such a method of storage has certain disadvantages which include <b>multistage</b> <b>compression</b> costs, limited driving range and safety aspects. Hence, alternative methods of storage such as adsorbed natural gas (ANG) which involve adsorbing natural gas at moderate pressures and room temperatures in a suitable nanoporous material are currently being explored. In this thesis, we have isolated model carbon nanostructures and defect geometries {{most likely to be}} found in these materials and investigated their specific interactions with methane. The thesis is concerned with ab-initio density functional theory calculations on these various model carbon nanostructures in order to identify the potential candidates that enhance methane adsorption. The adsorption energies of methane on graphite and graphene sheets were similar, with a value of 12. 3 kJ/mol for graphene. The Stone-Wales defect in graphene was found to increase the methane adsorption energy to 37. 2 kJ/mol, and small surface undulations on the graphene sheet resulted in a smaller increase (16 kJ/mol) in the adsorption energy relative to graphene. The presence of an interstitial carbon was found to significantly reduce the adsorption energy to 5. 2 kJ/mol. The enhanced adsorption energy {{in the case of the}} Stone-Wales defect was attributed to the significant charge redistribution in the vicinity of the defect. A variety of functional groups such as carboxylic acid (COOH), carbonyl (CO), phenol (OH), pyran (-O-), phenone (=O), peroxide (OOH) and amine (NH 2) groups have been observed on carbon surfaces. Extensive density functional calculations of methane adsorbed on various chemically functionalized graphene nanoribbons were carried out to evaluate their methane adsorption energies. A significant finding in this study, is the increased adsorption energies (relative to graphene) that occur for the functional groups containing the OH moiety. The adsorption energies for edge functionalized graphene nanoribbons are 27. 6 and 69. 7 kJ/mol for COOH and OOH functionalization. Additional computations reveal a strong correlation between the induced dipole moment on methane and the strength of the adsorption energies obtained for the extended nanoribbons. Adsorption isotherms for methane were obtained using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for slit-like graphitic pores with and without functional groups. For both OH and COOH functionalized graphite, we observe more than a 40 % increase in the volumetric loading over bare graphite for the highest weight % of the functional group and smallest pore width considered. The maximum volumetric loading decreases with a decrease in the wt% of the functional groups and with an increase in the pore width...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Pulse Compression is a {{technique}} that may be employed for the generation of extremely high amplitude current and voltage pulses. These pulses can be as short as 50 to 100 ns, and may have amplitudes in the kiloampere and kilovolt ranges. Pulse Compression entails the compression of relatively "flat" pulses in the time domain, to pulses of very high amplitudes and extremely short duration. The pulse amplitudes and durations necessary to be achieved in this research, lie in the range where the switching speeds and other parameters of semiconductors are inadequate and where even the working life of conventional gas discharge apparatus are drastically reduced by the extreme switching demands. The burden of excessively high current densities and unmanageable current rise-rates can be transferred from the semiconductor switches to electromagnetic switches, by making use of pulse compression. Pulse compression {{can be carried out}} simultaneously or separately for the compression of the current or voltage content of pulses derived from slowly switched sources, to obtain pulses of extremely short duration and very high amplitudes. The main theme of this dissertation is Current compression. Current compression is accomplished through series-resonance in capacitors and saturable inductors connected in a transmission-line configuration. Energy is transferred in this process from one stage to the next, with reduction in pulse-time in each successive stage and a commensurate increase in amplitude. The generated pulses can attain gigawatt amplitudes and nanosecond durations, whilst loading on the semiconducting switches remains low. In addition to design of the pulse-compressor proper, the work also includes design and development of a voltage-controlled pulse power supply, suitable for generating the initial pulses which are to be compressed. <b>Multistage</b> pulse <b>compression</b> is based on the non-linear characteristics of saturable inductors. Dynamic analogue-time simulation is indispensable in a study thereof, as new theory has to be validated and because non-linear analysis is complex and capable only of being executed by employing approximation methods. Because of the difficulties involved, a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the development of suitable analogue-dynamic simulation programs for execution on a digital computer. A numerical technique has been developed to express non-linear parameters in differential form. This technique makes it possible to model and simulate virtually any non-linear, physically realizable lumped parameter system with ease. The program is based on State Space techniques and has been developed for its versatility, to accomplish the simulation {{of a wide variety of}} circuit configurations...|$|R
