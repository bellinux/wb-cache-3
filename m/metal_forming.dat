Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good castability properties. [...] Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects. Steel is also distinguishable from wrought iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag.|$|E
500|$|Lithium, {{the lightest}} of the alkali metals, {{is the only}} alkali metal which reacts with {{nitrogen}} at standard conditions, and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule (N2) {{requires a lot of}} energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali <b>metal</b> (<b>forming</b> M+ ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N2 and the formation of N3− ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic, forming lithium nitride. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic, so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions. Sodium nitride (Na3N) and potassium nitride (K3N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.N|last=Fischer|first=D. |last2=Jansen|first2=M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1755–1756|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10<1755::AID-ANIE1755>3.0.CO;2-C}}N|last1=Fischer|first1=D. |last2=Cancarevic|first2=Z. |last3=Schön|first3=J.

2500|$|Contact {{mechanics}} is part {{of mechanical}} engineering.

Principles of contacts mechanics are implemented towards applications such as locomotive wheel-rail contact, coupling devices, braking systems, tires, bearings, combustion engines, mechanical linkages, gasket seals, metalworking, <b>metal</b> <b>forming,</b> ultrasonic welding, electrical contacts, and many others. Current challenges faced in the field may include stress analysis of contact and coupling members and the influence of lubrication and material design on friction and wear.
