25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and <b>mating</b> <b>contact</b> pads on a circuit board.|$|E

40|$|A {{proposed}} tool {{would be}} used to inspect alignments of mating twinaxial-connector assemblies on interconnecting wiring harnesses. More specifically, the tool {{would be used}} to inspect the alignment of each contact pin of each connector on one assembly with the corresponding socket in the corresponding connector on the other assembly. It is necessary to inspect the alignment because if mating of the assemblies is attempted when any pin/socket pair is misaligned beyond tolerance, the connection will not be completed and the dielectric material in the socket will be damaged (see Figure 1). Although the basic principle of the tool is applicable to almost any type of mating connector assemblies, the specific geometry of the tool must match the pin-and-socket geometry of the specific mating assemblies to be inspected. In the original application for which the tool was conceived, each of the mating assemblies contains eight twinaxial connectors; the pin diameter is 0. 014 in. (. 0. 35 mm), and the maximum allowable pin/socket misalignment is 0. 007 in. (. 0. 18 mm). Incomplete connections can result in loss of flight data within the functional path to the space shuttle crew cockpit displays.

Given the thousands of species of parasitoid wasps, there are relatively few studies of their mating systems. Here, I examine many aspects of mating behavior, and I attempt to further document some of the proximal mechanisms involved in mating in the parasitoid wasp Spalangia endius. I first focused on decreased male sexual responsiveness after mating and its relationship to ejaculate replenishment. There {{was no significant difference in}} ejaculate amount between males that remated immediately and males that waited 30 minutes to remate. Additionally, I showed that decreased male sexual responsiveness, whether from interaction with a mated female or as a result of mating, is short-lived (minutes or less) but still a disadvantage in terms of competition. Recently mated males are less likely to mount and thus mate with a virgin female in the presence of a virgin male. Second, I generated isofemale lines in order to test the hypothesis that time-until-male-remating shows genetic variation. Time-until-remating was greater among lines than within lines, therefore a genetic component appears to exist. Third, I investigated whether or not the male's mating status has consequences for females. Mating a mated male rather than a virgin male did not significantly decrease a female's attractiveness or receptivity, perhaps because mated males did not perform less postcopulatory courtship and postcopulatory courtship is the major trigger for changes in attractiveness and receptivity. Chapter 2 results suggest an advantage to the temporary decrease in sexual responsiveness in males after mating, in that males will not attempt to remate with the same female. However, if this decrease in sexual responsiveness occurs in a broader array of situations there may be an associated cost. In my last chapter I attempt to address what stimuli could be associated with virgin males showing decreased sexual responsiveness. Unfortunately, I am not able to directly test whether males associate an aphrodisiac with an antiaphrodisiac. However, results are at least consistent with an association of aphrodisiac with either antiaphrodisiac or brush off, not failure to copulate. A decrease in sexual responsiveness did occur in a broader array of situations so there may be an associated cost.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to study the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis {{in the presence of}} a wildlife reservoir species. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of possum populations with endemic bovine tuberculosis infection were analysed. The results were used to develop a computer simulation model of the dynamics of bovine tuberculosis infection in possum populations. A case-control study of breakdowns to tuberculosis infection in cattle herds in the Central North Island of New Zealand was conducted to identify risk factors other than exposure to tuberculosis in local possum populations. The cross-sectional study was based on data gathered some years earlier in the Hauhungaroa Ranges from a number of traplines with a total length of 60 km, hence it provided information about the epidemiology of possum tuberculosis on a large geographical scale with varying environmental conditions. The results from the study showed that disease occurrence was clustered in space with local prevalence reaching up to 20 % while the overall prevalence was about 1. 2 %. The longitudinal study was conducted using an area of 21 hectare of mixed pasture and bush on a sheep/beef farm. The study showed that incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis infection in possum populations has distinct spatial and temporal patterns. Environmental conditions were a major factor in determining the temporal pattern. Spatial and temporal analysis of the occurrence of different strains of Mycobacterium bovis allowed inferences to be made about the importance of particular transmission paths. Survival of possums depended on environmental conditions and tuberculosis disease status. Adverse weather conditions increased mortality and the incidence of clinical disease in possums. On average clinically tuberculous possums survived for about 2 to 3 months from the onset of clinical disease. The simulation model uses a Monte-Carlo modelling approach and incorporates geographical features. Biological mechanisms which are considered important for population and infection dynamics were implemented in the model. These include mating, density-dependent and -independent mortality, pseudo-vertical transmission, transmission through spatial or temporal proximity, and transmission during <b>mating</b> <b>contact.</b> Each possum's movements and behaviour are simulated on a day-by-day basis. Simulations are conducted using a geography and possum population based on data from the longitudinal field study. For preliminary validation, model output was compared with field data from the longitudinal study. Sensitivity analyses and some initial simulation experiments were conducted to identify areas in the model structure which require the collection of additional field data. Use of the model for simulation of a possum population occupying a 400 ha area in the Central North Island of New Zealand is demonstrated. The case-control study of breakdowns to tuberculosis infection in cattle herds showed that in the Waikato area of New Zealand exposure to tuberculosis infection in local possum populations was not the dominant cause of breakdowns when the study was conducted in 1989 / 90, at a time when tuberculous possums were first discovered in the region. Farmers who had breakdowns tended to follow cattle purchase and management practices which traditionally have been considered to put farms at risk of introducing tuberculosis.

40|$|In {{engineering}} practice {{it is important}} to know which factors affect the thermal and electrical resistance of metal contacts. This thesis is to investigate some of these factors such as surface roughness and contact pressure. Thermal electrical contact resistance ratios for metal contacts were calculated from the experimental data. The technical literature was searched, and several papers were found in which either thermal or electrical contact resistance was studied separately. However, none of the papers recorded data for both thermal and electrical resistances for the same samples. The information found in these papers has been used as a background for understanding the nature of thermal and electrical contact resistance. Both of these contact resistances are primarily a function of the load on the contact and the condition of the surfaces. At low pressures only a small fraction of the total gross area of the contacts is in metal-to-metal contact. Increasing the load, flattens the “hills” and reduces both the thermal and electrical contact resistance. This phenomenon is called “spreading resistance” since the flow of heat or electrical current must spread out after they pass through the restricted areas that are actually in contact. Another type of thermal and electrical resistance, which is called “interface resistance 2 ̆ 2, is caused by a film of foreign material such as an oxide, etc. on the surfaces of the contacting “hills”. If the space between the “hills” of a contact is filled with air, there is a heat flow by convection currents. The literature indicates this quantity of heat flow is approximately one thousandth of the total heat flow through metal contacts. Since the only electrical current conduction mechanism acting between areas not in actual metallic contact is that due to thermionic emission, the electrical resistance for these areas will be extremely high at room temperature for which thermionic emission is negligible. The experimental apparatus to measure both the thermal and electrical contact resistances consists mainly of a bellows-actuated press which is operated remotely under a vacuum bell. The press pressure loads the sample metal wafers. A thin film heat meter is used to indicate the quantity of heat flowing through the metal contacts. The temperature drop caused by the contacts is measured with thermocouples. The temperature difference and the quantity of heat flowing is used to calculate the thermal contact resistance. A strain gage on the bellows-press stem measures the loading on the contact surfaces. Electrical probes are used to measure the electrica 1 resistance across the contact surfaces. The thermocouples and electrical resistance probes are permanently installed in the outer two smooth copper wafers. This makes it possible to quickly change to other sets of sample wafers of other metals and finishes. In order to use this permanent arrangement, it is necessary to finish two mating surfaces of the particular set of metal wafers to be tested, similar to the permanent smooth copper wafers so that these two extra <b>mating</b> <b>contact</b> resistances can be found and thus be subtracted from the overall contact resistance. The data indicates that the thermal-electrical contact resistance ratio can be changed by changing the load on the contacts. The heat meter had performed very well, and this new method of measuring heat flow will undoubtedly become a standard method of measuring heat flux...|$|E

40|$|Background: Mating {{behaviors}} in simple invertebrate model organisms represent tractable paradigms {{for understanding the}} neural bases of sex-specific behaviors, decision-making and sensorimotor integration. However, there are few examples where such neural circuits have been defined at high resolution or interrogated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we exploit {{the simplicity of the}} nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to define the neural circuits underlying the male’s decision to initiate mating in response to <b>contact</b> with a <b>mate.</b> <b>Mate</b> <b>contact</b> is sensed by male-specific sensilla of the tail, the rays, which subsequently induce and guide a contact-based search of the hermaphrodite’s surface for the vulva (the vulva search).

Using optogenetics, cell-specific ablation- and mutant behavioral analyses, we show that the male makes this shift by manipulating the activity of command cells within this sex-shared locomotory system. The rays control the command interneurons through the male-specific, decision-making interneuron PVY and its auxiliary cell PVX. Unlike many sex-shared pathways, PVY/PVX regulate the command cells via cholinergic, rather than glutamatergic transmission, a feature that likely contributes to response specificity and coordinates directional movement with other cholinergic-dependent motor behaviors of the mating sequence.

40|$|Abstract: Socially monogamous male {{birds are}} {{predicted}} to maximise their reproductive success by pursuing extra-pair copulations (EPCs) while engaging in anti-cuckoldry behaviour such as mate guarding. In the stitchbird, Notiomystis cincta, {{high levels of}} forced EPCs and {{a high proportion of}} nestlings resulting from extrapair fertilisations lead to the prediction that males of this species should exhibit intense paternity guarding behaviours. While studying an isolated stitchbird population on Tiritiri Matangi Island – New Zealand (36 ° 36 ´S, 174 ° 53 ´E), I collected daily behavioural data throughout the breeding season from 15 males in 2000 / 01 and 27 males in 2001 / 02. In this study, male stitchbirds demonstrated clear paternity guarding by exhibiting: (1) an increased likelihood of being close to their mate during her fertile period, (2) an increased initiation of <b>mate</b> <b>contact</b> during her fertile period, (3) switching from site-specific territorial defence during the pre-fertile period to defending an area centring on the their female partner’s location during her fertile period, and (4) an increased following of the female to communal feeding sites outside the territory during her fertile period. For polygynous males, mate guarding and territorial defence were conditional on which of their females was fertile. Additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that mate guarding in this species is a form of paternity assurance, rather than protection from harassment, is that males protected their partner from harassment by other stitchbird males but did not intervene when females were harassed by male bellbirds, Anthornis melanura.

The specimens {{used in the}} tests are composed of three or two individual blocks with perfectly <b>mated</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces. The contact surfaces have on their upper half a frictional strength smaller than on their lower half. This creates a “weak” surface on the upper half and a “strong” surface on the lower half. Different tests are performed by changing the frictional characteristics (e. g. cohesion and friction) of the strong surface. The experiments are conducted by applying first a normal stress across the frictional surface and then increasing the shear stress until final debonding and slip along the strong surface occur. Slip starts on the weak area and, as the shear stress is increased, propagates towards the strong area. Full slip along the weak area introduces a sharp transition between {{the area of the}} discontinuity that has slipped and the area that has not. This transition induces a large concentration of stresses which can be treated within the framework of fracture mechanics as a mode II frictional crack. With further loading rupture occurs through the strong area as an unstable process that coincides with failure. The results show that GIIC is not a material property. It depends on the normal stress applied, on the frictional characteristics of the interface, and on the critical slip required for the transition from peak to residual. A slip initiation model is proposed based on experimental observations and on fracture mechanics theory. Predictions with the model compare very well with experiments. ...|$|R

By assuming that food scents are more intensive on specific body parts of returning foragers, i. e., the posterior legs of pollen foragers and mouthparts of nectar foragers, we quantified the interactions between hive mates and foragers during dances advertising different types of food sources. For natural sources, {{a higher proportion of}} hive <b>mates</b> <b>contacted</b> the hind legs of pollen dancers (where the pollen loads were located) with their heads compared to non-pollen dancers. On the other hand, the proportion of head-to-head contacts was higher for non-pollen foragers during the waggle runs. When the food scent was manipulated, dancers collecting scented sugar solution had a higher proportion of head-to-head contacts and a lower proportion around their hind legs compared to dancers collecting unscented solution. The presence of food odors did not affect in-hive behaviors of dancers, but it increased the number of trophallaxes in-between waggle runs (i. e., during circle phases). These results suggest that the honeybee dance facilitates the olfactory information transfer between incoming foragers and hive mates, and we propose that excitatory displays in other social insect species serve the same purpose. While recent empirical and theoretical findings suggested that the colony level foraging benefits of the spatial information encoded in the waggle dance vary seasonally and with habitats, the role of the dance as a compound signal not only indicating the presence of a profitable resource but also amplifying the information transfer regarding floral odors may be important under any ecological circumstances...|$|R

The proportions of superficial, intermediate and parabasal epithelial cells in the vagina smears showed that superficial cells usually contribute less than 16 % of the total and are also less abundant (P< 0. 05) irrespective of the doe’s exposure type or parity status. All categories of follicles were seen on ovarian sections from NVC and VIC does, but corpora lutea were also present on the sections from VIC does, whereas only follicles below 0. 5 mm diameter were seen on the sections from NOC does. In conclusion, these results suggest that the rabbit does require some form of stimulus from the male to remain sexually attractive. Moreover, ovulation appeared to have been induced in the does with visual contact with the male, probably in conjunction with auditory and olfactory, but without tactile or <b>mating</b> <b>contacts.</b> Key Words: rabbit, oestrous, ovulation, male effect...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} mechanism for deformation and failure in rock masses under relatively low stresses is slip along pre-existing discontinuities. These discontinuities {{can be viewed}} as fractures and their behavior can be approximated using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics theory. Slip along a frictional discontinuity can be approached as initiation and propagation of a mode II fracture along its own plane. Fracture mechanics theories predict that under pure mode II loading initiation will occur when the energy release rate of the fracture attains a critical value (GIIC), which is generally taken as a material property. The research conducted shows that this is not be the case. Identification and quantification of the mechanisms for the onset and propagation of slip along frictional surfaces are carried out by testing in biaxial compression rock and rock-model specimens. The specimens consist of individual blocks with perfectly <b>mated</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces. The contact surface between blocks is equally divided in two areas, one with a lower frictional strength (weak area) and the other one with a higher frictional strength (strong area). Experiments show that slip starts first in the weak area and progresses toward the strong area with increasing load. Once slip has reached the strong area, a sharp contact is created between the area that has slipped (weak) and the area that has not (strong). Results from the tests show that the critical energy release rate, GIIC, depends on the frictional characteristics of the surface and on the critical displacement required to decrease the frictional strength from peak to residual. Furthermore, experiments conducted on surfaces with and without cohesion indicate that cohesive debonding and frictional mobilization may not occur simultaneously. Imaging of the discontinuity using wave propagation, as it undergoes slip, has been instrumental in detecting precursors to failure {{in the form of a}} distinct peak in the amplitude of transmitted waves and a marked decrease in the amplitude of reflected waves prior to the peak shear strength of a discontinuity. Seismic precursors are consistently observed well before slip, or failure, of the discontinuity...|$|R
40|$|T he aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the response to combinations of male stimuli in the oestrous doe in terms of changes in vulva colour, exfoliated cells in the vaginal lumen and the ovarian histology. Twelve oestrous heterogeneous rabbits does (6 multiparous and 6 nulliparous) were allotted equally to 3 experimental treatments: VIC – Male exposure with visual contact; NVC – Male exposure without visual contact and; NOC – Females completely isolated and not allowed any contact with the male. The does were placed under these treatments for 30 consecutive days during which vulvar colour was checked and vaginal smears were taken daily for each animal. All animals were sacrificed on the thirtieth day and their ovaries processed for histological examination following H & E staining. Does with NVC and VIC exposure displayed either red or pink vulva in 95 and 90 %  of cases, respectively, the remaining cases being rose coloured but never a whitish vulva (P< 0. 05), whereas does with NOC exposure displayed rose vulva on 80 % of the days checked and another 11. 7 % cases with white vulvae but never a reddish vulva (P< 0. 05). The proportions of superficial, intermediate and parabasal epithelial cells in the vagina smears showed that superficial cells usually contribute less than 16 % of the total and are also less abundant (P< 0. 05) irrespective of the doe’s exposure type or vulva colour, except in male-isolated does with purple vulva. All categories of follicles were seen on ovarian sections from NVC and VIC does, but corpora lutea were also present on the sections from VIC does, whereas only follicles below 0. 5 mm diameter were seen on the sections from NOC does. In conclusion, these results suggest that the rabbit does require some form of stimulus from the male to remain sexually attractive.
