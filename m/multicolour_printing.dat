5000|$|The {{design process}} for this series began in 1963 with a {{primary goal of}} {{creating}} banknotes that were more counterfeit-resistant than the 1954 Series it was to replace. The Bank of Canada requested design submissions from security printing companies, receiving several from both domestic and foreign companies. One proposed design was received from Organisation Giori, a Swiss security printer based in Lausanne that had developed a <b>multicolour</b> <b>printing</b> press [...] "that raised the bar on banknote security". Its designs for the $10 and $20 banknotes were a [...] "significant departure" [...] from traditional Canadian banknote designs by incorporating more colours, new graphic elements, and different security features, but the design was rejected. Final conceptual designs were created by Canadian Bank Note Company, British American Bank Note Company, and De La Rue, the latter being the first foreign firm involved {{in the design of}} Canadian banknotes. The design by De La Rue was selected by the Bank of Canada in 1964 {{as the basis for the}} new series.|$|E

40|$|In the {{newspaper}} printing industry, offset is the dominating printing method {{and the use}} of <b>multicolour</b> <b>printing</b> has increased rapidly in newspapers during the last decade. The offset printing process relies on the assumption that an uniform film of ink of right thickness is transferred onto the printing areas. The quality of reproduction of colour images in offset printing is dependent on a number of parameters in a chain of steps and in the end it is the amount and the distribution of ink deposited on the substrate that create the sensation and thus the perceived colours. We identify three control points in the offset printing process and present methods for assessing the printing process quality in two of these points: • Methods for determining if the printing plates carry the correct image • Methods for determining the amount of ink deposited onto the newsprint A new concept of colour impression is introduced as a measure of the amount of ink deposited on the newsprint. Two factors contribute to values of the colour impression, the halftone dot-size and ink density. Colour impression values are determined on gray-bars using a CCD-camera based system. Colour impression values can also be determined in an area containing an arbitrary combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks. The correct amount of ink is known either from a reference print or from prepress information. Thus, the deviation of the amount of ink can be determined that can be used as control value by a press operator or as input to a control system. How a closed loop controller can be designed based on the colour impression values is also shown. It is demonstrated that the methods developed can be used for off-line print quality monitoring and ink feed control, or preferably in an online system in a newspaper printing press.

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a common}} printing method in the packaging field. The printing method is characterized primarily by the flexible printing plate and the low viscosity inks which make it suitable for use on almost any substrate. The object {{of this study was}} to obtain further knowledge of the some important mechanisms of flexographic printing and how they influence the print quality. The thesis deals with printing primarily on board and liner but also on newsprint with water-borne ink using a full-scale flexographic central impression (CI) printing press. Several printing trials have been performed with a focus on the chemical interaction between the ink and substrate and the physical contact between the ink-covered printing plate and the substrate. <b>Multicolour</b> <b>printing</b> exposes the substrate to water from the water-containing ink. The emphasis was to investigate the relation between print quality and water-uptake of the paper surface with heat and water. Printing trials was carried out on substrates possessing a hydrophobic, and also a rather hydrophilic surface using a regular commercial water-borne ink. The favorable effect which water or surfactant solution had on the hydrophobic substrate with regard to print mottle could depend on its surface compressibility in combination with the hydrophobic nature of its surface that could affect the wetting properties. Conventional printing involves physical contact between plate and ink and between ink and substrate. A method for measuring the dynamic nip pressure using thin load cells is presented. Print quality was influenced by the plate material. A correction procedure taking into account the size of the sensor was developed in order to estimate the maximum dynamic pressure in the printing nip. An attempt was made to identify essential mechanical and chemical parameters, and also geometrical properties of the plate that affected print quality. Laboratory printing trials were carried out and a multivariate analysis was applied for evaluation of print quality data. The impact of the plate properties on print quality was evident. The essential properties of the plate that influence print quality were the small-scale roughness and long-scale roughness...|$|E
30|$|The {{extensive}} use of red is invariably cited as defining characteristic of Meiji prints. The dominant red in the nishiki-e <b>multicolour</b> <b>print</b> medium from its introduction in 1765 was safflower (natural red 26, benibana in Japanese), an ancient dye in Japan that was used on much wider scale in the Edo period as textile dye and for cosmetics [18, 19].|$|R

50|$|After the 1901 reorganization, the company’s {{name was}} changed to State Printing House. The state budget and its justification, the {{appropriation}} accounts, the important bills, the Financial Gazette and the time-tables of the Hungarian State Railways were printed in the State Printing House. Hungarian Royal Treasury Notes, different treasury bills, state promissory notes, annuity loan notes, class lottery tickets, blank bills, bills of lading of domestic and foreign freights and cigar and tobacco packaging materials and tax stamps were also produced there. The Hungarian government founded the Hungarian Banknote Printing House in 1922 which started domestic banknote printing in August 1923 in the buildings of the State Printing House. During World War II, the printing house served as a war factory producing food and fuel notes. After the war, the documents of the post and the railway were printed again as well as state forms, bonds and lottery tickets. For the 1945 election, State Printing House printed the election forms, later it produced the tax notes during the 1946 hyperinflation. The company has been producing lottery forms and tickets since 1947. Besides production of lottery forms and tickets, the production of election forms every four years also became stable part of the production portfolio. Due to the investment in 1957, the capacity was expanded and the quality improved, the production of <b>multicolour</b> <b>printed</b> stamps was started. In the 1960 the company began to print export stamps as well.|$|R

50|$|Although most work is {{executed}} throughout by one {{or another}} of the seven distinct processes mentioned above, combinations are frequently employed. Sometimes a pattern is printed partly by machine and partly by block, and sometimes a cylindrical block is used along with engraved copper-rollers in an ordinary printing machine. The block in this latter case is in all respects, except for shape, identical with a flat wood or coppered block, but, instead of being dipped in colour, it receives its supply from an endless blanket, one part of which works in contact with colour-furnishing rollers and the other part with the cylindrical block. This block is known as a surface or peg roller. Many {{attempts have been made to}} <b>print</b> <b>multicolour</b> patterns with surface rollers alone, but hitherto with little success, owing to their irregularity in action and to the difficulty of preventing them from warping. These defects are not present in the printing of linoleum in which opaque oil colours are used, colours that neither sink into the body of the hard linoleum nor tend to warp the roller.|$|R
