40|$|Brief physical-geographical characteristics, {{history of}} {{creation}} {{and development of the}} Mordovia State Nature Reserve territory are presented. We listed aims and objectives assigned for the Mordovia Reserve in different periods. During {{the first years of the}} Mordovia Reserve the forest conservation was aimed at reforestation of the southern area of the taiga zone; the investigation of harmful insect fauna to timely response on infection foci of trees; enriching of the fauna of the Reserve. At present, the Reserve should have an ecological-educational value in addition to the value of nature conservation. The article presents the modern period of scientific investigations and the development of the Mordovia Reserve territory. Also, it contains data on the species number of flora and fauna, including those listed in the Red Book of the Republic of Mordovia (2003, 2005) and of the Russian Federation (2001, 2008). Due to the geographical location on the border of three natural zones and a high degree of knowledge of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve, there are noted 344 macromycetes (including 1 species listed in the Red Book of Russian Federation, 15 species included in the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); 361 lichens (including 3 species included in the Red Book of Russia and 24 species from the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); more than 100 mosses (including 7 species from the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); 796 vascular plants (including 3 species from the IUCN list, 3 species included in the Red Book of Russian Federation and 46 species from the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); more than 4500 insects (including 11 species from the IUCN list, 11 species from the Red Book of Russian Federation and 53 species from the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); 32 fishes (including 1 species from the Red Book of Russian Federation and 11 species included in the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); 11 amphibians (including 4 species from the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the Red Book of the Republic of Mordovia); 7 reptiles (including 3 species from the Red Book of the Republic of Mordovia); 222 birds (including 2 species from the IUCN list, 20 species included in the Red Book of Russia, and 69 species from the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book); 65 mammals (including 1 species from the Red Book of Russian Federation and 23 species included in the <b>main</b> <b>list</b> of the regional Red Data Book).

5000|$|The Köchel catalogue, {{generally}} accepted as the definitive listing of Mozart's works, {{was published by}} Ludwig von Köchel in 1862, and has been revised and updated on several subsequent occasions. The original catalogue, known as K1, listed incomplete or lost works in an appendix or [...] "Anhang", without regard to chronological order. These works were identified by an [...] "Anh.", not a [...] "K" [...] number. In the last major revision of the catalogue (1964, K6), the Anhang was extended to include doubtful and spurious works. On {{the basis of the}} most recent research and discoveries, some of the old K1 Anhangs were promoted to [...] "K" [...] status, while others were relegated from the main catalogue into the K6 Anhang. However, as Zaslaw points out, the Köchel catalogue allocations between <b>main</b> <b>listing</b> and Anhang are not reliable indicators of authenticity or otherwise. Zaslaw deems some of the divisions [...] "arbitrary", and calls for [...] "clearer, more honest categories" [...] for the problematic works.|$|E
5000|$|Although TV48 {{was widely}} {{recognized}} as a pioneer of community-oriented LPTV, W48AP suffered initially in its bid for cable TV carriage, as the local cable systems did not generally grant LPTV stations space on their networks. This effectively relegated their signal to being viewed on [...] "second TVs" [...] and in the minority of households that did not subscribe to cable—which meant that getting advertising support was difficult. Exacerbating the difficulties posed by lack of cable carriage, the local newspaper (the Toledo Blade, whose owners, Block Communications, also own the local cable system) refused to publish TV listings for TV48. The station bought small ads in the Sunday TV listings booklet, but {{was not able to}} list their programming alongside the other stations in the <b>main</b> <b>listing</b> section. However, TV48 was able to secure a cable slot on April 24, 1989 on Buckeye Cablesystem, though on channel 29B (or [...] "B-29", as TV48 referred to it), away from the other local channels. Buckeye Cablesystem then responded by turning its local programming channel on 5A into a unique format, where it would be programmed as an independent station solely on cable, launching ToledoVision 5, which took programming inventory which would have usually ended up by default on W48AP.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shares of}} the DLC parents {{represent}} claims on exactly the same underlying cash flows. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the DLC parents should therefore move in lockstep. In practice, however, large differences from theoretical price parity can arise. For example, in the early 1980s Royal Dutch NV was trading at a discount of approximately 30% relative to Shell Transport and Trading PLC. In the academic finance literature, Rosenthal and Young (1990) and Froot and Dabora (1999) show that significant mispricing in three DLCs (Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever, and Smithkline Beecham) has existed {{over a long period}} of time. Both studies conclude that fundamental factors (such as currency risk, governance structures, legal contracts, liquidity, and taxation) are not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the price deviations. Froot and Dabora (1999) show that the relative prices of the twin stocks are correlated with the stock indices of the markets on which each of the twins has its <b>main</b> <b>listing.</b> For example, if the FTSE 100 rises relative to the AEX index (the Dutch stock market index) the stock price of Reed International PLC generally tends to rise relative to the stock price of Elsevier NV. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008) report similar effects for nine other DLCs. A potential explanation is that local market sentiment affects the relative prices of the {{shares of the}} DLC parent companies. Because of the absence of [...] "fundamental reasons" [...] for the mispricing, DLCs have become known as a textbook example of arbitrage opportunities, see for example Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2006, chapter 13).|$|E
