5000|$|After World War II, the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), {{which was}} {{established}} in Pittsburgh in the 19th century, proposed to move to New York City. Banker Richard King Mellon aimed to block the move. In 1949 he proposed a new downtown headquarters building for ALCOA (now the Regional Enterprise Tower). As a bonus, {{it would have a}} nearby underground parking garage capped by a public plaza: Mellon Square, built in 1953-55, designed by Mitchell & Ritchey, landscaped by Simonds & Simonds, and paid for by Mellon family foundations. The Mellon family through various foundations gave a total of $4 million ($ in [...] dollars) to help create the park, $3.5 million for property acquisition ($ in [...] dollars) and $500,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to build the parking garage and flora. [...] On September 28, 1953 Pittsburgh City Council officially renamed the block [...] "Mellon Square". Upon completion, Mellon gave the property to the City of Pittsburgh. Mellon Square is named in honor of Mellon's father and uncle, Richard Beatty Mellon (1858-1933) and Andrew Mellon (1855-1937). A dedication <b>marker</b> <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> level says the following: [...] "Mellon Square is dedicated to the memory of two brothers, Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon, their leadership, civic spirit and philanthropy advanced immeasurably the welfare of this community".The square is part of the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District, which received National Register of Historic Places status in 1985.|$|E

Those that reject the indirect object with para base their objections on two points: first on the impossibility of replacing that indirect object by the personal pronoun le/s and, second, because it can co-occur with an indirect object in a in the same sentence. These objections are rebutted with examples that prove that the pronoun le/s is not uniquely and exclusively associated with the indirect object and that the co-occurrence of both prepositional complements does not exclude the complement of para from being an indirect object. This study accepts para as an indirect object <b>marker</b> <b>on</b> the <b>grounds</b> that the contextual semantics and the contrastive syntactical structure sometimes admit an inter-functional border between indirect objects and adverbial phrase...|$|R
50|$|East Main Street Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Chesterfield, Chesterfield County, South Carolina. The district encompasses 20 contributing buildings and 1 contributing site reflecting {{the development of the}} town of Chesterfield from about 1798 to 1937.

40|$|The highly {{polymorphic}} {{system of}} serologically defined genetic <b>markers</b> <b>on</b> human IgG heavy chains (Gm allotypes) {{is second only}} to the HLA complex in terms of the large number of determinants, alleles, and haplotypes {{that can be used for}} analyses of disease associations and other genetic studies. However, present typing methods are based on the use of anti-Gm antisera that are derived mainly from fortuitously immunized human donors, often requiring processing before use, and must be used in a hemagglutination-inhibition assay that cannot be used in typing for isoallotypic determinants (currently termed "non-markers"). In studies presented here, we describe an allotyping system that utilizes monoclonal antibodies in a "sandwich" modification of the solid-phase radioimmunoassay, which is capable of reliable quantitative typing of allotypic, isoallotypic, and isotypic immunoglobulin determinants. We show that these highly reproducible, easily disseminated, and essentially inexhaustible reagents can be used for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative Gm typing. Using this system we define two previously unrecognized Gm determinants, one of which, found to date only in Caucasians, is different from all known Gm markers and thus defines previously unrecognized alleles and haplotypes. The other determinant co-segregates with the conventional G 3 m(b 1) marker but is distinct from that <b>marker</b> <b>on</b> serological <b>grounds.</b> The successful preparation of mouse monoclonal antibodies that detect human Gm allotypic differences and the development of an assay system capable of typing isoallotypic as well as allotypic determinants opens the way to further dissection and application of this rich genetic system...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} automated {{reconstruction of}} highly detailed 3 D models of urban areas for visualization and analysis {{is an active}} area of research for diverse applications ranging from surveillance to architecture. A flexible and cheap data source are wide-baseline image sequences generated with hand-held consumer cameras with several to tens of Megapixels. Image sequences are particularly suitable for the reconstruction of 3 D structures along linear objects such as roads. This paper presents an approach for 3 D reconstruction from image sequences taken with a weakly calibrated camera with no need for approximations for position and attitude, <b>markers</b> <b>on</b> the <b>ground,</b> or even ground control. The generated 3 D reconstruction result is relative, i. e., the scale is not known, but Euclidean, that is, right angles are preserved. The paper shows that the approach allows to produce a 3 D reconstruction consisting of points, camera positions and orientations, as well as vertically oriented planes from image sequences taken with a Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) under challenging wind conditions and without navigation information. Finally, the paper discusses how sequences can be linked into networks, or also images into blocks, clarifying which image configurations exist {{and how they can}} be adequately treated when prior knowledge about them is available...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{algorithm}} {{for the detection}} of circles from an image captured by a monocular omnidirectional camera system. We assume that an image captured by an omnidirectional camera system is normalised to a spherical image, the image on the unit sphere. Using this geometrical property of the omnidirectional images, we introduce a method for marker-based positioningand navigation of autonomous mobile robots which mounts a monocular omnidirectional camera system. We first clarify the geometric properties of the spherical image of a circle <b>marker</b> placed <b>on</b> the <b>ground</b> plane, and we show that, {{for the detection of}} a plane from circle markers, we are required to capture at least two coplanar circle markers. We prove that the image of a circle on the spherical image is a fourth-order algebraic curve, which is the intersection of a sphere and an oblique elliptic cone. For the detection of <b>marker</b> images <b>on</b> the spherical images, we introduce a method for transforming the detection of this fourth-order algebraic curve to the detection of a spatial conic, which is quadric. Second, we develop a voting method for the extraction of images of planar circle <b>markers</b> <b>on</b> a spherical image, using the spatial-quadric detection strategy. Finally, using the assumption for the geometrical configuration of the camera system and the circle <b>markers</b> <b>on</b> the plane on which the robot moves, we derive a positioningalgorithm. This positioningmethod for the robot mounting a monocular omnidirectional camera system allows us to navigate a robot using our circle-detection algorithm. We show some numerical examples both for synthetic and real images. 978 - 1 - 4244 - 1631 - 8 / 07 /$ 25. 00 © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Discourse {{structure}} and coherence relations {{are one of}} the main inferential challenges addressed by computational pragmatics. The present study focuses <b>on</b> discourse <b>markers</b> as key elements in guiding the inferences of the statements in natural language. Through a rule-based approach for the automatic identification, classification and annotation of the discourse markers in a multilingual parallel corpus (Arabic-Spanish-English), this research provides a valuable resource for the community. Two main aspects define the novelty of the present study. First, it offers a multilingual computational processing of discourse <b>markers,</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>on</b> a theoritical framework and implemented in a XML tagging scheme.

Our system allows using a mobile outdoor robot in areas that cannot be reached other than from the air and aerial measurements alone are not sufficient. For example a ground robot can perform in situ measurements and even take samples that can later be analyzed when the robot is returned by the aerial system. We use a helicopter UAV with a rotor diameter of 1. 8 m and a takeoff mass of 11 kg as a proof-of-concept platform. The UAV is equipped with our modular autopilot system. The real time control and navigation {{is done by the}} flight control computer. The target detection is done by the image processing computer connected to a downward looking camera. In addition to the autopilot payload the helicopter can carry an extra mass of around 2 kg. The ground robot we used had a mass of 1. 1 kg and is equipped with a GPS sensor and a communication system that is used to send its current position estimate to the UAV. The aerial system is using a high precision hover position controller and a multi-sensor fusion module which is used for detection and precise localization of the mobile robot. It combines GPS-based localization for obtaining an initial estimation of the ground robot location and a vision-system for its accurate localization. We use a known optical <b>marker</b> <b>on</b> the <b>ground</b> robot for its precise localization relative to the aerial system. All control and sensor processing and fusion are performed on board of the UAV. The docking system we developed is very similar to the probe-and-drogue aerial refueling system.
