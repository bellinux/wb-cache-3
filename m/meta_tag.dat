25|$|Unlike the {{keywords}} attribute, {{the description}} attribute {{is supported by}} most major search engines, like Yahoo! and Bing, while Google will fall back on this tag when information about the page itself is requested (e.g. using the related: query). The description attribute provides a concise explanation of a Web page's content. This allows the Web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content. The description is often, but not always, displayed on search engine results pages, so it can affect click-through rates. While clicks for a result can be a positive sign of effective title and description writing, Google does not recognize this meta element as a ranking factor, so using target keyword phrases in that element will not help a site rank better. W3C doesn't specify {{the size of this}} description <b>meta</b> <b>tag,</b> but almost all search engines recommend it to be shorter than 155 characters of plain text.|$|E

50|$|Web pages {{often include}} {{metadata}} {{in the form}} of <b>meta</b> <b>tags.</b> Description and keywords in <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> are commonly used to describe the Web page's content. Meta elements also specify page description, key words, authors of the document, and when the document was last modified. Web page metadata helps search engines and users to find the types of web pages they are looking for.|$|R

2500|$|No {{consensus}} exists {{whether or}} not the keywords attribute has any effect on ranking at any of the major search engines today. It is speculated that it does if the keywords used in the meta can also be found in the page copy itself. With respect to Google, thirty-seven leaders in search engine optimization concluded in April 2007 that the relevance of having keywords in the meta-attribute keywords is little to none and in September 2009 Matt Cutts of Google announced that they were no longer taking keywords into account whatsoever. [...] However, both these articles suggest that Yahoo! still makes use of the keywords <b>meta</b> <b>tag</b> in some of its rankings. [...] Yahoo! itself claims support for the keywords <b>meta</b> <b>tag</b> in conjunction with other factors for improving search rankings. In October 2009 Search Engine Round Table announced that [...] "Yahoo Drops The Meta Keywords Tag Also" [...] but later reported that the announcement made by Yahoo!'s Senior Director of Search was incorrect. In the corrected statement Yahoo! Senior Director of Search states that [...] "…What changed with Yahoo's ranking algorithms is that while we still index the meta keyword tag, the ranking importance given to meta keyword tags receives the lowest ranking signal in our system … it will actually have less effect than introducing those same words {{in the body of the}} document, or any other section." [...] In Sept 2012, Google announced that they will consider Keyword <b>Meta</b> <b>tag</b> for news publishers. Google said that this may help worthy content to get noticed. [...] The syntax of the news meta keyword has subtle difference from custom keyword meta tag; it is denoted by [...] "news_keywords", while the custom keyword <b>meta</b> <b>tag</b> is denoted by [...] "keywords".|$|E
2500|$|In the past, the PageRank {{shown in}} the Toolbar was easily manipulated. Redirection from one page to another, either via a HTTP 302 {{response}} or a [...] "Refresh" [...] <b>meta</b> <b>tag,</b> caused the source page to acquire the PageRank of the destination page. Hence, a new page with PR 0 and no incoming links could have acquired PR 10 by redirecting to the Google home page. This spoofing technique was a known vulnerability. Spoofing can generally be detected by performing a Google search for a source URL; if the URL of an entirely different site is displayed in the results, the latter URL may represent the destination of a redirection.|$|E
2500|$|For {{dynamically}} created web pages, Google proposes {{the above}} <b>meta</b> <b>tag</b> which causes fragment URLs (ones {{that look like}} [...] "http://www.url.com/#xyz" [...] ) to be rewritten and recrawled as [...] "ugly URLs" [...] (i.e. ones looking like [...] "http://www.url.com/?_escaped_fragment_=xyz" [...] ). [...] See [...] for more details about the rewriting process. [...] This rewrite step is {{a signal to the}} web site to please provide a simple and full HTML web page that is the result of executing the AJAX or other scripting on the page. [...] This allows Google and other search engines to collect and index static web pages even when a web page is dynamically created and updated by the browser.|$|E

The statistics sample consists of 291 pages of various pages of Shahed university webpages. The results showed that the web designers of Shahed University have used more <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> (mean 168. 2 presence in webpages). However, in none of the pages reviewed, metadata standards are not present. Considering the antiquity of <b>meta</b> <b>tags,</b> little Attention in the <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> and metadata can be caused by a lack of accurate understanding of the structures and importance of this elements in the process of indexing and organizing content by designers. Therefore, the use of information science experts' opinions that are aware of metadata standards and advantages of using them is recommended in designing and editing webpages...|$|R
50|$|Keyword {{stuffing}} is {{a search}} engine optimization (SEO) technique, considered webspam or spamdexing, in which a web page is loaded with keywords in the <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> or in content of a web page {{in an attempt to}} gain an unfair rank advantage in search engines. Keyword stuffing may lead to a website being banned or penalized on major search engines either temporarily or permanently. The repetition of words in <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> may explain why many search engines no longer use these tags.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the extent of}} {{utilization}} of two <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> – “keywords” and “descriptors” – in Web-based Open-Access Journals. A sample composed of 707 journals taken from DOAJ was used. These were analyzed on the account of utilization of the said <b>meta</b> <b>tags.</b> Findings demonstrated that these journals utilized “keywords” and “descriptors” meta-tags, 33. 1 % and 29. 9 % respectively. It was further demonstrated that among various subject classifications, “General Journals” had been the highest while “Mathematics and Statistics Journals” had the least utilization as “keywords” meta-tags. Moreover, “General Journals” and “Chemistry journals”, with 55. 6 % and 15. 4 % utilization respectively, had the highest and the lowest “descriptors” meta-tag usage rate. Based on our findings, and when compared against other similar research findings, {{there had been no}} significant growth experienced in utilization of these <b>meta</b> <b>tags...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Google {{does not}} use HTML keyword or <b>meta</b> <b>tag</b> {{elements}} for indexing. The Director of Research at Google, Monika Henzinger, was quoted (in 2002) as saying, [...] "Currently we don't trust metadata because we are afraid of being manipulated." [...] Other search engines developed techniques to penalize Web sites considered to be [...] "cheating the system". For example, a Web site repeating the same meta keyword several times may have its ranking decreased by a search engine trying to eliminate this practice, though that is unlikely. It {{is more likely that}} a search engine will ignore the meta keyword element completely, and most do regardless of how many words are used in the element.|$|E

5000|$|They {{have been}} the focus of a field of {{marketing}} research known as search engine optimization (SEO), where different methods are used to provide a user's website with a higher ranking on search engines. Prior to the rise of content-analysis by search engines in the mid-1990s (most notably Google), search engines were reliant on meta data to correctly classify a Web page and webmasters quickly learned the commercial significance of having the right meta element. The search engine community is now divided as to the value of <b>meta</b> <b>tags.</b> Some claim they have no value, others that they are central, while many simply conclude there is no clear answer but, since they do no harm, they use them just in case. Google state they do support for the <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> [...] "content", [...] "robots", [...] "google", [...] "google-site-verification", [...] "content-type", [...] "refresh" [...] and [...] "google-bot." [...] Major search engine robots look at many factors when determining how to rank a page of which <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> will only form a portion.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was aimed {{to study the}} scope of presence of Dublin Core metadata elements and HTML <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> in web pages. Ninety web pages were chosen by searching general search engines (Google, Yahoo and MSN). The scope of metadata elements (Dublin Core and HTML <b>Meta</b> <b>tags)</b> present in these pages as well as existence of a significant correlation between presence of meta elements and type of search engines were investigated. Findings indicated very low presence of both Dublin Core metadata elements and HTML <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> in the pages retrieved which in turn illustrates the very low usage of meta data elements in web pages. Furthermore, findings indicated {{that there are no}} significant correlation between the type of search engine used and presence of metadata elements.

Another well-used technique is to use the services of Search Engine Optimization (SEO - optimization service sites for the results of search engines) is to conduct a responsible strategy to improve the presentation of a page available on the Web. The proposal of this work was verify the efficiency of <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> in information retrieval procedures applied in the electronic journals in information science by search engines. We developed a quantitative survey, which covered the four major search engines, Google, Bing, Yahoo and Ask, where <b>meta</b> <b>tags</b> was inserted in the search engines and query results tabulated and compared.
