5|$|Adults {{interested}} in Scouting or Guiding, including former Scouts and Guides, often join {{organizations such as}} the International Scout and Guide Fellowship. In the United States and the Philippines, university students <b>might</b> join the co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.

5|$|Alternatively, prey animals <b>might</b> be {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators <b>might</b> learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E
5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event <b>might</b> be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn <b>might</b> be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn <b>might</b> be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism <b>might</b> be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators <b>might</b> also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|As a philologist, Tolkien's {{interest}} in languages {{led him to}} invent several languages of his own as a pastime. In considering the nature of who <b>might</b> speak these languages, and what stories they <b>might</b> tell, Tolkien again turned {{to the concept of}} elves.|$|E
5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade <b>might</b> bring great prosperity {{to the country and}} that more power <b>might</b> be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or {{in the company of a}} few other vessels, traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which <b>might,</b> like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing <b>might</b> suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes <b>might</b> suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, <b>might</b> give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance <b>might</b> include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which <b>might</b> suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of the}} negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and <b>might</b> also be a feature of severe depression or dementia.

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense.

Lower down in society boys <b>might</b> be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls <b>might</b> go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this <b>might</b> be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E

5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause <b>might</b> permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government <b>might</b> be able to charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause <b>might</b> permit the government to encourage potential jurors {{to move into the}} Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government <b>might</b> argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
