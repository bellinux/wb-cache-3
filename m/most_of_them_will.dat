500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} success, [...] "We Are the World" [...] received {{mixed reviews}} from journalists, music critics {{and the public}} following its release. American journalist Greil Marcus felt that the song sounded like a Pepsi jingle. He wrote, [...] "... the constant repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, {{on the part of}} Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity." [...] Marcus added, [...] "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi—and the true result will likely be less that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest." [...] Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and expressed the opinion that the line [...] "We're saving our own lives" [...] was a [...] "distasteful element of self-indulgence". He asserted that the artists of USA for Africa were proclaiming [...] "their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> never encounter".|$|E

In this article, Knox focuses on the differentiation between those with “mental aberration” or active insanity, versus those “mental defectives” classified as “morons and constitutional inferior types.” It was during this time that Alfred Binet was publishing his research on intelligence testing. In this JAMA article, Knox draws reference to Binet’s research {{and the development of}} intelligence tests during the time. He pointed out that although intelligence tests can differentiate the less intelligent, less well developed class of people, if administered to individuals from another culture or country, the individuals might be incorrectly classified as morons. He wrote, “if these peasants are questioned about conditions existing in the land from which they come, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> show average intelligence” ...|$|E
