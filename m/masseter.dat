5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep <b>masseter,</b> making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial <b>masseter</b> muscles and smaller deep <b>masseter</b> muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} ocular {{disorders}} (OD) in pathogenesis of MMp {{is still}} a controversal issue. Ocular arc reflexes (OAR) may involve changes in head and neck posture and generate modifications of contraction resulting in muscle contraction and finally weakness. sEMG tests were performed on 28 patients (13 with masticatory muscles pain and myopia/ 15 healthy) in rest position with eyes open and eyes closed. Patients group control (healthy patients) showed no significance difference in sEMG record in open/close test. In non healthy patients there were great differences between the sEMG recordings with eyes closed and open. Temporalis and <b>masseters</b> showed a statistical difference of means activation in two tests (temporalis p = 0. 0010; <b>masseters</b> = 0. 0006). Great difference there was in means muscles activation between open eyes healthy test and non healthy. No difference in close eyes test was evaluated in temporalis and <b>masseters</b> close test in the two groups. The exact causes of MMp are still unknown. The role how ocular disorders (OD) may {{play an important role}} in pathogenesis of MMp is still a controversal issue.

50|$|Its {{powerful}} jaws, {{combined with}} the specialised dentition, strongly suggest that Necromantis was a carnivore, feeding primarily on other vertebrates. The shearing teeth and strong <b>masseters</b> suggest {{that it was more}} specialised to grind and crush flesh and bone than other bat species. In particular, the angular process of the dentary implies that crushing force was much more important than the width of gape, unlike modern predatory bats.|$|R
25|$|Fractures of the mandibular {{body are}} defined as those that involve a region bounded {{anteriorly}} by the parasymphysis (defined as a vertical line just distal to the canine tooth) and posteriorly by the anterior border of the <b>masseter</b> muscle.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} bruxism will {{experience}} no pain. The presence or degree of pain {{does not necessarily}} correlate with the severity of grinding or clenching. The pain in the muscles of mastication caused by bruxism can be likened to muscle pain after exercise. The pain may be felt over {{the angle of the}} jaw (<b>masseter)</b> or in the temple (temporalis), and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw. Most (but not all) bruxism includes clenching force provided by <b>masseter</b> and temporalis muscle groups; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only, which involves minimal action of the <b>masseter</b> and temporalis muscles. The temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful, which is usually felt {{just in front of the}} ear, or inside the ear itself. Clicking of the jaw joint may also develop. The forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle, and so inflammation may result. A tooth may become sore to bite on, and further, tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity, e.g. to cold stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandible}} {{is moved}} primary {{by the four}} muscles of mastication: the <b>masseter,</b> medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid and the temporalis. These four muscles, all innervated by V3, or the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, work in different groups to move the mandible in different directions. Contraction of the lateral pterygoid acts to pull the disc and condyle forward within the glenoid fossa and down the articular eminence; thus, action of this muscle serves to protrude the jaw, it with assistance of gravity and the digastricus muscle also opens the jaw. The other three muscles close the mouth; the <b>masseter</b> and the medial pterygoid by pulling up {{the angle of the}} mandible and the temporalis by pulling up on the coronoid process of the mandible.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Muscular {{hyperactivity}} is {{a potential}} source of symptoms in patients with temporal-mandibular disorders. An adequate occlusal adjustment may relieve such symptoms. This study aims to measure the effect of shortening the protrusive disclusion time (DT) and balancing the center of occlusal forces (COF) on the EMG recordings and assess the pain reported by chronic patients {{one month after the}} computer-guided occlusal adjustment. Study Design: The sample studied comprised 34 patients suffering from chronic facial pain in which the EMG activity of both <b>masseters</b> was recorded by electromyography. By selective grinding we alleviated all the occlusal interferences during the mandibular protrusion from the habitual closure position in order to establish an immediate posterior disclusion and an equilibration of the COF. Results: At follow-up 76. 5 % of the patients reported no facial pain. Moreover, the EMG activity and protrusive DT were significantly reduced, and occlusal and muscular function were significantly more symmetric than at baseline. Conclusions: According to this EMG study, this computer-guided occlusal adjustment is able to reduce the activity of the <b>masseters</b> and the self-reported muscular pain of patients one-month after treatment...|$|R

The linear correlation between trichinoscopy and artificial digestion was very high and significant (r- 0. 94, p< 0. 0001), showing that both methods for the detection of muscular larvae did not differ significantly.

25|$|In 1962, Carleton S. Coon {{said that}} one of the reasons that Mongoloids have flatter faces than Caucasoids is due to the <b>masseter</b> and temporalis jaw muscles in the faces of Mongoloids being {{positioned}} more toward the front of the faces of Mongoloids relative to where these jaw muscles are positioned in the faces of Caucasoids.|$|E
25|$|The wombat's incisors {{resemble}} those of rodents, and its molars are widely spaced by the palate. The teeth keep growing for {{the entirety of the}} animalâs life, which is likely an adaptation to its harsh diet. Compared to the common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger temporalis muscle and a smaller <b>masseter</b> muscle. Also, unlike the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombatâs nasal bone is longer than the frontal bone.|$|E
5000|$|As {{noted by}} most researchers, Necromantis is unique among extinct and extant bats {{due to the}} sheer {{robustness}} of its jaws and skull. Its jaws are rather short and broad, bearing proportionally large teeth. The mandible is deep and thick and bears deep fossae; combined {{with the presence of}} a wide zygoma and a high-positioned condyle, it suggests that Necromantis had large, well developed <b>masseters.</b> The teeth themselves are strongly convergent with those of carnivoran mammals, bearing carnassial-like M1 and M2. The sagittal crest was tall, though less so than some other carnivorous bats like Vampyrum spectrum or Macroderma gigas ...|$|R

50|$|Members of Carnivora have a {{characteristic}} skull shape with relatively large brains {{encased in a}} heavy skull. The skull has a highly developed zygomatic arch just behind the maxilla (common to all mammals and their cynodont forebears), and they have ossified external auditory bullae. Feloidea have a two-chambered auditory bulla. In addition to allowing extra room for the passage of muscles to work the lower jaw, the zygomatic arch also allows for differentiation of separate muscle groups {{to be involved in}} biting and chewing. <b>Masseters</b> attach from the dentary (specifically, the masseteric fossa) to the zygomatic arch and onto the maxilla in front of the arch, providing crushing force. The temporalis attaches from the dentary (specifically, the coronoid process) {{to the side of the}} braincase, providing torque about the axis of jaw articulation.|$|R
25|$|Some bruxism {{activity}} is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths {{of a second}} (like chewing), and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (clenching). Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements. Bruxism can also {{be regarded as a}} disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of muscles. This typically involves the <b>masseter</b> muscle and the anterior portion of the temporalis (the large outer muscles that clench), and the lateral pterygoids, relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased <b>masseter</b> and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audioâvideo recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscles of}} {{mastication}} (the temporalis, <b>masseter,</b> medial and lateral pterygoid muscles) are paired {{on either side}} and work together to move the mandible, which hinges and slides around its dual articulation with the skull at the temporomandibular joints. Some of the muscles work to elevate the mandible (close the mouth), and others also are involved in lateral (side to side), protrusive or retractive movements. Mastication (chewing) is a complex neuromuscular activity that can be controlled either by subconscious processes or by conscious processes. In individuals without bruxism or other parafunctional activities, during wakefulness the jaw is generally at rest and the teeth are not in contact, except while speaking, swallowing or chewing. It is estimated that the teeth are in contact for less than 20 minutes per day, mostly during chewing and swallowing. Normally during sleep, the voluntary muscles are inactive due to physiologic motor paralysis, and the jaw is usually open.|$|E
30|$|Indeed, {{numerous}} {{clinical observations}} {{have demonstrated the}} unequivocal contribution of the tongue {{in the development of}} jaw morphology[5, 8, 10, 15]. It is well known that only when there is a balance between the intraoral and extraoral muscles will there be harmonious dentoalveolar development and correct tooth eruption. Every muscular dysfunction, whether incorrect lingual posture (e.g. low tongue position, tongue thrusting, abnormal swallowing patterns) or perioral muscle contraction, can generate abnormal dentoalveolar changes[26 â 31]. Swimming is a symmetrical sport, and this ensures balanced and symmetrical development and muscle trophism throughout the body. Clinical experience shows that weak facial muscles in hyperdivergent patients, combined with oral breathing, generate open bite and crossbite, while hypodivergent patients are characterized by strong <b>masseters,</b> deep bite and retrusion of both the upper and lower alveolar bones[1, 15, 32 â 35].|$|R
40|$|Porcine {{cysticercosis}} {{is emerging}} as a serious agricultural and public health problem in African countries. A study on the prevalence and morphometric of porcine cysticercosis was conducted at post mortem using palpation and incision technique of routine meat inspection. Out of the 247 slaughter pigs examined at post mortem, 8 (3. 2 %) were infected and of this number 5 (2. 7 %) were males and 3 (5. 1 %) were females. Infection was {{more common in the}} Hampshire breed 7 (3. 5 %), than the black Ashanti 1 (3. 3 %). The Landrace breed had no infection. A total of 760 cysts were removed from infected animals. Out of this number, 261 (34. 3 %) were removed from the shoulder muscle, 189 (24. 9 %) from the <b>masseters,</b> 176 (23. 2 %) from the tongue and 134 (17. 3 %) were removed from the heart respectively. 5 (0. 65 %) of the cyst were matured and 755 (99. 34 %) were immature. A total of 632 (83. 2 %) were viable while 128 (16. 8 %) were non-viable. Cyst morphometry indicated an overall mean Â± SD (range) of 8. 8 Â± 1. 0 (5 - 12) by 5. 4 Â± 1. 1 (3 - 7) mm. Cysts from the shoulder had a mean Â± SD (range) (length x breadth in mm) of 7. 6 Â± 8. 7 (5 - 11) by 4. 4 Â± 8. 8 (3 - 6) while those from the <b>masseters</b> were 7. 8 Â± 6. 9 (6 - 12) by 4. 7 Â± 3. 8 (4 - 6), tongue 8. 7 Â± 2. 9 (6 - 12) by 5. 7 Â± 2. 6 (4 - 6), and heart 8. 6 Â± 3. 5 (5 - 12) by 5. 3 Â± 3. 7 (3 - 7).

50|$|In {{comparing}} the skulls of carnivores and herbivores, {{it can be}} seen that the shearing force of the temporalis is somewhat more important to carnivores, which have more room on the braincase (this is not unrelated to carnivoran intelligence) and commonly develop a sagittal crest (running from posterior to anterior on the skull), providing yet additional room for temporalis attachment. Carnivoran jaws can only move on a vertical axis, in an up-and-down motion, and cannot move from side-to-side. The jaw joint in carnivores tends to lie within the plane of tooth occlusion, an arrangement that further emphasizes shearing (as in a pair of scissors). In herbivores, the crushing force of the <b>masseters</b> is relatively more important than is shearing. The jaw joint is generally well above the plane of tooth occlusion, allowing extra room for masseteric attachment on the dentary and causing the rotation of the lower jaw to be translated into straight-ahead crushing force between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.|$|R
25|$|Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis/atrophy by {{inhibition}} of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions. Botox injections {{are used in}} bruxism {{on the theory that}} a dilute solution of the toxin will partially paralyze the muscles and lessen their ability to forcefully clench and grind the jaw, while aiming to retain enough muscular function to enable normal activities such as talking and eating. This treatment typically involves five or six injections into the <b>masseter</b> and temporalis muscles, and less often into the lateral pterygoids (given the possible risk of decreasing the ability to swallow) taking a few minutes per side. The effects may be noticeable by the next day, and they may last for about three months. Occasionally, adverse effects may occur, such as bruising, but this is quite rare. The dose of toxin used depends upon the person, and a higher dose may be needed in people with stronger muscles of mastication. With the temporary and partial muscle paralysis, atrophy of disuse may occur, meaning that the future required dose may be smaller or the length of time the effects last may be increased.|$|E
25|$|In the vipers, {{which have}} the most highly {{developed}} venom delivery apparatus, the venom gland is very large and is surrounded by the <b>masseter</b> or temporal muscle, which consists of two bands, the superior arising from behind the eye, the inferior extending from the gland to the mandible. A duct carries venom from the gland to the fang. In vipers and elapids, this groove is completely closed, forming a hypodermic needle-like tube. In other species, the grooves are not covered, or only partially covered. From the anterior extremity of the gland, the duct passes below the eye and above the maxillary bone, to the basal orifice of the venom fang, which is ensheathed in a thick fold of mucous membrane. By means of the movable maxillary bone hinged to the prefrontal bone and connected with the transverse bone which is pushed forward by muscles set in action by {{the opening of the}} mouth, the fang is erected and the venom discharged through the distal orifice. When the snake bites, the jaws close and the muscles surrounding the gland contract, causing venom to be ejected via the fangs.|$|E
500|$|The skulls {{of bears}} are massive, {{providing}} anchorage for the powerful <b>masseter</b> and temporal jaw muscles. The canine teeth are large but mostly used for display, and the molar teeth flat and crushing. Unlike most {{other members of}} the Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter. Considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species. This may indicate bears are {{still in the process of}} evolving from a mainly meat-eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved carnassial-like cheek teeth, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory.

50|$|People {{with the}} {{syndrome}} typically develop {{symptoms of the}} illness at a young age, usually between {{the age of six}} and fifteen years old. The initial symptoms are muscle spasms in the legs and alopecia, also known as baldness. The spasms are painful and progressive and their frequency varies from 1 or 2 to 100 per day, each lasting a few minutes. It can be sufficiently severe to produce abnormal posturing of the affected limbs, particularly the thumbs. With progression the illness involves the pectoral girdle and trunk muscles and finally the <b>masseters</b> and temporal muscles. The spasms usually spare the facial muscles. Severe spasms can interfere with respiration and speech. During an attack-free period, non-stimulus-sensitive myoclonus can occur in the arms, legs and neck. Diarrhea occurs in the first 2-3 years with intolerance to carbohydrate and high glucose diets. Endocrinopathy manifests as amenorrhea and hypoplasia of the uterus. Affected children fail to attain height after 10-12 years of age.|$|R

Horse offals (i. e. liver and kidneys) contained a significantly greater amount of humidity (p < 0, 001) and lower raw protein, raw fat, raw ashes and non nitrogen extracts (p < 0, 001). The metabolism of liver tissue energy was 656, 05 kJ/ 100 g, i. e. 72, 8 kJ {{less than that of}} muscles. The metabolic energy of kidney tissue amounted to 445, 01 kJ/ 100 g, it being 238, 84 kJ less than that of the cheek muscle and 211, 04 kJ less than in the liver. Active acidity (pH) was changing more intensively than in the liver, rather than in muscles or kidneys. The lowest pH in liver was recorded 5 days after the slaughter and stood at 5, 72, in muscles this value was the lowest 3 days after the slaughter with a similar value to the former â 5, 83. Kidneys had the highest acidity during {{the last days of the}} analysis, amounting to 6, 43. The total amount of biogenic amines in kidneys was significantly higher than in liver or muscle tissue (p < 0, 001). The total biogenic amines content in kidneys was 6825, 84 Â± 23. 00 mg/kg 5 days after the slaughter and 7678, 63 Â± 78, 73 mg/kg 10 days after the slaughter, i. e. 19 times more than the liver (402, 96 Â± 40, 29 mg/kg) and 5, 2 times more than in <b>masseters</b> (1476, 35 Â± 150, 63 mg/kg). The biggest amount of milk fat L+ in muscles was 3 days after the slaughter, in liver â 10 days after, and in kidneys â 3 days after. We determined that the biggest amount of the milk fat isomer D (-) was present 5 days after the slaughter in liver...|$|R
40|$|Two direct {{methods for}} the {{diagnosis}} of trichinellosis were compared: trichinoscopy and artificial digestion. Muscles from 17 wistar rats, orally infected with 500 Trichinella spiralis encysted larvae were examined. From {{each of the following}} muscles: diaphragm, tongue, <b>masseters,</b> intercostals, triceps brachialis and cuadriceps femoralis, 648, 440 larvae from 1 g samples were recovered. The linear cor-relation between trichinoscopy and artificial digestion was very high and significant (r= 0. 94, p< 0. 0001), showing that both methods for the detection of muscular larvae did not differ significantly. In both methods, significant differences were found in the distribution of larvae per gramme of muscle. Key words: trichinellosis- diagnosis- trichinoscopy- artificial digestion Trichinellosis is a parasitic zoonosis which causes human infection in Argentina. During the last five years, an important increase of clinical cases has been detected (Larrieu 1981, Nader et al. 1986, Brusolini & Gore 1992). Most of the cases were associated with the consumption of pork meat subproducts. In Argentina two methods of diagnosis are used: trichinoscopy and artificial digestion; both meth-ods allowing a direct observation of the larvae encysted in the skeletal muscles. Trichinoscopy is the primary method, even though, it is considered less sensitive than artificial digestion. Fifteen or more larvae per gramme of muscle, are considered necessary for detection using trichinoscopy, whereas, artificial digestion only requires four lar-vae per gramme (Ruitenberg & Kampelmache...|$|R
