5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class midget {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation against US battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor. The navy hoped that upgrades to the submarines, intensified crew training, and {{the selection of a}} less well defended target would lead to better results and an increased chance of the crews of the midgets to return alive from their mission. Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> operation.|$|E
5|$|Velebit (pennant number P-01) was a {{modified}} Una-class <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> {{and the only}} submarine to see service with the Croatian Navy. It was built for the Yugoslav Navy during the 1980s where it was named Soča. At {{the outbreak of the}} Croatian War of Independence Soča was being overhauled in the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata division of Brodosplit shipyard in Split, Croatia. Although stripped of all equipment, it was preserved from the retreating Yugoslav forces by the shipyard workers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Battleship Row and the island's naval field, the fixed moorings {{on the western}} side of Ford Island (capable of securing battleships or aircraft carriers) were high-priority targets. Just west of the island, the seaplane tender Curtiss was hit by a crashing dive bomber, a bomb and fragments of another bomb. She was then unsuccessfully attacked by a Japanese <b>midget</b> <b>submarine,</b> which fired a torpedo before being sunk by the destroyer Monaghan. Hangar 6 and several patrol seaplanes and other aircraft on Ford Island (33 out of 70 of the island's planes) were destroyed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Midget</b> <b>{{submarine}}s</b> {{have also}} seen some use in support roles. X-craft were used for reconnaissance, and the Seehund was used to carry supplies. A number of modern <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> have also been built for submarine rescue.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Navy {{has used}} {{a number of}} <b>midget</b> <b>submarines.</b> Most were {{developed}} during the Second World War. The decommissioning of the Stickleback class {{marked the end of}} <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> designed for combat in the Royal Navy.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the air campaign, {{a small number of}} Australians took part in special operations ahead of the invasion. In January 1944, RANVR officer Lieutenant Ken Hudspeth, who commanded the <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> , transported a party of specialist personnel to inspect and collect soil samples from French beaches being considered for the invasion. This operation was successful, and earned Hudspeth his second Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Nancy Wake, an Australian serving with the British Special Operations Executive, was parachuted into France in April 1944 and subsequently helped to organise the French Resistance in the Auvergne region.|$|E
5|$|The main {{impact of}} the <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> attack and {{subsequent}} operations was psychological; dispelling any belief that Sydney was immune to Japanese attack and highlighting Australia's proximity to the Pacific War. There was no official inquiry into the attacks, despite demand from some sections of the media, as there was concern that an inquiry would lead to defeatism and reduce faith in John Curtin's government, particularly after the damaging inquiry into Australian defences that had followed the Japanese aerial attack on Darwin three months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> {{attacks and}} {{subsequent}} bombardments {{are among the}} best-known examples of Axis naval activity in Australian waters during World War II, and are the only occasion in history when either city has come under attack. The physical effects were slight: the Japanese had intended to destroy several major warships, but sank only an unarmed depot ship and failed to damage any significant targets during the bombardments. The main impact was psychological; creating popular fear of an impending Japanese invasion and forcing the Australian military to upgrade defences, including the commencement of convoy operations to protect merchant shipping.|$|E
50|$|On 12 January 1945, three Japanese <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> {{entered the}} harbor, and the ships {{spent the day}} dodging coral heads trying to ferret out the elusive little submarines. One of the <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> was sunk; the other two escaped.|$|R
50|$|In the Black Sea, the Italian {{flotilla}} of five CB-class <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> {{was seized}} by Romanian naval authorities, and despite strong German protest, the Romanian naval commander, Rear Admiral Horia Macellariu, stood his ground and the five <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> remained a new addition to the Royal Romanian Navy.|$|R
50|$|The Stickleback class <b>submarines</b> were <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> of the Royal Navy {{initially}} ordered as improved {{versions of}} the older XE class submarines. They were designed to allow British defences to practice defending against <b>midget</b> <b>submarines</b> since it was theorised that the Soviets had or could develop such craft.|$|R
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1941 in the artillery. He was sent to Warwick Farm, then on the western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for training. A non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military discipline. In May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his wife. As a result, he was missing when a Japanese <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, which never materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he did work in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia was {{remote from}} the main battlefronts, there was {{considerable}} Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.|$|E

Boats on display include Coastal Motor Boat 4, built by Thornycroft in 1916. She saw action during the Baltic campaign of 1918–19, and her commander Lieutenant Augustus Agar won the Victoria Cross for sinking the Russian cruiser Oleg on 17 June 1919. Other vessels include the Vosper {{motor torpedo boat}} MTB-71, acquired from the British Military Powerboat Trust in 2005, {{an example of an}} X-Craft <b>midget</b> <b>submarine,</b> and a wartime Royal National Lifeboat Institution boat, the Jesse Lumb which was stationed at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. A variety of naval aircraft are on display, including a de Havilland Sea Vixen, Sea Venom, and Sea Vampire, and a Westland Wasp helicopter which was embarked on the frigate HMS Apollo during the Falklands War.|$|E

5|$|The main {{flaw in the}} Japanese plans {{was the use of}} midget {{submarines}} for {{the primary}} attack. Midget submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions: they would be released from modified seaplane carriers to run amok through the enemy fleet. This concept went out of favour as changing Japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around carrier-supported aerial combat. As a result, the midget program's focus changed to the infiltration of enemy harbours, where they would attack vessels at anchor. This concept failed completely during the attack on Pearl Harbor, where the midgets had no effect, and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> attacks on Sydney and Diego Suarez proved a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Japanese surface fleet the IJN {{deployed}} submarines to disrupt Allied supply lines by attacking shipping off the Australian east coast. This campaign began with an unsuccessful <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> raid on Sydney Harbour on the night of 31 May 1942. Following this attack, Japanese submarines operated along the Australian east coast until August 1942, sinking eight merchant ships. The submarine offensive resumed in January 1943 and continued until June during which time a further 15ships were sunk off the east coast. The 1943 sinkings included the hospital ship Centaur, which was torpedoed off Queensland on 14 May with the loss of 268lives. The Japanese did not conduct further submarine attacks against Australia after June 1943 as their submarines were needed to counter Allied offensives elsewhere in the Pacific. A single German submarine, U-862, operated in the Pacific Ocean during the war, cruising off the Australian coast and New Zealand in December 1944 and January 1945. It sank two ships in Australian waters before returning to Batavia.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{repeatedly}} attacked Tirpitz at Kaafjord from September 1943 until August 1944. On 23 September 1943, {{the crews}} of two British midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around the battleship during Operation Source, and placed explosive {{charges in the}} water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, putting her out of service for six months. Further <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> attacks were not considered feasible, and an air raid designated Operation Tungsten was conducted by Royal Navy aircraft carriers on 3 April 1944 as repairs to the battleship neared completion. Tirpitz did not suffer heavy damage in this operation, but was out of action for several more months while repairs were completed. The Home Fleet sortied to attack Kaafjord on a further four occasions between April and July; all but the last of these operations were frustrated by bad weather, and the Operation Mascot raid on 17 July did not inflict any damage on Tirpitz. Four more carrier attacks targeting Tirpitz were undertaken between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but again resulted in only minor damage to the battleship.|$|E

5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a major threat}} to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re-enter service. Another <b>midget</b> <b>submarine</b> attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord, and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated Operation Tungsten, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on Tirpitzs superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, placed a priority on returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys.|$|E
