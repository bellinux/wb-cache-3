A 20 in. diameter double arch lightweight mirror previously fabricated was modified to use a new mount configuration. This mount concept was developed and fabricated. The mounting concept of the double mounting mirror is outlined. The modifications made to the mirror, fabrication of the mirror mount, and room temperature testing of the mirror and mount and the extension of the mirror and mount concept to a full size (40 in. diameter) primary mirror for SIRTF are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lightweight {{and high}} {{resolution}} mirrors {{are needed for}} future space-based X-ray telescopes to achieve advances in high-energy astrophysics. The slumped <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> technology in development at NASA GSFC aims to build X-ray mirror modules with an area to mass ratio of approx. 17 sq cm/kg at 1 keV and a resolution of 10 arc-sec Half Power Diameter (HPD) or better at an affordable cost. As the technology nears the performance requirements, additional engineering effort is needed to ensure the modules are compatible with space-flight. This paper describes Flight Mirror Assembly (FMA) designs for several X-ray astrophysics missions studied by NASA and defines generic driving requirements and subsequent verification tests necessary to advance technology readiness for mission implementation. The requirement to perform X-ray testing in a horizontal beam, based on the orientation of existing facilities, is particularly burdensome on the mirror technology, necessitating mechanical over-constraint of the mirror segments and stiffening of the modules {{in order to prevent}} self-weight deformation errors from dominating the measured performance. This requirement, in turn, drives the mass and complexity of the system while limiting the testable angular resolution. Design options for a vertical X-ray test facility alleviating these issues are explored. An alternate mirror and module design using kinematic constraint of the mirror segments, enabled by a vertical test facility, is proposed. The kinematic mounting concept has significant advantages including potential for higher angular resolution, simplified mirror integration, and relaxed thermal requirements. However, it presents new challenges including low vibration modes and imperfections in kinematic constraint. Implementation concepts overcoming these challenges are described along with preliminary test and analysis results demonstrating the feasibility of kinematically <b>mounting</b> slumped <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> segments...|$|R

Recent improvements to the ARC Cryogenic Optics Test Facility are described. The purposes of the tests were to determine: (1) how <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> would perform at cryogenic temperatures compared with metal mirrors and (2) how various mirror mounts would affect the cryogenic performance of mirrors. Details of a cryogenic test of a 50 cm 'double arch', fused-silica mirror with a three-point mount and with a radially-compliant, flexured mount are given. Within {{the accuracy of the}} measurements, it was determined that the flexured mount did not induce appreciable distortion in the double arch mirror. Results of the cryogenic tests of a number of <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> and two beryllium mirrors are included.

50|$|Early octants were {{constructed}} primarily in wood, with later versions incorporating ivory and brass components.

These used coatings of mercury-containing tin amalgam; coatings of silver or aluminum were not available until the 19th century.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work was to carry out initial studies on Scania’s {{possibility}} to have plastic rearview <b>mirror</b> <b>glasses</b> as that for example may reduce costs and problems for Scania’s customers and enable another design of the mirror assembly. It was performed by studying the legislative and Scania demands regarding rearview mirrors to write a test program, find and order plastic mirrors, and then perform the tests and evaluate the mirrors {{to see if they}} seem good enough for Scania’s trucks. A Scania technical regulation for rearview <b>mirror</b> <b>glass</b> was also written.   The tested mirrors were a Scania <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> as reference, a PC mirror from Sabic, a PC and a PMMA mirror from Specchidea, a mirror from SMR automotive, an ABS mirror from Ficocipa/Renault, an ABS mirror from Ford and a PC plastic from Bayer and they were tested for scratch resistance, temperature variations, impact resistance, corrosion and chemical resistance in that order. If a sample did not pass a certain test, it was not subjected to the next one.   Of all samples it was only the SMR mirror and the reference <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> that passed the first test (scratch resistance). The others became too scratched and were not tested further. The SMR and the <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> also withstood all the following tests very good, the SMR mirror was the best one of the tested mirrors. Probably the SMR mirror was the best one because many of the other mirrors did not seem to have been made for outdoor conditions and because it seemed to be the most modern mirror with a good abrasion resistant coating.   It was concluded that there is a future for plastic <b>mirror</b> <b>glasses,</b> that {{it would be interesting to}} do more tests on the mirrors, for example a UV test and a distortion test, and to test more mirrors as a new generation of plastic <b>mirror</b> <b>glass</b> seem to be underway. It would also be interesting to know how much cheaper and lighter the whole mirror assembly can become by changing to plastic <b>mirror</b> <b>glass,</b> which weighs 68 % less than a <b>glass</b> <b>mirror...</b>|$|R

25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. <b>Glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors,</b> solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|R
