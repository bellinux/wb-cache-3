Designed in Venetian Renaissance styling, the 1882 BNZ {{building}} stands {{just two}} doors along from the National Bank building. The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior.

The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E

5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced.

25|$|Snails of {{the same}} species {{collected}} from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: Alyssum, fruit and leaves of apple, apricot, artichoke (a favorite), aster, barley, beans, bindweed, California boxwood, almost any cabbage variety, camomile, carnation, carrot, cauliflower, celeriac (root celery), celery, ripe cherries, chive, citrus, clover, cucumbers (a favorite snail food), dandelion, elder, henbane, hibiscus, hollyhock, kale, larkspur (Consolida or Delphinium genera), leek, lettuce (liked, and <b>makes</b> <b>good</b> snails), lily, magnolia, mountain ash, mulberry, chrysanthemum, nasturtium, nettle, nightshade berries, oats, onion greens, pansy, parsley, peach, ripe pears, peas, petunia, phlox, plum, potatoes (raw or cooked), pumpkins, radish, rape, rose, sorrel, spinach, sweet pea, thistle, tomatoes (well liked), turnip, wheat, yarrow, zinnia. They will eat sweet lupines, but will reject bitter lupines and other plants with high quinolizidine alkaloids. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.|$|E
25|$|The World War II era {{also brought}} on rising {{production}} costs {{that resulted in}} a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as Loco Boy <b>Makes</b> <b>Good,</b> What's the Matador?, Sock-A-Bye Baby (all 1942), I Can Hardly Wait and A Gem of a Jam (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films. Spook Louder (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett's The Great Pie Mystery (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. Three Smart Saps (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from Harold Lloyd's The Freshman (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to come apart at the seams while he is on the dance floor.|$|E

25|$|Harvests of P. clarkii {{account for}} a large {{majority}} of the crayfish produced in the United States and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in Louisiana in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent culture of rice and crayfish <b>makes</b> <b>good</b> use of land, resources, equipment, and infrastructure already being used for rice production. However, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from China, which is now the world's leading producer of crawfish and is also using a rice-based system. A number of species of crustaceans were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture and because they are better adapted to growing in a rice field than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from Green Revolution practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited.|$|E
25|$|Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) {{soils are}} typical of those {{supporting}} white spruce throughout {{the range of the}} species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce <b>makes</b> <b>good</b> growth on well-drained lacustrine soils in Alberta Mixedwoods (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{deposition}} of the Barrow Delta's sediment ceased {{during the early}} or middle Valanginian with due the continental break up at the southern margin of the Exmouth Plateau. This was followed seafloor spreading at the Gascoyne and Cuvier Abyssal Plains and erosion at {{the surface of the}} Exmouth, Dampier and Barrow sub-basins and an unconformity to be position {{at the top of the}} early to middle Valanginian. By the middle to late Valanginian and through the Cretaceous major transgression occurred with deposit the Winning Group atop the Valanginian unconformity. The Winning Group consists of Muderong Shale, Windalia Radiolarite, and Gearle Siltsone. The Muderong Shale actually considered a siltstone and was deposited in a low energy, offshore-marine environment. The {{deposition of}} these sediments <b>makes</b> <b>good</b> seal for gas buildups in the Exmouth Plateau and the surrounding sub-basins of the Northern Carnvon Basin. The Windalia Radiolarite are primarily carbonate marine deposits commonly containing poorly preserved radiolarians and forminiferas. The Gearle Siltstone is a low-energy, offshore-marine deposit in a period of that input of the terrigenous sediments to the offshore was low minimal.|$|E

The road to romance starts out rocky, with the two of them ending up in many misunderstandings. During one of Greenlee's attempts to win him back after a fight, Greenlee and Leo inadvertently learn that Leo's friend, Bianca Montgomery is a lesbian. Greenlee promptly nicknames the young woman LesBianca. Jealous of his friendships with Bianca and Laura English, a drugged Greenlee pushes Laura off a yacht, while a horrified Bianca looks on. In order to silence her, Greenlee threatens to tell Bianca's mother, Erica Kane, that Bianca is gay. Greenlee later <b>makes</b> <b>good</b> on her threat and publicly outs Bianca. Leo finds out and ends his relationship with Greenlee, although the two eventually reconcile. When Greenlee proposes to Leo, he accepts, though he is worried that she will find out that his original interest in her was to steal her trust fund. Although he no longer cares about the money and is truly in love with her, Greenlee feels too betrayed to believe Leo when she learns the truth and breaks up with him.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century Oxford Movement {{brought the}} High Church within the Church of England {{into a place}} of {{confident}} leadership of the mainstream of the church. By {{the end of that}} century, many were struggling to find suitable forms of worship that were at once obedient to the letter of the Book of Common Prayer (if not its intention) and reflected the desire to a return to more Catholic forms of ritual and ceremonial. Some in the church took on board much of the ritual of the Tridentine Mass. Dearmer {{and other members of the}} Alcuin Club decried this wholesale adaptation of Italianate forms, and they campaigned for a revived English Catholicism that was rooted in pre-Reformation ritual, especially in the Sarum Use — something they termed the Anglican Use or English Use. The Parson's Handbook is Dearmer's brotherly advice to fellow churchmen about the correct way to conduct proper and fitting English worship. Dearmer's writing style is strong: he disparages customs he finds quaint or misguided, and <b>makes</b> <b>good</b> use of his subtle wit. Although Deamer's directions would have originally been considered High Church, the popularity of the Handbook has made them normative. This norm has been influential throughout those portions of the Anglican Communion that have been open to the development of a more Catholic ritual. Although the Handbook now appears somewhat dated, and many Anglican provinces have adopted more modern liturgies than the single BCP of Dearmer's age, his work remains surprisingly useful in the modern context.|$|E
