Karen representatives played a relatively minor role in the conference and, as subsequent rebellions revealed, remained alienated from the new state. U Aung Zan Wai, U Pe Khin, Major Aung, Sir Maung Gyi, Dr Sein Mya Maung, and <b>Myoma</b> U Than Kywe were among the negotiators of the historic Panglong Conference negotiated with Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947.

25|$|Aung San also {{succeeded in}} {{concluding}} {{an agreement with}} ethnic minorities for a unified Burma at the Panglong Conference on 12 February, celebrated since as 'Union Day'. U Aung Zan Wai, U Pe Khin, <b>Myoma</b> U Than Kywe, Major Aung, Sir Maung Gyi and Dr. Sein Mya Maung. were most important negotiators and leaders of the historical pinlon (panglong) Conference negotiated with Burma national top leader General Aung San and other top leaders in 1947. All these leaders decided to join together to form the Union of Burma. Union day celebration {{is one of the}} greatest in the history of Burma. The popularity of the AFPFL, now dominated by Aung San and the Socialists, was eventually confirmed when it won an overwhelming victory in the April 1947 constituent assembly elections. But in July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members. Shortly after, rebellion broke out in the Arakan led by the veteran monk U Seinda, and it began to spread to other districts.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Large uterine <b>myomas</b> in premenopausal women rarely are leiomyosarcomas. However, biopsies of uterine <b>myomas</b> may be {{relevant}} prior to non-excision treatment {{techniques such as}} uterine artery embolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or ablation. Laparoscopic ultrasound-guided global fibroid ablation of uterine <b>myomas</b> permits both biopsy and ablation of all <b>myomas</b> within a uterus.|$|R

He became the first Prime Minister of independent Burma, and he had to deal with armed rebellion. The rebels included various ethnic groups, White Flag and Red Flag communist factions, and some regiments in the Army. Yet another challenge was the exiled Kuomintang (KMT). [...] After being chased out of China by the victorious Communists, they had established bases in eastern Burma, and it took several years in the early 1950s to drive them out. A democratic system was instituted and parliamentary elections were held several times. Throughout the 1950s, U Nu oversaw the implementation of the Pyidawtha Plan, a national economic development plan to establish an industrial welfare state in Burma.|$|E
30|$|In our study, {{mean size}} of <b>myomas</b> removed was 3.28  cm, {{which is not}} {{considered}} significant by Pritts et al. in his review article. Most of our patients were having a long duration of infertility and planning to go for IVF {{and that was the}} reason for removing smaller <b>myomas.</b> The size of the <b>myomas</b> removed is similar to other studies [9, 10, 15]. Additional <b>myomas</b> that were not visible laparoscopically were detected by intraoperative TVS in 69 of 84 patients. The mean size of the additional enucleated <b>myomas</b> was 2.5 (1.5 to 3.5  cm). In a similar study where intraoperative contact ultrasound probe was used, 25 additional <b>myomas</b> with a median diameter of 1.2  cm were enucleated in a group of 42 patients which is comparable to our study [12].|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the use of {{intraoperative}} transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) to locate deep <b>myomas</b> that were not identified on laparoscopic view. The design of this study is a prospective observational study. This study was conducted in private Advanced Endoscopy and Infertility Treatment Centre, Kerala, India. The study comprised of 84 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy from January 2011 to December 2013 in whom intraoperative TVS was used as an intervention. The number of additional deeper <b>myomas</b> removed was calculated, and recurrence at 1  year was calculated. The total number of <b>myomas</b> enucleated was 390, and the additional <b>myomas</b> enucleated after intraoperative TVS were 94. The recurrence of <b>myomas</b> at 1 -year follow-up was 7.1  %.

30|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of laparoscopic myomectomy is locating the deeper and smaller <b>myomas</b> especially those closer to the endometrium (type 3) according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification [4]. Laparoscopic myomectomy carries increased risk of residual <b>myomas</b> because unlike laparotomy, the uterus cannot be palpated to locate very small <b>myomas.</b> Postoperative recurrence may be either due to enlarged residual <b>myomas</b> or newly formed <b>myomas.</b> There are studies that show increased risk of recurrence (16.7 – 51.4  %) after 5  years of laparoscopic myomectomy [5, 6]. This increases the chance of reoperation and decreases the chances of symptom relief after the surgery. Several {{studies have shown that}} large <b>myomas</b> are associated with significant reduction in pregnancy rate after IVF [7, 8]. Khalaf et al. showed that smaller <b>myomas</b> (≤ 5  cm) not encroaching endometrial cavity were found to significantly reduce ongoing pregnancy rate at each cycle of IVF by 40  %; similarly, Stovall et al. concluded that implantation and pregnancy rates were one half that of matched controls [9, 10].|$|R

The respective median time-averaged maximum velocity and pulsatility index (PI) values for the left uterine artery were 36. 1 cm/s and 1. 36 in premenopausal women with <b>myomas</b> vs. 17. 6 cm/s and 2. 58 in controls; p = 0. 0001. The corresponding values in postmenopausal women were 13. 9 cm/s and 1. 93 vs. 11. 0 cm/s and 2. 33; p < 0. 05.

40|$|Study Objective: The primary {{outcome of}} the study was to assess the {{usefulness}} of intraoperative transvaginal ultrasonography (iTVS) during multiple laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) in identifying and removing uterine fibroids. The secondary aim {{of the study was}} to assess the value of iTVS in evaluating the quality of the suture performed to close the uterine wall defect. Design: This prospective study included women between 18 and 45 years old with ultrasonographic diagnosis of multiple fibroids (R 3 with mean diameter of at least 1 cm) scheduled for LM. iTVS was used for identifying residual fibroids after standard surgery. An independent ultrasonographer evaluated the quality of the suture by iTVS on the basis of a Likert scale. A follow-up was performed at 1 - and 3 -month after surgery. Setting: University teaching hospital. Patients: Patients with symptoms related to uterine <b>myomas</b> were elegible. This study included 69 women. Intervention: Patients underwent multiple LM. iTVS was performed to identify residual fibroids after standard surgery. Measurements and Main Results: The mean (` SD) age of the study population was 34. 7 ` 3. 4 years. A total of 317 <b>myomas</b> were identified before surgery. Forty-five <b>myomas</b> were identified during iTVS; these <b>myomas</b> were identified in 20 patients with preoperative diagnosis of 3 <b>myomas,</b> in 4 patients with 4 <b>myomas,</b> in 3 patients with 5 <b>myomas,</b> in 2 patients with 6 <b>myomas</b> and in one patient with 7 <b>myomas.</b> The mean (` SD) largest diameter of the <b>myomas</b> identified only by iTVS was 2. 7 ` 0. 7 cm (mean volume: 10. 3 ` 7. 4 cm 3).

30|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} myomectomy as a therapy for infertility and to define the factors that influence reproductive outcome, a retrospective study of a case series is summarised. To assess the role of leiomyomas and their surgical removal on pregnancy rates, 212 women who were investigated for infertility were studied. Patients were divided according to case control criteria as those who underwent laparoscopic removal of <b>myomas</b> (106) {{and those who did not}} (106); both groups were compared with 106 women with unexplained infertility without <b>myomas.</b> Of the 318 women, 83 (26 %) became pregnant and delivered live infants. The 44 (42 %) who underwent surgical removal of leiomyomas had higher delivery rates than 12 (11 %) who did not undergo surgery (P[*]<[*] 0.001) and 27 (25 %) who did not have <b>myomas</b> (P[*]<[*] 0.001). Patients whose <b>myomas</b> were not surgically treated had fewer deliveries than women who did not have <b>myomas</b> (12 vs. 27, P[*]<[*] 0.002). Fifteen women had spontaneous abortions before week 12 : 3 (3 %) who had surgery, 10 (9 %) who did not have surgery, and 2 (2 %) who did not have <b>myomas.</b> The conclusion of this study emphasised that myomectomy improved pregnancy rates over nonsurgical management of <b>myomas</b> [46].|$|R
