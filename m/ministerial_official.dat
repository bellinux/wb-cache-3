The ministry was especially sensitive because it was central {{in the relationship between}} West and East Germany, including so-called [...] "political questions" [...] and [...] "security responsibilities". [...] It was while he was at the ministry that the practice began whereby the West German government paid the East German government for the release of political prisoners, under a scheme which {{came to be known as}} [...] "Häftlingsfreikauf". Although something similar had previously taken place involving the churches, direct government involvement in the practice first occurred in December 1962 when twenty East German prisoners and the same number of children were released in return for a delivery from the west of three rail wagons loaded with potash fertilisers. [...] A pattern quickly emerged, driven from the western side by humanitarian motives and from the east by a desperate shortage of basic supplies and convertible currency.|$|E

[...] He {{returned}} to government service in 1982, again taking {{a job as a}} <b>ministerial</b> <b>official</b> in the Ministry of Intra-German Relations, which was in fact his old ministry but with a new title (and a greatly modified mandate). [...] His job title was now Secretary of State, which under the German system denotes a top civil service position equivalent to a [...] "permanent secretary" [...] in the British system.) Rehlinger was by now closely identified with his former boss, Rainer Barzel, and his return to government service coincided with the election success of Helmut Kohl and a resulting restitution of a CDU led governing coalition. [...] He retired from the ministry in 1988. During his final six years he resumed his earlier responsibilities for negotiating [...] "Häftlingsfreikauf" [...] exchanges with East German counterparts, concentrating in particular on reuniting divided families: it is believed {{that he was able to}} purchase the release from East Germany to the west of around 2,000 East Germans who had lost their parents after the erection of the Berlin Wall, when escaping parents had been obliged to leave their children behind.|$|E

[...] Although the German governments attempted to keep the transactions secret, {{as more and more}} former detainees turned up in the west awareness of the [...] "Häftlingsfreikauf" [...] programme seeped into public consciousness. In 1983 a scandal erupted in West Germany which threatened to undermine the humanitarian motives of West German governments. [...] It was alleged that the long-standing, Minister of Intra-German Relations between 1969 and 1982 Egon Franke and a senior <b>ministerial</b> <b>official,</b> named Edgar Hirt, had presided over the questionable disappearance of 5.6 Million Deutsche Marks into East Germany. Both men were indicted. [...] They stood trial at the end of 1986, during the run up to a general election, for embezzlement and fraud in connection with the [...] "Häftlingsfreikauf" [...] programme. Franke was acquitted, but the court determined that Hirt had applied some of the [...] "black funds" [...] involved to non-humanitarian causes without the knowledge of his minister, and Hirt was sentenced to a three and a half year jail term.|$|E
5000|$|The General {{election}} of September 1969 saw the ruling centre-right unionist parties with their electoral support virtually unchanged, but following negotiations involving key {{leaders in the}} SPD and FDP parties, which had respectively come second and third in the polls, resulted in a change of government. The new government was dominated by the SPD and led by Willy Brandt, a man whose opinions {{on a range of}} matters were never left in doubt for long. It was immediately clear that Brandt would attempt to follow a far more emolient strategy in terms of relations between East and West Germany. Rehlinger was a <b>ministerial</b> <b>official</b> and not a politician, but he had nevertheless worked in a high-level job in a politically sensitive ministry under a government that, formally, had not even acknowledged the existence of a separate East German state. He was out of sympathy with the Brandt approach and late in 1969 left his job with the ministry. [...] In the meantime, between July 1969 and March 1972, Ludwig Rehlinger {{served as president of the}} Bundesanstalt für gesamtdeutsche Aufgaben (BfgA / Whole Germany Tasks Institute), an institution created by the government for educational purposes and, more generally, for information gathering, evaluation and dissemination, to be supervised by the Ministry for which, in July, Rehlinger was still working.|$|E

40|$|Everywhere {{it is now}} {{difficult}} {{to think of what}} our educational actuality is without confronting "accountability". This fashionable, multilayered term is today a "planetspeak" (Novoa, 2002). In the anglophon arena accountability policies are central to educational systems, meanwhile other countries are swinging from policy makers' eagerness to borrow accountability strategies from abroad to educators’ resistance to accept initiatives which they think threatening their professional values. In Italy, in the last decades several attempts to create evaluation systems were unsuccessfully implemented. This paper draws on the dynamics that emerged in a recent initiative launched by the ministry, aimed at piloting a voluntary teacher reward scheme. The "best" teachers of selected schools would have been awarded “financial prizes” after assessment of their performances and professional reputation. What the government expected to be a proud celebration of a new meritocratic turn, after ages of “bureaucratic egalitarianism”, resulted in rejection and complaint. A documentary analysis has been undertaken of <b>ministerial</b> <b>official</b> documents and presentations and of documents, contributions, comments published by national press and professional websites. First, the paper describes the inner logic of the new accountability policy framing the pilot {{within the context of a}} wider project to establish a new form of governmentality based on ‘performativity’ and reputation. Second, the ‘discourses’ developed around the pilot are analysed, looking at both the Ministry’s attempts and the unions’, teachers’ and public opinion’s reactions. The paper shows the slippery implications of the “merit logic” and how, in the messy Italian political scenario, it left both sides to handle a hot potato. The ministry’s proposal makes even sharper the contradictions of its policy and cuts. Meanwhile unions and associations locked themselves up in corporatist positions leading teachers towards a possible trap: their complaint is interpreted as the “guilty” rejection of a professional category which refuses evaluation, enhancing their “bad reputation”. We argue that the ritualistic enactment of the pilot policy resulting from these struggles is a missed opportunity to develop more democratic forms of evaluation, where a real account is given of what happens in schools and why (Ranson, 2003) and evaluation is interpreted as a form of contextualized and knowledge-grounded reflection (Goodson, 2003) on professional practice. However the debate is paramount and well documented, its analysis provides a meaningful inventory of how resistance and its dynamics occur in the field, teachers’ angry and passionate voices shed light on a range of counter-elaborations and possible perspectives...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} shift from {{ownership}} to partnership policy in Dutch development aid. It is an ethnography based on participant observation during several periods between 2001 and 2006 in the Ministry’s headquarters in The Hague and the Dutch embassy in developing country Z. The aim {{of this research is}} neither to criticize nor to defend development aid. It does not address the issue of whether partnership policy is effective or if the implementation of this policy is efficient. Instead, this thesis explores policy practices to answer the question of how practitioners try to realize development through aid. It is argued that the current writings conceive development aid as a rational, instrumental policy process and ignores the practices of aid practitioners and, therefore, do not help us understand policy processes. Hence, this thesis develops a theoretical framework that pays attention to aid practitioners’ work and tries to understand how they make sense of development aid. This thesis points out that policy studies should pay attention to dreams of development, which are imaginary orders of an ideal world in which life is good. It shows that ownership and partnership policies express different dreams of development. Then, it shows how aid practitioners try to realize dreams of development through aid and, consequently, how development aid is shaped by different dreams of development. The theoretical framework developed in this thesis conceives policy processes as involving translation and purification practices. Translation is the mobilization and tying together of people, organizations, things, and interests. Purification is the keeping apart of people, organizations, and things because it is believed that they have fundamentally different interests. Hence, this thesis follows the trajectory of partnership from being a policy notion to becoming a public-private partnership project (PPP-project) with the Dutch pharmaceutical company in country Z. In this trajectory {{the focus is on the}} different dreams of development that are expressed in and aspired through partnership and the translation and purification processes that make possible or hamper the travelling of partnership. This study of partnership policy combines both the approach of ‘‘studying through”, by following the policy of partnership through time and space, and of ‘‘studying up”, by exploring the aid practices of ministerial officials as a professional elite. The studying of an elite has implications for the methodology of the study. To carry out the research, I had to sign a statement of confidentiality that says no state secrets can be made public. Therefore, this thesis does not reveal any material that is marked as classified in the ministry, but it does write about practices in the aid bureaucracy that are considered by many aid practitioners as public secrets, that is what is generally known about the practices of the state but cannot be articulated in official documents. This thesis contends that writing about the practices of the aid bureaucracy that are part of the state can make a valuable contribution to the debate on development aid. It can explain what keeps the aid bureaucracy together despite the fact that it is not a homogeneous, coherent entity and explicate what makes up development if it isn’t a well-defined, singular goal. The passages quoted in this thesis are both from official and unofficial documents and they also include e-mails between officials in the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The documents and e-mails on the PPP-project were filed in the official archives of the PPP-project in the Dutch Embassy in country Z. These e-mail exchanges are used to show how projects like the PPP are discussed and how practices of translation and purification are negotiated, resisted, and justified in the Ministry. For reasons of confidentiality, all people have been given fictional names except for the Dutch ministers for Development Cooperation. Furthermore, to protect the embassy staff, this thesis talks about the country where the PPP-project should be realized as country Z. Likewise, the Dutch pharmaceutical company is referred to as Pharmaco. The organization of the book is as follows: Chapter 1 describes the academic debate on partnership in development aid. It points out the limitations of the dominant analyses for our understanding of policy processes in development aid and provides a theoretical framework that can address these issues. Chapter 2 shows that studies of development aid should pay more attention to the dreams, ideals, values, fears, and beliefs that the aid policies express. Subsequently, this chapter explores the dreams of development of the three Dutch Ministers for Development Cooperation, Jan Pronk, Eveline Herfkens, and Agnes van Ardenne, over the period of 1989 until 2005. These dreams of development can be understood from the descriptions of the key events and important encounters in each minister’s life. The dreams of development can be traced in their policies; they are expressed in the symbolic language of ownership and partnership. Pronk used the concept of ownership to express a dream that takes into account power relations, while Van Ardenne’s concept of partnership expresses a dream that aims to unite people. Then, whereas Pronk and Herfkens communicate their dream of development in a technical-scientific way, Van Ardenne uses a personal and political way of communicating her dream of development. Because officials who have been trained in academia and worked for many years under Pronk and Herfkens, they have believe that partnership is a buzzword. Chapter 3 explores the assembling of a public-private partnership project (PPP-project) with the Dutch pharmaceutical company Pharmaco. It explains how in this project various actors with different dreams of development and aspirations in life are tied together in the PPP-project. The chapter describes how a project proposal designed to realize the dream of making contraceptives available and affordable worldwide is translated and transformed by a <b>ministerial</b> <b>official</b> to fit Minister Van Ardenne’s dream of development. It is explained why the person who designed that initial project, feels that his project has been ‘‘hijacked” by the Dutch ministry and why he, nonetheless, joins the project when Pharmaco invites him. Chapter 4 analyzes the transportation of the PPP-project from the headquarters in The Hague to country Z. It explores how an assessment team of representatives of the ministerial headquarters in The Hague and of Pharmaco select a country for the realization of the PPP-project. Then, it explains that the choice for country Z is based on where support for the project is thought to be highest and opposition minimal. It is shown that the selection process goes together with the contextualization of the PPP-project. Thus, this chapter shows that a project is not implemented in a context. Rather, a context is created around a project. Then, transportation implies the transformation of both the project and the context of a project. Chapter 5 shows how ministerial officials in the headquarters in The Hague and in the Dutch embassy in country Z discuss the PPP-project. The officials negotiate whether or not this PPP is a development project and how it can be transformed into one. Thus, they debate the sense or nonsense of the translations made by a <b>ministerial</b> <b>official</b> in the headquarters and argue if and how the PPP-project should be purified from Pharmaco’s interest in profit. We see in this that besides dreams of development, career aspirations, concerns for reputation, and ideas of what it means to be a good <b>ministerial</b> <b>official</b> also play a role in the negotiation on translation and purification of the PPP-project. Chapter 6 presents the main findings of this research and their theoretical implications. It concludes that the dividing policy processes into policy making and policy implementation is a theoretical misunderstanding as this thesis shows that policy processes consists of translation and purification practices, Yet, this model of policy making versus implementation is also a used as an argument by officials to legitimize particular translations and decline other interpretations. Furthermore, this thesis claims that only when we take dreams of development seriously, we can find a way out of the current cynicism in development aid...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{evaluating}} {{the level of}} bureaucracy and efficiency {{of the government of}} the Czech Republic, both are seen to lag behind more developed Western countries. Causes of this condition are seen by many as being the advanced age of officials, their lack of education and the profound influence of politicians on the performance of the bureaucracy. The analysis is based on our own research of the ministerial staff as conducted in 2013 (N = 1, 351). All 14 ministries of the Czech Republic were invited to participate. No similar empirical analysis of the Czech Republic's ministerial staff had yet been undertaken. This {{is also one of the}} epistemological reasons why myths prevail among the general public about staff of ministries. The analysis shows that <b>ministerial</b> <b>officials</b> are, in fact, a predominately university-educated, and the vast majority of them are not under political pressure. The overall median age of employees in all ministries is 42 years old...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} continuity in the long-term development of the Japanese tax system, focussing on fiscal reform in the 1930 s {{in order to assess}} the impact of war on policy making. Specifically, it tracks the response of bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry to the challenge of how to reconcile economic growth with tax increases and redistribution of the burden. The views of <b>ministerial</b> <b>officials</b> are investigated on the basis of classified documents issued by the Tax Bureau, which previous research has only partially examined. The analysis points out that, rather than looking at war as an opportunity to push through a structural reform, bureaucrats continued to follow policy guidelines that were rooted in the developmentalist strategy established in the Meiji period. This conclusion helps to explain the resurgence of some key prewar features of taxation in the contemporary system, despite wartime reorganisation and attempts at further reform during the American occupation...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the TVNZ charter legislation in 2003 restructured the broadcaster from a state-owned enterprise (SEO) to a Crown-owned company (CROC). TVNZ was given a charter involving a dual remit obliging the delivery of extensive public service functions while maintaining commercial performance. The government also decided to directly fund charter initiatives through the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, and TVNZ anticipated that the Treasury would forego any expectations of continued dividend payments. However, in 2004 TVNZ paid a $ 37. 6 million dividend to the Treasury - double the amount it received from the Ministry of Culture and Heritage. Despite charter requirements, TVNZ remains disproportionately dependent on commercial revenue to fund programming initiatives. Drawing on original interviews with TVNZ and <b>ministerial</b> <b>officials,</b> and using the TVNZ charter as a case study, this paper explores how different institutional agents can engage with political economic structures in the negotiation of broadcasting policy and funding mechanisms...|$|R
