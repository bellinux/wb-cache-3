5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat.

It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E

5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
