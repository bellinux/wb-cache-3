The authors offer a model for calculating the operational process in the hydrodynamic mixer with <b>multiple-jet</b> <b>nozzle</b> as agitator of cavitation, based on hydrodynamic equations and data of experimental research on jet pumps. There has been considered and analyzed the characteristic of the cavitation mixer, which shows how relative loss of total stream pressure depends on relative nozzle square, and hydraulic resistance coefficient of flow-part elements. It is shown that gradual reduction of hydraulic resistance coefficient allows to decrease considerably the loss of total stream pressure. Besides, there exists the range of optimal relative square values where losses of total pressure are minimized. If the elements of the mixer flow-part are made hydraulically proper then the optimal values of the nozzle relative square are 0, 66 … 0, 76, whereas minimum losses of relative pressure don’t exceed 0, 22...|$|E
