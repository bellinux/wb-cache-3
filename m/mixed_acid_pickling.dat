40|$|Basic {{research}} {{work has been}} carried out for continuous metal removal from <b>mixed</b> <b>acid</b> high-grade steel <b>pickling</b> solutions by electrolytic deposition of nickel and chromium containing iron alloys, and process flow schemes have been derived for waste-free processing of hydrofluoric acid and nitric <b>acid</b> containing <b>pickling</b> solutions. Prior to the alloy deposition the nitric acid is removed and sulfate concentration is diminished by electrodialysis, and Fe (III) is reduced to Fe (II) by electrolysis or alternatively by reduction with metallic iron or by hydrogen from diffusion electrodes. Efficiency of electrodialysis, electrolytic reduction and electrolytic metal deposition strongly depends on the properties of the used ion exchange membranes. Computer models have been compiled for process description and simulation.

5000|$|Smooth clean surface (SCS) and eco {{pickled surface}} (EPS) are more recent alternatives. In the SCS process, surface {{oxidation}} is removed using an engineered abrasive {{and the process}} leaves the surface resistant to subsequent oxidation {{without the need for}} oil film or other protective coating. EPS is a more direct replacement for <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b> <b>Acid</b> <b>pickling</b> relies on chemical reactions while EPS uses mechanical means. The EPS process is considered [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] compared with <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and it imparts to carbon steel a high degree of rust resistance, eliminating the need to apply the oil coating that serves as a barrier to oxidation for acid-pickled carbon steel.|$|R
50|$|When both salt {{concentration}} and temperature are low, Leuconostoc mesenteroides dominates, producing a <b>mix</b> of <b>acids,</b> alcohol, and aroma compounds. At higher temperatures Lactobacillus plantarum dominates, which produces primarily lactic <b>acid.</b> Many <b>pickles</b> start with Leuconostoc, and change to Lactobacillus with higher acidity.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the EPS {{process is}} {{considered}} less {{damaging to the}} environment than <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> for these reasons: ...|$|R
5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed steel strip {{is superior to}} that of <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> steel strip primarily because <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not. This penalty {{is a result of}} chemical reactions that occur after <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and serve as a catalyst for oxidation. The primary pickling agent is hydrochloric acid (HCl). Although the steel strip is thoroughly rinsed with clean water after immersion in the HCl bath, some residual amount of chlorine (Cl) remains {{on the surface of the}} strip. Chlorine reacts very readily with oxygen to form chlorides, so the free Cl acts as something of a [...] "magnet" [...] for oxygen. This mechanism makes acid-pickled steel more prone to picking up oxygen, whereas there is no comparable mechanism at work with EPS mechanical pickling.|$|R
5000|$|Steel which {{utilizes}} the EPS {{process to}} remove surface scale shows few differences from steel which utilizes <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> to remove surface scale. [...] "Downstream" [...] industrial {{processes such as}} galvanizing, cold reducing and painting of EPS-processed steel strip show it to be interchangeable with acid-pickled steel strip. This also holds true for common sheet metal fabrication processes, such as laser cutting, plasma cutting, stamping, welding, bending, and roll forming - no meaningful difference between steel strip using the EPS process and steel strip using <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the free Cl, compounds known as [...] "chloride salts" [...] remain {{on the surface of}} <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> steel in trace amounts, even after rinsing. Chloride salts react rapidly with moisture and accelerate oxidation of iron on the steel's surface. To prevent oxidation of the iron in the <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> strip, a thin film of oil is applied to the surface to serve as a barrier between the free Cl, chloride salts and oxygen. No such protective barrier is needed for EPS-processed steel, as no free Cl or chloride salts are present.|$|R

In this research, hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> process was introduced into stainless steel pickling {{to improve the}} surface integrity. Research indicated that the impedance spectrum obtained from 430 SS in HCl solution consisted of a capacitive loop at high frequencies and an inductive loop at low frequencies. As the concentration of hydrochloric acid rose, the radiuses of the capacitive loop decreased. And the corrosion potential of 430 SS in hydrochloric acid solution moved to positive direction with band to a narrow 0. 1 V. And high HCl concentration more markedly influenced the charge-transfer resistance...|$|R

In the present study, electropolishing is performed on 316 LVM steel slotted tube coronary stents. Additionally, <b>acid</b> <b>pickling,</b> as a pretreatment of electropolishing, is also conducted. Gravimetric analysis of the stents (weight loss and strut width change) in the process of <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and electropolishing are done.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to prepare highly acceptable and long shelf-life low <b>acid</b> goat meat <b>pickle</b> and its quality evaluation and storage stability at 32 ± 0. 5 °C. Low <b>acid</b> goat meat <b>pickle</b> was prepared using deboned meat from spent Barbari goat breed. The product was evaluated after an elapse of seven days as maturation, for changes in physico-chemical (pH, titrable acidity), microbiological (Aerobic mesophilic, halophiles, yeast and mould counts) and organoleptic properties at an interval of 15 days up to 60 days of storage at 32 ± 0. 5 °C. Results showed that pH and titrable acidity of the low <b>acid</b> <b>pickles</b> was 4. 87 and 0. 69 whereas in control goat meat pickle, these values were 4. 70 and 0. 76, respectively after 60 days storage period.

40|$|Abstract: Production of the NiTi slotted tube stents by {{laser cutting}} leads to strong burr {{formation}} and depositions {{on the material}} surface. <b>Acid</b> <b>pickling</b> {{is one of the}} major methods to remove the burr and the depositions. In this study, as a pre-treatment of polishing the NiTi stents, pickling was tested for various times in an acid solution at room temperature.

The removal (weight loss) of the material increases linearly with the pickling time. The burr and depositions were removed totally from the cutting zone when pickling time reached a specific value.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science - Animal Sciences & IndustryFadi AramouniBlue-green {{pigments}} {{have the}} ability to form in crushed and whole garlic cloves following a rapid series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Economic losses associated with a reduction in organoleptic quality of garlic (Allium sativum L.) containing blue-green pigments can be incurred. Preventing blue-green pigment formation can mitigate potential financial and brand equity damages. To prevent pigment formation, inactivation of the enzyme which yields pigment substrates is essential. Two methods to inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation were explored: blanch treatment of whole garlic cloves (100 °C, 5 min); and soaking of whole, non-blanched garlic cloves in low pH (< 3. 0) acetic or citric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> solutions for seven days. The blanching treatment was effective in inactivating the enzyme as the pigment substrate decreased by approximately 99 % as compared with pigment substrate concentrations in non-blanched garlic cloves. Soaking whole garlic cloves in low pH (< 3. 0) pickling solutions did not result in enzyme inactivation as pigments formed in cloves soaked in the acetic <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> solutions; however pigments did not form in cloves soaked in the citric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> solution. This {{may be due to the}} different effect mono- and poly-carboxylic acids have on the permeability of garlic cell membranes.

Soaking garlic in a low pH pickling solution comprised of a poly-carboxylic acid does not inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation but pigment formation can be prevented.
