5|$|Native Hawaiians {{before the}} arrival of Captain Cook in 1770 used no coins; trade in their {{agricultural}} economy was based on barter. Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic foreign trade began {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other commercial activity that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and scrip used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community to think in terms of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by foreign trade, circulated as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> alongside American silver and gold pieces.|$|E

25|$|Except for the {{province}} of Skane, on the southernmost tip of Sweden which was under Danish control during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden {{as it did in}} the rest of Europe. Therefore, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. Slavery (also called thralldom) was not common in Sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity, the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century Indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus Erickson in 1335. Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became laborers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> For instance, the farmers of {{the province}} of Dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take down to the coast and trade the iron for fish they needed for food while the iron would be shipped abroad.|$|E

25|$|In 1690, the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{became the}} first to issue paper money in {{what would become the}} United States, but soon others began {{printing}} their own money as well. The demand for currency in the colonies was due to the scarcity of coins, which had been the primary means of trade. Colonies' paper currencies were used to pay for their expenses, as well as a means to lend money to the colonies' citizens. Paper money quickly became the primary <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> within each colony, and it even began to be used in financial transactions with other colonies. However, some of the currencies were not redeemable in gold or silver, which caused them to depreciate. The Currency Act of 1751 set limits on the issuance of Bills of Credit by the New England states and set requirements for the redemption of any bills issued. This Act was in response to the overissuance of bills by Rhode Island, eventually reducing their value to 1/27 of the issuing value. The Currency Act of 1764 completely banned the issuance of Bills of Credit (paper money) in the colonies and the making of such bills legal tender because their depreciation allowed the discharge of debts with depreciated paper at a rate less than contracted for, to the great discouragement and prejudice of the trade and commerce of his Majesty's subjects. The ban proved extremely harmful to the economy of the colonies and inhibited trade, both within the colonies and abroad.|$|E

2500|$|Irregular cast silver ingots {{circulated}} {{from about}} 11th to early 12th centuries. Only one such example is known from Lithuania, found in 1938 in Graužiai. Around {{the second half}} of the 12th century, supply of minted Western European coins dried up and there was no centralized power in Eastern Europe to take up coin mintage. The period is known as [...] "coinless period". However, merchants needed a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> Therefore, a local system of cast silver ingots was developed. While silver was imported (there are no silver mines in the region; the main mining area was in the Upper Harz in Germany), the ingots were cast locally. At first, a wax model was created. Then it was coated with clay and fired in a furnace inside a clay or sand pit. The wax would melt leaving a mold for the ingot. Molten silver was poured into the mold using a special clay scoop. After cooling off, the mold was broken to remove the ingot. Therefore, most molds were one-time use though a few examples of ingots are known that were cast using the same mold. Because of this technique, archaeologists have not discovered any furnaces or molds, only clay spoons and pouring cups.|$|E
2500|$|This {{worldwide}} primacy {{in trade}} {{would not have}} been possible if it only rested on Dutch primacy in the carrying trade. After all, one has to trade something. Even where the counterparty is primarily interested in gold and silver as <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> as in South-East Asia, that specie must be earned by a surplus on the balance of payments with other trading partners. A surplus in [...] "invisibles", like shipping services, would not suffice to cover the enormous financing requirement of the spice trade. At first, the Dutch had little indigenous to offer, beyond herring and dairy products. But the industrial revolution of the early 17th century brought an industry into being that by the 1640s had matured enough to play an important part in Dutch exports. This industrial growth was partly innovation driven, stimulating all kinds of heretofore not seen mechanization, that greatly enhanced labor productivity, thereby driving down prices for Dutch products, even while nominal wages rose steeply at the same time. But the commerce-engendered Dutch control of many raw-material markets (like Spanish and Turkish raw wool, Swedish iron and copper, Ibero-American dyestuffs, Portuguese salt, French wine, Baltic grain, Scandinavian tar and wood, Caribbean sugar, American tobacco etc.) was an important factor in stimulating the booms of the industries that used those materials: textiles, guns, vinegar, shipbuilding, sugar and salt refining, tobacco blending, to name only a few. [...] The Dutch entrepot was therefore supplied by an important domestic industrial sector, and not limited to reexporting wares obtained abroad. Industry and commerce were in this period closely integrated (though in later stages of the Dutch economy they would become disaggregated again, when foreign protection and a structurally high real-wage level forced the decline of the Dutch industrial sector).|$|E
