500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make {{love to me}} when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't let me go / Make love to me when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up <b>my</b> <b>fist,</b> I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|With Disney's backing, the {{production}} team was {{given access to}} 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't {{want to come in}} and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that they might want to chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of the way, I had <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|E
2500|$|Stories {{about the}} ghost {{soon began to}} circulate. Two women, one elderly and the other pregnant, were {{reported}} to have been seized by the ghost on separate occasions while walking near the churchyard; they were apparently so frightened they both died from shock a few days afterwards. A brewer's servant, Thomas Groom, later testified that, while walking through the churchyard with a companion one night, at close to 9:00pm, something rose from behind a tombstone and seized him by the throat. Hearing the scuffle, his companion turned around, at which the ghost [...] "gave me a twist round, and I saw nothing; I gave a bit of a push out with <b>my</b> <b>fist,</b> and felt something soft, like a great coat." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the commandant}} struck his hand upon his {{forehead}} and groaned, and I, half awakened at last, ran forward, shaking <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> and gibbering.|$|R
6000|$|I made {{fast and}} laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, {{and began to}} gap, and stretch <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> out against Jim, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{without waiting}} to test her powers of repartee I passed rudely beyond her and vanished, striding with <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> clenched, {{out of her}} world again. [...] .|$|R
2500|$|... "Now, {{people are}} coming back and almost {{adopting}} it as their own anthem, and it's hard, I think, to write an anthem that's not cheesy, and I hope {{that this could be}} something in that category. I hope this could be {{one of those things where}} it's like, 'Yeah, I want to put <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> up and feel proud and feel strong. But I also don't want to be cheesy, it's a fine line, and I think 'Firework' ... would be like the opus or my one song — if I had to pick a song to play — 'cause it has a great beat. But it also has a fantastic message. Many people refer to the lines 'like the 4th of July; however the original lyrics were 'like a firefly' as they reminded me of fireworks at night whenever I saw them. However the trend caught on and in live performances I now sing 4th of July, which happens to make great sense for the song name." ...|$|E
6000|$|CASHEL. [...] Shall twaddle [...] About his duty. Mellish: at no hour [...] Can I regard thee wholly without loathing; [...] But when thou play'st the moralist, by Heaven, [...] My soul {{flies to}} <b>my</b> <b>fist,</b> <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> to thee; [...] And never did the Cyclops' hammer fall [...] On Mars's armor--but enough of that. [...] It does {{remind me of}} my mother.|$|E
60|$|Sir Mart. I'll {{make him}} {{give up the}} ghost under <b>my</b> <b>fist,</b> {{if he does not}} deny it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Avuncular, I want to {{tell you}} {{something}} important. I was raised a Lord Fauntleroy, but I can outpack you, outwalk you, put you on your back, or lick you with <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> right now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will chance that," [...] Mark said quietly, as {{he moved}} towards the door. [...] "I don't {{think that he is}} {{stronger}} than I am, and I can use <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> a bit, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fool!" [...] I said, {{and stirred}} the {{crackling}} mass into a featureless heap of black scraps. Then with my chin on <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> and elbows on knees I {{stared at the}} end of my labours.|$|R
60|$|I thrust <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> {{through the}} window and struck the Hottentot's toad-like face on which the starlight gleamed faintly.|$|E
60|$|I {{resisted}} to {{the best}} of my ability--but he was the stronger man of the two. His long arms almost strangled me; his bristly mustache scratched my cheek. In my first involuntary impulse of disgust, I clenched <b>my</b> <b>fist.</b> Young Mr. Keller never suspected (my English brethren alone will understand) how very near <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> and his head were to becoming personally and violently acquainted. Different nations--different customs. I can smile as I write about it now.|$|E
6000|$|Sam: No man with-holds thee, {{nothing from}} thy hand [...] Fear I incurable; bring up thy van, [...] My heels are fetter'd, but <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> is free.|$|E
6000|$|... "For God's sake!" [...] I cried, [...] "for God's sake, what is {{this that}} I have done?" [...] and carried <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> to <b>my</b> temples. [...] "What made me do it? Sure, I am bewitched to say these things!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Ted, looking with a {{smile at}} his huge hands, [...] "I can't go for to say as I {{know much about the}} science of it, d'ee see; but I can use <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> after a fashion." ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{carrying}} {{on with her}} remarks, and as I listened I clenched <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> till I shouldn't wonder if the knuckles didn't stand out white under the strain. It seemed as if she would never get to the nub.|$|R
6000|$|... "YOU hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty, fusty, old savage!" [...] said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand uncle Rumgudgeon--shaking <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> {{at him in}} imagination.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nor yet is <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> the fore-hammer," [...] {{rejoined the}} smith, with {{sparkling}} eyes. [...] "Nevertheless, I repeat that I'll go--always supposing {{that you and}} Molly have no objections." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dossn't I?" [...] he shouted. [...] "Dossn't I? Ha'e {{much more}} o' thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> about thee. Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to whiten them," [...] said Cashel, impatiently {{throwing}} the lemon under the grate; [...] "but it's no use; I can't go about with <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> like a nigger's. I'll {{go up to}} London to-morrow and buy a pair of gloves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't bother about firearms, if I were you, sir," [...] Arnold interrupted. [...] "I {{can promise}} you that while I am in this office no one will touch you or harm you in any way. I would rather rely upon <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> any day." ...|$|R
60|$|This latter {{alternative}} is always permissible, therefore I {{could have used}} my short-sword, my dagger, my hatchet, or <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> had I wished, and been entirely within my rights, but I could not use firearms or a spear while he held only his long-sword.|$|R
60|$|Gui. You are fools; to kill them, were to shew I feared them; The court, disarmed, disheartened and besieged, Are all as much {{within my}} power, as if I griped them in <b>my</b> <b>fist.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The blackguard!" [...] growled the skipper, fiercely, {{referring}} to `that man,' [...] "if I only had his long nose within three futt o' <b>my</b> <b>fist,</b> I'd let him feel what my knuckles is made of!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mac {{turned to}} the speaker with rather a wild eye. [...] "Why, I see {{what looks like a}} patch of dry rot up yonder, that I bet I could stick <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> into," [...] said he.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not return}} to my study. I stood {{by the side of the}} house, with <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> clenched and <b>my</b> eyes set. Then, suddenly, I ran to the garden wall; looking over it, I saw, far down the shaded village street, two gray figures walking away.|$|R
5000|$|However, on Maresca's {{original}} demo of the song, {{the lyrics}} were [...] "with <b>my</b> two <b>fists</b> {{of iron and}} my bottle of beer", and the change to [...] "with <b>my</b> two <b>fists</b> of iron but I'm going nowhere" [...] in fact {{seems to have been}} at the record company's insistence.|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} I {{understood}} all, for my drugged brain had awakened at last. I {{ran to the}} brute upon the ground; grotesque in my woman's garments all awry, I leaped on him and stamped out {{the last of his}} life. Then, standing over his dead body, I shook <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> and cried: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I want you, Mary," [...] I cried, {{drumming}} at {{the little}} green table with <b>my</b> <b>fist.</b> [...] "I want you. I want nothing else {{in all the world}} unless {{it has to do with}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|I dodged his arm, and then, {{gathering}} myself together, landed <b>my</b> <b>fist</b> {{fairly and}} squarely upon {{the tip of}} his nose, a blow that knocked him off his feet and sent him rolling to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{knock you}} down, with a belayin' pin {{if it was}} handy, but if not, with <b>my</b> <b>fist,</b> knowin' Joshua Barney would uphold me in bringin' back at any price the same crew I took away." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{clinched}} <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> {{and charged}} off. How grateful I {{was to him}} for having spoken to me, the outcast of the class, thus publicly, I could only show by my exertions to please him. When I drew up before him I was panting hard, but I {{could see that he}} was satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|I braced my {{soul for}} battle. All {{civilisation}} was behind me, but I doubt if it kept the colour in my face. I buttoned my jacket and clenched <b>my</b> <b>fists</b> and advanced on my antagonist--he had, I suppose, {{the advantage of}} two {{years of age and}} three inches of height. [...] "Hand over that knife," [...] I said.|$|R
60|$|How long we swayed to and fro, I {{striving to}} reach the enemy's face with <b>my</b> <b>fists,</b> and he trying to {{strengthen}} his hold on my throat, I know not; but certain it is that I held him in fairly good play five minutes or more before the report of Jim Freeman's musket told that the Britishers were about to receive reinforcements.|$|R
