40|$|Eclampsia is {{an urgent}} illness, which threatens {{lactating}} female dogs in postpartum period. This illness is also called hypocalcemia, lactation tetany, puerperal tetany or milk fever. Based on the metabolic changes {{the main cause}} of eclampsia is a decrease of calcium in blood and its transition into <b>milk.</b> <b>Balance</b> between the intake and output of calcium from the extracellular fluid due to calcium loss in milk production appears like an important factor in the development of eclampsia. There are many causes which lead to the disease. The disease is caused by hypocalcemia, decreased secretion of PTH (parathyroid hormone), as well as high milk production, poor nutrition and diseases of the parathyroid glands. Reduction of PTH secretion occurs due to abnormal development of parathyroid glands, when they are damaged or after their surgical removal. The system of kidney is activated during hypocalcemia - vitamin D, which has the task of ensuring increased calcium absorption in the intestine or the system of parathyroid glands - parathyroid hormone, which is responsible for the release of calcium from the bones. If it was the opposite case, when there is an excess of calcium, calcitonin secretion from the parathyroid gland is activated. Calcitonin secretion from the parathyroid glands is responsible for calcium deposition in bones. Today, deficiency of vitamin D is the main center of interest because eclampsia in female dogs is considered as a negative prognostic indicator and one of the causes in development of hypocalcemia is just hypovitaminosis D. The symptoms of eclampsia occur in female dogs, especially during the first 4 weeks after birth in the period of maximum lactation. From a metabolic perspective puerperium (the period after birth) in female dogs represents an enormous ballast associated with caring of growing puppies and their nutrition. The outbreak of eclampsia indicates total exhaustion, restlessness, rubbing head on the ground or forelimb of the nose, nervousness, anxiety, loss of interest in puppies and difficulty in movement. Walking seems to be coordinated but gradually becomes stiff. In more serious cases thirst starts, excessive drooling, rapid breathing, muscle twitching and spasms. The time from the first symptoms to develop of overall clinical presentation represents 15 minutes to 12 hours. In normal conditions, this state is diagnosed thorough clinical examinations, history correlated with clinical symptoms, response to therapy and the condition accepted laboratory results. The basic step for treating eclampsia is an intravenous aplication of calcium. Generally, 5 - 10 ml of 10 % calcium gluconate provides a sufficient dose of calcium for female dogs weighing up to 10 kg of body weight. Late initiation of treatment can lead to fatal consequences. Prevention has not been exactly known yet. Small litters of puppies and early weaning has a positive effect. Excessive preventive use of vitamin supplements and mineral supplements is not recommended. Easy and convenient solution is feeding rations in the form of complete feed for pregnant and lactating bitches...|$|E

I just wanted to try knitting and walking. I change the colour for every walk, and the knitting is informed by the weather, conversation and terrain. Too cold, dark or boggy, I drop stitches. Sometimes I’m talking so much, and gesturing with my hands instead of knitting and little gets done. If the terrain is smooth and easy, the weather warm, and I’m listening more than talking, the stitches are good and the walk produces a large section. The knitting is a map of walks, each one defined through colour, amount and quality of stitches. I document the journey using two cameras – one strapped to my head filming the view, the other filming my hands.

40|$|In a 10 day {{cross over}} design experiment, six Friesian cows, in late lactation, were fed either white clover or white clover plus maize silage on a 50 : 50 DM basis in {{metabolism}} cages from continuous feeders. Data for intake, digestibility, nitrogen <b>balance,</b> <b>milk</b> production and rumen pH, {{volatile fatty acids}} (VFA), ammonia, fluid flow rate, pool sizes and protozoa population were collected. Replacing 50 % of white clover with maize silage reduced nitrogen intake significantly (P< 0. 001) and increased neutral detergent fibre (NDF) intake (P< 0. 01) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) intake (P< 0. 05). Digestibility was reduced significantly as follows: dry matter digestibility (P< 0. 05), organic matter, NDF, and ADF digestibilities (P< 0. 01) and crude protein digestibility (P< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} between diets for dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI) or digestible organic matter intake (DOMI). Milk yield and composition were similar for both diets. Rumen fluid ammonia concentration and urea nitrogen in urine were reduced significantly (both at P< 0. 001) by adding maize silage to white clover. There was no significant difference in nitrogen in <b>milk</b> or nitrogen <b>balance.</b> Rumen protozoa population increased significantly in the cows fed white clover plus maize silage diet due to an increase in Entodinium, No/ml (P< 0. 05) and total protozoa No/ml (P< 0. 01). There was no significant difference in rumen fluid VFA, pH, or fluid flow rate. It was concluded that feeding white clover with maize silage improves the efficiency of utilization of nitrogen in white clover which potentially can increase milk production per cow and/or per hectare without changing the milk composition or altering the rumen environment.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} on the profitability of automatic milking based on different simulation models, but a data-based study using actual farm data has been lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the profitability of dairy farms having an automatic milking system (AMS) compared with farms using a conventional milking system (CMS) based on real accounting data. In total, 62 farms (31 using an AMS and 31 using a CMS) were analyzed for the year 2003 in a case control study. Differences between the years 2002 and 2003 also were analyzed by comparing a subgroup of 16 farms with an AMS and 16 farms with a CMS. Matching was based on the time of investment in a milking system (same year), the total milk production per year, and intensity of land use (kg/ha). Results from 2003 showed that the farms with an AMS used, on average, 29 % less labor than farms with a CMS. In contrast, farms using a CMS grew faster (37, 132 kg of milk quota and 5 dairy cows) than farms with an AMS (¿ 3, 756 kg milk quota and 0. 5 dairy cows) between 2002 and 2003. Dairy farmers with a CMS had larger (7, 899) revenues than those with an AMS. However, no difference in the margin on dairy production was detected, partly because of numerically greater (6, 822) variable costs on CMS farms. Dairy farms were compared financially based on the amount of money that was available for rent, depreciation, interest, labor, and profit (RDILP). The CMS farms had more money (15, 566) available for RDILP than the AMS farms. This difference was caused by larger fixed costs (excluding labor) for the AMS farms, larger contractor costs (6, 422), and larger costs for gas, water, and electricity (1, 549). Differences in costs for contractors and for gas, water, and electricity were statistically significant. When expressed per full-time employee, AMS farms had greater revenues, margins, and gross margins per full-time employee than did CMS farms. This resulted in a substantially greater (but not statistically significant) RDILP per full-time employee (12, 953) for AMS farms compared with CMS farms. Depreciation and interest costs for automatic milking were not available but were calculated based on several assumptions. Assuming larger purchase costs and a shorter depreciation time for AMS than for CMS, costs for depreciation and interest were larger for AMS farms than for CMS farms. Larger fixed costs should be compensated for by the amount of labor that has become available after introducing the milking robot. Therefore, farm managers should decide whether the extra time acquired by automatic <b>milking</b> <b>balances</b> against the extra costs associated with an AMS...|$|R

We compared the intake of human milk, gold standard for infant nutrition, with equicaloric supplementation of donkey milk, the best substitute for newborns due to its nutritional properties, and cow milk, the primary marketed product. The results showed a hypolipidemic effect produced by donkey and human milk intake in parallel with enhanced mitochondrial activity/proton leakage. Reduced mitochondrial energy efficiency and proinflammatory signals (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin- 1 and lipopolysaccharide levels) were associated with a significant increase of antioxidants (total thiols) and detoxifying enzyme activities (glutathione-S-transferase, NADH quinone oxidoreductase) in donkey- and human milk-treated animals. The beneficial effects were attributable, at least in part, to the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid- 2 -related factor- 2 pathway. Moreover, the metabolic benefits induced by human and donkey milk {{may be related to the}} modulation of gut microbiota.

The relationship between dietary crude protein/energy <b>balance,</b> <b>milk</b> protein yield, stage of lactation, somatic cell count and milk urea concentration can be described by the following equation: first lactation period y = 156. 7 + 42. 52 * milk protein yield + 0. 34 * day in milk - 0. 017 * somatic cell count second lactation period y = 186. 2 + 43. 23 * milk protein yield + 0. 04 * day in milk - 0. 019 * somatic cell count third lactation period y = 188. 3 + 31. 17 * milk protein yield + 0. 06 * day in milk - 0. 015 * somatic cell count The approximate confidence interval for a predicted milk urea content is ± 15 mg/l. If the analyzed milk urea concentration is greater than the predicted milk urea content (interval), this could indicate dietary crude protein excess. If the analyzed milk urea concentration is lower this might be due to a lack of dietary crude protein...|$|R
40|$|Twelve Holsteins {{in first}} {{lactation}} {{were used to}} investigate the relationship between energy balance and effects of bovine somatotropin (bST) on thyroid hormone metabolism and cytokine concentrations in serum. Six cows were fed for ad libitum intake and six cows were feed restricted to induce negative energy balance during two treatment periods of 6 d. During treatment periods, cows were administered vehicle or 40 mg of bST/d according to a crossover design. Between treatment periods was a 15 -d recovery period, during which all cows were fed ad libitum. Cows that were fed ad libitum remained in positive energy balance during control and bST treatments, whereas cows that were fed for restricted intake were in negative energy balance during control and bST treatment periods. In both dietary groups, bST decreased energy <b>balance.</b> <b>Milk</b> production and the fat percentage of milk increased during bST treatment in both dietary groups. Fat-corrected milk yield was increased 13 % by bST treatment. Serum concentrations of IGF-I did not differ between dietary groups but were greater during bST than control periods. Serum thyroxine concentration was decreased by bST treatment. Serum triiodothyronine and reverse-triiodothyronine were not altered by hormone treatment, but circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones were apparently reduced by dietary restriction. Neither hepatic nor mammary thyroxine 5 '-deiodinase was affected by bST treatment. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a potential regulator of thyroxine 5 '-deiodinase, was not affected by bST treat-ment. Short-term treatment with bST did not influence thyroid hormone metabolism in lactating cows in positive or negative energy balance...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four {{multiparous}} cows {{were used}} to evaluate effects of body condition at calving on metabolic responses to induction of an experimental ketosis. The ketosis was induced by restricting cows to 80 % of feed intake and including 1, 3 -butanediol, a ketone precursor, in the ration at 7 % of dry matter intake from 15 to 49 d of lactation (FRBD). Obese and normal cows were assigned randomly to the control or FRBD diet after calving. Three normal and three obese cows developed signs of ketosis on the FRBD protocol. The FRBD protocol involved decreasing energy intake, and cows compensated by decreasing <b>milk</b> production. Energy <b>balance,</b> however, tended to be decreased by the FRBD protocol. Blood ketones were increased by the FRBD protocol, but they increased less in obese than in normal cows. The hepatic triglyceride to glycogen ratio was increased by the FRBD protocol; the increase, however, was greatest in cows of normal body condition. Hepatic gluconeogenesis, measured by increased in blood glucose after a propionate infusion, was delayed in obese cows, but tended to be greater than in normal cows. In cows that developed ketosis, in vitro glucose release was greater in obese than in normal cows. The FRBD protocol lessened the glucose increase after a propionate infusion, {{and there was no}} glucose increase at 26 d postpartum in cows that later became ketotic. Thus, obese cows were better able to compensate for the stresses of lactation and the FRBD protocol, yet they became ketotic more readily than cows of normal body condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe fluctuations in leptin concentrations during late pregnancy and lactation and to investigate how those fluctuations are related to energy <b>balance,</b> <b>milk</b> yield, milk components, dry matter intake, live weight, first postpartum luteal activity, and first observed estrus during lactation. Live weight, dry matter intake, energy <b>balance,</b> and <b>milk</b> yield were measured weekly on 304 primiparous Holstein cows for the first 80 d of lactation. The first postpartum luteal activity was determined by measuring milk progesterone, and independently, first observed estrus. For measuring leptin concentrations from 30 d before until 80 d after calving, blood samples were taken at 2 -wk intervals at a fixed time of the day after milking but before feeding. Leptin concentrations were high during pregnancy and declined to a nadir at parturition. It seems that leptin concentrations reflect the state of energy balance during lactation; plasma leptin concentrations were lower in cows with a mean negative energy balance during lactation. Those cows usually produced more milk, consumed less feed, and had a lower live weight compared with cows having a mean positive energy balance. The recovery of leptin concentrations from the leptin nadir at parturition seemed to depend on the extent and duration of the negative energy balance, thus probably on the amount of fat that was re-accumulated. Although there was lack of a relationship between leptin and first postpartum luteal activity, higher leptin concentrations associated with shorter intervals to first observed estrus might indicate a relationship between leptin and expression of estrus...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of propolis extract in maintaining the viability of human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, and to radiographically analyze tooth replantation and the adjacent periodontium in dogs after storage in this extract. Human PDL cells were incubated with the experimental media propolis, <b>milk,</b> saliva, Hank`s <b>balanced</b> salt solution (HBSS), and Dulbecco`s modified Eagles medium (DMEM, positive controls), and distilled water (negative control). Cell viability was determined 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h later by colorimetric MTT assay. Thirty incisors from dogs were divided into two storage time blocks (1 and 3 h) and were maintained in the experimental media. HBSS served as a positive control, and dry teeth (on gauze) as a negative control. The replanted teeth were radiographed once per month for 6 months. The radiographic images were standardized by the shortening/lengthening factor, and were both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The in vitro results showed that the efficacy of propolis in maintaining functional viability of PDL cells was similar to that of milk. Propolis and milk were significantly better than controls from the 6 -h time period. The in vivo results showed that teeth maintained in propolis medium exhibited replacement resorption with significant reduction in tooth length, similar to teeth maintained in saliva and dried teeth. This resorption was less intense with the 3 -h storage time than the 1 -h storage time. Conditions close to normal were found in teeth maintained in milk, similar to the HBSS control. Therefore, although propolis was effective in maintaining the viability of human PDL cells, resorption of the tooth replantation in dogs occurred under these experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The <b>milk</b> production, energy <b>balance</b> (EB), {{endocrine}} and metabolite {{profiles of}} 10 New Zealand Holstein Friesian (NZ) cows and 10 North American Holstein Friesian (NA) cows were compared. The NA cows had greater peak milk yields and total lactation milk yields (7387 v. 6208 kg; s. e. d. 5359), lower milk fat and similar protein concentrations {{compared with the}} NZ cows. Body weight (BW) was greater for NA cows compared with NZ cows throughout lactation (596 v. 544 kg; s. e. d. 515. 5), while body condition score (BCS) tended to be lower. The NA strain tended to have greater dry matter intake (DMI) (17. 2 v. 15. 7 kg/day; s. e. d. 50. 78) for week 1 to 20 of lactation, though DMI {{as a proportion of}} metabolic BW was similar for both strains. No differences were observed between the strains in the timing and magnitude of the EB nadir, interval to neutral EB, or mean daily EB for week 1 to 20 of lactation. Plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were greater for NA cows during the transition period (day 14 pre partum to day 28 post partum). Plasma IGF-I concentrations were similar for the strains at this time, but NZ cows had greater plasma IGF-I concentration from day 29 to day 100 of lactation, despite similar calculated EB. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} do not support the premise that the NZ strain has a more favourable metabolic status during the transition period. The results, however, indicate that NZ cows begin to partition nutrients towards body reserves during mid-lactation, whereas NA cows continue to partition nutrients to milk production. peer-reviewedNational Development Plan Irelan...|$|R
