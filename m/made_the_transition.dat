5|$|In 1931, Hu Die {{starred in}} Sing-Song Girl Red Peony (dir. Zhang Shichuan), the first Chinese sound film (although it was sound-on-disc, not sound-on-film).

5|$|The decade {{began with}} 25 million {{registered}} automobiles on the road, {{most of which}} predated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to rationing and restrictions.

5|$|Barton pursued {{his dreams}} of {{becoming}} a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at Nottingham Forest, but was rejected when it was decided he {{was too small to}} become a footballer. Barton said his rejection by clubs only made him more determined to succeed as a footballer and prove his detractors wrong. He made his first appearance for Manchester City's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him, but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season. Over the next two years, he successfully <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from the under-19s to regular reserve football. He was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Robson was {{replaced}} at Ipswich by his chief coach, Bobby Ferguson. Ferguson <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from coach to manager in July 1982, but {{some success in}} the various cup competitions was offset by {{an end to the}} high league positions the club had enjoyed under Robson. In the three seasons from 1982–83 to 1984–85, Ipswich reached the FA Cup quarter-final and League Cup semi-final in 1985, but declined in the league, finishing 9th, 12th and 17th. In the following season, the team's league form was even poorer, resulting in a 20th-place finish and relegation to the Second Division. Ipswich finished fifth in the Second Division in the 1986–87 season to qualify for the play-offs, but Ferguson resigned after losing to 2–1 on aggregate to Charlton Athletic.|$|E

After managing in the minors for one season, Gromek retired from the game of baseball, {{and worked as a}} car insurance sales representative. He and his wife, Jeanette, had three sons, Carl, Greg and Brian. Greg and Carl both pitched for the Florida State Seminoles baseball team, and Greg, who pitched in the Tigers' organization for four years, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from infielder to pitcher after college just as his father had. In 1981, Gromek {{became a member of the}} National Polish-American Hall of Fame. He died on March 12, 2002 of complications from diabetes, a stroke and pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky's {{school system}} was {{expanding}} rapidly, creating {{a shortage of}} qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from a private institution to a state-supported university. Money raised through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. Many citizens felt that public school money {{should not be used}} to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.|$|E

Prior to the 2008 season, Buffalo and UConn had signed a contract to play a four-game, home-and-home series beginning in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Vagrant Story was {{conceived}} {{during a time}} when most games had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> into three-dimensional graphics. Games with real-time polygons were the mainstream, and it was decided for Vagrant Story to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the frame rate caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of Vagrant Story are credited to Minoru Akao, the game's sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer.|$|E
5|$|Bean was not {{the first}} actor to be chosen to play Sharpe. As Paul McGann was injured while playing {{football}} two days into filming, the producers initially tried to work around his injury, but it proved impossible and Bean replaced him. The series ran continuously from 1993 to 1997, with three episodes produced each year. It was filmed under challenging conditions, first in Ukraine and later in Portugal. After several years of rumours, more episodes were produced: Sharpe's Challenge, which aired in April 2006, and Sharpe's Peril, which aired in autumn 2008 and was later released on DVD. Both of these were released as two cinema-length 90 minute episodes per series. With a role as enigmatic Lord Richard Fenton in the TV miniseries Scarlett, Bean <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to Hollywood feature films. His first notable Hollywood appearance was that of an Irish republican terrorist in the 1992 film adaptation of Patriot Games. While filming his death scene, Harrison Ford hit him with a boat hook, giving him a permanent scar. Bean's rough-cut looks made him a patent choice for a villain, and his role in Patriot Games was the first of several villains that he would portray, all of whom die in gruesome ways.|$|E

5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American {{television}} medical drama Grey's Anatomy, commenced airing in the United States on September 27, 2007 and concluded on May 22, 2008.
