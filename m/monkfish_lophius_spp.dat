40|$|The {{domestic}} <b>monkfish</b> (<b>Lophius</b> americanus) fishery off {{the northeastern}} USA is described, {{along with the}} management response {{to the expansion of}} the fishery and the challenges posed to the management and scientific processes. The US fishery was virtually non-existent in the early 1980 s, but it expanded rapidly over the next decade to the point that a management plan became necessary to regulate harvesting. By law, US fishery management plans must include measurable biological reference points based on maximum sustainable yield or a proxy; management plans must stop overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks. For monkfish, the limited bio-logical and historical fisheries information presented significant challenges to science and management and resulted in the adoption of innovative approaches to comply with the law...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 18 th century {{scientists}} have been using existing industrial technology for scientific investigation in remote places. This approach, pioneered by Linnaeus and his 'Apostles', is being used today to access deep-water environments using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) {{in collaboration with the}} offshore hydrocarbon industry, particularly through the Scientific and Environmental Remotely operated vehicle Partnership using Existing Industrial Technology (SERPENT) project. Industrial ROVs are well suited for scientific investigation with high quality imaging systems as standard.

In addition, work-class vehicles have sufficient power and manipulation capacity to interact with the environment, permitting sample collection and experimental assessment of deep-water ecological processes; examples are given of each of these investigations.

This paper reports on a study of modifications to a flow injection analysis (FIA) method necessary to make it suitable for TMA-N and TVB-N determination, specifically the optimal concentrations of NaOH and formaldehyde for releasing the volatile bases from the acidic fish extract and sequestering the non-TMA volatile bases respectively. The effects of using perchloric acid (PCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as fish extractants were also investigated. The fish species used were <b>monkfish</b> (<b>Lophius</b> piscatorius), skate (Raia clavata) and cod (Gadus morrhua). It was found that 1 M NaOH was the optimal concentration for volatile base release and that 200 gl- 1 formaldehyde was adequate for non-TMA base sequestration.

Although life history {{information is available}} for smaller L. americanus, the biology of large monkfish (. 70 cm) is poorly understood because relatively few large fish are caught in standard resource surveys. Between 2006 and 2008, 699 L. americanus of 71 – 118 cm total length were collected from commercial gillnet fishers operating in the mid-Atlantic Bight (n = 689) and in the Gulf of Maine (n = 10) to investigate growth rates, reproductive biology, and feeding habits of large monkfish. All those collected were mature females {{ranging in age from}} 7 to 13 years. Growth was linear at an average annual rate of 7. 6 cm. Hepatosomatic indices peaked in February and gonadosomatic indices between February and April. Postovulatory follicles and vitellogenic oocytes were observed in the same ovaries, evidence that monkfish spawn over a protracted period and possibly more than once annually. Food habits were similar to those reported for smaller benthic phase monkfish, but cannibalism was more prevalent in large fish (5. 6 % frequency of occurrence).

Surprisingly, the abundance of adult monkfish did not differ in vs. out of the closure, and juvenile monkfish were more abundant outside of the WGMCA, where they also exhibited higher feeding intensity and consumed more prey biomass.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} age-structured maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches for stock assessment of the Namibian <b>monkfish,</b> <b>Lophius</b> vomerinus, resource with questionable data, in which time series are short, abundance indices are variable, and research data conflict with commercial data. Bayesian approaches with both noninformative and informative priors are investigated {{to determine if they}} enhance estimation stability. Three data scenarios are assessed: commercial and research survey data, research survey data only, and commercial data only. Both statistical approaches show that resource abundance has decreased with exploitable biomass estimated at approximately 44 % of pristine levels. The maximum likelihood and the Bayesian approach with noninformative priors result in similar estimates. As the abundance data contained little information pertaining to possible density dependence within the stock–recruit relationship, only a Bayesian approach with informative priors reduces uncertainty in the steepness parameter h. Estimated management quantities are sensitive both to the set of data sources and whether prior information was informative or not. The strengths of the Bayesian approach include the integration of prior information with uncertain data, the exploration of data conflicts, and the ability to show the uncertainty in estimates of management parameters. Its weakness is that estimation stability is dependent on the choice of priors, which alters some posterior distributions of management quantities...|$|R

Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of rose shrimp. The rose shrimp, shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; <b>monkfish,</b> <b>Lophius</b> budegassa; european conger, Conger conger; and great forkbeard, Phycis blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked.

40|$|Anglerfish (<b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.)</b> is {{consumed}} worldwide {{and is an}} important economic resource though its seven species are often fraudulently interchanged due to their different commercial value, especially when sold {{in the form of}} fillets or pieces. Molecular analysis is the only possible mean to verify traceability and counteract fraud. We developed two multiplex PCRs, one end-point and one real-time with melting curve post-amplification analysis, which can even be run with the simplest two-channel thermocyclers. The two methods were tested on seventy-five reference samples. Their specificity was checked in twenty more species of those most commonly available on the market and in other species of the Lophiidae family. Both methods, the choice of which depends on the equipment and budget of the lab, provide a rapid and easy-to-read response, improving both the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of existing methods for identifying Lophius species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Data from a {{monitored}} segment (about 20 vessels) of {{the fleet}} of about 6000 small vessels (less than 15 meters length overall) operating bottom-set gillnets for cod (Gadus morhua) and <b>monkfish</b> (<b>Lophius</b> piscatorius) in the Norwegian coastal zone were used to estimate the bycatch rates of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Bycatch was estimated using the traditional stratified ratio technique and a GLM-based approach. Bycatch rates were then applied to the landing statistics for the target species for the whole fleet to estimate total bycatch. The stratified ratio estimates ranged from 2211 (CV 0. 16) to 3218 (CV 0. 17) harbour porpoises, 459 (CV 0. 24) to 565 (CV 0. 18) harbour seals and 68 (CV 0. 27) to 128 (CV 0. 41) grey seals. In the model-based approaches, estimates ranged from 2317 (CV 0. 16) to 3218 (CV 0. 17) harbour porpoises, 424 (CV 0. 13) to 600 (CV 0. 31) harbour seals and 83 (CV 0. 36) grey seals. There were difficulties fitting the models, and the design-based estimators might be considered “best”. Unless the population of harbour porpoise along the Norwegian coast exceeds 176, 500 animals, then current levels of harbour porpoise bycatch are unsustainable. Current levels of harbour seal bycatch (coupled with current hunting quotas) are most likely unsustainable. Estimates for grey seal bycatch based on CRF data were not considered reliable, because of insufficient data {{and the possibility of}} seal misidentification...|$|R
40|$|The spanish {{fishing fleet}} catches deep-water species {{on both sides}} of the North Atlantic ocean. In terms of catches, the most {{important}} commercial species is the Greenland hatibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) which is caught in the NAFO Divisions 3 L, 3 M and 3 N. In this fishery most research has focused on the Greenland halibut and the paper contains some preliminary information on length distribution, spawning and feeding. The fishery first commenced in 1990 and the fishing effort increased from 9 vessels in 1990 to 33 vessels in 1993. Each vessel makes a voyage of 5 to 6 months. It is the practice to monitor catches, catch information and biological data by employing trained observers on the vessels. Spanish vessels also fish for deep-water species in the eastern North Atlantic, and the paper describes the fishery for various species of deep-water sharks in depths from 400 m to in excess of 1000 m using longlines. These fisheries take place in ICES areas VII, VIIIc and IXa. Also in the eastern Atlantic there are spanish fisheries for <b>monkfish</b> (<b>Lophius</b> piscatorius and L. budegassa) using gillnets, and a small fishery for Chaecon affinis, (formerly Geryon affinis) on the Banco de Galicia using longlines and traps.

Potential yields were estimated for the former four species using growth, natural mortality and selectivity parameters available in the literature or calculated from empirical relationships and length frequency distributions of the trawl catches. These potentials oscillated between 8 and 10 % of the total virginal biomass (Bo) and the total virginal exploitable biomass (ExBo,) for the gulf hake and the argentine hake. In relation to the siver John dory estimated maximum catches corresponded to 12. 5 % of ExBo, and 9. 5 % of Bo, whereas in the monkfish these catches were limited to 6 % of both ExBo, and Bo,. Because the available biomass estimated for these stocks in the slope waters of southeastern and southern Brazil cannot be considered as virginal, {{at least for the}} gulf hake and the argentine hake, the estimated potential yields may be generally regarded as conservative reference points.

40|$|In {{response}} to a request from the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources and fishing industry, the conversion factors used to estimate round or live weights from gutted anglerfish were re-examined. A number of data sources was available from survey data, port sampling and observer trips. In some cases, the liver is left in place when the fish are gutted. For these landings a separate conversion factor is necessary. The conversion factors {{were found to be}} independent of fish size, however, some significant differences between the data sources were found. Significant differences between the conversion factors of the two species of anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) were also found. As commercial landings of anglerfish are not usually speciated, a generic conversion factor was estimated for <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.</b> by combining the data for both species after weighting by the estimated proportions of the two species in the Irish landings.

40|$|Encourage Capital {{has worked}} with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies and The Rockefeller Foundation to develop and {{evaluate}} an impact investing strategy supporting the implementation of sustainable fishing improvements in the distressed <b>monkfish</b> (<b>Lophius</b> gastrophysus) fishery in Brazil. The Sapo Strategy (Sapo) is a hypothetical $ 11. 5 million greenfield impact investment to create Brazil's first sustainability-focused, vertically integrated seafood company, {{with the objective of}} restoring the stocks of both the monkfish and related fisheries to full productive potential. In a fishery that does not have quota or other forms of formal tenure over the resource, this approach suggests how fisheries management investments in Brazil can support the needs of a cash-constrained public sector, and yield attractive returns to investors while restoring marine ecosystems and benefiting local economies. The $ 11. 5 million investment would be predicated on working with authorities to reform fisheries policy to ensure access limitations, establish secure, stable resource tenure {{in the form of a}} "catch share" system, and strong enforcement and monitoring. The strategy would enable the design and implementation of comprehensive fishery management improvements, purchase and retire up to 15 double-rigged trawl vessels and licenses, control at least 85 % of licenses/quota and associated gillnet vessels in the monkfish fishery, and create a new monkfish processing and distribution business to manage sales and export to international buyers. Given the current challenging policy environment in Brazil, certain enabling considerations must be met in order for the strategy to be viable. Sapo is targeting an 17. 5 % base case levered (equity) IRR, with upside potential of over 30 %, while simultaneously restoring the monkfish stock biomass, generating $ 7. 9 million in additional revenues to fund gillnet fishers' incomes and offer social benefits, and increasing meals-to-market by 7. 5 million portions annually over the eleven-year investment period...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} abundance and fishing {{potential of the}} commercially valuable fishes and cephalopods with marketable size was assessed using two seasonal bottom trawl surveys performed in 2001 and 2002 on the outer shelf and upper slope (100 - 600 m depth) {{off the coast of}} southern Brazil. These surveys were part of REVIZEE, a national program designed to assess the fishery potential within the Economic Exclusive Zone. Of the 228 fish and cephalopod species caught during the surveys, only 27 species and genera were considered to be of commercial interest. Commercial-sized individuals of these species made up 52. 3 % of the total catch. The total biomass was estimated to be 167, 193 ton (± 22 %) and 165, 460 ton (± 25 %) in the winter-spring and summer-autumn surveys, respectively. The most abundant species were the Argentine short-fin squid Illex argentinas, a species with highly variable recruitment, followed by the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi, the gulf-hake Urophycis mystacea, and the <b>monkfish</b> <b>Lophius</b> gastrophysus. The latter three were intensively fished prior to the surveys, as well as the beardfish Polymixia lowei and silvery John dory Zenopsis conchifera, both relatively abundant but with a very low market value. The potential yield of the demersal fish species, not considering Illex argentinus, estimated with the Gulland equation for a mean natural mortality of M = 0. 31, was 20, 460 ton. When considering only Merluccius hubbsi, Urophycis mystacea, and Lophius gastrophysus, the potential yield decreased to 6, 625 ton. The surveys showed that the fishery potential of the outer shelf and upper slope was substantially lower than that of the inner shelf. Therefore, this environment should be carefully monitored to avoid overfishing and fast depletion...|$|R
5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} is a bycatch {{species in the}} offshore demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. Cape {{horse mackerel}} caught in the midwater trawl fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see Cape horse mackerel assessment for midwater trawl). This fishery primarily targets deepwater hake (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and <b>monkfish</b> (<b>Lophius</b> vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the discard rate for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The Cape horse mackerel is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important small pelagic species, and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades it has become {{recognised}} that an ecosystem approach is required to manage world fisheries. Management strategies must ensure that non-target (bycatch) as well as target catches are sustainable. To achieve this, detailed commercial catch and biological information is required. The composition of catches made by trawlers operating off the south and west coasts of South Africa was investigated. Distinct fishing areas were identified on each coast, based on target species and fishing depth. Catch composition differed markedly among the areas defined. Although hake Merluccius sp. dominated South Coast catches, {{a large proportion of the}} catch was composed of bycatch. On the West Coast, hake dominated catches and this domination increased with increasing depth. On both coasts approximately 90 % of the observed nominal catch was processed and landed. Estimates of annual discards suggested that the fishery discarded 38 thousand tons of fish per annum (16 % of the nominal trawl catch). The data also indicated that hake discarding, the capture of linefish and the increased targeting of high value species might be cause for concern. Spatial analysis indicated that a variety of factors such as trawling position, catch size and catch composition affects bycatch dynamics. The <b>monkfish</b> <b>Lophius</b> vomerinus is a common bycatch species that has been increasingly targeted by demersal trawlers. This study showed that L. vomerinus is a slow-growing, long-lived species (West Coast males L∞ = 68. 50 cm TL, t₀ = - 1. 69 yr, K = 0. 10 yr⁻¹; West Coast females L∞ = 110. 23 cm TL, t₀ = - 1. 54 yr, K = 0. 05 yr⁻¹; South Coast sexes combined L∞ = 70. 12 cm TL, t₀ = - 0. 80 yr, K = 0. 11 yr⁻¹), that matures at approximately 6 years of age. These traits could have serious management implications for the species. Per-recruit analysis suggested that the stock might be overexploited, although further investigation is required to confirm this. Solutions were suggested for each of the concerns raised, taking cognisance of the differences observed between the South and West Coasts and the economic dependence of South Coast companies on bycatch. The needs of future research were considered...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mercury is a {{well-known}} toxic element present in seafood. Nevertheless some antioxidants, like selenium, as an integral component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and alpha-tocopherol having a protective role against it, are present as well. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the levels of total mercury (Hg-T), organic mercury (Hg-Org), Se and alpha-tocopherol in some adult deep-water fish species caught off Portuguese waters. RESULTS: Levels of Hg-T were above EU limits in 6 % of <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.</b> and Aphanopus carbo, 2 % ofLepidorhombus spp. and 70 % of Helicolenus dactylopterus. Hg-Org represented the major fraction (more than 84 %) of Hg-T in all studied muscles. The selenium concentration in muscle was similar in all species (about 0. 4 mg kg(- 1) wet weight) and the highest level of alpha-tocopherol (70 mg kg(- 1) wet weight) was found in Aphanopus carbo. CONCLUSION: The muscle of all species studied is a good source of selenium, but only can give a small contribution of alpha-tocopherol. Attending to the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the WHO/FAO for methylmercury, it appears that the species studied should be consumed sparingly.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, a high {{percentage}} of Japanese anglerfish, Lophius litulon (Jordan, 1902), contained a microsporidian infection of the nervous tissues. Xenomas were removed and prepared for standard wax histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA extractions were performed on parasite spores and used in PCR and sequencing reactions. Fresh spores measured 3. 4 × 1. 8 µm and were uniform in size with no dimorphism observed. TEM confirmed that only a single developmental cycle and a single spore form were present. Small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences were> 99. 5 % similar to those of Spraguea lophii (Doflein, 1898) and Glugea americanus (Takvorian et Cali, 1986) from the European and American <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.</b> respectively. The microsporidian from the nervous tissue of L. litulon undoubtedly belongs in the genus Spraguea Sprague et Vávra, 1976 and the authors suggest a revision to the generic description of Spraguea to include monomorphic forms and the transfer of Glugea americanus to Spraguea americana comb. n. Since no major differences in ultrastructure or SSU rDNA sequence data exist between Spraguea americana and the microsporidian from the Japanese anglerfish, they evidently belong to the same species. This report of Spraguea americana is the first report of a Spraguea species from L. litulon and indeed from the Pacific water mass. Microsporidian parasites found in the nervous tissues of anglerfish of the genus Lophius were first reported by Thélohan (1895), who described the infection of the spinal ganglia of Lophius piscatorius (Linnaeus, 1758) collected from the Atlantic coast of France with a species of Glugea, but was unable to complete his description. Doflein (1898) found the same condition in L. piscatorius sampled from Italy, and as the parasite assemblages resembled those described by Moniez (1887) for Glugea anomala, infecting the musculature of the stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, the microsporidian from L. piscatorius was assigned to this genus an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an observer trip on a Japanese freezer longliner {{in the international}} waters of the North East Atlantic {{in the autumn of}} 1997. The observation period was 71 days during which 7 species were recorded as catch and bycatch from 57 sets. Although bluefin tuna was the target species, with 18, 894 kg gilled and gutted weight (GWT) caught, the most frequently retained species was blue shark, Prionace glauca, followed by bluefin tuna. Three shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, one swordfish, Xiphias gladius and one anglerfish, <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.,</b> were also recorded. The most frequently discarded species were lancetfish Alepisaurus ferox, and deal fish Trachipterus arcticus. Bluefin tuna ranged from 139 cm to 275 cm in fork length (FL) and from 64 kg to 347 kg in round weight (RWT) with clear modes of 190 cm and 136 kg. Recent ageing results from the North East Atlantic infer ages of 4 to 17 years old. CPUE was lower than Norwegian sponsored trials in the North East Atlantic in 1998 and similar to those computed by the Japanese longline observer programme in 2000, 2001 and 2002. There was no evidence of trend in bluefin CPUE {{over the course of the}} observation period. The modelled length weight relationship predicted higher values than established length weight relationships for bluefin tuna in the East Atlantic: ICCAT modelled RWT for East Atlantic bluefin was 87 % of the observed round weight and 90 % of the predicted RWT value for Koshin Maru # 8 tuna. Over the observation period the condition of bluefin tuna was found to decline and examination of stomachs showed that most were empty or contained low numbers of prey items. Declining condition factors and apparent scarcity of prey are discussed in the context of CPUE. Prey scarcity reflected in declining condition may increase the effectiveness of baited hooks causing abundance estimates derived from CPUE series to over-estimate the population of bluefin tuna in the North East Atlantic. Investigation of condition indices has the potential to estimate stock ratios in longline catches in the North Atlantic. All observed blue shark catch were female with lengths ranging from 140 cm to 250 cm. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} abundance and fishing {{potential of the}} commercially valuable fishes and cephalopods with marketable size was assessed using two seasonal bottom trawl surveys performed in 2001 and 2002 on the outer shelf and upper slope (100 - 600 m depth) {{off the coast of}} southern Brazil. These surveys were part of REVIZEE, a national program designed to assess the fishery potential within the Economic Exclusive Zone. Of the 228 fish and cephalopod species caught during the surveys, only 27 species and genera were considered to be of commercial interest. Commercial-sized individuals of these species made up 52. 3 % of the total catch. The total biomass was estimated to be 167, 193 ton (± 22 %) and 165, 460 ton (± 25 %) in the winter-spring and summer-autumn surveys, respectively. The most abundant species were the Argentine short-fin squid Illex argentinas, a species with highly variable recruitment, followed by the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi, the gulf-hake Urophycis mystacea, and the <b>monkfish</b> <b>Lophius</b> gastrophysus. The latter three were intensively fished prior to the surveys, as well as the beardfish Polymixia lowei and silvery John dory Zenopsis conchifera, both relatively abundant but with a very low market value. The potential yield of the demersal fish species, not considering Illex argentinus, estimated with the Gulland equation for a mean natural mortality of M = 0. 31, was 20, 460 ton. When considering only Merluccius hubbsi, Urophycis mystacea, and Lophius gastrophysus, the potential yield decreased to 6, 625 ton. The surveys showed that the fishery potential of the outer shelf and upper slope was substantially lower than that of the inner shelf. Therefore, this environment should be carefully monitored to avoid overfishing and fast depletion. Se evaluó la abundancia relativa y el potencial pesquero de peces y cefalópodos de especies y tamaños de valor comercial en dos muéstreos estacionales con redes de arrastre de fondo realizados en los años 2001 y 2002 sobre la plataforma externa y talud superior, 100 a 600 m de profundidad, a lo largo del extremo sur de la costa brasilera, como parte de un programa nacional de evaluación del potencial pesquero de la Zona Económica Exclusiva (Programa REVIZEE). Del total de 228 especies de peces y cefalópodos capturados, sólo 27 especies y géneros fueron considerados de interés comercial. Los tamaños comercializables de estas especies representaron 52, 3 %) de la captura total. La biomasa total estimada fue de 167. 193 ton (± 22 %>) y 165. 460 ton (± 25 %>) en los muéstreos de invierno-primavera y verano-otoño respectivamente. Las especies más abundantes fueron el calamar argentino Illex argentinus, especie de reclutamiento muy variable, seguido de la merluza argentina Merluccius hubbsi, la brotóla de profundidad Urophycis mystacea, el pez sapo o rapé Lophius gastrophysus, estas últimas intensamente explotadas en la época de los levantamientos, así como también Polymixia lowei y Zenopsis conchifera, ambas relativamente abundantes pero de escaso valor comercial. El rendimiento potencial de especies demersales excluido Illex argentinus, estimado a través de la ecuación de Gulland para un coeficiente de mortalidad natural medio de M = 0, 31, fue de 20. 460 ton. Cuando sólo Merluccius hubbsi, Urophycis mystacea y Lophius gastrophysus fueron considerados, el potencial disminuye a 6. 625 ton. Los mustreos mostraron que el potencial pesquero de la plataforma continental externa y el talud superior es substancialmente inferior al de la plataforma interna, por lo tanto, este ambiente debe ser cuidadosamente controlado para evitar la sobrepesca y rápida depleción...|$|R
40|$|The Planning Group on Commercial Catches, Discards and Biological Sampling [PGCCDBS] (Co-Chairs: Mike Armstrong, UK, and Gráinne Ní Chonchúir, Ireland) met in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 18 th February – 22 nd February 2013, in {{parallel}} with the Mediterranean Planning Group for Methodological Development (PGMed). The PGCCDBS was established in 2002 {{in response to the}} EC-ICES Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requesting ICES to provide support for the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). It implements the ICES Quality Assurance Framework to ensure that data sets and parameters supporting assessments and advice for the ICES area are based on i) statistically-sound sampling schemes; ii) correct and consistent inter-pretation of biological material such as otoliths and gonads; iii) technology that im-proves accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection; iv) comprehensive and easily sourced documentation, and v) efficient collaboration between PGCCDBS, ex-pert groups and other bodies in relation to data collection. The 2013 meeting of PGCCDBS focused on work completed since last year, and planned work for 2013 and 2014, in the following topics which formed the basis of the Terms of Reference: Stock-based biological parameters from sampling of fishery and survey catches (age, growth, maturity, fecundity, sex ratio) - Fleet/métier related variables (discards estimates and length/age composi-tions of landings and discards) and statistical design of sampling schemes - Data collection technology (hardware, and software such as WebGR and the Regional Data bases). - Implementation of the ICES Quality Assurance Framework - Addressing recommendations and requests for advice from ICES expert groups (including through PGCCDBS data contact persons), and RCMs. During 2013, the PGCCDBS was requested to address an additional Term of Refer-ence as follows: a) Identify reasons for differences between raised discards estimates provided by ICES and STECF, and make recommendations on how to resolve this problem in the short and longer term. The PGCCDBS met in plenary with PGMed to review the outcomes {{of a wide range of}} workshops and age exchanges conducted since PGCCDBS 2012 and the workplan for 2013. On the basis of this and the PGCCDBS long term planning process, further workshops and exchanges were proposed for 2014 and beyond. These include: - Age and maturity workshops: WKSABCAL, the Workshop on the Statistical Analysis of Biological Calibration Studies (which had been postponed); WKARA, workshop on age reading of anglerfish <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp</b> will be con-sidered during the 2014 meeting, and a workshop will be proposed for 2015 if any advances in the knowledge of age reading of anglerfish have been made. - Sampling design workshops: in order to take forward the work of the series of WKPICS (Workshop on the Practical Implementation of Statistical Sound catch Sampling Programmes) and SGPIDS (Study Group on Practical Implementation of Discard Sampling Plans) which finish in 2013, PGCCDBS proposes the establishment of a Working Group on Commercial Catches to provide ongoing support for the design, implementation and analysis of sampling programmes for commercial fisheries. - Large-scale age exchanges: Whiting (Merlangius merlangus); Megrim (Lepidorhombus spp); Sole(Solea solea); Sprat (Sprattus sprattus, all areas); Horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. picturatus and T. mediterraneus) - PGCCDBS 2013 also updated the list of national age readers and co-ordinators, and this updated list was uploaded onto the European Age Readers Forum (EARF). Other proposals developed by PGCCDBS are: - Proposals for study contracts on i) anglerfish ageing (Lophius piscatorius); ii) Study proposal on age determination and maturity staging of species not previously subjected to biological sampling for analytical assessments. - Proposal for a training course covering the design of statistically sound catch sampling for fisheries monitoring programmes - ICES cooperative research report (CRR) on the Protocols on the ageing of dif-ferent fish species in the ICES area. PGCCDBS further developed its proposal for the CRR and and developed a work plan for this. PGCCDBS developed work plans for intersessional work related to development of Quality Assurance reports for fishery sampling, including testing a prototype QA report with selected ICES stock assessment expert groups, and circulating a ques-tionnaire to collect information on national approaches to the construction and appli-cation of age-length keys. The ToR’s for PGCCDBS 2014 were also discussed and agreed, see Annex 11, and it was also agreed that the PGCCDBS 2014 meeting will be held in Constanta, Romania, Monday the 10 th of February – Friday the 14 st of February 2014...|$|R
