Typically, they are dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> beef broth and <b>a</b> little <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fresh sage and <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> sauce, {{as a complex}} sauce would detract from the flavours in the agnolotti pockets.

60|$|This I {{would not}} hear of, {{so he took}} the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and it {{acquired}} additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.|$|R

2500|$|Tea tree oil {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as a treatment for}} head lice; however, evidence of its effectiveness is weak. A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil for children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, because of contraindications, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge about the oil's safety and effectiveness. Other home remedies such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> the hair have been partially disproven, The use of plastic bags may be dangerous. [...] Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that swimming has no effect on treating lice, and can in fact harm the treatment by commercial products. Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, common alcohol) is toxic to arthropods including lice and an external application of it is harmless to humans.|$|R

25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} <b>melt</b> <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill <b>a</b> steak <b>in</b> minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|R
