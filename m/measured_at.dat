5|$|Grave Circle A, with a {{diameter}} of , is situated on the acropolis of Mycenae southeast of the Lion Gate.

40|$|AbstractFor {{sustainability}} to {{be realized}} the automotive companies need to cascade down their strategies to all business functions, including maintenance. Maintenance objectives at the operational level shall be aligned with business strategies at the corporate level by defining key performance <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> each level. This paper developed the initial framework for measuring sustainable maintenance performance (SMP) where 15 <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> the corporate level, 20 <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> the tactical level and 43 <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> the functional level, are identified. In sequence, this paper established the importance level of these measures through a pilot survey in Malaysian automotive companies. The {{findings of this study}} are concluded by recommending all proposed measures as important. The total of lubricants consumption has been considered as the most crucial <b>measure</b> <b>at</b> the functional level, while learning and growth is the most vital perspective, and furthermore, social factor is becoming a more important in measuring SMP...|$|R

5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> four to six times the speed of light.

However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14b is {{the sole}} planet {{discovered}} in the Kepler-14 system to date. The planet orbits the primary star in the Kepler-14 binary system. Kepler-14b is estimated to have 8.40 Jupiter masses and 1.136 Jupiter radii. In other words, the planet is 8.4 times more massive than Jupiter, but only 1.136 times Jupiter's size. This equates to a high density, which is <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> 7.1 g cm−3. According to the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, which calculated Kepler-14b's eccentricity independently, Kepler-14b has a slightly irregular orbit, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.035. Kepler-14b takes approximately 6.79 days to orbit its host star. The mean distance from its host star is about 8.213 times the measured radius of Kepler-14.|$|E
