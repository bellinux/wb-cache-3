50|$|Shape memory heparin {{mimicking}} polymers {{can be used}} {{to create}} devices that extract hemorrhaging tissue. <b>Microactuator</b> (right) is a prototype endovascular electromechanical clot-extraction device. This device consists of electromechanical <b>microactuator</b> mounted on the distal tip of either a Prowler-14 microcatheter The <b>microactuator</b> is fabricated using a shape memory polymer (SMP) shell over a shape memory nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol) wire backbone with attached copper leads to deliver a current. The <b>microactuator</b> maintains a straight rod shape until the applied current, provided by a DC power supply, heating the nitinol wire, causing the <b>microactuator</b> to transform into a corkscrew shape capable of retrieving a blood clot. At body temperature, the overlying SMP is in a glassy state and maintains the nitinol tightly coiled configuration in a straight form for endovascular delivery. Once the <b>microactuator</b> is positioned beyond the clot, joule heating is initiated. As the surrounding SMP is heated by conduction to its characteristic glass-transition temperature (Tg ≈ 80 °C), it transitions to its rubbery state, allowing the nitinol to resume its corkscrew shape. Retrieval of the blood clot occurs through a pull back motion. The nitinol is engulfed in a tight space even though it is expanding and as a result retreats thus extracting the tissue.|$|E

40|$|<b>Microactuators</b> are versatile, low-cost, low-mass electrical-mechanical {{devices that}} can be used in many applications. <b>Microactuators</b> consist of two {{electrodes}} sandwiching a PZT (piezo-electric) film between them. The centers of the <b>microactuators</b> deflect when a voltage is applied across the electrodes. In order to correctly apply this technology for use, it is important to fully characterize the actuation behavior. Measuring the deflection profile as a function of the voltage of various <b>microactuators</b> is crucial. This measurement process has errors associated with it, so it is being studied to determine the accuracy of the data. In certain applications, <b>microactuators</b> may undergo many cycles of deflection; testing various <b>microactuators</b> through many cycles of deflection simulates these circumstances. However, due to an unknown issue, many of the <b>microactuators</b> exhibit defects that cause them to fail when voltage is applied to their electrodes. These defects do not allow for the acquisition of significant deflection profiles. Vibrations are the largest cause of error in deflection measurements, and the <b>microactuators</b> withstand continuous cycles of deflection, yet the cause of damage is still to be determined. Future projects will be needed to characterize the deflection profiles of various <b>microactuators</b> and to overcome the defects in the <b>microactuators</b> that are currently present...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of electrically-powered, lamination-based <b>microactuators</b> for the realization of large arrays of high impulse and short duration micro-jets with potential applications {{in the field of}} micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). <b>Microactuators</b> offer unique control opportunities by converting the input electrical or chemical energy stored in a propellant into useful mechanical energy. This small and precise control obtained can potentially be applied towards aerodynamic control and transdermal drug delivery applications. This thesis discusses {{the development of}} both chemical and physical <b>microactuators</b> and characterizes their performance with focus towards the feasibility of using them for a specific application. The development of electrically powered <b>microactuators</b> starts by fabricating an array of radially firing <b>microactuators</b> using lamination-based micro fabrication techniques that potentially enable batch fabrication at low cost. The <b>microactuators</b> developed in this thesis consist of three main parts: a micro chamber in which the propellant is stored; two electrode structures through which electrical energy is supplied to the propellant; and a micro nozzle through which the propellant or released gases from the propellant are expanded as a jet. The fabricated actuators are then integrated with MEMS-process-compatible propellants and optimized to produce rapid ignition of the propellant and generate a fluidic jet. This rapid ignition is achieved either by making the propellant itself conductive, thus, passing an electric current directly through the propellant; or by discharging an arc across the propellant by placing it between two closely spaced electrodes. The first concept is demonstrated with chemical <b>microactuators</b> for the application of projectile maneuvering and the second concept is demonstrated with physical <b>microactuators</b> for transdermal drug delivery application. For both the actuators, the propellant integrated <b>microactuators</b> are characterized for performance in terms of impulse delivered, thrust generated and duration of the jet. The experimentally achieved results are validated by comparing with results from theoretical modeling. Finally, the feasibility of using chemical <b>microactuators</b> for maneuvering the path of a 25 mm projectile spinning at 500 Hz is discussed and the feasibility of applying the physical <b>microactuators</b> for increasing skin's permeability to drug analog molecules is studied.
