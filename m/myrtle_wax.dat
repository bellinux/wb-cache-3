25|$|The Indian {{trade was}} {{generally}} an exchange between the colonies and Native Americans of the commodities each party desired {{but did not}} produce. The company was a major buyer from the Indians of hogs and cattle: either live on the hoof, as smoked or salted meat, or as skins. It also purchased indigo plants, hides, furs, corn, cattle, tallow, pitch, tar, hickory nut oil, tobacco, <b>myrtle</b> <b>wax,</b> salted wild beef, sassafras, canes and truck produce in exchange for weapons, gunpowder, tools, cloths, dyes, liquor, and various trinkets. Packhorse trains were outfitted with European-made goods—primarily guns, powder, flint, rum, and various dry goods—at Pensacola and the company's other warehouses, then sent to Indian villages in the interior, from which they returned with deerskins, furs, bear oil, honey, and foodstuffs. The company's agents ran stores in Indian villages scattered from the St. Johns River in East Florida to the Mississippi, and from the Gulf coast to Tennessee. The depot at Pensacola comprised a store and warehouses where the furs and skins were sorted and packed for shipment to foreign markets in schooners or brigantines belonging to the firm's fleet of fifteen vessels.|$|E

40|$|Interactions between fruiting {{plant and}} frugivorous species are {{considered}} to be highly generalized, resulting in diffuse mutualisms. Specialization has frequently been found to be either asymmetrical or the result of restricted options for frugivores. This dissertation documents a highly unusual case of reciprocal specialization between the myrtle group of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata coronata) and <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> (Myrica cerifera). Far from being {{one of a group of}} ecologically redundant dispersers, these warblers are the most valuable quantitative and qualitative contributors to this plant's recruitment on Assateague Island National Seashore, U. S. A. Fecal samples collected over four years from migrant and wintering passerines and feeding trials in two years demonstrated that <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> fruit was both the most preferred fruit and a consistently major food item for myrtle warblers throughout a 7 -month residence. Abundance of <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> fruit significantly affected this warbler's abundance in all years. Similarly, compared to all other frugivorous species, myrtle warbler were the most frequent and consistent consumer of <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> fruit in all years. <b>Wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> seed dispersal was significantly affected by yellow-rumped warbler abundance. In order to evaluate disperser contributions to <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle,</b> I examined factors influencing seedling recruitment. Data derived from three sources 1) seed trap data from three replicated habitats, 2) experimental evaluation of the effect of time and place of seed deposition, and 3) seedling surveys confirmed that deposition was wide-spread, lasting until late April. Recruitment was greatest in both scrub and meadow habitats, but seeds deposited in meadows, especially in spring, established at higher rates than in scrub because of post-dispersal predation rates associated with microhabitat seed deposition patterns of predation among habitats. Fecal samples and observations indicated that <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> has three primary dispersers: myrtle warblers, gray catbirds and tree swallows. Myrtle warblers, the only documented disperser after December, provided the greatest quantitative dispersal services. Although the germination rate and time of ingested seeds were unaffected by species identity of dispersers, post-foraging observations demonstrated that myrtle warblers were most likely to be the agent of <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> seed emigration from established thickets to sites suitable for colonization...|$|R

40|$|Exotic tree Melaleuca quinquenervia (melaleuca) {{deposits}} {{large quantities}} of slowly decomposing litter biomass that accumulates over time and covers forest floors in its adventive habitats in Florida (USA). Herein, we assessed the influence of melaleuca litter cover, seed addition, and seeding date on seedling emergence and survival. The assessment was conducted by ma-nipulating litter cover and seed inputs of melaleuca and two native species at different dates in two soil types. Litter cover was either removed or left in place in organic and arenaceous soils within melaleuca stands. Each of the three treatment plots were seeded with melaleuca, <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> or sawgrass, while the fourth plot was not seeded and served as the control. Seedlings were counted at 2 -wk intervals to determine cumulative seedling emergence and survival during the experimental period. The experiment was repeated four times within a year. Soil type did not influence seedling emergence of all three species but influenced survival of <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle.</b> Litter removal increased the emergence of melaleuca, sawgrass, and <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> and increased the survival of melaleuca. Seed addition increased the emergence and survival of sawgrass and <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle</b> but made no difference for melaleuca. Seeding during the periods of high soil moisture content had positive effects on the emergence and survival of melaleuca, <b>wax</b> <b>myrtle,</b> and sawgrass seedlings. These findings are deemed useful in planning active restoration for melaleuca invaded sites...|$|R
