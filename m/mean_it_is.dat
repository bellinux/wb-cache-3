5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky came out in a paperback format in 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have given it a Hugo ... I <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sort of a hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky."

500|$|SmarTrip and CharmCard have {{different}} qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such as employee transit benefits) are stored {{on the card}} in a separate [...] "purse" [...] from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA {{even if it was}} loaded on a CharmCard. This does <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to have identical or different passes (like a monthly pass from one and a day pass from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass.|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

[...] This moderation, [...] "seeking what is allowed rather than forbidden", is manifest in three ways. Firstly, along with the Haredi community, the ideology demands adherence to the halakha; however it is not insistent that strictures (chumras) are normative, rather, these are a matter of personal choice (see 3.1 and 4.1 under Modern Orthodox Judaism). Secondly, relative to the Haredi community - but less so than in non-orthodox communities - women are starting to play a public role within the community (in roles other than strictly religious). Thirdly, the movement will engage with the broader Jewish community, as discussed below, and with the secular world, as opposed to the Haredi approach of minimizing such contact.|$|E
