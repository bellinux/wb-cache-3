40|$|In the {{literary}} {{part of the}} diploma thesis, {{a brief overview of}} the current state in the tractor design has been done, concentrating onto such elements that lead to lowering of fuel consumption. The practical part is based on the realized solution. The target of the measurement was to prove the influence of adjusting of the three-point hitch onto the output parameters of ploughing sets, consisting of the Zetor Forterra 140 HSX tractor and Kverneland 150 B <b>mounted</b> <b>plough</b> or Kverneland PN 100 semi-mounted plough. The essence of the measurement was gradual shortening of the upper linkage of the three-point hitch, whereas simultaneously with shortening of the linkage, the force on the linkage was rising. The force was measured by means of strain gauge Hotinger U 2 A. In case of the <b>mounted</b> <b>plough</b> it has been proved that shortening of the upper linkage causes rising of the force. That shifts part of the plough weight onto the rear wheels of the tractor, resulting in lower wheel slipping and lower fuel consumption...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted for two consecutive seasons (1990 / 1991 and 1991 / 1992) {{at the farm}} of Tamboul testing and training center (Gezira State, Sudan), where the soil is heavy cracking clay, to investigate the effect of both rear wheel track width settings and the working depth on the tractive performance of a two-wheel drive tractor working with both <b>mounted</b> disc <b>plough</b> and trailed offset disc harrow. Three track width settings namely 140, 160, 180 cm and two working depths, shallow and deep were used to evaluate their effects on the engine fuel consumption, rear wheel slip, available drawbar power and the tractive power efficiency, using a <b>mounted</b> disc <b>plough</b> or trailed offset disc harrow. It was found that generally wider track widths and shallow depths improved the tractor field performance. Significant decrease (at 1 % level) in fuel consumption was observed when disc plough was used. Combining track width of 160 cm or 180 cm and working at shallow depths gave a reduction of 28 % fuel consumption when the disc plough was used. The disc harrow showed no significant differences (at 5 % level) between such combinations. The wider track width settings (160 and 180 cm) {{were found to have}} a highl...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Jewish {{historian}} Josephus, {{a certain}} Terentius Rufus (sic) {{was left to}} command the Roman army in Jerusalem after the Romans had sacked the city in 68 CE, during the First Jewish Revolt. When the arch-enemy Simon bar Giora was eventually caught and brought to him after hiding in an underground cavern in Jerusalem's Temple Mount, Terentius Rufus ordered that the Temple <b>Mount</b> be <b>ploughed</b> up in hopes of discovering other hideaways from the war. Whether this Terentius Rufus refers to the same Quintus Tineius Rufus who was made Consul suffectus some 59 years later is reasonably doubted.|$|R

40|$|The ledeburitic {{tool steels}} {{which used to}} be used mainly for cutting and shaping tools {{nowadays}} are frequently used for a manufacture of injection moulds, moulds for pressure castings of aluminium alloys and for moulds for ceramics processing. The article deals with findings of ledeburitic tool steels resistance against abrasive wear. For the tests there were prepared the test samples of ledeburitic tool steels 19 436 and 19 573 (both according to ČSN). Moreover there were prepared the samples from structural abrasion resistant material Hardox 450 and from unalloyed structural steel 11 373 (according to ČSN). A wear resistance was examined by means of a laboratory test with an abrasive cloth and the Bond’s device. Hereafter the article deals with a possibility of utilisation of ledeburitic alloyed steels for a manufacture of tools for a land processing. For the examination of a resistance against wear in land there was made a plough test in which the tested samples were <b>mounted</b> on <b>plough</b> blades. By means of both the laboratory and operational tests there was found multiple higher resistance against wear of ledeburitic tool steels rather than of structural steels. During a land processing there was found unsuitability of steels processed for a maximum hardness, which came out as fractures of several samples...|$|R
25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible <b>ploughs,</b> <b>mounted</b> on a tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have {{between two and}} as many as seven mouldboards– and semi-mounted ploughs (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can have as many as eighteen mouldboards. The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from the tractor so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough a two or three mouldboards-plough can be mounted {{on the front of the}} tractor if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|R
50|$|The {{reversible}} plough has two mouldboard <b>ploughs</b> <b>mounted</b> back-to-back, one {{turning to the}} right, {{the other to the}} left. While one is working the land, the other is carried upside-down in the air. At the end of each row, the paired ploughs are turned over, so the other can be used. This returns along the next furrow, again working the field in a consistent direction.These ploughs date {{back to the days of}} the steam engine and the horse. In almost universal use on farms, they have right- and left-handed mouldboards enabling them to work up and down the same furrow. Reversible ploughs may either be mounted or semi-mounted and are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|R
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of mines in the Caprivi and other rural areas posed a serious {{concern to the}} South African government, as they were relatively easy for a PLAN cadre to conceal and plant with minimal chance of detection. Sweeping the roads for mines with hand held mine detectors was possible, but too slow and tedious to be a practical means of ensuring swift police movement or keeping routes open for civilian use. The SADF possessed some mine clearance equipment, including flails and <b>ploughs</b> <b>mounted</b> on tanks, but these were not considered practical either. The sheer distances of road vulnerable to PLAN sappers every day was simply too vast for daily detection and clearance efforts. For the SADF and the police, the only other viable option was the adoption of armoured personnel carriers with mine-proof hulls that could move quickly on roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was encountered. This would evolve into {{a new class of}} military vehicle, the mine resistant and ambush protected vehicle (MRAP). By the end of 1972, the South African police were carrying out most of their patrols in the Caprivi Strip with mineproofed vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the issues of {{controllability}} of machine-tractor units based on wheel-type tractors during their non-straight driving on the soil surface, which is positioned at an angle to the horizon. There were obtained analytical expressions for the determination of the actual indicator of control λd, including both the power and the design parameters of the machine-tractor unit, which affect the abovementioned indicator in the longitudinal vertical plane. These expressions are obtained for the tractor driving on both road and also driving during field operation. In addition, the paper discusses the conditions under which there may occur the cross-slip of the tractor steering wheels in the transversal horizontal plane. As a result of this review, there were obtained the analytical expressions for determining the required indicator of the controllability λd of machine-tractor unit in the horizontal plane, excluding the possibility of lateral sliding of the unit by turning its steering wheels at a certain angle. These expressions are obtained for the two modes of the machine-tractor unit: for driving during transport on the road and during the operation in the field. The machine-tractor unit based on the wheel-type tractor with rear <b>mounted</b> 3 -mouldboard <b>plough</b> was analytically investigated. By means of computer calculations, there was observed the fact that when moving in non-straight direction on the soil surface, inclined to the horizon at an angle of 12 °, the machine-tractor unit is controllable only when the angles of the steering wheel of the given tractor do not exceed 9 °. During the working movement (ploughing) of the given machine-tractor unit on an inclined field surface, its controllability will be preserved on condition that the angle of the tractor steering wheels does not exceed 11 °. According to obtained results, it can be stated that the controllability of the machine-tractor unit is determined by the indicator of controllability, taking into account the value of the vertical load acting on the tractor steering wheels, the possibility of their turning in the horizontal plane, as well as the withdrawal of the machine-tractor unit from rectilinear motion and its movement on the field surface, inclined at an angle to the horizon...|$|R
