The average yearly temperature has decreased to 9.45°C compared to 9.55°C previously and in contrast <b>most</b> <b>places</b> of the UK have become warmer. The days have become cooler and the nights warmer. Winters have become much milder, summers cooler. Leeming now gets an additional 44.7mm of rain per year, although also 62.3 more hours of sunshine. The climate of Leeming has generally lost its characteristics of being drier and with more seasonal variation, compared {{with the rest of}} the UK. Leeming recorded its warmest December temperature on record in 2015.|$|E

5|$|After the {{generally}} failed assaults on the bridges, the German divisions began crossing attempts over the rivers IJssel and Maas. The first waves typically were destroyed, due to insufficient preparatory {{fire on the}} pillboxes. At <b>most</b> <b>places</b> a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges; but at some, as Venlo, the attempt was aborted. At Arnhem, Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the assault and that day advanced to the Grebbe Line, followed by 207. Infanteriedivision.|$|E
5|$|All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division-the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in {{line from}} north to south-crossed during the night to {{the east side of}} the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in <b>most</b> <b>places</b> very shallow.|$|E
5|$|In <b>most</b> <b>places</b> on Fishing Creek, {{there is}} not enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E

5|$|The {{main unit}} of local {{government}} was the parish, and since it was {{also part of the}} church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including fornication, drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking. The main focus was on the poor and the landlords ("lairds") and gentry, and their servants, were not subject to the parish's discipline. The policing system weakened after 1800 and disappeared in <b>most</b> <b>places</b> by the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for <b>most</b> <b>places,</b> some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In <b>most</b> <b>places</b> the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E

5|$|Animals form another {{important}} part of the house sparrow's diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, dipteran flies, and aphids are especially important. Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. Young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching. They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In <b>most</b> <b>places,</b> grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings. True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young. House sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. <b>Most</b> <b>places</b> have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1982, education in both English and French has been available in <b>most</b> <b>places</b> across Canada. Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for education provision. The mandatory school age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent. In 2002, 43 percent of Canadians aged 25 to 64 possessed a post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34, the rate of post-secondary education reached 51 percent. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates that Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading.|$|E

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog occurs on three islands off {{the east coast}} of Australia: Kooragang and Broughton Islands off Port Stephens, and Bowen Island at Jervis Bay. It was {{introduced}} to New Zealand in the 1860s, and it is now common in the part of the North Island north of Rotorua. In <b>most</b> <b>places,</b> it is the only frog species in the vicinity. However, recent declines have been reported, suspected to be due to predatory fish. It was also introduced to the Pacific island countries of New Caledonia and Vanuatu in the 19th century, and has since become common there.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups because it is more expensive and larger than <b>most</b> <b>places</b> where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division—the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in {{line from}} north to south—crossed during the night to {{the east side of}} the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in <b>most</b> <b>places</b> very shallow. The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry. The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at <b>most</b> <b>places.</b> Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
5|$|When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13thcentury, new walls {{surrounding}} the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, {{with a narrow}} gap between them {{in the west and}} south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in <b>most</b> <b>places,</b> it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving slowly}} {{for a few}} days, Hurricane Fernanda {{produced}} high surf along the eastern shores of the Hawaiian Islands. The rough waves prompted the closure of several beaches in Maui and the Big Island. Wave heights reached 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 m) in <b>most</b> <b>places,</b> while portions of Maui experienced up to 20 foot (6 m) waves. The surf damaged coastal roads along most of the islands, and some homes were flooded. One home in Maui was moved several feet off of its foundation due to the waves. In the harbor at Hilo, one boat was damaged and another was destroyed, and in the Puna district, 12 homes were damaged. Although the hurricane remained away from the islands, moisture from Fernanda combined with an upper-level trough to produce rainfall across the state. Precipitation was heaviest in Kauai, where some minor flooding was reported. After Fernanda became extratropical in the shipping lanes of the north Pacific, several vessels reported gale force winds.|$|E
