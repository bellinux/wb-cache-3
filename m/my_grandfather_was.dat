2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The odd {{thing is that}} my father was such a good story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> buried. It was if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} {{extensive}} literary analysis {{has been questioned}} by several prominent artists. Vladimir Nabokov once wrote that good readers do not read books, and particularly those which {{are considered to be}} literary masterpieces, [...] "for the academic purpose of indulging in generalizations". At a 1986 Copenhagen conference of James Joyce scholars, Stephen J. Joyce (the modernist writer's grandson) said, [...] "If <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> here, he would have died laughing ... Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man can be picked up, read, and enjoyed by virtually anybody without scholarly guides, theories, and intricate explanations, as can Ulysses, if you forget about all the hue and cry." [...] He later questioned whether anything has been added to the legacy of Joyce's art by the 261 books of literary criticism stored in the Library of Congress.|$|E

60|$|Well, gentlemen, <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> {{on his way}} to England, {{for which}} he {{intended}} to embark at Ostend;--bad luck to the place for one where I was kept by storms and head winds for three long days, and the divil of a jolly companion or pretty face to comfort me. Well, as I was saying, <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> {{on his way to}} England, or rather to Ostend--no matter which, it's all the same. So one evening, towards nightfall, he rode jollily into Bruges. Very like you all know Bruges, gentlemen, a queer, old-fashioned Flemish town, once they say a great place for trade and money-making, in old times, when the Mynheers were in their glory; but almost as large and as empty as an Irishman's pocket at the present day.|$|E

"Captain Paul," [...] said I, [...] "MacMuir {{has told}} me of your trouble. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>is</b> rich, and not lacking in gratitude,"--here I paused for {{suitable}} words, as I could not solve his expression,--"you, sir, whose bravery and charity will have restored me to him, shall not want for friends and money." ...|$|R

'As for that,' said Ferdinand moodily, {{yet with}} {{the air of a}} banished prince, 'Felix knows what my father was; and if I knew that <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> an honest man, it would be well.

60|$|Well, gentlemen, <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> {{shown to}} his quarters, {{up a huge}} Staircase {{composed}} of loads of hewn timber; and through long rigmarole passages, hung with blackened paintings of fruit, and fish, and game, and country frollics, and huge kitchens, and portly burgomasters, such as you see about old-fashioned Flemish inns, till at length he arrived at his room.|$|E

"It was {{a tempting}} morning {{for a ride}} before breakfast," [...] said Arthur; [...] "and I used to like breakfasting with you so when I was reading with you. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>is</b> always a few degrees colder at breakfast {{than at any other}} hour in the day. I think his morning bath doesn't agree with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was in the}} {{fortress}} that my grandfather found himself together with Sergeant Peter. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> a neighbour of the S--------- family in the country {{but he did not}} know Prince Roman, who however knew his name perfectly well.

"In my case, it {{certainly}} should, as I understand my father, and indeed have myself seen, by the accounts rendered to me, {{that not one}} dollar of rent has ever yet left the settlement, {{to go into the}} pocket of the owner of the estate--nay, that the direct outlays of <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>were</b> considerable, in addition to the first cost of the patent." ...|$|R

60|$|Thus it chanced {{that when}} he had sailed from Yarmouth a year and six months, there came {{a letter from the}} abbot of the monastery in Seville to his brother, the prior of St. Mary's at Bungay, saying that my father had fled from the monastery, leaving no trace of where he had gone. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> grieved at this tidings, but said little about it.|$|E

6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> a bold dragoon, for it's a profession, d'ye see, {{that has}} {{run in the}} family.

Well, my grandfather, as I said, was a bold dragoon, and had served in the Low Countries. In fact, he was one of that very army, which, {{according}} to my uncle Toby, [...] "swore so terribly in Flanders." [...] He could swear a good stick himself; and, moreover, was the very man that introduced the doctrine Corporal Trim mentions, of radical heat and radical moisture; or, in other words, the mode of keeping out the damps of ditch water by burnt brandy. Be that as it may, it's nothing to the purport of my story. I only tell it to show you that <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>was</b> a man not easily to be humbugged. He had seen service; or, according to his own phrase, [...] "he had seen the devil"--and that's saying everything.|$|E
