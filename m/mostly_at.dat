5|$|With {{the end of}} the Dardanelles Campaign in January 1916, British {{naval forces}} in the area were reorganized, and Agamemnon became part of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, which was re-designated the Aegean Squadron in August 1917. Under both names, the {{squadron}} was dispersed throughout the area to protect Allied-held islands, support the British Army at Salonika, and guard against any attempted breakout from the Dardanelles by the German battlecruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau. Agamemnon spent the remainder of the war based at Salonika and Mudros, alternating between the two bases with her sister Lord Nelson; Agamemnon was based <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Mudros, Lord Nelson <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Salonika. While carrying out these duties, Agamemnon damaged the German Zeppelin LZ85 on 5 May at Salonika with a shell from a 12-pounder and forced it to crash-land.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} started in the early 1980s with Tom Mankiewicz {{assigned}} to write the script. The screenplay would instead be crafted by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., both of Top Gun fame. The project also went through directors Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Walter Hill, and Richard Benjamin {{before the arrival of}} Beatty. Filming was <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Universal Studios. Danny Elfman was hired to compose the film score, and the music was featured on three separate soundtrack albums.|$|E

5|$|Election Special is the 2012 fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Cooder {{continued}} writing topical and storyline-inspired songs. Displeased {{with the}} Republican Party and its financial supporters, {{he also wanted}} to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012, which he {{believed to be a}} critical event in the country's history. Election Special was recorded <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} Fifteenth Amendment was {{ratified}} in 1870, {{differences between the}} two organizations remained. The AWSA worked almost exclusively for women's suffrage while the NWSA initially worked {{on a wide range of}} issues, including divorce reform and equal pay for women. The AWSA included both men and women among its leadership while the NWSA was led by women. The AWSA worked for suffrage <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> the state level while the NWSA worked more at the national level. The AWSA cultivated an image of respectability while the NWSA sometimes used confrontational tactics.|$|E
5|$|Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 1,000 and 26,000 vehicles per day used the highway, <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> the SR16 interchange in Tacoma. The Point DefianceTahlequah ferry carried 650,000 passengers and 383,000 vehicles in 2012, according to WSF statistics.|$|E

The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps {{to create a}} background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes {{in the basement and}} instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology {{has changed}} over time to {{accommodate}} the evolution of their culture, of which mythology, both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions, is an index of the changes. In Greek mythology's surviving literary forms, as found <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} progressive changes, it is inherently political, as Gilbert Cuthbertson has argued.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. Around a million people were killed using this method, <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Auschwitz. Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use on humans. Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but still has industrial applications. Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia-Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974.|$|E

5|$|The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm, {{also called}} the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm, El Cordonazo, The Lash of St. Francis was a tropical cyclone that hit Southern California in September, 1939. Formerly a hurricane, {{it was the only}} tropical storm to make landfall in California in the twentieth century. The only other known tropical cyclone to directly affect California is the 1858 San Diego hurricane, and only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have caused gale-force winds in the continental United States. The tropical storm caused heavy flooding, leaving many dead, <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> sea.|$|E

About 30 percent of the basin, <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> higher elevation levels, is populated with oak, aspen and coniferous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, sagebrush, juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Louis de Barth Walbach (November 1, 1764 – October 13, 1844), {{commonly}} known as Louis de Barth, was a Roman Catholic priest in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Born and raised in Alsace, he emigrated {{with his family to}} the United States during the French Revolution. He spent {{the rest of his life}} as a priest there, <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Conewago Chapel in rural Pennsylvania. After the Bishop of Philadelphia died in 1814, de Barth temporarily led the diocese as apostolic administrator until a new bishop arrived in 1820. After several years at a German-speaking Baltimore parish, he retired to Washington, D.C., in 1841 and died there three years later.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop and}} archbishop, Oswald was a {{supporter}} {{and one of}} the leading promoters (together with Æthelwold) of Dunstan's reforms of the church, including monastic reforms. Oswald founded a number of monasteries, including Ramsey Abbey, and reformed other seven, including Winchcombe in Gloucestershire and Pershore and Evesham in Worcestershire. Oswald also switched the cathedral chapter of Worcester from secular clergy to monks. While archbishop, he brought the scholar Abbo of Fleury to teach, and he spent two years in England, <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> Ramsey. Oswald died in 992, while washing the feet of the poor. A hagiographical life was written shortly after his death, and he was quickly hailed as a saint.|$|E

5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> {{the southern end of the}} Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be <b>mostly</b> <b>at</b> or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E
