40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiation {{exposure}} of the patient during Computerized Axial To-mography examinations {{is known to be}} relatively high. Limited knowledge is available on doses received indirectly by organs, during diagnostic procedures. In the present study, the radiation dose to the lens of the eyes was measured from various Computerized Axial Tomography protocols for head and trunk imaging. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure organ doses in an anthropomorphic Rando Alderson phantom. The unwanted (non-useful) radiation doses delivered to the eye lens during Computerized Axial To-mography examination of head, facial bone, orbits, abdomen, chest, pelvis, neck, nasopharynx, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and sacroiliac joint were as-sessed. The following results are obtained: head scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 74 mGy; facial bone scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 03 mGy; orbital scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 61. 51 mGy; abdomen scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 76 mGy; chest scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 03 mGy; pelvis scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; neck scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 81 mGy; nasopharynx scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 56 mGy; cervical spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 6. 15 mGy; lumber spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; and sacroiliac joint scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 35 mGy. The doses received by the eye lens from Com-puterized Axial Tomography examinations and general rediogaphy examina-tions are compared. It is observed that relatively high doses of unwanted ra-diations are delivered to the eye lens from Computerized Axial Tomography examinations...|$|R

500|$|The UBV {{photometric}} system {{measures the}} magnitude of stars through ultraviolet, blue, and yellow filters, producing U, B, and V values, respectively.

Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region—wavelength range 350–850 nanometers, most of which can be seen with the human eye—so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2000–4000Jy. However, the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the infrared, and is near 100 Jy at 5micrometers.|$|E

The doubt as to the number of plants in each row is of minor importance; the real difficulty lies in our ignorance of the precise law followed by the series. The experience of the plants in pots does not help us to determine that law, because the observations of such plants are too few to enable us to lay down more than the middle terms of the series to which they belong with any sort of accuracy, whereas the cases we are now considering refer to one of its extremities.
