5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks {{on the lower}} Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports on the lower Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the <b>main</b> <b>product</b> shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two <b>main</b> <b>product</b> lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy is}} diversified with corn, {{high-quality}} coffee, beans, soybeans, semi-precious stones, dairy products, a feed factory, and manufacture of sweets being {{some of the}} <b>main</b> <b>products.</b> While coffee and milk were the <b>main</b> <b>products</b> for many years nowadays one of the <b>main</b> <b>products</b> of the local economy is the extraction and commercialization of quartz. Small and medium-sized properties predominate in the municipality, which contribute for a better distribution of income.|$|R

5|$|In 1971, Allied Breweries {{sold its}} 35 per cent {{stake in the}} company, leaving Whitbread 25 per cent and the Boddington family 10 per cent, with the {{remainder}} of company shares held by small shareholders in the Manchester area. That year Guinness Draught stout and Heineken lager were introduced into the tied estate. During the 1970s the company operated within a 70-mile radius of Manchester, and growth was driven by the increasing popularity of its <b>main</b> <b>product,</b> Boddingtons Bitter. The Observer commented in 1974 that Boddingtons cheap pricing and distinctive flavour afforded it an unusually loyal following. In 1981 the same newspaper commented, what has stood Boddingtons in good stead is the highly distinctive flavour of its brews, especially its bitters. In fact, in the North-West, Boddies is increasingly becoming a sort of cult brew.|$|E
5|$|Iodine is {{the least}} {{abundant}} of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46parts per million of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544ppm, chlorine 126ppm, bromine 2.5ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance. Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include lautarite, Ca(IO3)2, and dietzeite, 7Ca(IO3)2·8CaCrO4. These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche, found in Chile, whose <b>main</b> <b>product</b> is sodium nitrate. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium iodate is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by sodium bisulfite. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{have been}} raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The <b>main</b> <b>product</b> locally was felt, produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried and cut into lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E

5|$|The first {{potassium}} nitrate was transported on 8 December 1911, {{and two years}} later the plants were making a profit. Transported cargo increased from 110,000 tonnes per year to 250,000 tonnes in 1915, after the plant had been expanded, and up to 345,000 tonnes in 1917. The small hamlet of Rjukan had turned into a town, and in 1920 there were 11,651 people in Tinn. The 1920 were a tough time, and cargo decreased, but in 1929 the electric arc technology was replaced by the ammonia method, with the <b>main</b> <b>product</b> being {{potassium nitrate}}. During the 1930s other products came into production, including hydrogen and other gases, and from 1934 as the first plant in the world mass-produced heavy water.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the United States and Western European {{countries}} {{introduced legislation}} to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%. The <b>main</b> <b>product</b> made of lead {{by the end of the}} 20th century was the lead–acid battery, which posed no direct threat to humans. From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western Bloc grew by a third. The share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E
