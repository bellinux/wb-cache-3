They settled in Fitzroy, and had a daughter in 1908. Little is known about Dartnell's life {{over the next few}} years, though it is thought that he managed his own business and worked as an actor until 1912 or 1913, when he again departed for South Africa. Elizabeth and their daughter remained in Victoria, while Dartnell established himself in East London, a coastal city in the Cape Province. He found employment with the Standard Printing Company, and was a regular contributor to their Saturday newspaper, the Weekly Standard. During this period, he started using the name Wilbur Taylor Dartnell and, according to historian Gerald Gliddon, became engaged to another woman, a Mabel Evans.|$|E
25|$|According to Cassius Dio, Cicero and Lucullus plotted {{to murder}} Caesar and Pompey {{because they were}} not happy with some steps he had taken. Fearing that Pompey might take charge in Rome while Caesar was away for his governorships (see below), Caesar tied Pompey to himself by marrying him to his {{daughter}} Julia even though she was betrothed to another man. He also married the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, one for the consuls elected for the next year (58 BC). Appian wrote that Cato said that Rome had become a mere <b>matrimonial</b> <b>agency.</b> These marriages were also mentioned by Plutarch and Suetonius.|$|E

The youth introduced Fish to such practices as urolagnia (drinking urine) and coprophagia (eating feces). Fish began visiting public baths where he could watch other boys undress and spent a great portion of his weekends on these visits. Throughout his life, he would write obscene letters to women whose names he acquired from classified advertising and <b>matrimonial</b> <b>agencies.</b>|$|R

60|$|The husband, then, is to {{be allowed}} to discard his wife when he is tired of her, and the wife the husband when another man strikes her fancy? One must reply unhesitatingly in the affirmative; for if we are to deny every {{proposition}} that can be stated in offensive terms by its opponents, we shall never be able to affirm anything at all. But the question reminds us that until the economic independence of women is achieved, we shall have to remain impaled on the other horn of the dilemma and maintain marriage as a slavery. And here let me ask the Government of the day (1910) a question with regard to the Labor Exchanges it has very wisely established throughout the country. What do these Exchanges do when a woman enters and states that her occupation is that of a wife and mother; that she is out of a job; and that she wants an employer? If the Exchanges refuse to entertain her application, they are clearly excluding nearly the whole female sex from the benefit of the Act. If not, they must become <b>matrimonial</b> <b>agencies,</b> unless, indeed, they are prepared to become something worse by putting the woman down as a housekeeper and introducing her to an employer without making marriage a condition of the hiring.|$|R

Oxford Street, which had the back alley (Dryden Chambers, now demolished) leading to Brenda Blaney's <b>matrimonial</b> <b>agency,</b> is the busiest shopping area in Britain.
