5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, <b>male,</b> <b>sterile</b> flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off.

40|$|In {{a series}} of field, garden and {{greenhouse}} experiments, the factors contributing {{to the maintenance of}} <b>male</b> <b>steriles</b> in natural populations of the gynodioecious species Plantago coronopus were examined. No differences in survival between sex phenotypes (hermaphrodites, partially <b>male</b> <b>steriles</b> and <b>male</b> <b>steriles)</b> were observed. <b>Male</b> <b>steriles</b> produced more (41 % to 148 %) and heavier (12 % to 22 %) seeds than hermaphrodites. Partially <b>male</b> <b>steriles</b> were intermediate in seed production between hermaphrodites and <b>male</b> <b>steriles.</b> The observed differences between sex types are interpreted as pleiotropic effects of male sterility genes. Reproductive variation within the group of hermaphrodites was further studied in relation to the cytoplasmic background of the plants used by means of reciprocal crosses. Hermaphrodites having cytoplasmic type 1 produced about 15 % less spikes than their hermaphroditic relatives having cytoplasmic type 2. This result, in combination with genetic studies with the same plants, is interpreted as evidence for the cost of restoration.

One potential method of achieving this reduction is the environmentally-friendly popula-tion control method known as the Sterile Insect Control (SIT) method. The SIT method has {{so far not been}} widely used against insect disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, because of various prac-tical difficulties in rearing, sterilization and distribution of the parasite population. For mosqui-toes, male-only release is considered essential since sterile females will bite and so may transmit disease, whereas male mosquitoes do not bite. This work concerns the mathematical modelling of the effectiveness of Sterile Insect Technique for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, when the female sexual preference is incorporated.

The early abnormal vacuolation of tapetal cells is the first visible evidence leading to premeiotic abortion of microsporogenesis in <b>male</b> <b>steriles.</b> The sporogenous cells disintegrate rapidly after the vacuolation of the tapetum, resulting in a shrunken, indehiscent anther which is composed of only the epidermal layer with some remnant cells of the endothecium and the connective at anthesis.
