5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, <b>must</b> <b>then</b> win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|According to the Party's Constitution, {{the members}} of the CCDI are elected by the National Congress and serve for a term of five years. After the {{national}} congress in which it is elected, the CCDI convenes to elect its Secretary, deputy secretaries, secretary general and Standing Committee. Elected officials <b>must</b> <b>then</b> be endorsed by the Central Committee to take office. The Secretary of the CCDI has, since 1997, {{been a member of the}} Politburo Standing Committee and, since 2009, served as the leader of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work. The current secretary is Zhao Leji, who took office on 25 October 2017.|$|E

5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator <b>must</b> <b>then</b> visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game developed {{and published by}} Human Entertainment for the Super Famicom in 1995. It is the first installment in the Clock Tower series. The story follows orphan Jennifer Simpson soon after she is adopted by the Barrows family along with other orphaned girls. With the introduction of Scissorman, the game's antagonist, {{one of the other}} children is killed. Jennifer <b>must</b> <b>then</b> explore the Barrows Mansion {{to find a way to}} escape while evading Scissorman, leading to one of the game's multiple endings. Clock Tower utlizes a point and click interface with the player controlling a cursor to direct Jennifer's actions.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures gave Spider-Man 3 a US {{release on}} May 4, 2007. The film begins with Peter Parker basking in his success as Spider-Man before an {{extraterrestrial}} symbiote takes control of him. Peter <b>must</b> <b>then</b> battle a rival photographer that the symbiote then takes control of (Topher Grace) and the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). The general consensus among critics {{was that the}} final installment was not as refined as the first two entries, with it being criticized for its excessive use of villains, romantic conflicts and weak plot points. Nonetheless, Spider-Man 3 surpassed the previous two films' openings, making $151 million at over 4,250 locations.|$|E

Aeron <b>must</b> <b>then</b> destroy a monstrous Zeron, saving Elena one last time. The two then leave while Mavda uses the chain {{to destroy the}} Thirteen Towers, sacrificing herself to end their evils. In the epilogue, it is {{revealed}} that the kingdoms manage to end the War of Independence after {{the closing of the}} Scar, the Vestra are granted new lands to settle on by Elyria after Elyria's king receives a letter from Mavda detailing events at the Towers, and Aeron and Elena lived happily together.|$|E
5|$|If the Community Committee {{accepts a}} {{community}} declaration, it <b>must</b> <b>then</b> refer the declaration {{to the appropriate}} Community Sub-Committee for consideration. If the Community Sub-Committee concludes that the declarant belongs to that community, it must issue a community certificate to the applicant. Otherwise, it must inform the declarant in writing that the application has been rejected. The decision must be communicated to the declarant no later than the eve of nomination day. All decisions of the Community Committee and its Sub-Committees are final, and a community certificate is conclusive of the matters it certifies– they {{are not subject to}} appeal or review in any court.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which <b>must</b> <b>then</b> be re-dissolved at the decompression stops {{before it can be}} eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.|$|E

5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players {{had to talk to}} a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players <b>must</b> <b>then</b> pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He <b>must</b> <b>then</b> return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E
5|$|Margiris, {{the defender}} of Pilėnai, is often {{suggested}} {{as the most}} likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of Hermann de Wartberge mention that in 1329 Gediminas {{and two of his}} brothers raided Livonia. By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. One of these two brothers <b>must</b> <b>then</b> have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his high status and wealth. Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.|$|E

5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive <b>must</b> <b>then</b> {{be taken into account}} when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can increase the risk of decompression sickness because of the buildup of asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E
5|$|The last Article {{creates the}} {{mechanism}} for future {{changes to the}} Constitution. Any amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by a majority {{in each of the}} two legislative houses. The proposed amendment <b>must</b> <b>then</b> be held over for consideration by the succeeding elected legislature, where it must again be passed by a majority in each house. The amendment then goes on the general ballot and becomes enacted into the Constitution if approved by a majority of the voters.|$|E
5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the tense and aspect of the clause. A small set of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb <b>must</b> <b>then</b> co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E

Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who <b>must</b> <b>then</b> assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.|$|E
5|$|After reuniting with Terra, the Returners {{decide that}} it is time to launch an all-out attack on the Empire, and Banon asks Terra to attempt {{contacting}} the espers' land in order to gain their support. Terra succeeds in making contact, and when the espers learn that the others captured by the Empire previously have now perished, they become infuriated and enter the human world, where they destroy much of Vector. When the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace. Gestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf, to which she agrees. Accompanied by Locke, Shadow (a ninja mercenary hired by the Empire for the mission), Generals Celes and Leo, the player <b>must</b> <b>then</b> guide Terra to the remote village Thamasa in search of the espers, where they meet Strago Magus and his granddaughter, Relm Arrowny, who also accompany them.|$|E
5|$|Falklands '82 is a turn-based {{strategy}} game {{focusing on}} land battles during the Falklands War. The player commands the British Task Force against the Argentine ground forces, who are occupying the islands. The game begins by allocating fifteen Royal Navy ships {{for the task}} force; a proportionate amount must be devoted for attack and defence purposes. The player <b>must</b> <b>then</b> choose four landing spots in northern East Falkland to begin the invasion: Port Stanley, Berkeley Sound, Cow Bay and San Carlos Bay. The SAS or SBS are available throughout the game to provide intelligence on Argentine movements; however, intelligence is limited and may only be collected {{a certain number of}} times. At any time, the player may request reinforcements from either one of the two aircraft carriers, HMS Hermes or HMS Invincible.|$|E
