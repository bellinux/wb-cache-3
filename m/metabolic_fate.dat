40|$|The <b>metabolic</b> <b>fates</b> {{and modes}} of {{excretion}} of diethylstilboestrol mono[35 S]sulphate and diethylstilboestrol di[35 S]sulphate were studied in the rat. Both of the esters were desulphated to some extent in vivo. In addition, significant amounts of radioactivity appeared in the bile as diethylstilboestrol mono[35 S]sulphate monoglucuronide. The percentage of the dose appearing in bile as the diconjugate was substantially greater in experiments with diethylstilboestrol mono[35 S]sulphate than with diethylstilboestrol di[35 S]sulphate. Whole-body radioautography and studies with isolated perfused liver confirmed the liver as the major metabolic organ for both esters. When the metabolite diethylstilboestrol mono[35 S]sulphate monoglucuronide isolated from the bile was reinjected, it was excreted in the bile unchanged. Studies in vitro demonstrated that both esters were substrates for arylsulphatase C with Km values in the range 52 - 76 micrometer.

40|$|Suberin, a cell specific, wall-associated biopolymer, {{is formed}} during normal plant growth and {{development}} {{as well as in}} response to stress conditions such as wounding. It is characterized by the deposition of both a poly(phenolic) domain (SPPD) in the cell wall and a poly(aliphatic) domain (SPAD) thought to be deposited between the cell wall and plasma membrane. Although the monomeric components that comprise the SPPD and SPAD are well known, the biosynthesis and deposition of suberin is poorly understood. Using wound healing potato tubers as a model system, we have tracked the flux of carbon into the aliphatic monomers of the SPAD in a time course fashion. From these analyses, we demonstrate that newly formed fatty acids undergo one of two main <b>metabolic</b> <b>fates</b> during wound-induced suberization: (1) desaturation followed by oxidation to form the 18 : 1 ω-hydroxy and dioic acids characteristic of potato suberin, and (2) elongation to very long chain fatty acids (C 20 to C 28), associated with reduction to 1 -alkanols, decarboxylation to n-alkanes and minor amounts of hydroxylation.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} 50 years, {{saturated}} fatty acids (SFAs) have {{played a key role}} in hypotheses relating diet to the risk of coronary heart disease. More recently, the international debate questioning the role of reducing intakes of saturated fat in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases has been re-opened. According to the past negative assumption, SFAs are indeed still considered as a single group even if it is now well-known that they do not have similar levels in common foods, nor similar <b>metabolic</b> <b>fates</b> and cellular functions. In addition, recent findings on the metabolism and biological functions of individual SFAs show that they have important and specific roles in the cells. Elucidated biochemical mechanisms such as SFA protein acylation (N-myristoylation, S-palmitoylation and ghrelin octanoylation) and regulation of gene transcription are presented. In terms of physiology, SFAs are involved for instance in lipogenesis, fat deposition, polyunsaturated fatty acid bioavailability and apoptosis. The variety of their functions demonstrates that SFAs should no longer be considered as a single group. Consequences on the current nutritional dietary recommendations are finally discussed.

Unlike glucose, which is metabolized widely in the body, fructose is metabolized almost completely in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis. Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride. 29% - 54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15% - 18% is converted to glycogen. Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.|$|R
40|$|Excess lipid {{accumulation}} in non-adipose tissues {{is associated}} with insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and heart failure. Here, we demonstrate in cultured cells that the relative toxicity of two common dietary long chain fatty acids is related to channeling of these lipids to distinct cellular <b>metabolic</b> <b>fates.</b> Oleic acid supplementation leads to triglyceride accumulation and is well tolerated, whereas excess palmitic acid is poorly incorporated into triglyceride and causes apoptosis. Unsaturated fatty acids rescue palmitate-induced apoptosis by channeling palmitate into triglyceride pools and away from pathways leading to apoptosis. Moreover, {{in the setting of}} impaired triglyceride synthesis, oleate induces lipotoxicity. Our findings support a model of cellular lipid metabolism in which unsaturated fatty acids serve a protective function against lipotoxicity though promotion of triglyceride accumulation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMetabolic {{adaptation}} to the host environment is a defining feature of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but we lack biochemical knowledge of its metabolic networks. Many bacteria use catabolite repression as a regulatory mechanism to maximize growth by consuming individual carbon substrates in a preferred sequence and growing with diauxic kinetics. Surprisingly, untargeted metabolite profiling of Mtb growing on 13 C-labeled carbon substrates revealed that Mtb could catabolize multiple carbon sources simultaneously to achieve enhanced monophasic growth. Moreover, when co-catabolizing multiple carbon sources, Mtb differentially catabolized each carbon source through the glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and/or tricarboxylic acid pathways to distinct <b>metabolic</b> <b>fates.</b> This unusual topologic organization of bacterial intermediary metabolism has not been previously observed and may subserve the pathogenicity of Mtb...|$|R

Measures of gluconeogenic markers indicate a reduction in gluconeogenesis (GNG) to be partially attributable to the improved glucose regulation. Importantly, we present the novel finding that chronic endurance exercise reduces the rate of hepatic glycogen synthesis despite improvements in glycemia.
