5|$|The {{original}} version was only moderately successful, {{although it is}} remembered for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained <b>more</b> <b>sex</b> and violence than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley {{has suggested that the}} magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with less attractive cover art and {{little in the way of}} notable fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's first story. By the end of 1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently.|$|E

Our model shows that the two-sexes reproduction scheme maximizes the recombination entropy-to-cost ratio, and hence is the optimal solution to the problem...|$|R

25|$|Erotic {{romance is}} {{a blend of}} romance and erotica. Erotic romance novels are {{characterized}} by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include <b>more</b> <b>sex</b> scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts. Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is not identical to traditional pornography. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.|$|E

For example the regular customers of a bar or sauna can link their private profile to the club or guide-profile of that place. Members of a particular club can exchange news or discuss diverse subjects in the club's forum or via a newsletter. Clubs also exist for supporters of political parties, members of religious groups and employees in particular industries. There are also clubs that are <b>more</b> <b>sex</b> or fetish orientated. There are also fan-clubs for pop or movie stars, classical music etc. In fact, since any user can create a club-profile, the list is limitless.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, sex {{education}} is not compulsory in schools as parents can refuse to let their children {{take part in the}} lessons. The curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain {{has one of the highest}} teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and {{sex education}} is a heated issue in government and media reports. In a 2000 study by the University of Brighton, many 14- to 15-year-olds reported disappointment with the content of sex education lessons and felt that lack of confidentiality prevents teenagers from asking teachers about contraception. However, in a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 it was revealed that only three in ten teenagers say they need <b>more</b> <b>sex</b> and relationships education. In most primary/junior schools, students are taught a (non-compulsory) formal sex education program from Upper Key Stage 2 (ages 10–11), and then onwards into secondary school, where it becomes a topic in the overall subject of Citizenship or PSHE (Personal Social Health Education). In March 2017 it was made complusory all schools have to teach sex education.|$|E

25|$|Adolescent {{sexuality}} is {{a stage of}} human development in which adolescents experience and explore sexual feelings. Interest in sexuality intensifies during the onset of puberty, and {{sexuality is}} often a vital aspect of teenagers' lives. In humans, sexual interest may be expressed {{in a number of}} ways, such as flirting, kissing, masturbation, or having sex with a partner. Sexual interest among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly, and is influenced by cultural norms and <b>mores,</b> <b>sex</b> education provided, sexual orientation, and social controls such as age of consent laws.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the updated sexual attitudes and behaviour {{of young people in}} Shanghai and finds that males have <b>more</b> open <b>sex</b> attitudes than females. However, their knowledge about how to have safe sex is rather limited, and most of them receive sex-related knowledge mainly from peers and the internet. As a result, it is important to integrate the experience of sex education programs and social workers' intervention strategies from Hong Kong and other countries in order to cultivate a <b>more</b> systematic <b>sex</b> education system in Shanghai. 本研究旨在了解時下上海青少年的性態度和行為，發現上海青少男比青少女對性更為開放，但是卻對安全性行為的概念十分模糊，他們普遍會在朋友和互聯網上取得性知識。有見及此，建議參考香港和外國的性教育及社會工作者的經驗，為其建立一套整全的性教育制度，有助青少年健康成長...|$|R
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of a charter of rights in the Constitution Act was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980, and announced his intention to constitutionalize {{a bill of rights}} that would include fundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal rights, equality and language rights. He did not want a notwithstanding clause. While his proposal gained popular support, provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers. The federal Progressive Conservative opposition feared liberal bias among judges, should courts be called upon to enforce rights. Additionally, the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada's old form of government. At a suggestion of the Conservatives, Trudeau's government thus agreed to a committee of Senators and MPs to further examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan. During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television, while civil rights experts and advocacy groups put forward their perceptions on the Charter's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them. As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the Charter, as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of civil libertarians, judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of Charter rights in certain circumstances, something the Charter was not originally going to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to the Charter, including equality rights for people with disabilities, <b>more</b> <b>sex</b> equality guarantees and recognition of Canada's multiculturalism. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.|$|E
