5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The <b>Memorize</b> {{corporation}} has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives <b>Memorize</b> an immense degree of control over the population and enables them to establish a surveillance state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down <b>Memorize.</b> The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris.|$|E
5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of <b>Memorize,</b> Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that <b>Memorize</b> scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for <b>Memorize.</b> However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we present {{the basics of}} <b>memorizing</b> of fuzzy data, we analyze the meaning of <b>memorizing</b> of fuzzy data and we present basic {{entities}} used for <b>memorizing.</b> At the beginning we do {{a survey of the}} state of the art in the area of <b>memorizing</b> of fuzzy data which originates from the binary <b>memorizing.</b> In the continuation we present some problems and advantages which are the result of <b>memorizing</b> of fuzzy data with modern analogous devices. With the direct <b>memorizing</b> of fuzzy data the new possibilities rises for the implementation of fuzzy computer, which will deal directly with fuzzy data and fuzzy knowledge.

5|$|Prior to the game's release, an {{official}} prelude story {{was published by}} way of a multimedia web site. The interactive site was depicted as the diary of Antoine Cartier-Wells, founder of the <b>Memorize</b> corporation and creator of the Sensen brain implant, and it tells the story of <b>Memorize</b> during the 100 years preceding the start of the game. At the time of the game's release, a 24-page print comic book written by Matt Kindt and illustrated by Matthew Southworth was released by Dark Horse Comics, as an exclusive bonus item for those who pre-ordered the game from GameStop. Dark Horse later published a 184-page hardcover book featuring concept art and developer commentary. On 20 June 2013, another official prelude story was published, this time set months {{before the start of the}} game, and centring on the character of Nilin.

50|$|Elaborative {{rehearsal}}: This is type of rehearsal is {{also known}} as creative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal uses creativity to increase capacity of short-term memory and accurately recall items. Creating associations and connections between something significant to the person <b>memorizing</b> and the item(s) to be <b>memorized</b> is one example of elaborative rehearsal. Another example is the use of mnemonic devices, which are a creative way to mentally arrange the items to be <b>memorized.</b>|$|R

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by <b>Memorize.</b> As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a <b>Memorize</b> doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a <b>Memorize</b> commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can <b>memorize</b> positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to <b>memorize</b> does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E

Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to <b>memorize</b> and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to <b>memorize</b> and perform their duel together. As {{in the previous}} two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use of}} stunt doubles. The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E

These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E
40|$|The Flight Management Computer (FMC) and its interface, the Multi-function Control and Display Unit (MCDU) {{have been}} {{identified}} by researchers and airlines as difficult to train and use. Specifically, airline pilots have described the "drinking from the fire-hose" effect during training. Previous research has identified <b>memorized</b> action sequences as {{a major factor in}} a user s ability to learn and operate complex devices. This paper discusses the use of a method to examine the quantity of <b>memorized</b> action sequences required to perform a sample of 102 tasks, using features of the Boeing 777 Flight Management Computer Interface. The analysis identified a large number of <b>memorized</b> action sequences that must be learned during training and then recalled during line operations. Seventy-five percent of the tasks examined require recall of at least one <b>memorized</b> action sequence. Forty-five percent of the tasks require recall of a <b>memorized</b> action sequence and occur infrequently. The large number of <b>memorized</b> action sequences may provide an explanation for the difficulties in training and usage of the automation. Based on these findings, implications for training and the design of new user-interfaces are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} different processes in working memory, using event-related potentials (ERPs) and response times. Abstract polygons were presented for memorization and subsequent recall in a delayed matching-to-sample paradigm.

ERP results suggested that memorization takes place in a visual buffer in contralateral posterior brain areas, whereas identification of the test stimulus as a target appears to be mainly a left hemispheric process. Increased response times were found for nontarget test stimuli as compared to targets, and for target test stimuli that were presented contralaterally with respect to the location of the <b>memorized</b> stimulus. In addition, response times were slower when two figures were <b>memorized</b> than when only one was <b>memorized...</b>|$|R
