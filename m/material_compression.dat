50|$|Compressive stress (or compression) is {{the stress}} state {{caused by an}} applied load that acts to reduce {{the length of the}} <b>material</b> (<b>compression</b> member) along the axis of the applied load, it is in other words a stress state that causes a {{squeezing}} of the material. A simple case of compression is the uniaxial compression induced by the action of opposite, pushing forces. Compressive strength for materials is generally higher than their tensile strength. However, structures loaded in compression are subject to additional failure modes, such as buckling, that are dependent on the member's geometry.|$|E
