40|$|Despite {{reasonable}} {{concerns that}} fabric <b>marking</b> pen <b>inks</b> may prove damaging over time, some quilters {{use them to}} temporarily mark quilting designs on quilt tops. Unfortunately, no published results concerning long-term effects of these products exist. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether <b>marking</b> pen <b>inks</b> contribute to degradation or discoloration over time. Samples were marked with one of three brands of marking pen and subjected to ink removal treatments, followed by heat or light aging. Changes in color and breaking strength were measured before and after heat or light aging. Results showed that a water immersion ink removal treatment is the most effective method for removing <b>marking</b> pen <b>ink</b> and was associated with significantly less discoloration and strength loss than eraser pen removal treatments. This suggests that quilters should use marking pens only if they immediately launder or soak in water their newly completed quilts. Curators considering a quilt for acquisition may wish to ask if marking pens were used. If that is not feasible, then it is advisable to have a specialist examine potential acquisitions for tell-tale traces of <b>marking</b> pen <b>ink.</b> If detected, wet-cleaning prior to storage should be considered...|$|R
60|$|The {{face of a}} streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black {{straw hat}} peered askew round {{the door of the}} shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of {{bringing}} more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's <b>marking</b> <b>ink</b> (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} the multi-printing technique for preparing, with a commercial inkjet printer and radio <b>marked</b> <b>ink,</b> planar emission phantoms particularly suitable for high-resolution radionuclide imaging. The well known practice of producing radioactive phantoms by inkjet was improved by developing the multi-printing technique definable as the reiteration of printing commands before processing the next line. The major advantage {{consists of the}} increase of the concentration of radioactivity deposited in the image {{with respect to the}} standard over-printing method without refilling radioactivity in the cartridge. Since the paper needs just one insertion in the printer, a better outlined image is produced than {{in the case of the}} over-printing technique obtainable by reiterating both the insertion and the printing of the same image over of the same sheet This paper discusses in particular: (1) the linear dependence of deposited activity vs. the number of multi-printing cycles; (2) the effective decay's ti e of radio marker at nozzle's output; (3) the evaluation of the absolute value of the activity deposited in the image and (4) the broadening of the printed surfaces vs. the number of multi-printing cycles. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R

The information around us of different formats is digitalized and processed by human by gestures and some kinds of expressions.

A lecturer needs different kinds of teaching aids like writing board, writing <b>Marker,</b> <b>Ink</b> remover, Notes, power point slides and more during teaching but using sixth sense technology all these aids can be used by our gestures and expression only. The information what we want to deliver through the lectures can be digitalized, projected and expressed by gestures that can be handled by our finger caps or by other movement of our hands. The lectures are delivered more effectively using images, videos, real life examples, query session. Besides those things the attendance list, library status of each student can be easily updated in the data base.

40|$|Context: The {{indelible}} ink that′s {{used in our}} elections was developed by National Physical Laboratories (NPL), Delhi in 1962, and has been used ever since. Though formulated by NPL, it is manufactured by Mysore Paints and Varnish Ltd. owned by the Karnataka Government. Earlier, the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> was applied on the cuticle but with effect from February 01, 2006 the ink is applied on the voter′s left index fingernail from the distal end proximally until the cuticle using an applicator. This idea of the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> applied during elections {{was used as a}} simple tool to measure the rate of nail growth in a busy outpatient department of a Tertiary Hospital in South India. Aims: To assess the feasibility of using the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> during elections as a method of obtaining data of nail growth across the spectrum of the entire country. Subjects and Methods: In 74 patients presenting to a hospital, the rate of nail growth was measured. The voter′s mark on the left index fingernail of patients during the recent elections was used as a marker for measuring the length of the nail. Results: The average rate of nail growth was 0. 113 mm/day. The rate of nail growth was found to be more in females, younger individuals, pregnancy, patients on nutritional supplementation, psoriasis. Conclusion: This study which was conducted on 74 patients using the election <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> successfully confirmed the possibility of using it as an efficient tool in measuring the rate of nail growth. The findings revealed the slightly higher rate of nail growth as compared to a study done by Rani et al. However, the limited sample size in this study was the major limitation...|$|R
