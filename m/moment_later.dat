5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 1985, Marty {{meets his}} {{scientist}} friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, {{in a shopping}} mall parking lot {{in the early morning}} hours. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. Doc demonstrates the time navigation system by punching in the date November 5, 1955: the day he invented time travel. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> the Libyans arrive and shoot Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine, and arrives in 1955 without enough plutonium to return.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a <b>moment</b> <b>later.</b> Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E
25|$|At that point, both radio {{networks}} rejoined NBC-TV. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> Ryan tossed coverage back to WBAP where Charles Murphy {{reported that}} although no official statement {{had been released}} by the President's staff, the Dallas police had been notified of Kennedy's death and radioed the word to every officer on duty.|$|E
25|$|On 9 October 1918, while escorting , Shaws rudder jammed {{just as she}} was {{completing}} the right leg of a zigzag, leaving her headed directly towards the transport. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> Aquitania struck Shaw, cutting off 90 feet of the destroyer's bow, mangling her bridge and setting her on fire. Shaws crew heroically brought her damage under control, and a skeleton crew of 21 men took the wreck 40 miles into port under her own power. 12 men died in the accident.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{from her}} bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, whom Briony has a crush on. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the {{fountain}} pond; a <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia {{had gone to}} the pond to fill a vase that was broken when Robbie grabbed onto one of the handles. A portion of the vase dropped into the pond, and she dived in to fetch it.|$|E
25|$|Peter is {{reunited with}} his sisters, who {{immediately}} notice Edmund's absence. They find him clinging to the last threads of life with a wounded Ginarrbrik preparing to slay him. Susan shoots and kills Ginarrbrik as he raises his axe for the kill, saving Edmund. Lucy attempts to use her cordial to cure Edmund, but seems to fail {{for a moment as}} Edmund seemingly dies the moment she pours a drop into his mouth. However, he revives a <b>moment</b> <b>later</b> cured of his injuries. Lucy rushes to heal the wounded soldiers while Aslan revives those who were petrified.|$|E
25|$|A week later, the family's quiet {{evening is}} {{interrupted}} by the unexpected arrival of Tancredi, who has brought a friend with him (Count Carlo). Tancredi and the Count, in their full dress uniforms, fascinate the Prince's daughters and puzzle the Prince, who says {{he thought they were}} still fighting for Garibaldi. Tancredi and the Count react with disgust, saying there was no way they could stay with such a rough outfit when positions with the new king's army were available. Tancredi then produces the ring he has purchased for Angelica. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> Angelica rushes in, having been informed by a note that Tancredi is back. The lovers embrace; sensuality fills the air.|$|E
60|$|Ruth, {{arriving}} a few <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> {{was met by}} Kirk {{with the}} card in his hand.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{vanished}} {{among the}} crowd; {{but a few}} <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> he returned hurriedly, without his paper.|$|R

25|$|The Red Raiders scored first, on a 1-yard {{pass from}} Graham Harrell to Lyle Leong. The Wildcats responded by scoring on the {{following}} drive on a 33-yard TD pass to Ernie Pierce. Texas Tech made another touchdown, followed by successful PAT, to bring the score to 14–7. Facing fourth-and-inches from their own 29 {{late in the first}} quarter, the Red Raiders sent Shannon Woods on a sweep. But he was stopped and, four plays later, Kansas State quarterback Josh Freeman scored on a 1-yard run, bringing the score to 14–14. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> Texas Tech’s Richard Jones recovered Lamark Brown’s fumble on the Kansas State 34 and Baron Batch capped the ensuing drive with a 9-yard touchdown run {{on the following}} play to make the score 58–21.|$|E
25|$|Barkas's {{next step}} was to run popular demonstrations of camouflage. He would {{assemble}} about 60 trucks, coaches and smaller vehicles and discuss with the non-commissioned officers how to hide these from the air. They would agree that a line of trucks could be parked by a hedge and all together draped with nets to appear as a thick belt of vegetation, or arrange a vehicle as a pitched-roof outhouse to a building. Then the commanders would arrive, and Barkas would give a speech about camouflage methods to defeat aerial reconnaissance. He would then signal the start, the unit would hide all its vehicles, and a <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> using his film-making skill with timing, an aircraft would arrive and start observing. It rarely found more than a few of the vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The time is 9.20pm. Sir Roger is {{enclosed}} {{in his study}} {{at the back of}} the hall. Dr. Sheppard was with him but Parker told Mrs. Ackroyd that he left earlier and, as far as she knows, Sir Roger is now alone. Flora follows her mother to bed and Raymond and Parker hear Sir Roger's voice coming from the other side of the door as he somewhat stiltedly tells an unknown person that he can give them no money as they require. Blunt enters from the terrace and he and Raymond go to the billiard room. Parker switches off the hall lights and leaves momentarily but re-enters a <b>moment</b> <b>later</b> to see Flora with her hand on the study door. She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E
60|$|A few <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> Arturo bore in {{his arms}} from the arbor the lifeless body of Mariposilla.|$|R
60|$|A few <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> Clarke stood up, {{stretching}} {{out his arms}} with a gesture of deep weariness.|$|R
60|$|A few <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> he {{was still}} more complimentary. He got up and took a ball himself.|$|R
25|$|Midway {{through the}} first half, both teams elected to make substitutions. Regular {{rotation}} players Steven Echevarria and Hayden Partain came on for Wake Forest for Luis Argudo and Ema Twumasi, respectively. For the Cardinal, rotation players Sam Werner and Adrian Alabi were subbed on for Bryce Marion and Corey Baird, respectively. In the 43rd minute, Wake Forest had their second shot on frame, where Deacons captain, Harkes, struck a shot on frame from about 20 yards out. The shot forced Epstein to make a diving save, that caused a deflection in the box before Thomas Hillard-Arce could clear {{it out of the}} box. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> Stanford made one more first half substitution, where Adrian Alabi came on for Foster Langsdorf, who had a rather quiet first half. The match ended scoreless going into the break.|$|E
25|$|The White Lady, {{without making}} a sound, {{advances}} along the terrace. Raymonda follows her {{in a state of}} unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E
25|$|The others leave but a <b>moment</b> <b>later</b> Poirot {{suffers a}} small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor {{his opinion of}} the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that he knows who the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer wanted to be on the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that can only have been to have hidden something from sight at the moment that the room was broken into. As the Dictaphone is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only be someone who had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E

500|$|Recording of the French {{version of}} [...] "Maman a tort" [...] {{took place in}} Paris in January 1984, with Farmer stating that the {{sessions}} were a [...] "magic" [...] <b>moment.</b> <b>Later,</b> the English-language version of the song was recorded in an afternoon at the Dany Darras studio in Cernay. Farmer had no difficulty in singing in English because she spoke the language very well, having lived in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Harris {{became an}} ace on September 13 {{when he and}} Lt. James Neighbours led {{divisions}} in a dawn strike on Negros Island. Both divisions flew [...] above the bombers, Neighbors' planes positioned in front to provide close support while Harris's division covered the rear. By the time the strike force crossed over the coast of Negros, 's Air Group 8 was already engaging Japanese interceptors. Enemy aircraft came after Intrepids bombers just a <b>moment</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
500|$|Jeter tied Lou Gehrig's {{record for}} hits at Yankee Stadium (1,269) {{with a home}} run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price on September 14, 2008.
