50|$|Lidar {{systems can}} be used to measure {{concentration}} profiles of atmospheric gases (i.e., water vapor, ozone), and industrial emissions (i.e., SO2, NO2, HCl). Such measurements are performed using two basic types of lidar; Raman lidar and Differential Absorption lidars (DIAL). In the first type, the Raman lidar detects the scattering of the laser beam due to Raman scattering. The frequency shift induced by such scattering is unique for each molecule, and acts as a “signature” to detect its specific contribution. The second type, DIAL systems, emit two beams with two distinct frequencies. One beam is tuned exactly on a <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> and the other beam is tuned in a nearby wavelength without molecular absorption. By examining the intensity difference of the scattered light at the two frequencies, DIAL systems can separate the contribution of the specific molecule in the atmosphere.|$|E

The unidentified line at 1369. 13 A has the appearance {{and characteristics of}} a weak diffuse interstellar band (DIB). The line has a smooth profile similar to many optical diffuse interstellar bands (i. e., a shallow asymmetric profile), it is clearly broader than identified interstellar lines near it in wavelength, and its full width at half maximum in ergs {{is comparable to the}} widths of the weak optical DIBs. The asymmetric profile cannot be attributed to blended absorption from diffuse clouds at different velocities; at this resolution the two principal cloud complexes on the sight line at heliocentric velocities of - 27 and - 15 km/s are clearly separated.

The 1504 + 377 radio source is located {{toward the center}} of what appears to be an inclined disk galaxy at z = 0. 674. The 21 cm absorption line shows multiple velocity components over a velocity range of about 100 km sec^- 1, with a total HI column density: N(HI) = 3. 8 × 10 ^ 19 ×(T_sf) cm^- 2. The velocity-integrated optical depth of this system is the largest yet seen for redshifted HI 21 cm absorption line systems (Carilli 1995). The 21 cm absorption line is coincident in redshift with a previously detected broad <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> system (Wiklind and Combes 1996). We do not detect HI 21 cm absorption associated with the narrow <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> system at z = 0. 67150, nor do we detect absorption at these redshifts by the 18 cm lines of OH, nor by the 2 cm transition of H_ 2 CO.
