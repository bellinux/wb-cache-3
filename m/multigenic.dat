5|$|As in prokaryotes, {{there is}} a very high {{proportion}} of coding DNA and an absence of repeats. Mitochondrial genes are transcribed as <b>multigenic</b> transcripts, which are cleaved and polyadenylated to yield mature mRNAs. Not all proteins necessary for mitochondrial function are encoded by the mitochondrial genome; most are coded by genes in the cell nucleus and the corresponding proteins are imported into the mitochondrion. The exact number of genes encoded by the nucleus and the mitochondrial genome differs between species. Most mitochondrial genomes are circular, although exceptions have been reported. In general, mitochondrial DNA lacks introns, {{as is the case in}} the human mitochondrial genome; however, introns have been observed in some eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA, such as that of yeast and protists, including Dictyostelium discoideum. Between protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present. During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. Mitochondrial tRNA genes have different sequences from the nuclear tRNAs but lookalikes of mitochondrial tRNAs have been found in the nuclear chromosomes with high sequence similarity.|$|E

So, GEP-nets can be used not only in Boolean problems but also in logistic regression, classification, and regression.

50|$|More recently, {{the scope}} of genetic {{epidemiology}} has expanded to include common diseases for which many genes each make a smaller contribution (polygenic, multifactorial or <b>multigenic</b> disorders). This has developed rapidly {{in the first decade}} of the 21st century following completion of the Human Genome Project, as advances in genotyping technology and associated reductions in cost has made it feasible to conduct large-scale genome-wide association studies that genotype many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms in thousands of individuals. These have led to the discovery of many genetic polymorphisms that influence the risk of developing many common diseases.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{genetics}} {{seeks to}} understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease. When searching for an unknown gene that {{may be involved in}} a disease, researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease. At the population level, researchers take advantage of Mendelian randomization to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases, a method especially useful for <b>multigenic</b> traits not clearly defined by a single gene. Once a candidate gene is found, further research is often done on the corresponding (or homologous) genes of model organisms. In addition to studying genetic diseases, the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of pharmacogenetics: the study of how genotype can affect drug responses.|$|E
5000|$|A {{possible}} {{limitation of}} many evolutionary algorithms is {{their lack of}} a clear genotype-phenotype distinction. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype. This indirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the evolvability of the organism. Such indirect (a.k.a. generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment. Recent {{work in the field}} of artificial embryogeny, or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear <b>multigenic</b> chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes.|$|E
50|$|Major (vertical) {{resistance}} of corn hybrids {{comes from the}} race specific Ht1, Ht2, Ht3, and HtN genes, with the Ht1 gene being most prevalent. Plants with Ht1 Ht2, or Ht3 genes have smaller, chlorotic lesions and reduced sporulation. The HtN gene delays symptoms until after the pollen shed. Individually, each Ht gene has limited effectiveness because there are races of E. turcicum that are virulent {{in the presence of}} one or the other. For example, widespread use of the Ht1 gene has reduced the prevalence of the Race 0 to which it has resistance against, but has increased Race 1. Breeders are now focusing on incorporating several resistance genes into corn hybrids. Incorporating both the Ht1 and Ht2 provide resistance against both Races 0 and 1. Thus far, this <b>multigenic</b> approach has proven to be effective. However resistant plants still show some symptoms, and the threat of new races showing up lends to the need for other management practices, especially in areas where the disease is present.|$|E
5000|$|Early phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{supported the}} hypothesis that the genus comprises only a few species with considerable phenotypic variation. Subsequent <b>multigenic</b> DNA studies, however, have revealed more than a dozen genealogically distinct species in North America and at least as many in Europe. [...] DNA studies revealed three discrete clades, or genetic groups, consisting of the [...] "white morels" [...] (Morchella rufobrunnea and Morchella anatolica), the [...] "yellow morels" [...] (Morchella esculenta and others), and the [...] "black morels" [...] (Morchella elata and others). The fire-associated species Morchella tomentosa, commonly known as the [...] "gray morel", is distinct for its fine hairs on the cap ridges and unique sclerotia-like underground structures, and may also deserve its own clade based on DNA evidence. Within the yellow and black clades, there are dozens of distinct species, most endemic to individual continents or regions. This species-rich view is supported by studies in Western Europe, Turkey, Cyprus, Israel, China, Patagonia and the Himalayas.|$|E
5000|$|The genetic {{component}} {{appears to be}} inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with high genetic penetrance but variable expressivity in females; this means that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the predisposing genetic variant(s) from a parent, and, if a daughter receives the variant(s), the daughter will have the disease to some extent. [...] The genetic variant(s) can be inherited from either the father or the mother, and can be passed along to both sons (who may be asymptomatic carriers or may have symptoms such as early baldness and/or excessive hair) and daughters, who will show signs of PCOS.

The sequencing of reference genomes, in particular the Human Genome Project, has revolutionized human genetics, molecular biology, and clinical medicine.

However, it became apparent that inherent to these studies is an emphasis on clinical outcome rather than a comprehensive understanding of human disease; indeed to date the most significant contributions of GWAS have been restricted to the “low-hanging fruit” of direct single mutation disorders, prompting a systems biology approach to genomic analysis. The connection between genotype and phenotype (how variation in genotype affects the disease or normal functioning of the cell and the human body) remain elusive, especially in the context of <b>multigenic</b> complex traits and cancer.

He also showed that the transcription factor Myb can reversibly block the differentiation of white blood cells, {{one of the first}} demonstrations of induced cell fate changes. In his more recent research he showed that different types of specialized blood cells can be induced to convert into each other by forced transcription factor expression. In 1995 he pioneered this technique permitting the transdifferentiation of white blood cells into red blood cell precursors and viceversa induced by Gata1 and PU.1, respectively. Later (2004) he managed to convert B lymphocytes into functional macrophages, using C/EBPa as a driver. Using the same approach he was also first to induce a conversion of more distantly related cells, namely that of non-blood cells into macrophages. Finally, he found that forced C/EBPa expression in malignant  lymphocyte precursors leads to the formation of macrophages and loss of tumorigenicity, suggesting transdifferentiation as an alternative avenue for therapeutic interventions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The sub-membranous {{skeleton}} of the ciliate Paramecium, the epiplasm, {{is composed of}} hundreds of epiplasmic scales centered on basal bodies, and presents {{a complex set of}} proteins, epiplasmins, which belong to a <b>multigenic</b> family. The repeated duplications observed in the P. tetraurelia genome present an interesting model of the organization and evolution of a <b>multigenic</b> family within a single cell. Results To study this <b>multigenic</b> family, we used phylogenetic, structural, and analytical transcriptional approaches. The phylogenetic method defines 5 groups of epiplasmins in the <b>multigenic</b> family. A refined analysis by Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) identifies structural characteristics of 51 epiplasmins, defining five separate groups, and three classes. Depending on the sequential arrangement of their structural domains, the epiplasmins are defined as symmetric, asymmetric or atypical. The EST data aid in this classification, in the identification of putative regulating sequences such as TATA or CAAT boxes. When specific RNAi experiments were conducted using sequences from either symmetric or asymmetric classes, phenotypes were drastic. Local effects show either disrupted or ill-shaped epiplasmic scales. In either case, this results in aborted cell division. Using structural features, we show that 4 epiplasmins are also present in another ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila. Their affiliation with the distinctive structural groups of Paramecium epiplasmins demonstrates an interspecific <b>multigenic</b> family. Conclusion The epiplasmin <b>multigenic</b> family illustrates the history of genomic duplication in Paramecium. This study provides a framework which can guide functional analysis of epiplasmins, the major components of the membrane skeleton in ciliates. We show that this set of proteins handles an important developmental information in Paramecium since maintenance of epiplasm organization is crucial for cell morphogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{degradation}} of wood is mainly restricted to basidiomycetes, these organisms having developed complex oxidative and hydrolytic enzymatic systems.

The members of the detoxification pathways constitute the xenome. Generally, they belong to <b>multigenic</b> families such as the cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases and the glutathione transferases. Taking advantage of the recent release of numerous genomes of basidiomycetes, we show here that these <b>multigenic</b> families are extended and functionally related in wood-decaying fungi. Furthermore, we postulate that these rapidly evolving <b>multigenic</b> families could reflect the adaptation of these fungi to the diversity of their substrate and provide keys to understand their ecology.

40|$|Theoretical models {{suggest that}} gene {{silencing}} at the nuclear periphery may involve "closing" of chromatin by transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here we provide experimental evidence confirming these predictions. Histone acetylation, chromatin compactness, and gene repression in lamina-interacting <b>multigenic</b> chromatin domains were analyzed in Drosophila S 2 cells in which B-type lamin, diverse HDACs, and lamina-associated proteins were downregulated by dsRNA. Lamin depletion resulted in decreased compactness of the repressed <b>multigenic</b> domain associated with its detachment from the lamina and enhanced histone acetylation. Our data reveal the major role for HDAC 1 in mediating deacetylation, chromatin compaction, and gene silencing in the <b>multigenic</b> domain, and an auxiliary role for HDAC 3 {{that is required}} for retention of the domain at the lamina. These findings demonstrate the manifold and central involvement of class I HDACs in regulation of lamina-associated genes, illuminating a mechanism by which these enzymes can orchestrate normal and pathological development...|$|E

Additionally, native Tat vaccines have conferred strong protection against simian/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV 89. 6 P challenge of cynomolgus monkeys, while native, inactivated, or vectored Tat vaccines {{have failed to}} elicit similar protective efficacy in rhesus macaques. Here we asked if priming rhesus macaques with replicating Ad-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat and boosting with the Tat protein would elicit protection against SHIV 89. 6 P. We also evaluated a Tat/Env regimen, adding an Ad-HIV env recombinant and envelope protein boost to test whether envelope antibodies would augment acute-phase protection. Further, expecting cellular immunity to enhance chronic viremia control, we tested a <b>multigenic</b> group: Ad-HIV tat, -HIV env, -SIV gag, and -SIV nef recombinants and Tat, Env, and Nef proteins. All regimens were immunogenic. A hierarchy was observed in enzyme-linked immunospot responses (with the strongest response for Env, followed by Gag, followed by Nef, followed by Tat) and antibody titers (with the highest titer for Env, followed by Tat, followed by Nef, followed by Gag). Following intravenous SHIV 89. 6 P challenge, all macaques became infected. Compared to controls, no protection {{was seen in the}} Tat-only group, confirming previous reports for rhesus macaques. However, the <b>multigenic</b> group blunted acute viremia by approximately 1 log (P = 0. 017), and both the <b>multigenic</b> and Tat/Env groups reduced chronic viremia by 3 and 4 logs, respectively, compared to controls (<b>multigenic,</b> P = 0. 0003; Tat/Env, P < 0. 0001). The strikingly greater reduction in the Tat/Env group than in the <b>multigenic</b> group (P = 0. 014) was correlated with Tat and Env binding antibodies. Since prechallenge anti-Env antibodies lacked SHIV 89. 6 P-neutralizing activity, other functional anti-Env and anti-Tat activities are under investigation, as is a possible synergy between the Tat and Env immunogens...|$|E
40|$|We use the <b>multigenic</b> {{pattern of}} gene {{expression}} across suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) regions {{and time to}} understand the dynamics within the SCN {{in response to a}} circadian phase-resetting light pulse. Global gene expression studies of the SCN indicate that circadian functions like phase resetting are complex <b>multigenic</b> processes. While the molecular dynamics of phase resetting are not well understood, it is clear they involve a "functional gene expression program", e. g., the coordinated behavior of functionally related genes in space and time. In the present study we selected a set of 89 of these functionally related genes in order to further understand this <b>multigenic</b> program. By use of high-throughput qPCR we studied 52 small samples taken by anatomically precise laser capture from within the core and shell SCN regions, and taken at time points with and without phase resetting light exposure. The results show striking regional differences in light response to be present in the mouse SCN. By using network-based analyses, we are able to establish a highly specific <b>multigenic</b> correlation between genes expressed in response to light at night and genes normally activated during the day. The light pulse triggers a complex and highly coordinated network of gene regulation. The largest differences marking neuroanatomical location are in transmitter receptors, and the largest time-dependent differences occur in clock-related genes. Nighttime phase resetting appears to recruit transcriptional regulatory processes normally active in the day. This program, or mechanism, causes the pattern of core region gene expression to transiently shift to become more like that of the shell region...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The role {{of random}} {{mutations}} and genetic errors {{in defining the}} etiology of cancer and other <b>multigenic</b> diseases has recently received much attention. With the view that complex genes should be particularly vulnerable to such events, here we explore {{the link between the}} simple properties of the human genes, such as transcript length, number of splice variants, exon/intron composition, and their involvement in the pathways linked to cancer and other <b>multigenic</b> diseases. Results We reveal a substantial enrichment of cancer pathways with long genes and genes that have multiple splice variants. Although the latter two factors are interdependent, we show that the overall gene length and splicing complexity increase in cancer pathways in a partially decoupled manner. Our systematic survey for the pathways enriched with top lengthy genes and with genes that have multiple splice variants reveal, along with cancer pathways, the pathways involved in various neuronal processes, cardiomyopathies and type II diabetes. We outline a correlation between the gene length and the number of somatic mutations. Conclusions Our work is a step forward in the assessment of the role of simple gene characteristics in cancer and a wider range of <b>multigenic</b> diseases. We demonstrate a significant accumulation of long genes and genes with multiple splice variants in pathways of <b>multigenic</b> diseases that have already been associated with de novo mutations. Unlike the cancer pathways, we note that the pathways of neuronal processes, cardiomyopathies and type II diabetes contain genes long enough for topoisomerase-dependent gene expression to also be a potential contributing factor in the emergence of pathologies, should topoisomerases become impaired...|$|E

To engineer the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthetic pathways to de novo produce PAs in two Nicotiana species, we incorporated four transgenes {{to the plant}} chassis. We opted to perform a simultaneous transformation of the genes linked in a <b>multigenic</b> construct rather than classical breeding or retransformation approaches. We generated a GoldenBraid 2. 0 <b>multigenic</b> construct containing two Antirrhinum majus transcription factors (AmRosea 1 and AmDelila) to upregulate the anthocyanin pathway in combination with two Medicago truncatula genes (MtLAR and MtANR) to produce the enzymes that will derivate the biosynthetic pathway to PAs production. Transient and stable transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum with the <b>multigenic</b> construct were respectively performed. Transient expression experiments in N. benthamiana showed the activation of the anthocyanin pathway producing a purple color in the agroinfiltrated leaves and also the effective production of 208. 5 nmol (-) catechin/g FW and 228. 5 nmol (-) epicatechin/g FW measured by the p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) method. The integration capacity of the four transgenes, their respective expression levels and their heritability in the second generation were analyzed in stably transformed N. tabacum plants.
