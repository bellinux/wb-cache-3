500|$|Fresh water aboard Queen Mary 2 is {{supplied}} by three seawater desalination plants. The plants, {{each with a}} capacity of [...] per day, use <b>multiple</b> <b>effect</b> plate (MEP) distillation technology. The plants' energy {{is supplied}} primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional multiple-effect distillation technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that scaling of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is [...] per day with a capacity of [...] {{so that there is}} ample spare capacity. The ship could easily be supplied by only two of the three plants. Potable water tanks have a capacity of , enough for more than three days of supply. If the engines are running on low load (when the ship is running at a slow speed) the engine jacket cooling water temperature is insufficient to heat the seawater to run the desalination plants. In that case steam from oil-fired boilers is used to heat the sea water. This is uneconomical as generating steam is expensive. It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution (brine) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship's stern together with cooling water from the engines. An additional plant was added during the 2016 refit works.|$|E

50|$|One unexploited {{application}} is to 'soften' or pre-treat the feedwater to multi stage flash (MSF) or <b>multiple</b> <b>effect</b> distillation (MED) plants by osmotically diluting the recirculating brine with the cooling water. This reduces {{the concentrations of}} scale forming calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate compared to the normal process, thus allowing an increase in top brine temperature (TBT), output and gained output ratio (GOR). Darwish et al. showed that the TBT could be raised from 110 °C to 135 °C whilst maintaining the same scaling index for calcium sulphate.|$|E
50|$|In 1881, {{at the age}} of 75, Rillieux {{made one}} last foray into sugar {{evaporation}} when he adapted his <b>multiple</b> <b>effect</b> evaporation system to extract sugar from sugar beets. The process for which he filed patent was far more fuel-efficient than that currently in use in the beet sugar factories in France. Prior to Rillieux's invention, two engineers developed a vacuum pan and electric coils to improve the process of making sugar, but this was unsuccessful due to the use of steam at wrong locations in the machine. Rillieux's process fixed the errors in the previous process, but Rillieux lost the rights to the patent he had filed.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{is not the}} sole design criteria however, as the most appropriate evaporator also depends on properties of the feed and products. Crystallisation, salting and scaling, product quality and its heat sensitivity, foaming potential of the solution, viscosity of feed (which increases with evaporation) and its nature (slurry or concentrate) all need to be considered. For Single Effect Evaporators {{that are used in}} small scale processes with low throughput of material, material and energy balances can be used to design and optimise the process. In designing <b>multiple</b> <b>effect</b> evaporators, trial and error methods with many iterations are usually the fastest and most efficient. The general steps in design are as follows, and would be carried out in excel for ease of calculation. Other design software such as Aspen Plus could also be used with built in functions for process equipment.|$|E
