Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the <b>mountain</b> <b>ash</b> <b>sawfly</b> have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
40|$|Six {{species of}} sawfly (Hymenoptera: Symphyta) from four taxonomic {{families}} (Agridae, Diprionidae, Pamphiliidae, and Tenthredinidae) {{were collected from}} locations across Canada and surveyed for their associated microbiota. Total DNA was extracted from individual insects, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the conserved 16 S rRNA gene from microbiota. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) were undertaken to separate bacterial clones associated with the host insect. Sequencing of the PCR–DGGE and PCR–RFLP products revealed a dominance of α- and γ-Proteobacteria, with most sequences showing high similarity to bacteria previously identified from other insect species and environmental samples. Additionally, a strain of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia and a Wolbachia bacteriophage were identified from the <b>mountain</b> <b>ash</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Pristiphora geniculata) ...|$|E

An objective {{of this research is}} development and scientific justification technology of bakeries of products with the improved physical and chemical and organoleptic indicators, due to introduction of a <b>mountain</b> <b>ash</b> black-fruited. Information on changes of physical and chemical and organoleptic indicators of dough in the course of fermentation depending on quantity of the brought additives, and also change of complex indicators of quality of finished products is provided. On the basis of the obtained data selection of optimum ratios of introduction of a product of processing of a <b>mountain</b> <b>ash</b> black-fruited in a compounding of bakeries of products is made. On the basis of an organoleptic and physical and chemical assessment of quality of the finished products received from the studied dough samples the qualimetrical assessment of quality is carried out. The conclusion that the best of studied during research, are samples with introduction of a product of processing of a <b>mountain</b> <b>ash</b> black-fruited in number of 4 % of total of wheat flour of the premium in a compounding is drawn. Development of bakeries of products with introduction of a <b>mountain</b> <b>ash</b> black-fruited allows to receive a product with high physical and chemical and organoleptic quality indicators, a treatment-and prophylactic orientation.
