Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) or subgrain boundaries are those with a <b>misorientation</b> less than about 15 degrees.

40|$|This study {{involved}} controlled {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) damage of high purity poly-crystalline Zirconium (Zr) and EBSD (electron backscattered diffraction) observations on the same region/microstructure. Direct experimental observations were augmented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: the latter demonstrating a hierarchy of microstructural features enabling/retarding relative ion damage. Experimental results clearly established a non-monotonic dependence of damage kinetics with average grain size. Damage increased with grain size, till an average grain size of 12 micron, and then dropped. This was explained from combined effects of grain size and in-grain <b>misorientations.</b> For lower than 12 micron average grain size, noticeable in-grain <b>misorientations</b> enabled lower damage kinetics. For greater than 17 micron grain size, with insignificant in-grain <b>misorientations,</b> reduced presence of high angle grain boundaries were shown to retard relative ion damage.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this study}} is to develop a general picture of the role of geometrically {{necessary}} dislocations (GNDs) in the evolution of long-range internal stresses and lattice plane <b>misorientations</b> in the heterogeneous dislocation pattern of deformed crystals. For this purpose, X-ray diffraction techniques are considered as the pertinent experimental tools. On the modelling side, the composite models of single/multiple slip serve to interpret the experimentally measured long-range internal stresses quantitatively in terms of densities of GNDs. However, in order to be able to deduce from experiment the evolution of those GNDs that are responsible for the observed lattice plane <b>misorientations,</b> the composite model must be refined. Quite generally, one and the same GND array can give rise to both long-range internal stresses and lattice plane <b>misorientations.</b> On this basis, available experimental data obtained on cyclically and tensile-deformed copper single crystals were analyzed quantitatively. The stresses acting locally in the “hard” dislocation cell walls and in the “soft” cell interiors and the magnitude of the internal stresses are found to increase approximately linearly with the applied stress. The density of the GNDs responsible for the long-range internal stresses (and/or for the <b>misorientations)</b> is always found to amount to only a few per cent of the total dislocation density. An analysis of the evolution of the lattice plane <b>misorientations</b> shows that the kink walls and the dislocation sheets/grids in stage II are geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs), whereas the dislocation cell walls formed by multiple slip are incidental dislocation boundaries (IDBs) ...|$|R

Cases where the most common boundary orientation is a plane of high planar coincident site density instead of a characteristic habit plane are rare. In fact, in most cases, the distributions of grain boundary planes at <b>misorientations</b> with high lattice coincidence are not substantially different from the distributions at other, more general <b>misorientations.</b> The results indicate that a model for grain boundary energy and structure based on grain surface relationships is more appropriate than the widely accepted models based on lattice orientation relationships...|$|R

30|$|After {{the first}} five γ-ε-γ cycles, the {{magnitude}} of ψ for the martensite {{was found to be}} higher than that for the austenite. Throughout this initial cycling, no visible accumulation of <b>misorientations</b> was observed, due to high crystallographic reversibility of the forward γ-ε and the reverse ε-γ transformations. But after 10  cycles of the transitions, <b>misorientations</b> started to accumulate in the crystal lattice of the austenite {{as well as in the}} martensite. When number of cycles is below 70 – 80, we are able to compare the magnitudes of ψ for the γ- and ε-phases. But after it exceeds 100, only the ε-phase can be registered using X-ray diffractometry. This is because, in the phase-hardened alloy, the γ-phase fully transforms into the ε-phase on cooling to room temperature after the completion of the reverse ε-γ transformation. The modification of the diffractometer used in this work was designed for room temperature measurements only; hence, after 100  cycles, the determination of ψ for the γ-phase was beyond the scope of this instrument.
