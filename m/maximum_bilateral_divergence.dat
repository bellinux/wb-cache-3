30|$|Here, {{we found}} that CD 56 dimCD 16 high cells {{included}} the mature NK and NKT cells were significant positive cellular immune indicators when compared to knee extensor and hand grip strength in very elderly subjects. The proportion of CD 56 dimCD 16 high in CD 56 +CD 16 + cells and the ratio of CD 56 dimCD 16 high and CD 56 dimCD 16 − cells correlated positively with the <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> knee extensor strength and <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> knee extensor strength/body weight. Logistic regression analysis showed the <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> knee extension strength/body weight was independently associated with the percentage of CD 56 dimCD 16 high cells within the total CD 56 +CD 16 + cells in males and females (Table  2). Various expression levels of CD 16 were found on CD 56 cells in the elderly. Reports show during maturation of the CD 56 bright (immature cells) into CD 3 −CD 56 dimCD 16 + NK cells (mature cells), the expression of NKp 46, NKG 2 D, Nkp 30, and NKG 2 A decreases and CD 16 expression is acquired (Moretta et al. 2002). Thus, the amount of CD 16 expression on the cell surface correlates {{with the level of}} maturation of the NK cell. CD 3 +CD 56 +CD 16 + NKT cells also have cytotoxic activity. The CD 56 dimCD 16 high cells have higher expression levels of CD 16, which may be useful indicators of the maturation of the NK and NKT subpopulation cells in the elderly.|$|R
30|$|Physical {{fitness is}} an {{indicator}} of systemic well-being in humans. Little {{is known about the}} role of physical fitness for maintaining systemic health in the elderly. Here, we study elderly subjects to determine the relationships between physical fitness and CD 56 and CD 16 surface NK cell markers on peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as to analyze the relationship between the surface markers and incidence of death. We selected 253 independent elderly subjects (122 female; 131 male) who were 79 – 80  years old. Subjects having a higher proportion of CD 56 dimCD 16 high within CD 56 +CD 16 + cells, or ration of CD 56 dimCD 16 high and CD 56 dimCD 16 − cells had a significant positive correlation with <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> knee extensor strength/weight (kg) (r =  0.425; P <  0.0001 or r =  0.323; P <  0.0001). In contrast, an increased proportion of CD 56 brightCD 16 − cells within lymphocyte significantly negatively correlated with the <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> knee extensor strength/weight (kg) (r = − 0.290; P =  0.0004); and these subjects had a significantly lower mortality during the 5  years following measurement of death. Therefore, we found that a synergistic effect of the right and left leg muscle strength was associated with proportion of matured NK and NKT cells and induced a low proportion of CD 56 brightCD 16 − cells within lymphocyte. Moreover, the low proportion of CD 56 brightCD 16 − cells was associated with incidence of death. In conclusion, measurements of physical fitness, the proportion of CD 56 dimCD 16 high within CD 56 +CD 16 + cells, the ratio of CD 56 dimCD 56 high and CD 56 dimCD 16 − cells, and the proportion of CD 56 brightC 16 − cells in lymphocytes are important indicators to check elderly health.|$|R

30|$|We {{conducted}} a medical examination followed by six physical fitness tests: maximum hand grip strength (Rantanen et al. 1998; Sonn et al. 1995), <b>maximum</b> unilateral and <b>bilateral</b> knee extensor strength (Rantanen et al. 1999; Sonn et al. 1995), maximum stepping rate for 10  s (Shindo et al. 1987), one-leg standing time with eyes open (Michikawa et al. 2009; Haga et al. 1986; Stones and Kozma 1987), and a 10 -m maximum walking speed test (Shinkai et al. 2000). The maximum hand grip strength {{in both the}} dominant and non-dominant hand was measured using a Smedley hand dynamometer (DM- 100 s, Yagami, Inc., Nagoya, Japan). The score used {{was the best of}} the trials between both grip strengths. The equipment for the isometric leg extension and hand grip strength tests were determined and calibrated before beginning the test. The <b>maximum</b> unilateral and <b>bilateral</b> isometric knee extensor strength was determined using a portable chair incorporating a dynamometer connected to a load cell. The subject sat on a seat in a vertical position that was adjusted so that he or she sat comfortably with legs hanging vertically and the knees bent at 90 °. The measurement of the maximum unilateral knee extension strength was performed twice on the right and left legs alternately, and thereafter the measurement of the <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> knee extension strength was performed once. The rest interval between contractions of the leg muscles was more than 2  min. The maximum step rate for 10  s was used as an index of agility using an industrial step rate counter (Stepping Counter, Yagami Inc). The subject was instructed to step as fast as possible for 10  s with each leg alternately while in a sitting position. The stepping rate for the left and right leg was summed for this analysis. The one-leg standing time with eyes open was measured. The static balance function was measured with the subject’s eyes open and arms out, standing on one foot with the other off the floor. The score was either the number of seconds when the non-preferred foot was raised and balance was lost (when the subject began to hop around or when the raised foot was lowered to the floor) or when 2  min had elapsed. The subjects performed one trial on each foot and the best score was recorded. The maximum walking speed was measured having the subjects walk at their fastest pace over a 10 -m course.

Therefore, the normalization by body weight was performed in every physical fitness data. To analyze the association of <b>bilateral</b> <b>maximum</b> knee extensor strength/weight (kg) compared to NK cell maturation, logistic regression models were used.

Para tanto, o estudo foi composto por três capítulos. No capítulo 1, intitulado Influence of measurement technique, test food, teeth and muscle force interactions in masticatory performance evaluation, realizou-se a revisão de literatura sobre performance mastigatória e discorreu-se sobre as variáveis influenciadoras. A revisão mostrou que {{a performance}} mastigatória tem sido amplamente avaliada e associada às variáveis morfológicas e funcionais do sistema mastigatório. No capítulo 2, intitulado Masticatory performance {{before and after}} oral rehabilitation in children, avaliou-se a performance mastigatória com alimento teste artificial. No capítulo 3, intitulado The influence of oral rehabilitation on muscle activity and chewing behavior in partially edentulous children, avaliou-se a atividade eletromiográfica dos músculos masseter e porção anterior do temporal e o comportamento mastigatório com alimentos de diferentes consistências. Avaliou-se também as variáveis corporais, peso e altura em ambos os capítulos. A performance mastigatória foi avaliada através da mastigação de um material à base de silicona, utilizando o sistema de peneiragem fragmentada para determinar o tamanho das partículas após mastigação. Para o registro eletromiográfico, foram utilizados o sistema de aquisição de sinais (EMG System do Brasil Ltda.) e o software Aqdados ? versão 5. 0 da Lynx Eletrônica Ltda. O sinal eletromiográfico foi captado em contração voluntária <b>máxima</b> <b>bilateral</b> tendo o material Parafilm entre os molares e em mastigação habitual com alimento teste artificial. Os alimentos utilizados para avaliação da mastigação foram: goma de mascar (Trident tutti fruit, Adams), cenoura crua, queijo polenghi, banana nanica, torrada industrializada. Na análise dos dados do segundo e terceiro capítulos utilizou-se o teste de Shapiro-Wilk para verificação da normalidade da distribuição dos dados. Os Testes t pareado, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis e post hoc Dun, Correlação de Pearson e Spearman e regressão linear foram aplicados quando indicados, com nível de significância de 5 %. Os resultados mostraram que não houve diferença estatística entre os sexos para nenhuma das variáveis (p> 0. 05). Houve um decréscimo significativo para o tamanho da partícula mediana antes e após 6 meses da instalação do aparelho protético (p 0, 05). Houve diferenças significativas no número de ciclos mastigatórios até a deglutição, duração da mastigação e a quantidade de alimento ingerida tanto para os alimentos duros quanto macios nas duas avaliações. A prótese parcial removível influenciou os aspectos funcionais dos músculos, determinando melhora da eficiência mastigatória e aumento da atividade muscularAbstract: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the masticatory performance, the electromyographic activity of the masseter and temporal anterior muscles and the chewing of foods of different consistency in children in the phase of mixed dentition, with early loss of posterior deciduous teeth, before and six months after oral rehabilitation with removable dental prosthesis. Three chapters compose the study. In chapter 1, entitled Influence of measurement technique, test food, teeth and muscle force interactions in masticatory performance evaluation, a review of the pertinent literature about masticatory performance was done, and the influencing variables were discussed. The review showed that masticatory performance has been widely evaluated and associated to the morphological and functional variables of the masticatory system. The second chapter entitled Masticatory performance before and after oral rehabilitation in children evaluated the masticatory efficiency with artificial test food. The third chapter entitled The influence of oral rehabilitation on muscle activity and chewing behavior in partially edentulous children evaluated the electromyographic activities of the masseter and temporal anterior muscles and the chewing of foods of different consistency. Also, it was evaluated the body variables, weight and height, in these two chapters. The masticatory performance was evaluated by the mastication of a silicone impression material, using the fragmented sieving system to determine the size of the chewed particles. For the electromyographic record, were used the system of acquisition of signs (EMG System of Brazil Ltd.) and software Aqdados-version 5. 0 of Lynx Eletrônica Ltd. The electromyographic sign was captured in <b>maximum</b> <b>bilateral</b> voluntary contraction having the Parafilm material among the molars and in habitual mastication with artificial tests food. The foods for the chewing evaluation were: chewing gum raw carrot, polenghi cheese, banana and industrialized toast. For data analysis in the second and the third chapters, the normality of the distributions was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilks W-test. The t paired tests, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis and pos hoc Dun, Pearson?s or Spearman?s Correlations and linear regression were applied as indicated, with significance level of 5 %. The results showed no statistical differences between genders for any of the variables (p> 0. 05). There was a significant decrease in the median particle size from first to second evaluation (p= 0. 000). The muscle activity was significantly greater on the second evaluation during the chewing of the artificial food (p< 0. 05). Considering the body variables, there was a significant negative correlation between masticatory efficiency, body height and weight in the first session of exams. After 6 months of the placement of the prosthesis no significant correlations were found for these variables (p< 0. 05). It was observed significant differences in number of cycles until swallowing, chewing duration and amount of food ingested for the soft and hard foods, at the two evaluations. Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the removable dental prosthesis influenced the function of the muscles, determining an increase in the masticatory efficiency and an increasing in the muscle activity. It was considered that the body alterations could have been consequences of the enhancement in the masticatory function determined by the oral rehabilitatio...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Activity of {{the motor}} cortex in one {{hemisphere}} reduces the maximum motor outflow of homologous parts of the opposite hemisphere, causing {{a reduction in the}} maximum force a muscle can exert when the contralateral homologous muscle is activated concurrently. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish whether this bilateral deficit is large enough to explain limitations in performance in bilateral exertions. Methods: Voluntary force production and neural drive during unilateral and bilateral exertions were compared in three experiments, consisting of unilateral <b>maximum</b> contractions, synchronous <b>bilateral</b> contractions, and asynchronous bilateral contractions of finger flexors and knee extensors. Results: Maximum voluntary force was overall about 7 % lower in bilateral knee extension as compared with unilateral knee extension (P < 0. 001). In finger flexion, a bilateral voluntary force deficit of as much as 20 % was found (P = 0. 001). Corresponding deficits in agonist EMG activity were also significant and on average found to be of similar size, though the magnitude of the bilateral deficit in EMG was not consistently related to the magnitude of the bilateral force deficit. In knee extension, a deficit in voluntary activation of 4 % (P = 0. 003) was demonstrated by means of superimposed tetanic stimulation. The magnitude of this deficit was correlated to the magnitude of the voluntary force deficit (r = 0. 80, P = 0. 002). The maximum rate of force development in bilateral knee extensions was 13 % lower than in a unilateral knee extension (P = 0. 002). Conclusion: These results suggest that deficits in bilateral force production are large enough to constitute an important performance-limiting factor. Furthermore, the data suggest that a reduced neural drive underlies this bilateral deficit...|$|R

MethodsSeventy–six patients respectively with early transected and avulsed types of Achilles tendon rupture were selected and treated with internal fixation of steel–wire limited loop. The patients began to take exercise for their lower limbs through continous passive motion {{as early as possible}} after surgical repair, and the loops were removed after 3 – 5 months. Six months later, the condition of complications including Achilles tendon re–rupture, wound fistula, wound infection and skin necrosis, cutaneous sensation in sural nerve dominance region, time back to preinjury work or learning as well as time to physical activities were observed. One year later, the therapeutic effect was evaluated, and the <b>maximum</b> circumferences of <b>bilateral</b> legs and ruptured plane circumferences of Achilles tendon were measured. ResultsThe wound of all patients healed well, no complications like Achilles tendon re–rupture, wound fistula, wound infection and skin necrosis occured, and the cutaneous sensation in sural nerve dominance region was normal. The mean time back to preinjury work or learning as well as to pysical activities of all patients were respectively 10 and 22 weeks. Seventy out of 76 patients (92. 1 %) achieved an excellent effect, and 6 (7. 9 %) good effect. The excellent and good rate came up to 100 %. The maximum circumference in the affected leg decreased to 2 mm averagely compared with the offside, while the ruptured plane circumferences of Achilles tendon in the affected side increased to 2. 2 mm compared with the offside.

Methods: Ten untrained men (mean T SD: age = 22 T 4 yr, body mass = 77. 8 T 8. 3 kg, percent body fat = 17. 8 T 4. 0) participated in three resistance exercise sessions (three sets of 10 repetitions at 80 % one-repetition <b>maximum</b> for the <b>bilateral</b> hack squat, leg press, and leg extension exercises) in a crossover fashion, which were preceded by carbohydrate, protein, or placebo ingestion 30 min before training. Presupplement/preexercise and 2 - and 6 -h postexercise muscle biopsies were obtained during each session and analyzed for fold changes in CDK 4, CYCLIN D 1, MGF, MYOD, P 21 CIP 1, and P 27 KIP 1 messenger RNA expression using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as muscle [DNA] using cuvette-based fluorometric methods. Results: Nonparametric statistics were completed, and no conditions _ time interaction effects were revealed. Several exercise-mediated responses were found to occur independent of condition: 1) muscle [DNA] increased at 6 h (+ 40 %, P G 0. 05), 2) CDK 4 expression increased at 6 h (+ 86 %, P G 0. 05), 3) MYOD expression increased at 6 h (+ 98 %, P G 0. 05), 4) P 27 KIP 1 expression decreased at 2 h (j 35 %, P G 0. 05) and 6 h (j 59 %, P G 0. 001), and 5) P 21 CIP 1 expression substantially increased 2 and 6 h postexercise (+ 1. 250 % and + 4. 670 %, respectively, P G 0. 001).

40|$|When {{individuals}} with post-stroke hemiparesis train with upper or lower extremity robotic devices, they increase muscle recruitment and strength {{specific to the}} joints exercised. Although current robotic devices address muscle weakness in individuals post-stroke, they do not address patients’ impaired force scaling abilities. In this dissertation I examined foot forces produced during lower limb extensions and designed and tested {{the use of a}} novel control mode (symmetry-based resistance) for improving individuals’ force-scaling abilities. With symmetry-based resistance, exercise resistance increases with increasing lower limb force asymmetry. Subjects who train with symmetry-based resistance perform the least work when they produce symmetric forces. In the first and second experiments, I investigated foot reaction forces in neurologically intact and post-stroke individuals. When both subject populations were asked to produce equal isometric forces in their lower limbs, they generated less force in their weaker limb even though they believed their forces were equal. Normalizing force by each limbs’ <b>bilateral</b> <b>maximum</b> voluntary contraction force revealed no significant differences between limbs. These results suggest that individuals relied primarily on sense of effort, rather than proprioceptive feedback, for gauging isometric lower limb force production. Results suggest that sense of effort is also major factor determining force production during isotonic, or dynamic, movements in subjects post-stroke. In the third experiment, I demonstrated that neurologically intact individuals can successfully use the robotic device with symmetry-based resistance to improve their force scaling abilities and increase lower limb force symmetry from ~ 46 % to ~ 50 % (where 50 % indicates perfect symmetry). In the final experiment, {{individuals with}} post-stroke hemiparesis were able to improve their lower limb symmetry from an initial average value of ~ 29 % to ~ 36 % during exercise with symmetry-based resistance. Improvements in lower limb symmetry, however, were not maintained during the one day training session when the controller was turned off. Subjects who trained for four weeks showed a trend towards retention of improved symmetry as initial lower limb symmetry values were improved from Day 1 to Day 4. Overall these studies provide information about the neural mechanisms for lower limb force generation and suggest an innovative controller for stroke rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} {{predictive}} model of spatial release from masking (SRM) for cochlear implantees, and validate this model against {{data from the}} literature. To establish the spatial configurations for which the model predicts a large advantage of bilateral over unilateral implantation. To collect data to support these predictions and generate predictions of more typical advantages of bilateral implantation. Design: The model initially assumed that bilateral cochlear implantees had equally effective implants on each side, with which they could perform optimal better-ear listening. Predictions were compared with measurements of SRM, using one and two implants with up to three interfering noises. The effect of relaxing the assumption of equally effective implants was explored. Novel measurements of SRM for eight unilateral implantees were collected, including measurements using speech and noise at azimuths of ± 60 degrees, and compared with prediction. A spatial map of bilateral implant benefit was generated for a situation with one interfering noise in anechoic conditions, and predictions of benefit were generated from binaural room impulse responses {{in a variety of}} real rooms. Results: The model accurately predicted data from a previous study for multiple interfering noises in a variety of spatial configurations, even when implants were assumed to be equally effective (r = 0. 97). It predicted that the <b>maximum</b> benefit of <b>bilateral</b> implantation was 18 dB. Predictions were little affected if the implants were not assumed to be equally effective. The new measurements supported the 18 dB advantage prediction. The spatial map of predicted benefit showed that, for a listener facing the target voice, bilateral implantees could enjoy an advantage of about 10 dB over unilateral implantees {{in a wide range of}} situations. Predictions based on real-room measurements with speech and noise at 1 m showed that large benefits can occur even in reverberant spaces. Conclusions: In optimal conditions, the benefit of bilateral implantation to speech intelligibility in noise can be much larger than has previously been reported. This benefit is thus considerably larger than reported benefits of summation or squelch and is robust in reverberation when the interfering source is close...|$|R

As the disease advances, syndesmophytes will form in axial joints leading to further functional loss. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is widely used as a surrogate marker for subclinical atherosclerosis. It is proposed that persistent systemic inflammation in SpA is associated with early carotid atherosclerosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the changes of carotid IMT in patients with axial SpA and their relationship with the underlying disease severity. METHODS: A total of 104 patients with axial SpA (mean age, 45. 5 ± 13. 3 years; 69. 2 % male) and 52 age- and gendermatched healthy controls were enrolled into the study. All patients underwent clinical examination, laboratory blood tests, and spine radiographs. High-resolution ultrasonography was used to measure far-wall carotid IMT at the common carotid artery. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>maximum</b> carotid IMT measurements were performed ofﬂine using semi-automated imaging processing software and the mean carotid IMT was calculated for evaluating atherosclerosis. The disease duration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, Bath Ankylosing spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) scores were recorded. The disease severity of the axial SpA patients was assessed by modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS). RESULTS: Carotid IMT was significantly increased in patients with axial SpA compared with controls (0. 78 ± 0. 19 mm vs 0. 69 ± 0. 10 mm; P < 0. 001). In axial SpA patients, BASDAI (β = 0. 22, P = 0. 03), BASFI (β = 0. 45, P < 0. 001), and mSASSS (β = 0. 60, P < 0. 001) correlated significantly with carotid IMT. Multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounding factors demonstrated that mSASSS was independently associated with carotid IMT (β = 0. 23, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 00 - 0. 01; P= 0. 03). In patients with mSASSS score above the median value (14. 75), carotid IMT was significantly higher compared with patients below the median value (0. 85 ± 0. 18 mm vs 0. 71 ± 0. 16 mm; P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that patients with axial SpA had early carotid atherosclerosis. mSASSS remained independently associated with carotid IMT after adjusting for the confounding factors. Importantly, the group with mSASSS score above the median value had a significantly higher carotid IMT. In conclusion, this study shows that patients with axial SpA have a tendency to develop subclinical atherosclerosis which correlates significantly with the disease severity. Whether effective disease control could prevent the development of atherosclerosis remains to be investigated...|$|R
