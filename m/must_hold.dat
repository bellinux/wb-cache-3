5|$|Ofcom awards {{licenses}} for digital radio services differently {{depending on the}} type of service and the platform. Ofcom advertises the licences of new digital radio ensembles and are subject to an open competition to the highest bidder. Ensemble licence awards are awarded for twelve years. To broadcast a service on a DAB ensemble, a station <b>must</b> <b>hold</b> a Digital Sound Programme Service licence from Ofcom. On digital television services, individual stations can apply for either a digital cable and satellite licence to broadcast on the aforementioned platforms, or apply for a digital terrestrial licence to broadcast on digital terrestrial television.|$|E
5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, {{existence of the}} empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct <b>must</b> <b>hold</b> for all sets.|$|E

5|$|The {{transport}} of hazardous goods through the crossing {{is governed by}} the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned. Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority <b>must</b> <b>hold</b> exercises {{in conjunction with the}} emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions <b>must</b> <b>hold).</b> Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Citizens {{of member}} {{nations of the}} Gulf Cooperation Council and Jordan may travel to Republic of Lebanon without visa limits for a maximum stay of 6 months per year and 3 months per 6 months respectively, {{citizens}} of the 79 other countries and territories are granted a visa on arrival at Beirut International Airport or any other port of entry {{if there is no}} Israeli stamps, visas, or seals on their passport and are holding a telephone number, address in the Republic of Lebanon, and a non-refundable return or circle trip ticket for a maximum stay of one month, extendable for 2 additional months. Citizens of Brazil and Turkey are instead granted a multiple entry visa valid for a maximum stay of 1 month and 3 months respectively. All visitors <b>must</b> <b>hold</b> a passport valid for 6 months beyond the period of intended stay and with two blank pages. An identity document is accepted in lieu of a passport for Jordanian citizens.|$|E

5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States <b>must</b> <b>hold</b> a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E

If the contestant is thrown by the bull or falls, they lose. Some variations only allow for one contestant. If two people grab the hump, then neither person wins.|$|R
