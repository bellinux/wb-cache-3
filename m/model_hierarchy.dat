The standard engine for 1971-72 was a 455 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was rated at 280 gross horsepower for 1971 and 185 net horsepower for 1972 and optionally available was the four-barrel version of the 455 rated at 325 gross horsepower in 1971 and 250 net horsepower in 1972.

50|$|To {{simulate}} an HDL model, {{an engineer}} writes a top-level simulation environment (called a test bench). At minimum, a testbench contains an instantiation {{of the model}} (called the device under test or DUT), pin/signal declarations for the model's I/O, and a clock waveform. The testbench code is event driven: the engineer writes HDL statements to implement the (testbench-generated) reset-signal, to model interface transactions (such as a host-bus read/write), and to monitor the DUT's output. An HDL simulator — the program that executes the testbench — maintains the simulator clock, which is the master reference for all events in the testbench simulation. Events occur only at the instants dictated by the testbench HDL (such as a reset-toggle coded into the testbench), or in reaction (by the model) to stimulus and triggering events. Modern HDL simulators have full-featured graphical user interfaces, complete with a suite of debug tools. These allow the user to stop and restart the simulation at any time, insert simulator breakpoints (independent of the HDL code), and monitor or modify any element in the HDL <b>model</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Modern simulators can also link the HDL environment to user-compiled libraries, through a defined PLI/VHPI interface. Linking is system-dependent (Win32/Linux/SPARC), as the HDL simulator and user libraries are compiled and linked outside the HDL environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cognitive <b>hierarchy</b> <b>models</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to explain systematic devi-ations from the equilibrium behavior in certain classes of games. This paper introduces an endogenous cognitive <b>hierarchy</b> <b>model,</b> which better explains the behavioral heterogene-ity of the strategies in games for which the standard cognitive <b>hierarchy</b> <b>model</b> provides an unreasonable prediction. As in the previous models, each player in the endogenous cognitive <b>hierarchy</b> <b>model</b> is assumed to best-reply to the other players holding a belief induced by the cognitive hierarchy. Contrary to the previous models, however, players are allowed to consider the presence of opponents at their own level of cognitive hierarchy. This extension is shown to eradicate the incompatibility of cognitive <b>hierarchy</b> <b>models</b> in the classes of games. We employ the model to explain voting behavior in information aggregation problems of the Condorcet Jury Theorem. Behavioral assumption of the strategic thinking {{turns out to be a}} crucial factor in whether the asymptotic efficiency is obtained or not.

40|$|Abstract The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a {{pronounced}} signal of climate {{variability in the}} North Atlantic sea-surface temperature field. In this paper, we propose {{an explanation of the}} physical processes responsible for the timescale and the spatial pattern of the AMO. Our approach involves the analysis of solutions of a hierarchy of models. In the lowest member of the <b>model</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> which is an ocean-only model for flow in an idealized basin, the variability shows up as a multidecadal oscillatory mode which is able to destabilize the mean thermohaline circulation. In the highest member of the <b>model</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> which is the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory R 30 climate model, multidecadal variability is found as a dominant statistical mode of variability. The connection between both results is established by tracing the spatial and temporal expression of the multidecadal mode through the <b>model</b> <b>hierarchy</b> while monitoring changes in specific quantities (mechanistic indicators) associated with its physics. The proposed explanation of the properties of the AMO is eventually based on the changes in the spatial patterns of variability through the <b>model</b> <b>hierarchy...</b>|$|E
