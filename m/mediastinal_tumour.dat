40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{rhabdomyosarcoma}} which occurred in a mediastinal teratoma in a 44 -year-old man. Presentation symptoms were chest pain, hoarseness and a cough. Diagnosis was fortuitous, performed by the histological and immunohistochemical study of a <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumour</b> biopsy specimen that showed embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumour components associated with the rhabdomyo-sarcoma. After cisplatin-based chemotherapy (bleomycin–etoposide–cisplatin), surgical resection of the residual <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumour</b> was performed. Histological and immunohistochemical study of this tumour confirmed the presence of mature teratoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Evolution was marked by a local extension of the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumour,</b> occurrence of multiple metastases and bone marrow involvement. The patient died 8 months after diagnosis despite chemotherapy and radio-therapy. A {{review of the literature}} reveals that the development of rhabdomyosarcoma in primary mediastinal teratomas is unusual in adults. The diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications of such an association are reviewed.

40|$|Mediastinal masses {{include a}} wide variety of tumours and remain an {{interesting}} diagnostic challenge for radiologist. We performed positron emission tomography (PET) studies of primary <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours</b> in order to predict the malignancy of these tumours preoperatively. Twenty-two patients with primary <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours</b> were studied with PET using 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). The histological findings of surgical pathology or biopsy, or mediastinoscopy were compared with those of computerised tomography (CT) and PET. PET images were evaluated semiquantitatively using the differential uptake ratio (DUR). Increased FDG uptake was observed in nine of ten patients with malignant tumours, including thymic carcinomas, lymphomas, invasive thymomas and a case of sarcoidosis. A moderate level of FDG uptake was found in a myeloma, non-invasive thymomas, and a schwannoma, whereas a low uptake was observed in a teratoma and various benign cysts. The mean FDG uptake of malignant tumours was significantly higher than that of benign tumours. Both thymic cancer and invasive thymoma showed a high FDG uptake. CT examination resulted in three false-negative and two false-positive cases when used in predicting tumour invasion, while PET was associated with a false-positive and a false-negative case. In conclusion, the use of FDG with PET is clinically helpful in evaluating the malignant nature of primary <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours.</b> Our results also suggest that a high FDG uptake reflects the invasiveness of malignant nature of thymic tumours...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Ultrasound guided transthoracic needle {{aspiration}} biopsy {{has recently}} been used to obtain specimens for histological diagnosis of pulmonary and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours.</b> Conventional real time, grey scale puncture guiding devices cannot differentiate vascular structures, and clear visualisation of the needle shaft or tip within a desired target is not always possible. This study describes a new built-in colour Doppler ultrasound puncture guiding device and assesses the relative safety of transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy of thoracic tumours by grey scale or colour Doppler ultrasound guidance. METHODS [...] Thirty patients with radiographic evidence of pulmonary (22 patients) or <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours</b> (eight patients) underwent ultrasonographic evaluation and transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy by using the colour Doppler ultrasound puncture guiding device (Aloka UST 5045 P- 3. 5). These tumours were initially examined by grey scale ultrasound, and colour Doppler imaging was then {{used to evaluate the}} number of blood vessels surrounding and within the target tumour and the possibility of visualisation of the needle shaft or needle tip during the aspiration biopsy procedure. RESULTS [...] The colour Doppler ultrasound guiding device was far superior to the grey scale device for identification of the number of vessels surrounding or within the target tumour (83 % v 20 %) and for visualisation of the needle shaft or needle tip (80 % v 17 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] By using the colour Doppler ultrasound puncture device, vascular structures surrounding or within the target tumour can be verified. Visualisation of the needle shaft or tip is also better. Biopsy routes can be selected to avoid puncturing vessels. This approach should be particularly helpful for guiding biopsies of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours,</b> where puncturing the heart or great vessels is a potential complication...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{present the}} {{technique}} of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumour</b> resection, which includes limited thymectomy, extended thymectomy, cyst excision and posterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumour</b> excision, and the early results of resection {{with the use of}} this technique. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with mediastinal tumours were treated with single-port thoracoscopic mediastinal resection at Chung Gung Memorial Hospital between April 2014 and May 2015. The surgical intervention was performed through the fourth or fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line. A 5 - or 10 -mm 30 ° video camera and working instruments were employed simultaneously at this incision site throughout the surgery. The perioperative variables and outcomes were collected and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among the 29 cases included in the final analysis, 8 extended thymectomies, 5 limited thymectomies, 7 cyst excisions and 9 tumour excisions were performed successfully without the need for conversion. For the 29 patients who underwent single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the mean operation time was 97. 3 ± 31. 2 min and the average blood loss was 34. 1 ± 45. 7 ml.

40|$|AbstractAim: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} percutaneous biopsy with core cutting needle (Trucut) in the diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours.</b> Method: Retrospective review of 56 patients with mediastinal lesions who underwent percutaneous core cutting needle biopsy, oriented but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, 1999 – 2008. Results: Percutaneous biopsy with core cutting needle provided adequate material in 49 / 56, with a total positive sample rate of 88 %. In 7 / 56 (12 %) cases the material was insufficient to define the diagnosis. Percutaneous core cutting needle biopsy established a specific histological diagnosis in 88 % of the patients: 23 / 56 (41 %) lymphomas; 12 / 56 (21 %) thymomas; 5 / 56 (3 %) thymic carcinomas; 3 / 56 (2 %) small cell carcinoma and 1 / 56 (0. 6 %) metastatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine primitive carcinoma, plasmocytoma, teratoma and goiter. All patients underwent thoracic X-ray after the procedure. No complications were found in these patients. Conclusion: Percutaneous core cutting needle biopsy (Trucut) oriented but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax is an easy and safe procedure which can provide a precise diagnosis {{in the majority of}} <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours</b> and can prevent the need for exploratory thoracic surgery in cases which are medically treatable or non-resectable.

40|$|Primary <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumours</b> (PMT) are rare, {{they include}} many {{different}} histological types, but lymphomas, thymomas and neurological tumours make {{up most of}} these tumours.

Diagnosis mainly relies on medical imagery and on biopsy by mediastinoscopy or by CT-Scan controlled needle puncture. The treatment depends on the histological type (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery). Median sternotomy is preferred to tackle anterior and middle mediastinum PMT, since it offers a large operative field and is more comfortable for the patient than classic thoracotomy, which will be reserved to tackle posterior mediastinum PMT.
