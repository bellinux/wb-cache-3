25|$|In 1999, Fred Barron was {{considering}} producing a British sitcom {{the same way}} sitcoms were produced in the U.S. <b>My</b> <b>Family</b> <b>was</b> to feature a group of writers rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in the UK with shows including Goodnight Sweetheart and On the Buses, but <b>was</b> nevertheless atypical. <b>My</b> <b>Family</b> <b>was</b> consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters viewers could build a relationship with {{in the same way}} as previous BBC sitcom 2point4 Children which focuses around a similar family unit.|$|R

500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>is</b> away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E

[...] However, in a 2014 televised interview on the NTV news network, he said, [...] "You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me.

5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>family</b> <b>was</b> {{very shy}} with {{feelings}} and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit. I {{think part of}} the reason I was attracted to theater was because I wanted to be close to stories because they could help me relate to <b>my</b> <b>family.</b>|$|R

2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, De Niro {{consulted}} with Pileggi, who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book. De Niro often called Hill {{several times a day}} to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to, because they exist in a very tight-knit community. She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she [...] "thought {{it would be better if}} the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role". Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging finding what he called [...] "that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>is</b> threatened".|$|E
2500|$|Vinnie {{was raised}} Roman Catholic in {{southern}} Philadelphia. Although his family practiced Catholicism, Vinnie felt {{disconnected from the}} religion. In high school, {{a good friend of}} his was Muslim, and whose home he frequented often. His friend's father soon began teaching Paz about the Qur'an, which was his first foray into the new religion. As an adult, he gradually converted to Islam, and remains a Muslim to this day. In an interview with Jason Goss, Paz stated; [...] "Growing up yeah, I'm Italian and from Philly, so obviously <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>is</b> Roman Catholic. Religion and spirituality are a strange thing, ya know? Most people just grow up and accept the propaganda that their parents pushed on them. Christian families produce Christian kids, Jewish families produce Jewish kids, and so on. Not many people break that mold. I just never felt any connection with Catholicism, or Christianity in general. I {{spent a lot of time}} in high school at my homeboy Arif's crib, and he came from a Muslim family. I learned a lot there from his family and I got interested in Islam through them." ...|$|E
