40|$|Blue <b>mussel</b> Mytilus edulis <b>cultures</b> {{contribute}} to nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems. Mussel populations filter particulate nutrients {{from the water}} column and inorganic nutrients are regenerated by excretion of metabolic wastes and decomposition of (pseudo-) faeces. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the intra-annual variability in nutrient regeneration by <b>mussel</b> rope <b>cultures</b> in oligotrophic fjord systems. In situ respiration and nutrient uptake and release rates of 1 m mussel ropes were measured using 250 l pelagic chambers. There was a 20 -fold difference between winter and summer respiration and nutrient release rates. Inorganic nitrogen release ranged from 50 to 1000 µmol h– 1 per meter rope. These variations were mainly related to mussel growth but were also related to changes in water temperature and biofouling biomass (organisms that colonized the mussel ropes). In total 24 genera of fouling organisms were observed, diversity increased over time (ranging from 2 to 12 genera m– 1), and fouling biomass was mainly characterised by ascidians (max. 37 ± 14 g m– 1). However, <b>mussels</b> dominated the <b>culture</b> ropes, representing > 90 % of total faunal biomass. The amount of organic material associated with the ropes was stable (6. 9 ± 0. 3 g m– 1). At the scale of one mussel farm, nutrient regeneration by <b>mussel</b> rope <b>cultures</b> increased inorganic nitrogen concentrations by 20 % and inorganic phosphorus concentrations by 5 % during summer conditions. During winter, there was no significant effect of <b>mussel</b> <b>cultures</b> on the inorganic nutrient pools. Nutrient regeneration by <b>mussel</b> <b>cultures</b> also affected stoichiometry as nutrients were excreted in dissimilar proportions (nitrogen > phosphate > silicate).

For the spring bloom period in the year 2003 MERIS chlorophyll-a maps, derived with the HYDROPT algorithm for coastal waters, were compared to in-situ measurements at stations off the coast in de Voordelta and the results of the GEM biogeochemical model. The analysis shows that the spatial and temporal variability in Phaeocystis abundance and total biomass (expressed by the Chl-a concentration) during spring is large. It is confirmed that blooms may develop off shore and show a tendency to accumulate within 10 km from the coastline, giving rise to rapid biomass accumulation {{at the mouth of the}} multiple estuaries in the Voordelta.

40|$|<b>Mussel</b> <b>culture</b> in Europe {{produces}} about 50 f {{the annual}} world-wide harvest of mussels. The main yields of atlantic mussels are from Spain, The Netherlands and Denmark, while the Mediterranean production predominantly comes from Italy. Production in these traditional {{areas have been}} stabilised since the 1970 s, and the share of Europe in the world production has decreased due to increased production outside Europe. The following factors are important in analysing production status and perspectives. Mussel production {{is based on an}} extensive culture and depends entirely on natural resources for food, spat and space. In the main culture areas, production with existing techniques seems to have reached the system's carrying capacity. Spat availability can be an additional limiting factor, particularly in bottom culture. In many traditional <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> areas, new functions have developed, such as recreation and nature conservation, and therefore extension of <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> is now also space limited. Expansion of <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> in Europe takes place in areas like Scottish fjords, Ireland and Greece, and is planned in Norway. Further development of sustainable <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> in Europe has different requirements for traditional and for new areas. In new areas the main problems are harmful blooms, local productivity and development of markets.

40|$|The kelps Undaria pinnatifida and Saccharina latissima are {{economically}} valuable edible seaweeds. Although epiphytism is a {{major problem}} affecting the productivity and quality of farmed seaweeds, studies of its effects on kelp aquaculture are scarce. We investigated the effects of epiphytism in two U. pinnatifida and S. latissima culture grounds located in two different parts (exposed and sheltered) of a bay (ría) in Galicia (NW Spain). Epiphytic organisms on blades were identified and their abundance was documented. The percentage of the total blade covered with epiphytes was measured for both kelp species in order to estimate the blade biomass that must be discarded during processing for human consumption. Algae, hydroids, and crustaceans were the most common epiphytic organism on kelp blades; colonies of the hydroid Obelia geniculata and harpacticoid copepods were the most abundant epiphytes. Abundance of epiphytes on the blades of both kelps was significantly higher for fronds growing in the sheltered area of the bay compared to those farmed at the exposed location. Different environmental conditions and other factors, such as the proximity of <b>mussel</b> <b>cultures</b> to kelp cultures, may be important contributors to epiphytism.

Aquaculture might be a solution for at least a part of the problems. However, the short Belgian coastline is already used intensively for recreation, nature conservation and harbour activities, making coastal aquaculture almost impossible. Recent developments in offshore or open-ocean shellfish culture were a challenge to start aquaculture in the rough North Sea. Culture experiments with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) started in 1998 at the ropes and grown over a period of 14 months to marketable size mussels. Preliminary experiments show that mussels metal, and parasite (Buck et al., 2005) loads than their inshore relatives, which leads to a fast growth and a healthy product.

Sediment chemistry, {{microbial}} and meiofaunal assemblages were investigated from March 1997 to February 1998 on monthly basis at two stations: the first was located under the mussel farm, while the second was at about 1 -km distance and served as control. Benthic response {{to changes in the}} biodepositional regime was investigated in terms of biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter, phytopigment content, bacterial abundance and composition and meiofaunal community structure. A large accumulation of chloroplastic pigments, proteins and lipids was observed under the mussel farm. Such changes in the sedimentary conditions reflected the accumulation of faeces and pseudo-faeces and {{led to the creation of}} reducing conditions. Microbial assemblages beneath the <b>mussel</b> <b>cultures</b> increased their densities and displayed, when compared to the control, a larger cyanobacterial importance associated to a strong decrease of the picoeukaryotic cell density. Farm sediments displayed significant changes in meiofaunal density: turbellarian, ostracod and kinorhynch densities decreased significantly, while copepods remained constant or increased possibly profiting of the enrichment in microphytobenthic biomass associated to mussel biodeposits.

A review of national and international projects forms the basis of the paper, where the Dutch North Sea is used as a case-study area. Analysis of technical, economic and ecological boundaries indicated that the potential of fish culture is limited, that seaweed cultivation is likely to gain potential when challenges related to processing will be overcome and that <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> has the highest potential in the near future. The North Sea is an area where many stakeholders claim space, which might set boundaries to the number of sites available for <b>mussel</b> <b>culture.</b> Competing claims are a potential source of conflict but may also lead to mutual benefits when smart combinations are sought, e. g. with wind parks, fisheries and nature conservation; especially, the possibility of combining <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> in or around wind parks is worthwhile to be further explored.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effect of bottom and suspended <b>mussel</b> <b>cultures,</b> cultured in different physical environments, on the sedimentary environmental conditions and thereby the biodiversity structure of the associated macrofaunal community. We compared two bottom cultures (Limfjorden: microtidal, wind-driven; Oosterschelde: macrotidal) and one suspended culture (Ria de Vigo in an upwelling coastal region). The sedimentary environmental conditions (mud fraction, POC, PON, phosphorus content, chl breakdown products) were significantly elevated underneath and surrounding bottom and suspended cultures compared to culture-free sediments that were nearby and hydrodynamically similar. The relative change in environmental conditions was more pronounced in the Oosterschelde compared to Limfjorden, most likely due to differences in hydrodynamic forcing and characteristics of the mussel bed. The effect of the suspended cultures in Ria de Vigo on the surrounding sediments was influenced by local topographic and hydrodynamic conditions. The impact of mussels on the benthic community due to biodeposition was clearly seen in the community structure. The species composition changed from species which are typically present in sandy environments to more small opportunistic species, which are typically present in organically enriched sediments. The impact of bottom cultures on the benthic community due to changes in the habitat under the presence of mussels was positive, especially in the Oosterschelde where an increase in the number of epibenthic species was seen. The influence of bottom cultures on the sedimentary environment and on the macrobenthic community seems to be very local.

40|$|Europe {{has been}} the centre of {{commercial}} mussel farming {{in the world and}} production has been nearly stagnating over the past 	 decade in the major mussel producing countries—Spain, the Netherlands, France and Italy, due to common problems of high 	 cost of production through advanced technologies, limitations of growing grounds and the price structure not being commensurate 	 with cost of production. It is believed that any substantial increase in world production of mussels can come about only through 	 expansion of <b>mussel</b> <b>culture</b> programmes in the developing countries, including India. 	 Due to several limitations, natural production of mussels in India cannot be increased more than 2 - 3 times the present sustenance 	 level.

40|$|Pollutants {{in marine}} coastal areas are mainly a {{consequence}} of anthropogenic inputs, and microorganisms often {{play a major role}} in determining the extent of this pollution. Thus, practical and eco-friendly techniques are urgently required in order to control or minimise the pathogenic bacterial problem. The bacterial accumulation of Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck 1919) in the presence or absence of another filter feeder, the demosponge Hymeniacidon perlevis (Montagu 1818) on sewage flowing into the Northern Ionian Sea has been estimated in a laboratory study. On account of the interesting results obtained, we also evaluated the bioremediation capability of the sponges when reared in co-culture with mussels. Specimens of M. galloprovincialis and H. perlevis were collected from the Mar Grande and from the Second Inlet of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Italy), respectively. In the laboratory, we detected the bacterial abundances in the sewage, in sponge homogenates (both sponges alone and sponges that have been added to sewage with mussels) and in mussel homogenates (both mussels alone and mussels that have been added to sewage with sponges). In the field, we estimated the bacterial concentration in both the seawater within the <b>mussels</b> <b>culture</b> and the seawater collected where mussels were reared in co-culture with sponges. The bacteriological analyses were performed analysing the following parameters: the density of culturable heterotrophic bacteria by spread plate on marine agar, total culturable bacteria at 37  °C on plate count agar and vibrios on thiosulphate–citrate–bile–sucrose–salt (TCBS) agar. Total coliforms, Escherichia coli and intestinal streptococci concentrations were detected by the MPN method. The study demonstrates a higher efficiency of the sponges in removing all the considered bacterial groups compared to the mussels. Due to the conspicuous bacterial accumulation by the sponge, we can conclude that the co-occurrence of the filter-feeder H. perlevis with M. galloprovincialis is a powerful tool in reducing the bacterial load in shellfish culture areas thus playing a role in mitigating the health hazard related to the consumption of edible mussels...|$|R

Temperature and salinity were measured in situ and water samples were collected at different depths each month. Total suspended matter (TSM) and its inorganic (ISM) and organic (OSM) fractions were analysed by gravimetry and loss on ignition. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments), particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON), particulate carbohydrate (CHO), protein (PRT) and lipid concentration (LIP) were also measured. The chlorophyll-a concentrations highlighted the high degree of oligotrophy of the study site. Moreover, the inorganic fraction of total seston, which exceeded the organic fraction throughout the study period, highlighted the importance of the allochthonous input of suspended particles. Two main phytoplankton abundance peaks were observed, in spring and autumn. These peaks were mirrored by the biochemical composition of the biopolymeric fraction of particulate organic matter (POM, the sum of PRT, CHO and LIP concentrations). The relatively high values of the POC:PON ratio indicated that the major fraction of particulate organic matter in the study area was of detrital origin. A clear dilution effect on the organic matter, caused by high concentrations of suspended inorganic material, was also revealed by the LPOM/TSM ratio, used as a qualitative food index. The mussels were found to activate physiological compensatory mechanisms in order to maintain a constant absorption rate of organic matter from the total available seston. In this case study, the mussels survived in an environment in which the quantities of available food were frequently time-varied.

For raft and longline culture, a platform is typically lowered under the mussel lines, which are then cut from the system and brought {{to the surface and}} dumped into containers on a nearby vessel. After harvest, mussels are typically placed in seawater tanks to rid them of impurities before marketing.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a risk {{analysis}} on the introduction of exotic non-indigenous species – species that have their origin outside the North Atlantic Continental Shelf region – with the import of bottom <b>culture</b> <b>mussels</b> from the Isefjord and the Limfjord (Denmark) into the Oosterschelde. Based on available literature data and expert judgement, the target species are identified and the risks of these species are assessed semiBquantitively. It is concluded that the risk of introducing exotic non-indigenous species into the Oosterschelde with the import of mussels from the Isefjord and the Limfjord is low...|$|R
