Thermal limit avoidance hypotheses {{were not able to}} explain this behaviour, as the thermal regime of the stream was moderate. Marine exit date was not correlated to spawning date, as fish were able to spawn at any time (early or late) regardless of their <b>marine</b> exit <b>strategy.</b> Individuals with early <b>marine</b> exit <b>strategies</b> had higher growth, greater somatic energy density, smaller gonads, and greater fecundity.

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a <b>Marine</b> Sector <b>Strategy</b> for Qeshm Island for the Qeshm Free Area Authority (QFA). Qeshm Island is an Iranian island, a Free Trade Zone near the entrance of the Persian Gulf in the Straits of Hormuz. The long-term strategy of QFA is to develop Qeshm as Iran’s leading centre for Marine activities. The <b>Marine</b> Sector <b>Strategy</b> has been developed with this long-term vision in mind and the scope of work and implementation strategies work towards this long-term goal. The Scope of Work provided for the strategy to cover all marine related activities including commercial and recreational fishery development and management; measurement and monitoring of marine resources, development of rules and regulations for fisheries management; post catch and downstream processing; marketing strategies; aquaculture and marine park development, and their impacts on the marine ecosystem. The study identifies interaction between marine sector users and with other sectors, infrastructure requirements and the impacts of the Qeshm marine sector on Iran and regionally. The paper presents findings from the study, the results of the analysis of potential for fisheries development and enhancement of management practises {{in the context of a}} planned marine sector in the discrete coastal and marine environment of Qeshm Island.

50|$|The use {{of passive}} {{sampling}} devices, {{such as the}} Chemcatcher®, and the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), {{have a number of}} advantages over the use of spot or bottle sampling for monitoring pollutants in the aquatic environment. The latter technique gives only an instantaneous concentration of the pollutant as the specific time of sampling. Passive samplers, depending on their mode of use can give either the TWA or equilibrium concentration of the pollutant over the deployment period. The measurement of TWA concentrations give a better indication of the long-term environmental conditions and enables improved risk assessment. Such devices have potential roles in monitoring programmes such as those underpinning the European Union’s Water Framework Directive and <b>Marine</b> <b>Strategy</b> Framework Directive. An ISO standard concerning the use of passive samplers for the determination of priority pollutants in surface waters is available for end users of this technology.|$|E

40|$|Canada {{is a major}} {{maritime}} {{country with}} a wide range of interests and concerns in three oceans. The sea is a vital factor in the development of its economy. Canadian policy for the protection of its maritime vital interests has been implemented through a blend of law, force and diplomacy. The strategy has been one of surveillance, monitoring and enforcement, or in military terms, naval presence and sea control. Over the next two decades, the scale and complexity of increasing oceans use in the northwest Atlantic, the northeast Pacific, and in Canadian Arctic waters will have profound implications for Canadian security, broadly defined. Trends in the patterns of marine transportation and ocean use, especially the management of ocean resources, and the broad requirements to preserve the security of Canada's other maritime vital interests at home and overseas will increasingly have foreign policy implications. In this regard, oceans policy, like security policy, will need to become more closely integrated into the foreign policy process. Similarly, the fishery and living resources, offshore energy, marine transportation and navigation, the marine environment, maritime boundary delimitations, marine science and technology and recreation and community development will call for closer coordination between federal and provincial governments. Maritime security will require the meshing of policy and instruments of surveillance, monitoring and enforcement to meet the challenges of law enforcement and marine emergencies, and to protect maritime sovereignty. Multilateral, regional cooperation in the protection and management of Canada's three oceans is an imperative, dictated by interdependence for reasons of politics and costs. These factors call for a comprehensive national oceans policy, integrated <b>marine</b> <b>strategies,</b> and a naval and regulatory force posture capable of ensuring the harmonious and sustainable use of Canada's contiguous seas. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines <b>marine</b> management <b>strategies</b> in Cambodia, {{with the}} aim of addressing key issues relating to the design, implementation and management of marine protection systems. The establishment of marine protected areas in developing countries is perceived to solve many of the issues currently facing the marine environment. However, in reality this is not the case. A majority of the world's marine protected areas are considered ineffective, with issues relating to the environmental understanding and appropriate governance of such <b>strategies.</b> Implementing <b>marine</b> management is an extremely complex process, with many factors, stakeholders and individual site-specific variables and it has long been understood that an integrated social-ecological approach is preferable. This thesis aims to build a more comprehensive picture of the implementation of <b>marine</b> management <b>strategies</b> into developing communities and addresses a number of research gaps. This thesis provides key information on the current extent and health of coral reefs in the Koh Sdach Archipelago, and identies changes in the health of those reefs between 2002 and 2013 in the absence of marine management. The socio-economic impacts of the current management programmes used to protect the Cambodian coastal zone have been examined, and identify the perceptions of community members relating to governance, change and threats surrounding marine management. This work highlighted issues relating to the effective governance of areas at multiple institutional levels, stressing the need for increased governmental support and communication within and between management organisations. Finally, the suitability of volunteer and community-based coral reef monitoring was assessed. Despite only being a preliminary study into the potential applications of such systems, the results suggested that the use of both volunteers and community members in the collection of coral reef health data could contribute to the current deficit in monitoring data. <br/...|$|R
