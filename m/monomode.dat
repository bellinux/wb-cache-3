50|$|Monochromatic {{sources are}} usually lasers; such high monochromaticity implies long {{coherence}} lengths (up {{to hundreds of}} meters). For example, a stabilized and <b>monomode</b> helium-neon laser can easily produce light with coherence lengths of 300 m. Not all lasers are monochromatic, however (e.g. for a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser, Δλ ≈ 2 nm - 70 nm). LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50 nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600 nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.|$|E

As a main outcome, <b>monomode</b> fibres {{are characterized by}} nearly Gaussian far fields, which are essentially independent of the launching conditions. They act as spatial filters with suppression of higher laser modes, detrimental in trace gas analysis. Transmission levels for the "useful" modes are up to 60 per cent for fibre samples of some 10 cm. Under the same condition, optical backward reflection levels as low as 10 (exp - 6) were realized. Direct coupling of a fibre to t diode laser as a prerequisite for pigtailing can result in some 10 per cent of the total power launched to the fibre.

30|$|Microwave {{reactors}} can {{be designed}} to function in two different modes: multimode and <b>monomode</b> (also referred to as single-mode) reactors. In multimode reactor instruments (which {{is similar to a}} domestic oven in concept), the microwaves that enter the cavity are reflected by the walls and the load over the typically large cavity. In most instruments a mode stirrer ensures that the field distribution is as homogeneous as possible. In the much smaller <b>monomode</b> cavities, the electromagnetic irradiation is directed through an accurately designed rectangular or circular wave guide onto the reaction vessel mounted at a fixed distance from the radiation source, thus creating a standing wave. The key difference between the two types of reactor systems is that in multimode cavities several reaction vessels can be irradiated simultaneously in multi vessel rotors (parallel synthesis), in <b>monomode</b> systems only one vessel can be irradiated at any time. In the latter case high throughput can be achieved by integrated robotics that move individual reaction vessels {{in and out of the}} microwave cavity [133].|$|E
