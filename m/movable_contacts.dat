50|$|When an {{electric}} current is {{passed through the}} coil it generates a magnetic field that activates the armature, and the consequent movement of the <b>movable</b> <b>contact(s)</b> either makes or breaks (depending upon construction) a connection with a fixed contact. If the set of contacts was closed when the relay was de-energized, then the movement opens the contacts and breaks the connection, and vice versa if the contacts were open. When the current to the coil is switched off, the armature is returned by a force, approximately half {{as strong as the}} magnetic force, to its relaxed position. Usually this force is provided by a spring, but gravity is also used commonly in industrial motor starters. Most relays are manufactured to operate quickly. In a low-voltage application this reduces noise; in a high voltage or current application it reduces arcing.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge for}} neural prosthetic {{research is to}} develop intimate and selective neural interfaces able to record and stimulate {{over long periods of}} time. To satisfy these requirements, recent studies have been investigating new approaches to develop advanced neural electrodes. In particular longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) seem to be a suitable solution to contact the peripheral nervous system. However, they present some drawbacks in terms of robustness during chronic experiments. In this work we combined together two different approaches in order to address these issues: {{a new version of the}} LIFEs characterized by a flexible and light-weighted structure (named tf-LIFE) were integrated together with micro-actuators in order to obtain <b>movable</b> <b>contacts.</b> In particular, shape memory alloys (SMA) have been applied as smart actuators to move the contact points of the tf-LIFEs modifying their shape in a selective way. A "serpentine" like shape has bee n memorized into SMA thin films which have been covered by polyimide thin films to simulate the tf-LIFE structure. In parallel, SMA has also been glued directly to the electrode. The results of the characterization showed that flexible intrafascicular electrodes actuation by SMA could be a new promising technique to control the position of the active sites of the tf-LIFE inside the nerve, thus improving their performance for long-term applications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMembrane {{switching}} technology {{is commonly used}} to operate electrical apparatus such as remote controls, automotive switches, mobile phones, etc. This technology {{is based on a}} <b>movable</b> <b>contact,</b> mounted in a supple elastomer frame which allows the contact to be pressed against a stationary contact, mounted on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The material of the <b>movable</b> <b>contact</b> is typically a carbon-loaded polymer or a metal whereas the PCB electrode structure is copper, coated with a layer of gold. The current trend is to use this technology for power applications such as operating a coil or a direct actuator control. As reported in the literature, for such currents <; 1 A and inductive loads, microarcs occur between rigid, metallic contacts, during break and make. Their duration and subsequent damage depend highly on the material and the mechanical separation. On the other hand, the high contact resistance of a flexible carbon-loaded polymer and the progressive separation due to its flexibility are expected to modify arc ignition and persistence characteristics. In this paper, we present experimental measurements of the electrical characteristics of such contacts and the consequences of arcing on contact reliability. Long contact rise times of the voltage are found compared to common metallic contacts. These complex voltage characteristics have been analyzed to extract arc voltage and duration. It was found that this supple and resistive contact allows an inductive load to be switched with a minor over-voltage and self-protection against arcing compared to common rigid metallic contacts...|$|R

40|$|The force {{acting on}} a current {{carrying}} body, which is induced by magnetic fields gained more interest due to new applications. These magnetic techniques are used for decades to accelerate or move objects, for instance for catheter navigation in the human body, metal forming or for fast opening of electrical circuit breakers. Due {{to the increase in}} short circuit power in most grid systems, and thereby larger prospective currents, conventional AC and DC switches lose interest. This has led to an increased interest in faster and hybrid switching techniques. For this reason a novel electro-mechanical set-up has been developed, which accelerates a <b>movable</b> electrical <b>contact</b> extremely fast by using the combination of Lenz law and the Lorentz force. This contribution describes the mixed domain simulation environment and the validation of the set-up, which consist of a linear electro-magnetic drive and a mechanical damper system.

Initial simulations have been compared with the measurements and the results are in good agreement. This tool can be used to develop generic hybrid circuit breakers, reduces the risk for switchgear manufacturers and speed up the introduction of hybrid switch systems, which is urgently needed due to the ever increase of short circuit power in grid systems and the introduction of DC grid systems...|$|R

We then extend our theory for drops on inclined surfaces and reveal that the contact line {{plays a key role}} on the wetting state of the drops: (1) when the contact line is completely pinning, the advancing and receding contact angles and the shape of the drop can be uniquely determined by the predefined droplet volume, sliding angle and contact area, which does not rely on the Young contact angle; (2) when the drop has a <b>movable</b> <b>contact</b> line, it would achieve a wetting state with a minimum free energy resulting from the competition between the surface tension and gravity.

The process consists of continuously high-speed coating for functional film materials, 3 -D nano/micro-machining of the films on fibers, and weaving the functional fibers into large-area integration. In the coating process, functional materials, e. g., organic semiconductor, piezoelectric, conductor and insulator films could be formed on fibers with a speed of 20 m/min.

40|$|Abstract. Vibration or {{bouncing}} {{of electrical}} contacts at closure {{is a reason}} of failure occurring in relays, contactors, circuit breakers and other electrical equipment due to arc erosion and welding. Experimentally observed bouncing of electrical contacts in vacuum circuit breakers cannot be satisfactorily explained by elastic restitution force or electrodynamic repulsion.

The mathematical model describing these phenomena includes a non-linear differential motion equation for a <b>movable</b> <b>contact</b> piece, heat equations for anode and cathode (Axisymmetric Stefan’s problem with two free boundaries for melting and evaporation), a differential equation for the arc column, and non-linear algebraic equations for near-electrode regions. The special method of majorant functions is applied for the solution of this problem. It is found theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the vapour force at contact bouncing is sometimes comparable and may be greater than the contact spring force even in vacuum.
