40|$|Abstract. We derive 1 D steady equilibria for {{partially}} saturated downslope flow as {{a solution}} to the reposed vadose-zone problem. The equilibria are determined by two free parameters: a mean flow and a downstream saturation.

The saturated zone produces a <b>capillary</b> <b>head</b> jump that blocks the downward percolation. With a fully saturated downstream zone in medium clay mixtures, flow backs up more than 20 km projected vertically, but with 90 % downstream saturation, the back up is reduced to less than a km.

Stokes flow relates variations in soil moisture with velocities of wetting and draining fronts, and with volume flux densities.

40|$|We derive steady equilibria for lateral {{downslope}} moisture flow in {{an idealized}} thin closed layer {{as a solution}} to the 1 D Richards' Equation. The equilibria are determined by two free parameters: the downslope flux and a boundary condition. Solutions exhibit a constant downslope flow speed and moisture content for the constant equilibrium flux, which is the product of the two. However where an isolated zone of fixed saturation degree exists representing a boundary condition, the flow speed immediately upslope is reduced and the moisture content correspondingly increased to preserve the constant equilibrium flux. The <b>capillary</b> <b>head</b> jump at the saturated zone produces a blockage that gives a high moisture content back upslope through a pooling distance determined by the equilibrium condition that the downslope flux is constant. In our numerical integrations, the vertically projected pooling height is more than 10 km for a fully saturated zone in mixed silty or clay soils, but decreases by about an order of magnitude with every 10 % decrease in the boundary-zone saturation degree.

40|$|Methodologies for {{estimating}} hydraulic and {{solute transport}} properties of unsaturated, fractured rock are developed. The methodologies {{are applied to}} networks of discrete fractures {{for the purpose of}} estimating steady fluid flow rates and breakthrough curves of entrained solutes. The formulations employ the boundary integral method to discretize the outer rim of each fracture and to solve a two dimensional flow equation within fracture planes. A three dimensional variant of the two dimensional boundary integral method is used to calculate flow through a permeable matrix with embedded permeable fractures. Exterior and interior surfaces are discretized using boundary elements to account for flow between fractures and the matrix, and between the matrix and fractures and the exterior boundaries. Synthetic fracture networks are created using planar fractures of finite areal extent embedded within a three dimensional rock matrix for the purpose of performing sensitivity studies of network hydraulic conductivity with respect to geometric parameters, such as fracture orientation and density. Results of the sensitivity studies show that: (1) The global hydraulic conductivity is linearly dependent on the product of fracture transmissivity and density for fractures of which fully penetrate the rock volume; (2) The effect of correlation between fracture length and transmissivity is to increase the global hydraulic conductivity; and (3) Results using a three dimensional coupled fracture— matrix flow regime compare favorably with analytic results. Flow through variably saturated fracture networks is modeled by assuming a constant <b>capillary</b> <b>head</b> within individual fractures. A free surface is found using an iterative procedure which locates nodal points at the intersection of constant total head and pressure head contours.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the inversion of lattice pore-network model parameters of carbonate rocks using only the capillary pressure, and then the use of the inverted parameters to predict the water-flooding relative permeabilities of the carbonate rocks. Background: There has been a tendency to claim that pore-network modelling using three-dimensional micro-computed tomography or 3 D mathematically created images can predict imbibition relative permeabilities for wettabilities other than strongly water/oil-wetting. This is based on the flexibility for matching data, which is a weakness of pore-network modelling. The method proposed in this thesis is important because {{a large percentage of the}} porosity in carbonates is microporosity. Conclusions: We applied stochastic inversion of lattice pore-network model parameters using Hamiltonian Dynamics (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) to three carbonate rock samples and we predicted water-flooding relative permeabilities with good accuracy by using as constraint only routinely obtained data, such as mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) and oil/water capillary pressure. We found that there is a strong correlation between the amount of microporosity and the volume exponent parameter. This suggests that when microporosity is ignored, the volume exponent will tend to be systematically strongly underestimated. HMC found large variability in wettability that causes mid-sized pores to be invaded at the same level of pressure as larger pores. The coexistence of these events reduces the tendency for preferential flow through large pores, resulting in more uniform flow at the pore scale compared with the case in which flow is restricted only to large pores. Mid-sized pores have an important effect on the connectivity because they could have higher contact angles than larger pores. Therefore, they do not spontaneously imbibe and shield larger pores, improving water-flooding displacement. The wettability of micropores could better explain the gentle curvature of the imbibition water relative permeability compared with the generally assumed mixed-wet large wettability model. The importance of the maximum and <b>minimum</b> observed <b>capillary</b> pressure is directly connected to accounting for the full pore-size distribution. Thus, the common assumption that microporosity can be ignored is unsatisfactory. The ranges of advancing contact angles obtained from the HMC inversion were wider than the ranges of apparent advancing contact angles obtained with analytical determinations in previous studies, and in one case our results were contradictory to the analytical determination. It follows that variability in advancing and receding contact angles is not reflected in the apparent contact angle data outside porous media. Apparent contact angle data outside porous media cannot completely characterise the wettability in porenetwork models because the data does not capture the contact angle variability in porous media. The existence of wetting films depends on the maximum capillary pressure during drainage, and thus wettability alteration during ageing. Our results suggest that matching both connate water at the maximum drainage capillary pressure before ageing and matching residual oil at the <b>minimum</b> imbibition <b>capillary</b> pressure leads to better estimation of the advancing and receding variability in the contact angles...|$|R

We consider the front to form a sharp boundary at which the <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>head,</b> assumed equal to the entry pressure head of DNAPL, is prescribed either deterministically or randomly, treat log conductivity as a statistically homogeneous random field with given mean, variance and covariance; cast the corresponding boundary-value problem {{in the form of}} an integro-differential equation, in which the parameters and domain of integration are random; expand this equation in a Taylor series about the mean position of the front; and take ensemble mean. To quantify the predictive uncertainty associated with this mean solution, we develop a set of integro-differential equations for the corresponding second ensemble moments. We solve the resulting moment equations analytically and numerically in one and two dimensions to second order in the standard deviation of log conductivity. A comparison of our one-dimensional solutions with the results of Monte Carlo simulations verifies its accuracy. We also show that a probabilistic analysis of wetting front instability due to Chen and Neuman (1996) applies to a DNAPL front...|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated organic {{solvents}} such as TCE and PCE {{are among}} the most ubiquitous and problematic groundwater contaminants at many sites. They usually enter the subsurface in the form of organic liquids which exhibit low miscibility with water and thus form a separate dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL). Here we analyze the movement of DNAPL in a three-dimensional randomly heterogeneous porous medium saturated with water. We consider the fluid interface between DNAPL and water to form a sharp boundary at which the <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>head,</b> assumed equal to the entry pressure head of DNAPL, is prescribed either deterministically or randomly. We treat log hydraulic conductivity as a statistically homogeneous random field with given mean, variance and covariance, This allows us to cast the corresponding boundary-value problem {{in the form of an}} integro-differential equation, in which the parameters and domain of integration are random. Expanding this equation in a Taylor series about the mean position of the front, and averaging in probability space, yields leading-order ensemble I moment equations for the mean and variance of front evolution with time. Previously we solved these moment equations analytically in one-dimension with gravity, to first order in the variance of log conductivity, and compared our solution with the results of Monte Carlo sjmulations. Here we solve the same moment equations numerically in two-spatial dimensions without gravity...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimate}} of the evaporation from the soil is a key-point for the assessment ofthe local recharge to a phreatic aquifer. On this study, we compared different methodsto evaluate the evaporation from a bare soil (Bowen Ratio, Penman and Hamonequations). Experimental data were provided by a field campaign carried out for a periodof 16 months {{in the area of}} Parco Lambro, in Milano (Italy); meteorological data(atmospheric pressure, rainfall, humidity, wind velocity and air temperature, net andincident solar radiation) were collected, together with soil data (volumetric water content,temperature and <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>head).</b> In applying the Bowen Ration method,we developed an analysis of error propagation to estimate the expected error on theevaporation; in order to avoid possible unphysical results: the samples for which thecoefficient of variation on evaporation was greater than an assigned threshold wereeliminated from the series. A similar analysis was performed on the Penman results. The evaporation estimates computed by Penman and Bowen Ratio methods were comparedwith each other in order to verify the consistency with the data measured froman evaporation pan and with the actual soil water content measured by TDR probes. Finally, the comparison between Penman and Hamon method allowed us to develop astatistical model for assigning the real day length, {{which is one of the}} parameters necessaryto apply the Hamon method. This modified method permitted to obtain goodestimates of the potential evaporation using only standard meteorological data...|$|R
40|$|Work {{under the}} project {{entitled}} "Geologic Sequestration Training and Research," {{was performed by}} the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Southern Company from December 1, 2009, to June 30, 2013. The emphasis was on training of students and faculty through research on topics central to further development, demonstration, and commercialization of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The project had the following components: (1) establishment of a laboratory for measurement of rock properties, (2) evaluation of the sealing capacity of caprocks, (3) evaluation of porosity, permeability, and storage capacity of reservoirs, (4) simulation of CO{sub 2 } migration and trapping in storage reservoirs and seepage through seal layers, (5) education and training of students through independent research on rock properties and reservoir simulation, and (6) development of an advanced undergraduate/graduate level course on coal combustion and gasification, climate change, and carbon sequestration. Four graduate students and one undergraduate student participated in the project. Two were awarded Ph. D. degrees for their work, the first in December 2010 and the second in August 2013. A third graduate student has proposed research on an advanced technique for measurement of porosity and permeability, and has been admitted to candidacy for the Ph. D. The fourth graduate student is preparing his proposal for research on CCUS and solid waste management. The undergraduate student performed experimental measurements on caprock and reservoir rock samples and received his B. S. M. E. degree in May 2012. The "Caprock Integrity Laboratory," established {{with support from the}} present project, is fully functional and equipped for measurement of porosity, permeability, <b>minimum</b> <b>capillary</b> displacement pressure, and effective permeability to gas in the presence of wetting phases. Measurements are made at ambient temperature and under reservoir conditions, including supercritical CO{sub 2 }. During the course of the project, properties of 19 samples provided by partners on companion projects supported by NETL were measured, covering a range of permeabilities from 0. 28 ndarcy to 81 mdarcy. Reservoir simulations were performed for injection of 530, 000 tonnes of CO{sub 2 } through a single well into the Middle Donovan formation in Citronelle Dome, in southwest Alabama, over 40 years, followed by migration and trapping for 10, 000 years, using the TOUGH 2 and TOUGHREACT software packages from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It was estimated that 50 kg CO{sub 2 }/m{sup 3 } of formation would be converted to mineral phases within the CO{sub 2 } plume during that time. None of the sand units considered for CO{sub 2 } storage in Citronelle Dome have thickness exceeding the estimated critical CO{sub 2 } column height (Berg, 1975) at which seepage might begin, through their confining shale layers. A model for leakage through caprock, based on work by Hildenbrand et al. (2004), including a functional relationship between capillary pressure and the effective permeability to gas {{in the presence of a}} wetting phase, demonstrated the sensitivity of long-term storage to caprock permeability and thickness. A traditional course on coal combustion was augmented with material on climate change, coal gasification, and carbon sequestration. A total of 49 students completed the course during two offerings, in Fall 2010 and Fall 2012. It has become a popular advanced elective course in the Department of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|Infiltration {{equations}} {{can be used}} {{to describe}} furrow and drip irrigation, groundwater recharge, and wastewater injection. Physical two dimensional (2 -D) infiltration equations for drip irrigation expressed in explicit, power algebraic forms were developed based on four consecutive time intervals which were derived in a previous study. two-dimensional infiltration is assumed to be a composite of 2 -D upward infiltration and downward infiltration components. These components of infiltration are computed {{on the assumption that the}} loci of the wetting pattern for 2 -D infiltration are semiellipses. Because the developed equations are presented in explicit algebraic power forms, the physical parameters of the soil media, such as hydraulic conductivity, <b>capillary</b> potential, pressure <b>head,</b> soil porosity, and moisture content, can be expressed as dependent parameters of drip irrigation. The validity of the developed equations was examined in five laboratory experiments at different moisture contents. The results of computed infiltration show good agreement.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{model has been}} developed to analyze the transient and steady-state performance of flat heat pipes subjected to heating with multiple discrete heat sources. Three-dimensional flow and energy equations are solved in the vapor and liquid regions, along with conduction in the wall. Saturated flow models are used for heat transfer and fluid flow through the wick. In the wick region, the analysis uses an equilibrium model for heat transfer and a Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy model for fluid flow. Averaged properties weighted with the porosity are used for the wick analysis. The state equation {{is used in the}} vapor core to relate density change to the operating pressure. The density change due to pressurization of the vapor core is accounted for in the continuity equation. Vapor flow, temperature and hydrodynamic pressure fields are computed at each time step from coupled continuity/momentum and energy equations in the wick and vapor regions. The mass flow rate at the interface is obtained from the application of kinetic theory. Predictions are made for the magnitude of heat flux at which dryout would occur in a flat heat pipe. The input heat flux and the spacing between the discrete heat sources are studied as parameters. The location in the heat pipe at which dryout is initiated is found to be {{different from that of the}} maximum temperature. The location where the maximum <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>head</b> is realized also changes during the transient. Axial conduction through the wall and wick are seen to play a significant role in determining the axial temperature variation...|$|R
