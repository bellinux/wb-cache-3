5|$|In 2001, Bukovsky {{was elected}} President of the Comitatus pro Libertatibus – Comitati per le Libertà – Freedom Committees in Florence, an Italian libertarian {{organisation}} which promoted an annual <b>Memento</b> Gulag, or Memorial Day {{devoted to the}} Victims of Communism, on 7 November (the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution). The <b>Memento</b> Gulag has since been held in Rome, Bucharest, Berlin, La Roche sur Yon and Paris.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} {{fieldwork}} to characterise and compare physical and digital <b>mementos</b> in the home. Physical <b>mementos</b> are highly valued, heterogeneous and support {{different types of}} recollection. Contrary to expectations, we found physical <b>mementos</b> are not purely representational, and can involve appropriating common objects and more idiosyncratic forms. In contrast, digital <b>mementos</b> were initially perceived as less valuable, although participants later reconsidered this. Digital <b>mementos</b> were somewhat limited in function and expression, largely involving representational photos and videos, and infrequently accessed. We explain these digital limitations and conclude with design guidelines for digital <b>mementos,</b> including better techniques for accessing and integrating these into everyday life, allowing them to acquire the symbolic associations and lasting value that characterise their physical counterparts...|$|R
40|$|The saving of {{childhood}} <b>mementos</b> {{is a common}} practice that has existed for many generations across different cultures. Parents often save physical objects such as baby blankets, toys, or clothing. Designers of interactive technology {{have the opportunity to}} learn from and augment the practices surrounding the selecting, saving, sharing, and savoring of these physical objects. To understand the design opportunities for this space, we conducted artifact-based interviews and surveys with parents about the <b>mementos</b> they have saved from their own childhood and are currently saving for their young children. Themes emerged surrounding preserving and using <b>mementos,</b> qualities that imbue value to <b>mementos,</b> meanings associated with sharing <b>mementos,</b> and tensions around saving, clutter, and discarding. The themes highlight qualities of ambivalence and ambiguity surrounding sentimental behavior. We discuss these themes and apply the findings to the design of a new feature of an interactive system for tracking children’s data...|$|R

5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. <b>Memento</b> was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives loved the film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. After the first few weeks of distribution, <b>Memento</b> had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was surprising to those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized his mistake and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E

5|$|<b>Memento</b> premiered on September 5, 2000, at the Venice International Film Festival and was {{released}} in European theaters starting in October. It became a blockbuster success, being acclaimed by critics who praised its nonlinear narrative structure and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception, and earning $39.7 million over a $9 million budget. It received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The film was subsequently ranked {{one of the best}} films of the 2000s by several critics and media outlets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{creation}} of visual <b>mementos</b> as a new application area for visualization. We define visual <b>mementos</b> as visualizations of personally relevant data {{for the purpose of}} reminiscing, and sharing of life experiences. Today more people collect digital information about their life than ever before. The shift from physical to digital archives poses new challenges and opportunities for self-reflection and self-representation. Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual <b>mementos</b> can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people’s subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual <b>mementos.</b> Our results show how reminiscing has been supported and reveal promising new directions for self-reflection and sharing through visual <b>mementos</b> of personal experiences...|$|R

5|$|<b>Memento</b> was a {{box office}} success. In the United States, during its opening weekend, it was {{released}} in only 11 theaters, but by week 11 it was distributed to more than 500 theaters. It grossed over $25million in North America and $14million in other countries, making the film's total worldwide gross some $40million as of August 2007. During its theatrical run, it did not place higher than eighth {{in the list of}} highest-grossing movies for a single weekend.|$|E
5|$|<b>Memento</b> was {{released}} on DVD and VHS in the United States and Canada on September 4, 2001, and in the United Kingdom on January 14, 2002. The UK edition contains a hidden feature that allows the viewer to watch the film in chronological order. The Canadian version does not have this feature but the film chapters are set up to do this manually or through DVD programming. The original US release {{does not have the}} chronological feature nor are the chapters set up correctly to do it.|$|E

Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a <b>memento.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and <b>Memento.</b>|$|E
