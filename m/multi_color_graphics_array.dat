50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) text-only graphics card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> Adapter 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution <b>color</b> IBM Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> Adapter and Video <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R

500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> Adapter (CGA) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), but not Video <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|R
