40|$|The {{increasing}} use of heterogeneous {{embedded systems}} with multi-core CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) presents important challenges in effectively exploiting pipeline, task and data-level parallelism to meet throughput requirements of digital signal processing (DSP) applications. Moreover, {{in the presence of}} system-level memory constraints, hand optimization of code to satisfy these requirements is inefficient and error-prone, and can therefore, greatly slow down development time or result in highly underutilized processing resources. In this paper, we present vectorization and scheduling methods to effectively exploit multiple forms of parallelism for throughput optimization on hybrid CPU-GPU platforms, while conforming to system-level memory constraints. The methods operate on synchronous dataflow representations, which are widely used in the design of embedded systems for signal and information processing. We show that our novel methods can significantly improve system throughput compared to previous vectorization and scheduling approaches under the same memory constraints. In addition, we present a practical case-study of applying our methods to significantly improve the throughput of an orthogonal frequency division <b>multiplexing</b> (OFDM) <b>receiver</b> <b>system</b> for wireless communications.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} low-power dynamic multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) detection for a 4 x 4 MIMO-orthogonal frequency-division <b>multiplexing</b> (MIMO-OFDM) <b>receiver.</b> MIMO-OFDM <b>systems</b> achieve high-speed {{and large}} capacity communications. However, they impose high computational cost in MIMO detection when separating spatially multiplexed signals and they consume {{vast amounts of}} power. We propose low-power dynamic MIMO detection that controls detection speed according to wireless environments. The power consumption is reduced by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) that controls the operating voltage and clock frequency in the MIMO detector. We implemented dynamic MIMO detection in a pipelined {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) MIMO detector that we developed in our previous work. A power saving of 92 % was achieved under lowest clock frequency mode conditions...|$|R
