2500|$|In conifers, the {{reproductive}} structures are borne on cones. The cones are either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are monoecious and others dioecious. [...] A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called sporophylls. Spore mother {{cells in the}} microsporangia divide by meiosis to form haploid microspores that [...] develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature male gametophytes (pollen grains). [...] The four resulting cells consist of a large tube cell that forms the pollen tube, a generative cell that will produce two sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. [...] These cells comprise a very reduced <b>microgametophyte,</b> that is contained within the resistant wall of the pollen grain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the seed}} plants, the <b>microgametophyte</b> is called pollen. Seed plant microgametophytes {{consists}} {{of two or three}} cells when the pollen grains exit the sporangium. The megagametophyte develops within the megaspore of extant seedless vascular plants and within the megasporangium in a cone or flower in seed plants. In seed plants, the <b>microgametophyte</b> (pollen grain) travels to the vicinity of the egg cell (carried by a physical or animal vector), and produces two sperm by mitosis.|$|E

50|$|The {{flowers of}} Plagiobothrys nothofulvus {{generally}} bloomfrom February - April. Like many {{other members of}} the boraginaceae family the flower consists of five petals and are bi-sexual with both male and female parts represented in the flower. Bees and butterflies are the main pollinators transferring the haploid <b>microgametophyte,</b> or pollen grain, to the pistil. The <b>microgametophyte</b> will then travel down the pistil to the ovule to fertilize the haploid macrogametophyte, or egg. Each pollen grain contains two sperm cells for double fertilization of the egg. One fertilization event forms a diploid zygote and the other fertilization event forms the endosperm of the seed.|$|E
50|$|Microgametogenesis is {{the process}} in plant {{reproduction}} where a <b>microgametophyte</b> develops in a pollen grain to the three-celled stage of its development. In flowering plants it occurs with a microspore mother cell inside the anther of the plant.|$|E

5000|$|Megasporangia and microsporangia {{occur on}} {{different}} sporophytes, {{which are then}} called dioecious.An individual tree of the European holly (Ilex aquifolium) produces either 'male' flowers which have only functional stamens (microsporangia) producing microspores which develop into pollen grains (<b>microgametophytes)</b> or 'female' flowers which have only functional carpels producing integumented megasporangia (ovules) that contain a megaspore that develops into a multicellular megagametophyte.|$|R
50|$|Heterosporic plants, {{as their}} name suggests, bear spores of two sizes - microspores and megaspores. These would {{germinate}} to form <b>microgametophytes</b> and megagametophytes, respectively. This system {{paved the way}} for ovules and seeds: taken to the extreme, the megasporangia could bear only a single megaspore tetrad, and to complete the transition to true ovules, three of the megaspores in the original tetrad could be aborted, leaving one megaspore per megasporangium.|$|R
5000|$|Microspores {{germinate}} producing microgametophytes; at maturity {{one or more}} antheridia are produced. Sperm develop {{within the}} antheridia.In a willow, microspores are not liberated from the anther (the microsporangium), but develop into pollen grains (<b>microgametophytes)</b> within it. The whole pollen grain is moved (e.g. by an insect or by the wind) to an ovule (megagametophyte), where a sperm is produced which moves down a pollen tube to reach the egg.|$|R
50|$|Pollen of {{angiosperms}} must {{be transported}} to the stigma, the receptive surface of the carpel, of a compatible flower, for successful pollination to occur. After arriving, the pollen grain (an immature <b>microgametophyte)</b> typically completes its development. It may grow a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two sperm nuclei.|$|E
50|$|Microsporangia produce 32 microspores, each 71-101μm in diameter. Megasporangia produce 16 megaspores, each 163-183μm in diameter. Microspores {{produce a}} {{filamentous}} <b>microgametophyte,</b> which lacks rhizoids and gives rise only to antheridia. Megaspores produce spatulate megagametophytes with rhizoids, which produce archegonia. Megagametophytes may later produce antheridia, making them functionally bisexual. Development of gametophytes is not endosporic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transition}} to ovules continued with this megaspore being [...] "boxed in" [...] to its sporangium while it germinates. Then, the megagametophyte is contained within a waterproof integument, which forms {{the bulk of}} the seed. The <b>microgametophyte</b> - a pollen grain which has germinated from a microspore - is employed for dispersal, only releasing its desiccation-prone sperm when it reaches a receptive megagametophyte.|$|E
5000|$|Megasporangia and microsporangia {{occur on}} the same sporophyte, which is then called monoecious.Most {{flowering}} plants fall into this category. Thus the flower of a lily contains six stamens (the microsporangia) which produce microspores which develop into pollen grains (the <b>microgametophytes),</b> and three fused carpels which produce integumented megasporangia (ovules) each of which produces a megaspore which develops inside the megasporangium to produce the megagametophyte. In other plants, such as hazel, some flowers have only stamens, others only carpels, but the same plant (i.e. sporophyte) has both kinds of flower and so is monoecious.|$|R
50|$|Cycads {{form their}} microsporangia on microsporophylls which are {{aggregated}} into strobili. Megasporangia are formed within ovules, which are borne on megasporophylls, which are aggregated into strobili on separate plants (all cycads are dioecious). Conifers typically bear their microsporangia on microsporophylls aggregated into papery pollen strobili, and the ovules, {{are located on}} modified stem axes forming compound ovuliferous cone scales. Flowering plants contain microsporangia in the anthers of stamens (typically four microsporangia per anther) and megasporangia inside ovules inside ovaries. In all seed plants, spores are produced by meiosis and develop into gametophytes while still inside the sporangium. The microspores become <b>microgametophytes</b> (pollen). The megaspores become megagametophytes (embryo sacs).|$|R
50|$|It {{also should}} be borne in mind that every sexually {{reproducing}} extant species of vascular plant actually has an alternation of generations; the plants we see about us generally are diploid sporophytes, but their offspring really are not the seeds that people commonly recognise as the new generation. The seed actually is the offspring of the haploid generation of <b>microgametophytes</b> (pollen) and megagametophytes (the embryo sacs in the ovules). Each pollen grain accordingly {{may be seen as}} a male plant in its own right; it produces a sperm cell and is dramatically different from the female plant, the megagametophyte that produces the female gamete.|$|R
5000|$|In {{plants with}} {{heteromorphic}} gametophytes, {{there are two}} distinct kinds of gametophytes. Because the two gametophytes differ in form and function, they are termed heteromorphic, from hetero- [...] "different" [...] and morph [...] "form". The egg producing gametophyte {{is known as a}} megagametophyte, because it is typically larger, and the sperm producing gametophyte is known as a <b>microgametophyte.</b> Gametophytes which produce egg and sperm on separate plants are termed Dioicous.|$|E
50|$|A typical anther {{contains}} four microsporangia. The microsporangia form sacs or pockets (locules) in the anther (anther sacs or pollen sacs). The {{two separate}} locules {{on each side}} of an anther may fuse into a single locule. Each microsporangium is lined with a nutritive tissue layer called the tapetum and initially contains diploid pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. The spores may remain attached to each other in a tetrad or separate after meiosis. Each microspore then divides mitotically to form an immature <b>microgametophyte</b> called a pollen grain.|$|E
50|$|The first seed plants, Pteridosperms (seed ferns), now extinct, {{appeared}} in the Devonian and diversified through the Carboniferous. In these the <b>microgametophyte</b> is reduced to pollen and the megagametophyte remains inside the megasporangium, attached to the parent plant. A megasporangium invested in protective layer called an integument is known as an ovule. After fertilisation by means of sperm deposited by pollen grains, an embryo develops inside the ovule. The integument becomes a seed coat, and the ovule develops into a seed. Seed plants can survive and reproduce in extremely arid conditions, {{because they are not}} dependent on free water for the movement of sperm, or the development of free living gametophytes.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse powdery {{substance}} comprising pollen grains which are male <b>microgametophytes</b> of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|R
40|$|Pollen grains are <b>microgametophytes</b> {{produced}} by angiosperm and gymnosperm plants. They {{are responsible for}} transporting genetic material and carrying out fertilization. The study of pollen has numerous practical applications such as plant biodiversity, paleoclimatology, archaeology, allergy studies, the study of nectar sources in honey (melissopalynology), searching for sources of petroleum, and more recently, using pollen as a trace evidence component in forensics. Once pollen grains become airborne, their dispersal is controlled {{by a number of}} physical factors that determine the deposition distance from their source area. The purpose of this work is to study spatial pattern of composite pollen in Big Bend National Park using pollen information contained in the top soil layer, test the accuracy of four interpolation methods and use cartographic generalizations to present the results. The focus is on a composite pollen group that {{is a member of the}} Asteraceae plant family and is a prolific producer of airborne pollen (Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|In angiosperms, mitosis and {{cytokinesis}} {{take place}} in the absence of structurally defined microtubule-organizing centers and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In the spindle and phragmoplast, microtubule reorganization depends on microtubule-interacting factors like the γ-tubulin complex. Because of their critical functions in cell division, loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding genes are often homozygous or sporophytic lethal. However, a number of mutations like gem 1, gcp 2, and nedd 1 can be maintained in heterozygous mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. When mutant microspores produced by a heterozygous parent undergo pollen mitosis I, they are amenable for phenotypic characterization by fluorescence microscopy. The results would allow us to pinpoint at specific functions of particular proteins in microtubule reorganization that are characteristic to specific stages of mitosis and cytokinesis. Conclusions made in the developing <b>microgametophytes</b> can be extrapolated to somatic cells regarding mechanisms that regulate nuclear migration, spindle pole formation, phragmoplast assembly, and cell division plane determination...|$|R
50|$|When the <b>microgametophyte</b> {{is first}} formed inside the pollen grain {{four sets of}} fertile cells called sporogenous cells are apparent. These cells are {{surrounded}} by a wall of sterile cells called the tapetum, which supplies food to the cell and eventually becomes the cell wall for the pollen grain. These sets of sporogenous cells eventually develop into diploid microspore mother cells. These microspore mother cells, also called microsporocytes, then undergo meiosis and become four microspore haploid cells. These new microspore cells then undergo mitosis and form a tube cell and a generative cell. The generative cell then undergoes mitosis one more time to form two male gametes, also called sperm.|$|E
50|$|In conifers, the {{reproductive}} structures are borne on cones. The cones are either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are monoecious and others dioecious. A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called sporophylls. Spore mother {{cells in the}} microsporangia divide by meiosis to form haploid microspores that develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature male gametophytes (pollen grains). The four resulting cells consist of a large tube cell that forms the pollen tube, a generative cell that will produce two sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. These cells comprise a very reduced <b>microgametophyte,</b> that is contained within the resistant wall of the pollen grain.|$|E
50|$|Pollen is also {{produced}} by meiosis {{in the male}} anther (microsporangium). During meiosis, a diploid microspore mother cell undergoes two successive meiotic divisions to produce 4 haploid cells (microspores or male gametes). Each of these microspores, after further mitoses, becomes a pollen grain (<b>microgametophyte)</b> containing two haploid generative (sperm) cells and a tube nucleus. When a pollen grain makes contact with the female stigma, the pollen grain forms a pollen tube that grows down the style into the ovary. In the act of fertilization, a male sperm nucleus fuses with the female egg nucleus to form a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the newly forming seed. Upon germination of the seed, a new plant can grow and mature.|$|E
40|$|Regulation of {{flowering}} {{is one of}} the key issues in crop yield. The Flowering Locus T (FT) gene is a well-known florigen, which integrates various signals from multiple flowering-regulation pathways to initiate flowering. We previously reported that there are at least six FT genes (GmFTL 1 – 6) in soybean displaying flowering activity. However, the individual functions of genes GmFTL 1 – 6 remain to be identified. In this study, we cloned the GmFTL 2 promoter (GmFTLpro) from soybean (Glycine max) cultivar Tianlong 1 and analyzed its motifs bioinformatically and its expression patterns using both a transgenic approach and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). In GmFTLpro::GUS transgenic lines, GUS signals were enriched in cotyledons, hypocotyledons, pollen, embryos, and root tips in a photoperiod-independent manner. qRT-PCR confirmed the GUS reporter results. Our results suggest that GmFTL 2 expression is regulated by developmental and tissue-specific clues and plays roles in seedling establishment and the development of <b>microgametophytes,</b> embryos, and roots...|$|R
50|$|The male gametophytes, or <b>microgametophytes,</b> that {{participate}} in double fertilization are contained within pollen grains. They develop within the microsporangia, or pollen sacs, of the anthers on the stamens. Each microsporangium contains diploid microspore mother cells, or microsporocytes. Each microsporocyte undergoes meiosis, forming four haploid microspores, {{each of which}} can eventually develop into a pollen grain. A microspore undergoes mitosis and cytokinesis {{in order to produce}} two separate cells, the generative cell and the tube cell. These two cells in addition to the spore wall make up an immature pollen grain. As the male gametophyte matures, the generative cell passes into the tube cell, and the generative cell undergoes mitosis, producing two sperm cells. Once the pollen grain has matured, the anthers break open, releasing the pollen. The pollen is carried to the pistil of another flower, by wind or animal pollinators, and deposited on the stigma. As the pollen grain germinates, the tube cell produces the pollen tube, which elongates and extends down the long style of the carpel and into the ovary, where its sperm cells are released in the megagametophyte. Double fertilization proceeds from here.|$|R
40|$|Selection among <b>microgametophytes</b> usually {{exploits}} {{variation in}} pollen grain germination. Studies {{of variation in}} pollen grain size in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) suggested that selection for size might lead to changes in sporophytic traits. To determine whether microgametophytic selection based on size would affect pollen grain size in subsequent generations or sporophytic traits that were correlated with pollen grain size, pollen grains from three crosses were separated into two size categories by sieving and then used to pollinate cv. Diacol Calima. Selection resulted in changes in pollen grain diameter for pollen from F 1, F 2 and F 3 plants for all crosses. In vitro germination indicated no differences between vigor of large and small grains, but extraction and sieving reduced germinability. F 1 seed from two of the crosses with size-selected pollen varied in weight according to pollen grain size, but in subsequent generations, the effect disappeared. Both size categories of selected pollen resulted in F 2 progeny with reduced numbers of seeds per pod as compared to controls, suggesting that the size selection process may have resulted in indirect selection for traits reducing seed set. The overall results suggested that genes determining pollen grain size in bean {{have little or no}} effect on sporophytic traits such as seed size and seed yield. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|In the spermatophytes, {{the seed}} plants, the {{sporophyte}} {{is the dominant}} multicellular phase; the gametophytes are strongly reduced in size and very different in morphology. The entire gametophyte generation, with the sole exception of pollen grains (microgametophytes), is contained within the sporophyte. The life cycle of a dioecious flowering plant (angiosperm), the willow, has been outlined in some detail in an earlier section (A complex life cycle). The life cycle of a gymnosperm is similar. However, flowering plants have in addition a phenomenon called 'double fertilization'. Two sperm nuclei from a pollen grain (the <b>microgametophyte),</b> rather than a single sperm, enter the archegonium of the megagametophyte; one fuses with the egg nucleus to form the zygote, the other fuses with two other nuclei of the gametophyte to form 'endosperm', which nourishes the developing embryo. For further information, see Double fertilization.|$|E
5000|$|Penetration {{of these}} {{protective}} layers needs {{something more than}} a free-floating <b>microgametophyte.</b> Angiosperms have pollen grains comprising just three cells. One cell is responsible for drilling down through the integuments, and creating a conduit for the two sperm cells to flow down. The megagametophyte has just seven cells; of these, one fuses with a sperm cell, forming the nucleus of the egg itself, and another joins with the other sperm, and dedicates itself to forming a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of [...] "double fertilisation" [...] is unique and common to all angiosperms.In the fossil record, there are three intriguing groups which bore flower-like structures. The first is the Permian pteridosperm Glossopteris, which already bore recurved leaves resembling carpels. The Mesozoic Caytonia is more flower-like still, with enclosed ovules - but only a single integument. Further, details of their pollen and stamens set them apart from true flowering plants.|$|E

50|$|Gymnosperms, {{like all}} {{vascular}} plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, {{which means they}} {{spend most of their}} life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (<b>microgametophytes)</b> mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.|$|R
40|$|Monoecious {{flowering}} plants produce both <b>microgametophytes</b> (pollen) and megagametophytes (embryo sacs) containing {{the male and}} female gametes, respectively, which participate in double fertilization. Much is known about cellular and developmental processes giving rise to these reproductive structures and the formation of gametes. However, {{little is known about the}} role played by changes in the epigenome in dynamically shaping these defining events during plant sexual reproduction. This has in part been hampered by the inaccessibility of these structures—especially the female gametes, which are embedded within the female reproductive tissues of the plant sporophyte. However, with the recent development of new cellular isolation technologies that can be coupled to next-generation sequencing, a new wave of epigenomic studies indicate that an intricate epigenetic regulation takes place during the formation of male and female reproductive lineages. In this mini review, we assess the fast growing body of evidence for the epigenetic regulation of the developmental fate and function of plant gametes. We describe how small interfereing RNAs and DNA methylation machinery play a part in setting up unique epigenetic landscapes in different gametes, which may be responsible for their different fates and functions during fertilization. Collectively these studies will shed light on the dynamic epigenomic landscape of plant gametes or ‘epigametes’ and help to answer important unresolved questions on the sexual reproduction of {{flowering plants}}, especially those underpinning the formation of two products of fertilization, the embryo and the endosperm...|$|R
40|$|The {{proximity}} of mates can influence mating opportunities and {{the quantity and}} quality of offspring, especially in dioecious plant species. Progeny sex ratios modulated by environmental conditions is one of the most radical ways in which offspring quality may be influenced, yet it has rarely been reported in plants. A mechanism proposed to influence progeny sex ratios in dioecious plants involves competition between female- and male-determining <b>microgametophytes</b> (certation) as a result of variation in pollination intensity. However, the role of selective fertilization in dioecious plants is controversial and has not been demonstrated under field conditions. Here we investigate whether natural variation in the spatial arrangement of females and males influences pollination intensity and progeny sex ratios in the wind-pollinated herb Rumex nivalis. Based on previous experimental manipulation of pollination intensity in this species, we predicted that maternal parents in close proximity to males would produce more strongly female-biased progeny sex ratios. We tested this prediction in six alpine populations in Switzerland by measuring the distance between focal females and neighboring males and assessing pollen loads and seed sex ratios of maternal parents. In four of the six populations, females positioned in close proximity to males captured more pollen and exhibited more female-biased sex ratios. Our results demonstrate that demographic aspects of the maternal mating environment can influence progeny sex ratios. The most probable explanation for biased primary sex ratios in Rumex is selective fertilization resulting from pollen tube competition...|$|R
