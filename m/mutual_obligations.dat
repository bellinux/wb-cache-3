5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and the feudal system, which formalised <b>mutual</b> <b>obligations</b> {{of service and}} protection, organised through heritable jurisdictions, {{has been seen as}} creating the Highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to Lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and could be called upon to act as soldiers when needed. In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the Jacobite rising of 1745. Highland dress was banned, clansmen were forcible disarmed, there was the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, many chiefs were exiled and ordinary clansmen were sent to the colonies as indentured labourers. Within a generation, these factors reduced most clan leaders to the status of simple landholders, without independent military power.|$|E

Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish sharia from siyasah (politics).|$|E
40|$|Discrete agent {{simulation}} {{was used}} to study several models of reciprocity and sanctions in a model egalitarian society. We found that <b>mutual</b> <b>obligation</b> between agents was maximized for indiscriminant sharing, the same condition that has been observed in several traditional cultures. Alternate sharing strategies, including ones based on kinship or sharing with those who share in return, reduced <b>mutual</b> <b>obligation.</b> When theft and sanctions were introduced into the simulations, we found that <b>mutual</b> <b>obligation</b> was maximized when individual norms were strong, i. e. when there was little tolerance to theft. Collective sanctions, represented by the ostracism of non-normative agents, produced levels of <b>mutual</b> <b>obligation</b> comparable {{to the case of}} strong individual norms, but with significant risk of population collapse. The probability of long term survival was highest when tolerance to transgressions was either very low or very high and we propose that this may be one reason for the similarity of normative systems across diverse egalitarian cultures.

Below the king were the great magnates, who by this period were no longer a feudal nobility, whose power was based on territorial landholding, but an honorific peerage, and land had become a commodity to be traded. They were headed by a small number of dukes (usually descended from very close relatives of the king) and a larger group of earls. These senior nobles formed the political classes {{at the beginning of the}} period: sometimes holding major office, holding a place on the king's council and taking part in the major crises and rebellions of the period.

Communicating normative reputation was found to be most important in societies lacking social structure and was less influential in social clusters where agents frequently and directed experienced the character of other agents.

The paper contends that some of the conceptual and political limitations of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> and Sustainable Development combine to undermine the effectiveness of Work for the Dole programmes such as the Green Reserve. A gap often emerges between the rhetoric of these policy frameworks and their tangible achievements in practice.

500|$|Perpetuating {{the family}} cult with many {{descendants}} was {{coupled with the}} notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection, reinforcing its power in the community. More children meant better odds of extending a family's power through marriage alliance with other prominent families, as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government. Hymes notes that [...] "elite families used such standards as official standing or wealth, prospects for office, length of pedigree, scholarly renown, and local reputation in choosing both sons-in-law and daughters-in-law." [...] Since official promotion was considered by examination degree as well as recommendation to office by a superior, a family that acquired a significant amount of sons-in-law of high rank in the bureaucracy ensured kinship protection and prestigious career options for its members. Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity, and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes. No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family, as it was common for upper-class families to have several generations living in the same household. However, one did not even have to share the same bloodline with others in order to build more social ties in their community.

I argue that temporal and conceptual inconsistencies within <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> frame unemployed citizens as perpetual recipients with no past and no future. This artificially static representation justifies the enforced obligations found in current unemployed policy. Other citizens are represented as eternal contributors who are already fulfilling their obligations, a conceptualisation that offers little guidance on general civic responsibilities. Consequently, I argue that reciprocity so-conceived is at best only a partial indicator of whether citizens are fulfilling their obligations to the community.

40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of speeches by government ministers, documents and regulations, {{this article examines the}} Australian national government’s surveillance of unemployed people through what is known as Activity Testing, and more specifically as <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation.</b> It seeks to merge the social policy analysis of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> with a surveillance perspective in order to delve deeper into the underlying nature of the policy and its implications for people who are unemployed. It does this by 1. Outlining the neo-liberal political theory underlying these policies; 2. Illustrating {{the nature and extent of}} surveillance of people in receipt of income support, and 3. Employing Foucault’s concepts of the technologies of domination and the self to highlight the controlling and coercive aspects of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> in achieving certain of the Government’s political and policy objectives.

40|$|Since 1997, the Australian Federal Liberal Government has {{introduced}} policies which {{have sought to}} reduce rates of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. The policy, known as <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation,</b> increased the expectations on unemployed people {{in return for their}} social security payment. At the same time, previous labour market programmes and government assistance schemes were scrapped or privatised. This article explores the justification of the term 2 ̆ 7 <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> 2 ̆ 7 by examining both the language and the underlying principles of the policy. By defining the problem of unemployment in terms of flaws in the previous social security system, the stage is set for the government to introduce policies which remedy those flaws by emphasising self- reliance in favour of government assistance. Further, by invoking notions of fairness and mutuality, the article argues that the term 2 ̆ 7 <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> 2 ̆ 7 masks both the extent and the strength of the obligations imposed on unemployed people...|$|R
