Data of gilt productive and sow reproductive performance from large Slovenian <b>multiplying</b> <b>farms</b> was used. Altogether 8139 animals of two maternal genotypes were involved: Slovenian Landrace - line 11 (SL 11) and hybrid 12 (Slovenian Large White X Slovenian Landrace - line 11). Statistical model included owner and sow genotype as fixed effects. Backfat thickness and growth rate were included as linear regression. Data was analyzed by GLM procedure in SAS/STAT. Average weight of gilts was 129. 4 +/- 9. 6 kg at 206. 7 +/- 6. 8 days of age, indicating average growth rate of 626 g/day. Gilts had 13. 26 mm of backfat thickness, in range from 5. 5 mm to 31. 5 mm. The increase of 100 g of daily gain resulted in increase of 0. 54 +/- 0. 08 liveborn piglets in the 1 st, 0. 71 +/- 0. 11 in the 2 nd, 0. 64 +/- 0. 11 in the 3 rd parity. Sows with higher growth rate were culled earlier (47 days). Gilts with thicker backfat had smaller litter size in the first three parities. Backfat thickness did not influence lifetime productivity, although sows with 10 mm thicker backfat farrowed more litters (0. 41 in average) in lifetime and were culled 50 days later. Growth rate and backfat thickness did not affect the cost per liveborn piglet as number of days per liveborn piglet did not change...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{outbreaks}} of Aujeszky’s Disease (AD) {{are controlled by}} vaccination and movement restriction zones (MRZ). Although this strategy avoids the socio-ethical concerns associated with pre-emptive slaughter, it can easily result in animal welfare problems and negative economic consequences. These arise because movement restrictions result in surpluses of live (vaccinated) piglets on farms. The aim is to {{provide insight into the}} development of these surpluses and its impact and to describe how measures that allow early transportation of pigs under certain conditions and to specific destinations (channelling) could reduce these problems. For the analysis, a deterministic simulation model was developed, which calculates surpluses of piglets at <b>multiplier</b> <b>farms</b> during AD outbreaks. This is performed on a weekly basis for two areas (with and without piglet surplus), three outbreak durations (minimum, moderate and long) and three strategies for movement restrictions (strict, transports within the MRZ allowed and transports outside the MRZ allowed). The results show that in case of complete movement restrictions, surpluses of piglets varying in age and vaccination status will quickly arise. These surpluses are larger for longer epidemics and can become as large as 180 – 340 thousand piglets (45 – 75 % of weekly domestic production) for moderate and long epidemics, respectively. Implementation of channelling strategies that allow earlier transportation within the MRZ can reduce surpluses by about 50 % to 100 – 150 thousand piglets maximum. Strategies that also allow transportation outside the MRZ can reduce surpluses even further to below 100 thousand piglets. It was concluded that channelling of live piglets during AD outbreaks results in a drastic reduction of problems with accommodating ready-for-transport piglets. Moreover, it reduces shortages during movement restrictions and peak supply immediately after removing the restrictions. Channelling could therefore be an important instrument to reduce the economic and animal welfare impacts of containment measures...|$|R

30|$|We {{can make}} rough {{estimates}} of the economic effects of this work on the US economy according to different assumptions about this substitution with other non-labor inputs. In the short run, {{there can be no}} substitution, so the marginal revenue product of an hour of Haitian labor for the US farm is simply the revenue generated by the sales of the product created with that hour of work (a Leontieff production function). In the long run, the farmer could adjust other inputs to partially compensate for reductions in foreign seasonal labor, so the marginal revenue product of Haitian labor for the US farm would be the Leontieff estimate multiplied by the cost share of foreign labor (with unit elasticity of substitution, a Cobb-Douglas production function). 14 Internal data from the employers participating in this program show that the ratio of farm revenue per unit output to Haitian wage per unit output is 3.65, and the share of Haitian labor in production costs is 0.301. These figures imply that for every dollar earned in Haitian wages in the USA, between $ 3.65 (short run) and $ 1.11 (long run) are added to the US farms’ productivity, which would then ripple through other sectors. Such multiplier effects of added farm productivity {{through the rest of the}} regional US economy are well studied and are approximately 1.5 for Oregon and 2.0 for Alabama. 15 These regional multipliers imply, conservatively using the 1.11 long-run <b>multiplier</b> on <b>farm</b> productivity, that a worker-month of Haitian labor expands the US economy by more than $ 3720 (Oregon)–$ 4140 (Alabama). 16 The short-run effects would be substantially larger.|$|R
40|$|In the Spring of 2009, a {{veterinarian}} reported suspected {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) on a <b>multiplier</b> pig <b>farm</b> {{in the southern part}} of the Netherlands (close to the Belgian border). Over a 5 -week period there had been a number of sick sows and an excessively high percentage of stillborn and preterm piglets. Sick animals were treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics, but did not respond as well as anticipated. A visiting specialist team from the Food Safety Authority could not exclude CSF as the cause of the clinical problems and sent blood samples to the reference laboratory in Lelystad for a PCR test on CSF antigen. Fortunately, test results obtained 6 hours later were negative for CSF, and the disease control measures were lifted. It later appeared that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) might have been responsible for the problems. But what if CSF had caused the clinical problems? A C SF-transmission model was used to simulate CSF outbreaks dependent on the duration of the high-risk period (HRP). As the duration of the HRP increased, there was an exponential growth in the number of pig farms infected during this period. Simulations also showed that with a longer HRP, the virus spread over greater distances from the source herd. It was also investigated whether a possible CSF outbreak could be detected on the basis of an increased mortality and hence increased number of cadavers sent to a rendering plant. However, the calculated mortality incidence was not sensitive enough to serve as an alarm signal. It is recommended that CSF-exclusion diagnostics be used much earlier in similar clinical situations on pig farms...|$|R

40|$|Transport of {{live animals}} {{is a major}} risk factor in the spread of {{infectious}} diseases between holdings. The present study analysed the pork supply chain of a producer community in Northern Germany. The structure of trade networks can be characterised by carrying out a network analysis. To identify holdings with a central position in this directed network of pig production, several parameters describing these properties were measured (in-degree, out-degree, ingoing and outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and ingoing and outgoing closeness centrality). To obtain {{the importance of the}} different holding types (<b>multiplier,</b> farrowing <b>farms,</b> finishing farms and farrow-to-finishing farms) within the pyramidal structure of the pork supply chain, centrality parameters were calculated for the entire network {{as well as for the}} individual holding types. Using these centrality parameters, two types of holdings could be identified. In the network studied, finishing and farrow-to-finishing farms were more likely to be infected due to the high number of ingoing trade contacts. Due to the high number of outgoing trade contacts multipliers and farrowing farms had an increased risk to spread a disease to other holdings. However, the results of the centrality parameters degree and infection chain were not always consistent, such that the indirect trade contacts should be taken into consideration to understand the real importance of a holding in spreading or contracting an infection. Furthermore, all calculated parameters showed a highly right-skewed distribution. Networks with such a degree distribution are considered to be highly resistant concerning the random removal of nodes. But by strategic removal of the most central holdings, e. g. by trade restrictions or selective vaccination or culling, the network structure can be changed efficiently and thus decompose into fragments. Such a fragmentation of the trade networks is of particular importance from an epidemiological perspective...|$|R

Freewheelin’ founder Amy Courtney, a 1997 graduate of UCSC’s Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, strives to produce fresh, healthy food while minimizing her environmental footprint. Courtney started the farm in 2002 {{with almost no}} motorized vehicles, incorporating used equipment and recycled materials wherever possible in the farm’s operations. She and her current farming partners, Kirstin Yogg and Darryl Wong, still haul all of their CSA shares by bicycle six miles into Santa Cruz. Courtney’s work as a farmer springs not only from a love of land and plants, but also from a commitment to social justice, community health, and cultural vitality. She majored in community studies as an undergraduate student at UCSC; before founding Freewheelin’ Farm, she worked with school gardens, Santa Cruz’s Homeless Garden Project, the United Farm Workers and the AFL-CIO, and an agricultural extension program in Cuba. Freewheelin’s website places the farm “at {{the forefront of the}} growing movement towards community renewal, addressing issues of environment, health, and social equity in a simple and delicious way. ” The Freewheelin’ farmers have begun collaborating with “Food, What?!”—a youth empowerment program based at UCSC’s Life Lab Garden Classroom. Other cultural and educational initiatives at the farm have included an annual community art show, yoga classes, and cooking instruction with Zen Buddhist priest and Tassajara Bread Book author Edward Espe Brown. Courtney’s long, low house sits on the original Freewheelin’ acre, a stretch of cultivated land between the Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean in northern Santa Cruz County.

The good performance in agricultural sector can diminish levels of rural poverty and meet increasing demand of agricultural products (Ahluwalia, 1978). Agricultural productivity {{is a measure of the}} efficiency with which inputs are used in agriculture to produce an output.

Rainwater which is harvested using structures of varying types and sizes was used for either supplemental irrigation or recharging open-wells. In many cases, the farm level rainwater harvesting structures were highly effective for rainfed farming and had a <b>multiplier</b> effect on <b>farm</b> income.

Despite such examples, the adoption of the farm ponds was low, except in Maharashtra. A functional analysis of the reasons for high adoption of water harvesting structures indicated that factors such as technical support, customized design, level of farmer participation, age, existing ownership of open wells, annual rainfall and household assets were the major determinants of performance of farm-level rainwater harvesting structures.
