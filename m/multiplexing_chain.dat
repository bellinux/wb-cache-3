40|$|International audienceTime-to-market and {{implementation}} cost are high-priority considerations in the automation of digital hardware design. Nowadays, {{digital signal processing}} applications are implemented into fixed-point architectures due to its advantage of manipulating data with lower word-length. Thus, floating-point to fixed point conversion is mandatory. This conversion is translated into optimizing the integer word length and fractional word length. Optimizing the integer word-length can significantly reduce the cost when the application is tolerant to a low probability of overflow. In this paper, a new selective simulation technique to accelerate overflow effect analysis is introduced. A new integer word-length optimization algorithm that exploits this selective simulation technique is proposed to reduce both implementation cost and optimization time. The efficiency of our proposals is illustrated through experiments, where selective simulation technique allows accelerating the execution time of up to 1200 and 1000 when applied on Global Positioning System and on Fast Fourier Transform part (FFT) of Orthogonal Frequency Division <b>Multiplexing</b> <b>chain</b> respectively. Moreover, applying the optimization algorithm on the FFT part leads to a cost reduction between 17 to 22 % with respect to interval arithmetic and an acceleration factor of up to 617 with respect to classical max- 1 algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Multiplex</b> {{polymerase}} <b>chain</b> reaction allows amplification {{of multiple}} target sequences of a genome under identical conditions {{in a single}} tube. This "one-shot" polymerase chain reaction detection is time and cost effective when large or multiple genes, with many target fragments are investigated. This is applicable for retinoblastoma susceptibility gene having 27 exons with recurrent mutations reported at most of the 12 CGA codons. Materials and Methods: <b>Multiplex</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction assay for the amplification of 12 CGA codons, which constitutes about 50 &#x 0025; of retinoblastoma susceptibility gene mutations has been designed. The time and cost (includes only reagent cost) involved in both multiplex and uniplex polymerase chain reaction was also calculated. Results: Twelve CGA codons were multiplexed in 5 instead of 12 uniplex polymerase chain reactions, which took 36 hours and 9. 78 US$ whereas <b>multiplex</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction took 15 hours and 6. 88 US$. <b>Multiplex</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction method saved 58. 3 &#x 0025; of time and 29. 6 &#x 0025; of cost over uniplex polymerase chain reaction. Conclusion: Saving time {{by more than half}} and cost by nearly a third would help clinicians and geneticists while counseling retinoblastoma patients...|$|R
