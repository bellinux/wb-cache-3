40|$|Graphene and {{structurally}} similar 2 -dimensional (2 <b>d)</b> <b>materials</b> such as {{transition metal}} dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) hold enormous {{potential for the}} next generation optoelectronics and photonics. Pairing 2 <b>d</b> <b>materials</b> with printing is an emerging cost-effective large-scale device fabrication strategy. However, the current inks are far from ideal to support reproducible device fabrication. In addition, the instability of BP in ambient limits its applications. In this thesis, I present formulation of 2 <b>d</b> <b>material</b> inks for inkjet printing for optoelectronic and photonic applications. To begin with, I produce mono- and few-layer 2 <b>d</b> <b>material</b> flakes via ultrasonic assisted liquid phase exfoliation. This allows one-step formulation of a polymer stabilised graphene ink. For TMDs and BP, I design a binary solvent carrier for binder-free ink formulation. I show that these 2 <b>d</b> <b>material</b> inks have optimal fluidic properties, drying dynamics and interaction with substrates for spatially uniform, highly controllable and print-to-print consistent large-scale printing on untreated substrates. In particular, the rapid ink drying at low temperatures leads to minimal oxidation of BP during ambient printing; the printed BP with passivation retains a stability over one month. On this basis, the printed graphene is employed as active sensing layer in CMOS integrated humidity sensors and as counter-electrodes in dye-sensitised solar cells, while the printed TMDs and BP are used to develop nonlinear photonic devices (i. e. saturable absorbers for femtosecond pulsed laser generation) and visible to near-infrared photodetectors (e. g. MoS_ 2 and BP/graphene/silicon hybrid photodetectors). Beyond inkjet printing, I present an ink formulation of commercial graphene nanoplatelets for roll-to-roll flexographic press (∼ 100 m min^− 1 printing speed). This allows hundreds of conductive electronic circuits to be printed in a minute for capacitive touchpads. Though I investigate only graphene, TMDs and BP, the ink formulation strategies can be effortlessly transferred to other 2 <b>d</b> <b>materials</b> such as boron nitride, MXenes and mica. In addition to the demonstrated applications, printing of 2 <b>d</b> <b>materials</b> can be potentially exploited to fabricate devices such as transistors, light emitters, energy storage conversion, and biosensors.

This research investigates the accuracy of the simple random and the systematic sampling in the case of hydrologic variables. Therefore, from a population of 1339 observations in the area of Axiou where the parameters of certain variables were known, a simple random sample and a systematic sample of 50 observations were taken. With the help of these samples the already known parameters of the population were been valuated. The principal results of the research showed that an inappropriate sampling is the systematic sampling for the calculation of the rains height average due to the difference of the average in relation to the population accounted to 63, 5 % although the simple random sampling underestimated the average when the difference reached - 6, 05 %.

Aim: This study evaluated the transverse deflection and transverse strength of four commercial brands of heat cure acrylic resin (Stellon, Acrylin-H, Trevalon and Trevalon-HI). Materials and Methods: An experimental design was adapted. Twenty-four rectangular strip specimens, six for each group, were prepared. Strips were finished on the edges and equally from the both the molded surfaces to make strips of specific dimensions. The tests were conducted mainly in accordance with the American Dental Association Specification no. 12 /ISO: 1567 - 1981 (ISO: 6887 - 1986) for denture base polymer. The transverse deflection and transverse strength were measured by Instron testing machine. Intergroup differences were assessed using student "t" test.
