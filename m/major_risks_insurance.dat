40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} a 'major-risk' approach to health insurance {{using data from the}} National Medical Expenditure Survey. We study the impact of switching from existing coverage to a policy with a 50 percent coinsurance rate and 10 percent of income limit on out-of-pocket expenditures, as well as several alternative combinations of a high-coinsurance rate with a limited out-of-pocket payment. Our analysis is limited to the population under age 65. Although 80 percent of spending on physicians and hospital care is done by the 20 percent of families who spend over $ 5, 000 in a year, our analysis shows that shifting to a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> policy could reduce aggregate health spending by nearly 20 percent. The reductions would be greatest among higher income individuals. By reducing excess consumption of health services, the <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> policy increases aggregate economic efficiency. With modest values of both demand sensitivity and risk aversion we find that shifting to a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> policy would raise aggregate national efficiency by $ 34 billion a year. Government provision of a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> policy" to those under 65 could be financed with a premium of about $ 150 per person because of the increased tax revenue and reduced Medicare outlays that would result from the provision of universal <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> for the population under age 65. Even without government provision, individuals might be induced to select <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> policies by changing existing tax rules to eliminate the advantage of insurance, either by including employer provided insurance in taxable income or by permitting a tax deduction for out-of-pocket medical expenditures. ...|$|R

In this framework the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) {{is defined as the}} amount of capital that an insurer needs in order to remain viable in the market and maintain its default probability below a certain level. The main purpose of the new solvency regulation is to obtain more realistic modelling and assessment of the different <b>risks</b> <b>insurance</b> companies are exposed to. According to this regulation the SCR standard calculation is based on a modular approach where the overall risk is split into several modules and submodules for which SCRs are computed separately and then aggregated according to pre-specified correlation matrices. Longevity risk is one of the <b>major</b> <b>risks</b> that an <b>insurance</b> company or a pension fund {{will have to deal with}} and it is expected that its importance will grow in the near future. In agreement with these considerations in Solvency II standard formula longevity risk is explicitly considered as a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. In this paper we will refer exactly to the sub-module of longevity risk and, in a risk management perspective, we suggest a multiperiod approach for calculating the corresponding SCR, that is, we estimate at issue time the solvency adequacy along the overall portfolio contract duration. We propose a backtesting framework for measuring the consistency of the SCR calculations for life insurance policies. In particular to evaluate the performances of the SCR calculation methodologies we quantify the convergence of the SCR forecasts through the time.

The ongoing discussions by the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are putting substantial efforts to promote climate change adaptation through international cooperation in the form of providing additional finances and technologies including proposals to promote a global or regional climate <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> facility. Case studies from within and outside the Asia-Pacific region provide valuable lessons which could be used for promoting <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> by the future climate regime (post-Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012).

There is a need for the proposals to the Convention to give more thought on how they address the issues such as high base risks, lack of historical data required for designing <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> systems, limited awareness in the utility of insurance instruments, keeping the premium prices within affordable levels, encouraging the role of private sector, enabling greater access to reinsurers, and instituting enabling policies t...|$|R

However, I understood that, the research on builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance,</b> which aims to protect the shipbuilding industry, is unfortunately quite limited. The countries, which having such important shipping interests as China, should have a well developed body of law dealing with builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> issues. The Institute Builder’s Risk Clauses (ILU clauses), the People’s Insurance Company of China Builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> clauses (PICC clauses) and the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan of 1996 (NMIP clauses) are the main regulations governing builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> in UK, China and Norway.
