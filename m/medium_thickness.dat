5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with <b>medium</b> <b>thickness</b> and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

It consisted of a deep water-tight compartment adjacent to the hull, backed by a thick torpedo bulkhead that connected to the side and deck armor plates, with a deep fuel oil tank behind it.|$|E
60|$|We {{mentioned}} that the bases of the mountains bordering the Lake of Como were chiefly composed of black marble; black, at least, when polished, and very dark gray in its general effect. This is very finely stratified in beds varying in thickness from an inch {{to two or three}} feet; and these beds, taken of a <b>medium</b> <b>thickness,</b> form flat slabs, easily broken into rectangular fragments, which, being excessively compact in their grain, are admirably adapted for a building material. There is a little pale limestone[17] among the hills to the south; but this marble, or primitive limestone (for it is not highly crystalline), is not only more easy of access, but a more durable stone. Of this, consequently, almost all the buildings on the lake shore are built; and, therefore, were their material unconcealed, would be of a dark monotonous and melancholy gray tint, equally uninteresting to the eye, and depressing to the mind. To prevent this result, they are covered with different compositions, sometimes white, more frequently cream-colored, and of varying depth; the moldings and pilasters being frequently of deeper tones than the walls. The insides of the grottoes, however, when not cut in the rock itself, are left uncovered, thus forming a strong contrast with the whiteness outside; giving great depth, and permitting weeds and flowers to root themselves on the roughnesses, and rock streams to distill through the fissures of the dark stones; while all parts of the building to which the eye is drawn, by their form or details (except the capitals of the pilasters), such as the urns, the statues, the steps, or balustrades, are executed in very fine white marble, generally from the quarries of Carrara, which supply quantities of fragments of the finest quality, which nevertheless, owing to their want of size, or to the presence of conspicuous veins, are unavailable for the higher purposes of sculpture.|$|E

40|$|In {{this series}} of articles, a method is {{presented}} that performs (semi) quantitative phase analysis for nanocrystalline transmission electron microscope samples from {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) patterns. Volume fractions and degree of fiber texture are determined for the nanocrystalline components. The effect of the amorphous component is minimized by empirical background interpolation. First, the two-dimensional SAED pattern is converted into a one-dimensional distribution similar to X-ray diffraction. Volume fractions of the nanocrystalline components are determined by fitting the spectral components, calculated for the previously identified phases with a priori known structures. These Markers are calculated not only for kinematic conditions, but the Blackwell correction is also applied to take into account dynamic effects for <b>medium</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Peak shapes and experimental parameters (camera length, etc.) are refined during the fitting iterations. Parameter space is explored {{with the help of the}} Downhill-SIMPLEX. The method is implemented in a computer program that runs under the Windows operating system. Part I presented the principles, while part II elaborated current implementation. The present part III demonstrates the usage and efficiency of the computer program by numerous examples. The suggested experimental protocol should be of benefit in experiments aimed at phase analysis using electron diffraction methods...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{part two of}} a broader {{investigation}} into pre-cooling the air that enters natural draft dry cooling towers. Evaporative cooling of air is to some extent different from evaporative cooling of water. Two trickle media (Trickle 125 and Trickle 100) originally designed for evaporative cooling of water were studied in an open-circuit wind tunnel for evaporative cooling of air. Three <b>medium</b> <b>thicknesses</b> (200, 300 and 450 mm) and two water flow rates (10 and 5 l/min per m horizontally exposed surface area) {{were used in the}} tests. The air velocities ranged from 0. 5 to 3. 0 m/s. The cooling efficiency and the pressure drop of the two media were curve fitted to yield a set of correlations. The pressure drop ranges for Trickle 125 and Trickle 100 were 0. 7 - 50 Pa and 0. 6 - 41. 6 Pa, respectively. The cooling efficiencies of Trickle 125 and Trickle 100 fell within 15. 7 - 55. 1 % and 11 - 44. 4 %, respectively. Generally, media with large effective surfaces provide high cooling efficiencies and high pressure drops; there is a trade-off between cooling efficiency and pressure drop when selecting a particular medium for a specific application. The water entrainment off the media was detected with water-sensitive papers, and both media had severe water entrainment at large air velocities...|$|R

40|$|The Hybrid Compact Gamma Camera (HCGC) is a {{portable}} optical-gamma hybrid imager designed for intraoperative medical imaging, particularly for sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} procedures. To investigate the capability of the HCGC in lymphatic system imaging, two lymphoscintigraphic phantoms have been designed and constructed. These phantoms allowed quantitative assessment and evaluation of the HCGC for lymphatic vessel (LV) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection. Fused optical and gamma images showed good alignment of the two modalities allowing localisation of activity within the LV and the SLN. At an imaging distance of 10 cm, the spatial resolution of the HCGC during the detection process of the simulated LV was not degraded at a separation of more than 1. 5 cm (variation < 5 %) from the injection site (IS). Even {{in the presence of}} the IS the targeted LV was detectable with an acquisition time of less than 2 minutes. The HCGC could detect SLNs containing different radioactivity concentrations (ranging between 1 : 20 to 1 : 100 SLN to IS activity ratios) and under various scattering thicknesses (ranging between 5 mm to 30 mm) with high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values (ranging between 11. 6 and 110. 8). The HCGC can detect the simulated SLNs at various IS to SLN distances, different IS to SLN activity ratios and through varied scattering <b>medium</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The HCGC provided an accurate physical localisation of radiopharmaceutical uptake in the simulated SLN. These characteristics of the HCGC reflect its suitability for utilisation in lymphatic vessel drainage imaging and SLN imaging in patients in different critical clinical situations such as interventional and surgical procedures.
