5|$|In 1869, {{the ground}} hosted an archery {{meeting for the}} Royal St. Leonards Archers. During the 1890s, the ground hosted local {{football}} matches for Rock-a-Nores (now Hastings United); in 1895, it hosted Rock-a-Nores' matches in the Hastings Carlisle Cup Competition. In 1896, the ground hosted a charity match between Hastings and Eastbourne, {{to raise money for}} Hastings Rowing Club; Hastings won the match 3–1, and the match raised almost £10, which was <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> needed for the rowing club's new galley. Later in the year, it hosted another match between Hastings and Eastbourne, which Eastbourne won 7–2.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, bookmakers made {{a profit}} out of {{patriotic}} Britons placing bets on a Manchester United victory. William Hill reported two bets of around £20,000 placed on Manchester United, while Paddy Power received one of £5,500 and Ladbrokes one of £3,000. Ladbrokes {{also took a}} bet of £10,000 on a Barcelona win, but bookmakers reported that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was put on Manchester United. Extrabet.com paid out £12,000 to a £3,000 bet on Samuel Eto'o to score the first goal at odds of 4–1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E

50|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} <b>money</b> {{supply is}} bank money held on computers. This is also considered digital currency. One {{could argue that}} our increasingly cashless society means that all currencies are becoming digital (sometimes referred to as “electronic money”), {{but they are not}} presented to us as such.|$|R
5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Castleford, {{the son of a}} coal miner. He became {{well-known}} through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures, and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom. His ability in later life to fulfill large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy. Despite this, he lived frugally; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation, which continues to support education and promotion of the arts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for {{the first}} phase of Device works came from Henry's {{dissolution}} of the monasteries a few years before, and the revenues that flowed in from the Court of Augmentations and First Fruits and Tenths as a result. In addition, the dissolution had released ample supplies of building materials as the monastic buildings were pulled down, and much of this was recycled. Netley Castle, for example, was based on an old abbey and reused many of its stones, East Tilbury Blockhouse reused parts of St Margaret's Chantry, Calshot Castle took the lead from nearby Beaulieu Abbey, East and West Cowes castles stone from Beaulieu and Quarr, and Sandwich had the stone from the local Carmelite friary. Milton Blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from Milton Chantry. By {{the second phase of the}} programme, however, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from the dissolution had been spent, and Henry instead had to borrow funds; government officials noted that at least £100,000 was needed for the work.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the aviation industry was accompanied by the disruption of road transport; many roads are frequently blocked by militia checkpoints which demand payment (between $3 and $300, depending on goods carried) {{in order to allow}} the cars to continue their journey. A BBC report claimed there were seven such checkpoints in the 50km between an airstrip and the capital, Mogadishu. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> is used to buy khat, a drug used by the militiamen.|$|E
25|$|The Reno Gang, {{also known}} as the Reno Brothers Gang and The Jackson Thieves, were a group of criminals that {{operated}} in the Midwestern United States during and just after the American Civil War. Though short-lived, they carried out the first three peacetime train robberies in U.S. history. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stolen <b>money</b> was never recovered.|$|R
50|$|The Directory {{became a}} kind of {{ineffective}} dictatorship. It repudiated <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assignats <b>money</b> and <b>the</b> debt but failed to restore financial confidence or stability. Guerrilla activity flared up again in the Vendée and other parts <b>of</b> western France. <b>The</b> religious schism became more acute; the Directory took severe measures toward the refractory clergy who would not swear allegiance to the government.|$|R

5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} {{issues that he}} needed to deal with {{at the time of his}} accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in a dire fiscal situation that Macrinus needed to address.|$|E
5|$|Originally budgeted at $400million, the new South Ferry station cost a {{total of}} $530million, with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> being {{a grant from the}} Federal Transit Administration {{earmarked}} for World Trade Center reconstruction. In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far {{from the edge of the}} platform. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009, with a new free transfer to between the 1 and the N, R, and W trains at the older Whitehall Street station. It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{was passed}} on 11 June 1792, {{creating}} The Company of Proprietors of the Sleaford Navigation, which was empowered {{to make and}} maintain a Navigation from Sleaford Castle Causeway, through the town of Sleaford, along the course of Sleaford Mill Stream and Kyme Eau, to the River Witham, at or near Chappel Hill. It had authority to raise £13,000 in capital for the project, with an additional £6,500 if necessary. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was raised within Lincolnshire, {{with half of the}} shares being bought by people living in Sleaford. Six proprietors were elected to serve on a committee, which expressed its thanks to Joseph Banks at its first meeting. By the end of 1793, £16,000 had been raised to fund construction.|$|E
50|$|In {{contemporary}} monetary systems, {{most money}} in circulation exists not as cash or coins created by the central bank, but as bank deposits. Commercial bank lending expands <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> bank deposits. Through fractional reserve banking, the modern banking system expands <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply <b>of</b> a country beyond the amount initially created by the central bank, creating <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad <b>money</b> in <b>the</b> system.|$|R
50|$|First run in 1895, {{the race}} was named for Brooklyn {{contractor}} and tugboat captain, William Carter, who put up <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purse <b>money.</b> <b>The</b> race was hosted by the old Aqueduct race track from 1895 to 1955, except for 1946 when it was held at Belmont Park.

50|$|Etty Glazer, wife of South African {{businessman}} Bernard Glazer, and her 22 month old son Sammy, were kidnapped for ransom on 30 March 1966. They {{were both}} returned safely after a ransom of ZAR 140,000 (South African Rand) {{was paid to}} the kidnappers. The kidnapper's house was quickly identified by police, and four suspects were arrested, with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ransom <b>money</b> been retrieved.|$|R
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E
5|$|The {{two were}} {{detained}} by the British in Bari and thoroughly searched by local authorities, who suspected them of a robbery {{that had occurred}} in the Yugoslav consulate in Cairo. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> jewelry and uncensored letters that they were carrying were impounded. The two were flown out of Bari on 30 May, and landed on an airfield at Pranjani northwest of Čačak shortly after. Because their landing at Pranjani coincided with Armstrong's departure, Baćović and Lukačević demanded that Armstrong be held as a hostage until their impounded belongings could be returned from Bari. The Chetnik personnel at the airfield refused to keep Armstrong any further, and {{he was allowed to}} depart without incident.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E
50|$|Even {{with these}} {{measures}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companies lost <b>money.</b> Only about ten earned profits. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companies' vast holdings existed only on paper {{with virtually no}} presence {{on the ground in}} Africa.|$|R

50|$|In 1885 the Clan's {{hereditary}} lands {{would have}} been seized due to Fergus' inability to pay his taxes. But Scrooge spent his savings at the time ($10,000) to pay the taxes and become <b>the</b> new owner <b>of</b> their lands. While Scrooge was away, Fergus and his family moved back to Castle McDuck, abandoned for centuries in Dismal Downs. The family continued to work {{to pay for the}} taxes and Scrooge sent them <b>most</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he earned while traveling. Fergus became a widower in 1897.|$|R
5|$|Hermética's last {{concert was}} held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had {{contracted}} hepatitis B {{turned out to be}} false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Hermética, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clarín newspaper and the other members to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not talking to each other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February 1944, Lukačević, Baćović {{and another}} officer {{accompanied}} Bailey {{to the coast}} south of Dubrovnik and were evacuated from Cavtat by a Royal Navy gunboat. Their passage through German-occupied territory was probably facilitated by Lukačević's accommodation with the Germans. At one point, Lukačević was invited to have a meal with the German garrison commander of a nearby town, but declined the offer. Lukačević and the others then travelled via Cairo to London, where Lukačević represented Mihailović at King Peter's wedding on 20 March 1944. After the British government decided to withdraw support from Mihailović, Lukačević and his Chetnik companions {{were not allowed to}} return to Yugoslavia until the British mission to Mihailović headed by Armstrong had been safely evacuated from occupied territory. Lukačević and the others were detained by the British in Bari and thoroughly searched by local authorities, who suspected them of a robbery that had occurred in the Yugoslav consulate in Cairo a short time before. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> jewelry and uncensored letters that they were carrying were impounded.
