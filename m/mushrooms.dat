5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these <b>mushrooms</b> {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller <b>mushrooms</b> tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature <b>mushrooms.</b> In general, the psilocybin content of <b>mushrooms</b> is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated <b>mushrooms</b> have less variability in psilocybin content than wild <b>mushrooms.</b> The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried <b>mushrooms</b> retain their potency for months or even years, while <b>mushrooms</b> stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|Edible <b>mushrooms</b> are {{well-known}} {{examples of}} fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button <b>mushrooms</b> when small or Portobello <b>mushrooms</b> when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw <b>mushrooms</b> (Volvariella volvacea), oyster <b>mushrooms</b> (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.).|$|E

5|$|Unlike other <b>mushrooms</b> {{known to}} release spores in {{response}} to a circadian rhythm, spore release in M.rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried <b>mushrooms</b> may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks—a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics. There are several species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.rotula <b>mushrooms</b> are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications.|$|E

The effect of various levels of <b>mushroom</b> powder on the physico-chemical properties and nutritional quality of cakes had been observed. <b>Mushroom</b> powder at 15 % addition level significantly improved colour, flavour and texture of cake.

5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its <b>mushrooms</b> fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} de-ice the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. <b>Mushrooms</b> can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the <b>mushrooms</b> will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E
