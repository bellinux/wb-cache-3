50|$|Most fertile {{part of the}} village, use {{to produce}} all the most {{valuable}} rabi and bhadoi crops. In the low-lying areas, the main crop grown is winter rice, though in some parts good rabi crops are also raised on the lands. Rabi and Bhadoi crops were grown from 1800 till recently (1980). Villages like Umaidpur were chiefly dependent on the Aghani (or winter) rabi and bhadoi harvests. The village land falls into two classes: Bhith (uplands) and Dhanhar (low lands where water logging occurred during rainy season). Bhith was further classified as saliferous land or usher (soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils) was found in patches in the outer area between good land and low-lying land. Nunia caste from the neighbouring village, Nauachak, used to extract saltpetere in the summer after rabi crop from these lands for their living. In these lands small farmers grew mainly 'Marua, also called mandua, nachini or Ragi' or Finger Millets (Eleusine coracana), Kauni (foxtail milet) and Sama (kutaki or little milet). In Bhith land, wheat, maize, and miscellaneous food-grains which consisted chiefly of khesari, rahari, masuri, urd, mung, janera, and oats. <b>Miscel</b> laneous food-crops growns also included potatoes, and suthni (Dioscorea fasciculate). The chief non-food crops are oilseeds. Tobacco and Chilies are cultivated as commercial crops. Of the other non-food crops, kharhaul or thatching-grass was the most valuable, but now these lands are used for growing paddy.|$|E

Changing {{the scope of}} the search when, e. g., too many or too few hits have been obtained, requires re-formulation of the search expression. For an alternative scheme we suggest an explorative full-text information retrieval method, where the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm is used to order documents based on their full textual contents. The visualized order can then be utilized for an explorative search or exploration of novel knowledge areas, whereby the scope can be changed interactively. The ordering of the documents is achieved by a two-level analysis: First, word categories are extracted from the text by a "semantic" SOM. Second, the textual context of the documents is encoded {{on the basis of the}} histograms of words formed on the word category map. 1 Introduction The information age is characterized by an uncontrolled flood of <b>miscel</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} mobile, GPS-based {{multimodal}} navigation system, equipped with inertial control that {{allows users to}} explore and na-vigate through an augmented physical space, incorporating and displaying the uncertainty resulting from inaccurate sensing and unknown user intentions. The system propagates uncertainty ap-propriately via Monte Carlo sampling and predicts at a user-controllable time horizon. Control of the Monte Carlo exploration is entirely tilt-based. The system output is displayed both visually and in audio. Audio is rendered via granular synthesis to accurately display the probability of the user reaching targets in the space. We also demonstrate the use of uncertain prediction in a trajectory fol-lowing task, where a section of music is modulated according to the changing predictions of user position {{with respect to the}} target tra-jectory. We show that appropriate display of the full distribution of potential future users positions with respect to sites-of-interest can improve the quality of interaction over a simplistic interpretation of the sensed data.

Description of the countryside, including ruins of Castle Kennedy.

Concludes that August is a bad month for botany, nonetheless found a profusion of 'Parnassia', 'Campanula rotundifolia' covers the fields, missed 'Rhodiola rosea' in Portpatrick. Stayed with Lord Clanbrassil [James Hamilton (1730 - 1798) 2 nd Earl of Clanbrassil] in Dandalk, Ireland, description of his house and grounds, "a great amateur". Congratulates Smith on five plates in [William Curtis'] "Botanical Magazine". Asks whether it is worth subscribing to [Robert John] Thornton's [(c 1768 - 1837), physician and writer on botany] work. Asks if publication of Andrew's "Ericas" goes on.

40|$|Abstract] Secondary {{analysis}} of data from a survey among primary care physicians and from another survey among the general population provides information {{on the extent to}} which sexuality and HIV prevention are discussed in Swiss medical offices. Data on physicians show that they do not discuss sexual life issues routinely. When a sexual history is taken, questions are mainly asked about protection, and much less about the patient's sexual orientation and sexual practices. Regarding HIV risk assessment, physicians focus on patients considered at higher risk (drug users, men who have sex with men), and less on patients in more 'neutral' situations, such as during check-ups, with young adults, with new patients or with migrants. Patients' reported experiences are rather different: few people report having discussed HIV after a consultation with their doctor. Paying insufficient attention to sexuality impedes primary care physicians in their attempts to obtain necessary information to counsel and inform their patients, to help them if faced with difficulties or to detect certain pathologies. Medical training on three levels is needed to increase primary care physicians' skills in dealing with their patients' sexual issues: knowledge (for example, on the frequency of sexual problems, on STIs), skill (how to take a sexual history) and presence (talking with ease about sexuality).

Cotecchia, S. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2002 Molecular Pharmacology 6151025 - 1032 <![CDATA[Computer simulations on a new model of the alpha 1 b-adrenergic receptor based on the crystal structure of rhodopsin have been combined with experimental mutagenesis to investigate the role of residues in the cytosolic half of helix 6 in receptor activation. Our results support the hypothesis that a salt bridge between the highly conserved arginine (R 143 (3. 50)) of the E/DRY motif of helix 3 and a conserved glutamate (E 289 (6. 30)) on helix 6 constrains the alpha 1 b-AR in the inactive state. In fact, mutations of E 289 (6. 30) that weakened the R 143 (3. 50) -E 289 (6. 30) interaction constitutively activated the receptor. The functional effect of mutating other amino acids on helix 6 (F 286 (6. 27), A 292 (6. 33), L 296 (6. 37), V 299 (6. 40,) V 300 (6. 41), and F 303 (6. 44)) correlates with the extent of their interaction with helix 3 and in particular with R 143 (3. 50) of the E/DRY sequence...|$|E
