5|$|Adamle {{grew up in}} Cleveland, Ohio and was a star fullback on his Collinwood High School {{football}} team.

Cleveland won AAFC championships in each of Adamle's first three years, after which the league folded and the Browns were absorbed by the <b>more</b> <b>established</b> NFL. Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning the 1950 championship and advancing to the 1951 championship but losing to the Los Angeles Rams.

5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{church in}} the capital, the Church of the Holy Apostles, which {{had been in a}} very poor state {{near the end of the}} 5th century, was likewise rebuilt. Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the Great Palace of Constantinople have yielded several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian's reign, and a column topped by a bronze statue of Justinian on horseback and dressed in a military costume was erected in the Augustaeum in Constantinople in 543. Rivalry with other, <b>more</b> <b>established</b> patrons from the Constantinopolitan and exiled Roman aristocracy (like Anicia Juliana) might have enforced Justinian's building activities in the capital as a means of strengthening his dynasty's prestige.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{prepared}} {{for its first}} season in 1946, McBride stepped aside and let Brown run it. The Browns were an immediate success, both financially and on the field. A capacity crowd of 35,964 saw the Browns play their first preseason game at the Akron Rubber Bowl, and the team led all of football in attendance in 1946 and 1947. The Browns, meanwhile, won every AAFC championship between 1946 and 1949. McBride proposed for the Browns to play an inter-league championship game with the National Football League champion Philadelphia Eagles in 1948 and 1949, but the NFL shot down the idea. He {{also played a role}} in negotiating peace between the AAFC and NFL after competition for talent drove up player salaries and ate into owners' profits. After the 1949 season, the AAFC dissolved and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the <b>more</b> <b>established</b> NFL.|$|E

Brown offered Rymkus a $4,000 salary ($ today), double what he made with the Redskins.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of <b>more</b> <b>established</b> areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E

In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs {{for the first time since}} reforming.
