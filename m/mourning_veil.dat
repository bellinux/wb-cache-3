6000|$|... § III. Yet {{the power}} of Nature cannot be {{shortened}} by the folly, nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery, of man. The broad tides still ebb and flow brightly about the island of the dead, and the linked conclave of the Alps know no decline from their old pre-eminence, nor stoop from their golden thrones {{in the circle of}} the horizon. So lovely is the scene still, in spite of all its injuries, that we shall find ourselves drawn there again and again at evening out of the narrow canals and streets of the city, to watch the wreaths of the sea-mists weaving themselves like <b>mourning</b> <b>veils</b> around the mountains far away, and listen to the green waves as they fret and sigh along the cemetery shore.|$|R
5000|$|Quackenbos met fierce {{resistance}} {{to her work}} to expose peonage. Plantation owners such as LeRoy Percy deliberately worked to thwart her investigations, often using {{the fact that she}} was a woman to belittle her work. One southern newspaper, reporting on her investigations, referred to her as [...] "busybody Quackenbos". Articles sometimes focused on {{the fact that she was}} a woman and her dress rather than on the results of her investigations. A New York Times article on her appointment to the Department of Justice included the following description of Quackenbos: Mrs. Quackenbos is young and pretty, with jet black eyes and hair, a vivacious maner, and a glance of keen penetration. Her figure is tall, slender, and girlish. She always wears well-made black gowns, with touches of white at the neck and sleeves. Her hat is the most distinctive part of her attire, for it is rather wide and flat, and from it, in the back, hang short folds of <b>mourning</b> <b>veiling.</b> Mrs. Quackenbos assumed this dress at the time of the death of her parents a few years ago.|$|R
60|$|The {{lady was}} handed {{forth by the}} Constable of Chester, with the same {{ceremony}} which had been observed at their entrance, and {{she returned to her}} own castle, sad and anxious in mind for the event of this important conference. She gathered closely round her the great <b>mourning</b> <b>veil,</b> that the alteration of her countenance might not be observed; and, without pausing to speak even to Father Aldrovand, she instantly withdrew to the privacy of her own bower.|$|E

60|$|While he thus {{suffered}} {{under these}} contending feelings, Magdalen, {{the widow of}} the slaughtered man, entered the court, wrapt in a deep <b>mourning</b> <b>veil,</b> and followed and supported by five or six women of good (that is, of respectability) dressed in the same melancholy attire. One of her attendants held an infant in her arms, the last pledge of poor Oliver's nuptial affections. Another led a little tottering creature of two years, or thereabouts, which looked with wonder and fear, sometimes on the black dress {{in which they had}} muffled him, and sometimes on the scene around him.|$|E
60|$|As {{he raised}} his eyes he could not repress a slight start. He had not noticed before that they had passed through a small gateway on {{diverging}} from the road, and was quite unprepared to find himself {{on the edge of}} a gentle slope leading to a beautiful valley, and before him a long vista of tombs, white head-stones and low crosses, edged by drooping cypress and trailing feathery vines. Some vines had fallen and been caught in long loops from bough to bough, like funeral garlands, and here and there the tops of isolated palmettos lifted a cluster of hearse-like plumes. Yet in spite of this dominance of sombre but graceful shadow, the drooping delicacy of dark-tasseled foliage and leafy fringes, and the waving <b>mourning</b> <b>veils</b> of gray, translucent moss, a glorious vivifying Southern sun smiled and glittered everywhere as through tears. The balm of bay, southernwood, pine, and syringa breathed through the long alleys; the stimulating scent of roses moved with every zephyr, and the closer odors of jessamine, honeysuckle, and orange flowers hung heavily in the hollows. It seemed to Courtland like the mourning of beautiful and youthful widowhood, seductive even in its dissembling trappings, provocative in the contrast of its own still strong virility. Everywhere the grass grew thick and luxuriant; the quick earth was teeming with the germination of the dead below.|$|R

6000|$|Amongst {{the troops}} {{detached}} on this service {{was a small}} party, commanded by Stawarth Bolton, a captain in the English army, and full of the blunt and unpretending gallantry and generosity which has so often distinguished that nation. Resistance was in vain. Elspeth Brydone, when she descried a dozen of horsemen threading {{their way up the}} glen, with a man at their head, whose scarlet cloak, bright armour, and dancing plume, proclaimed him a leader, saw no better protection for herself than to issue from the iron grate, covered with a long <b>mourning</b> <b>veil,</b> and holding one of her two sons in each hand, to meet the Englishman--state her deserted condition--place the little tower at his command--and beg for his mercy. She stated, in a few brief words, her intention, and added, [...] "I submit, because I have nae means of resistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No one so dull as a wit," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "when {{he does not}} hit off the scent at once. My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a hurry {{to run away from}} Falkland as I to come hither. We have both left our apparel behind. There is as much female trumpery in the {{wardrobe}} adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival. Look you, I will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a <b>mourning</b> <b>veil</b> and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John, wilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour, the Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her nurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his whole face, and skull to boot. He should have the commodity of a beard to set her forth conformably. Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable pages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom. Hearest thou? about it instantly." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the face}} of Donkin leaning high-shouldered over the after-rail became grave. Something like a weak rattle was heard through the {{forecastle}} door. It became a murmur; it ended in a sighing groan. The washerman plunged both his arms into the tub abruptly; the cook became more crestfallen than an exposed backslider; the boatswain moved his shoulders uneasily; the carpenter got up with a spring and walked away--while the sailmaker seemed mentally to give his story up, and began to puff at his pipe with sombre determination. In the blackness of the doorway a pair of eyes glimmered white, and big, and staring. Then James Wait's head protruding, became visible, as if suspended between the two hands that grasped a doorpost {{on each side of}} the face. The tassel of his blue woollen nightcap, cocked forward, danced gaily over his left eyelid. He stepped out in a tottering stride. He looked powerful as ever, but showed a strange and affected unsteadiness in his gait; his face was perhaps a trifle thinner, and his eyes appeared rather startlingly prominent. He seemed to hasten the retreat of departing light by his very presence; the setting sun dipped sharply, as though fleeing before our nigger; a black mist emanated from him; a subtle and dismal influence; a something cold and gloomy that floated out and settled on all the faces like a <b>mourning</b> <b>veil.</b> The circle broke up. The joy of laughter died on stiffened lips. There was not a smile left among all the ship's company. Not a word was spoken. Many turned their backs, trying to look unconcerned; others, with averted heads, sent half-reluctant glances out of the corners of their eyes. They resembled criminals conscious of misdeeds more than honest men distracted by doubt; only two or three stared frankly, but stupidly, with lips slightly open. All expected James Wait to say something, and, at the same time, had the air of knowing beforehand what he would say. He leaned his back against the doorpost, and with heavy eyes swept over them a glance domineering and pained, like a sick tyrant overawing a crowd of abject but untrustworthy slaves.|$|E

50|$|Black Saturday is {{highlighted}} by 3-hour presentation of “Vigilia na Muling Pagkabuhay” at the patio of the church.

It is facilitated by young girl inside an inverted giant paper flower suspended {{the removal of}} the <b>mourning</b> <b>veil</b> from Mary’s head by a from bamboo trellis. The petals are mechanically opened by giant toy birds to reveal the girl inside. It is then followed by a religious dancing of young ladies called “Kapitana” and “Tenyenta”, to the tune of “Bati”.|$|E
5000|$|Veils {{remained}} {{a part of}} Western mourning dress customs into the modern times. The tradition of widow's veiling {{has its roots in}} nun's attire, which symbolized modesty and chastity. The <b>mourning</b> <b>veil</b> was commonly seen as a means of shielding the mourner and hiding her grief, and, on the contrary, seen by some women as a means of publicly expressing their emotions. Mourning veils have also been sometimes perceived as expressions of elegance or even sex appeal. In a 19th century American etiquette book one finds: [...] "Black is becoming, and young widows, fair, plump, and smiling, with their roguish eyes sparkling under their black veils are very seducing".|$|E
50|$|Regionalist artist Grant Wood, {{who grew}} up and lived in Cedar Rapids as an adult, was {{commissioned}} to design the memorial window. The window measures 24 by 20 ft. It is the only stained glass window designed by Wood. It depicts a 16 ft Lady of Peace and Victory in the clouds. She wears a Grecian robe and a blue <b>mourning</b> <b>veil</b> and holds a palm branch for peace {{in one hand and}} a wreath for victory in the other. The artist's sister Nan was the model for the Lady of Peace and Victory. Across the bottom are six 6 ft tall soldiers representing the American Revolution, War of 1812, Mexican-American War, American Civil War, Spanish-American War, and World War I.|$|E
5000|$|Espiritu contested the will, and {{a decade}} of court battles {{followed}} that were covered in detail by the Los Angeles press. At a jury trial in 1891, Espiritu called 40 witnesses who testified that Leonis had publicly acknowledged her as his wife. When Espiritu appeared in court dressed in black with <b>mourning</b> <b>veil</b> attached to a black flat straw hat, the Los Angeles Times described her as [...] "a typical Mexican of the original cast," [...] with [...] "a very dark complexion, small black eyes, nose blunt, mouth large and lips tightly compressed when in repose." [...] When Espiritu took the stand, she testified that she met Leonis at the Escorpion Indian camp in 1859, lived with him for 30 years, and even had a daughter with him who died before adulthood. The grave identifying Leonis as the deceased child's father was offered as proof of their relationship.|$|E
5000|$|The mob has {{the three}} released, {{but now that}} it is clear that Arnie is a {{liability}} and cannot be trusted, Mr. Varga orders Abie and Harry to kill him. When Abie hesitates, still drinking and distraught over his uncle, Harry kills Arnie himself, despite his friend's pleading. Once again, in this blood-lust haze, Harry seeks comfort with Iris. At Arnie's funeral, Mr. Varga reminds Harry that when Abie drinks, he starts talking, and this makes him a liability. Mr. Varga hints that they may need to kill Abie to keep him silent. When Kate finds Iris' hair in Harry's underwear, he admits to having a girlfriend and Kate calmly says she would like to meet her. The stress puts a strain on Iris and Harry's sex life, and even [...] "Madden's one-track mind" [...] is of no use (during past sexual encounters, Harry has only had sex with Iris under Madden's persona). Worried for Harry's mental health, Iris resolves they really try, without Madden's help. The two go to a hotel, where they make love after Harry has her put on a <b>mourning</b> <b>veil.</b> At the family dinner where Iris was to meet Kate, things seem to be going well, until Kate has her son go out for ginger ale, leaving the two women alone. When Harry returns he finds Iris gone, his mother having driven her away in a jealous rage. Harry admits that he may be in love with Iris and is about to go after her when his mother stops him. Harry remains home and breaks off contact with Iris, his mother's hold over him stronger than ever.|$|E
5000|$|This {{elegant and}} {{historical}} building {{has been described}} as a [...] "monumental neo-classical design" [...] and a [...] "modern rendering of the late Renaissance". The exterior, foyer and staircase are made of Portland stone and many of the rooms are ornately decorated with French walnut and oak panelling, carved plaster ceilings and elaborate crystal chandeliers. The most impressive apartment in the building is the Great Hall, which is approached via the grand staircase and its processional route to the first floor. The walls of the Great Hall can be described as a 'Graeco-Roman rhapsody', as huge marble pilasters with bronze effect Ionic capitals and metal bases interspersed with consoled panels that frame portraits from the Institution's oil paintings collection flow around the vertical surfaces. The ceiling of the Great Hall features a huge painting by Charles Sims commemorating World War 1 (the patron being Sir John Purser Griffith, ICE President in 1920). The work shows a female figure draped in what appears to be a robe or peplos holding in one hand a giant Union Flag, billowing in the wind, and in the other hand a wreath (she is identified in the ICE Catalogue of Works and Art as 'the figure of Renown, wearing a <b>mourning</b> <b>veil</b> and holding out a wreath of bays with the gesture of crowning'). Peering down at the viewer from the edge of the painting are servicemen and women dressed in uniforms reflecting the different branches of the military and above them can be seen a low-flying biplane with fixed undercarriage proudly displaying its red, white, and blue insignia. The corners of the painting show civil engineering scenes in the form of viaducts, steel structures, cranes etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} my presentation, Electronic Textiles: Hacking the Museum, {{is a project}} I orchestrated between the Marsil Museum of Textiles in St. Lambert, Quebec and the Glass Box Gallery at Salford University near Manchester, England. The purpose was to {{manipulate}} images of textile objects {{as a way to}} reconsider the practice of collecting, question the system of classification (and thereby the authority of the museum), and open up new possibilities for the collected object. The Marsil is the only museum in Quebec whose mandate is exclusively dedicated to textiles. Its catalogue system catagorizes the collection according to function and gender, distinguishes between adult and children 2 ̆ 7 s wear, and has a small section of non-Western dress. In 1996, I made several trips to the storage collection, under the guidance of Marsil 2 ̆ 7 s Curator of Costume, Cynthia Cooper. Historic textiles [...] ranging from ready made structures such as a fox collar to those with compound weaves [...] were photographed with a digital camera directly into a laptop computer. The photographs underwent a 2 ̆ 2 normalization 2 ̆ 2 process through manipulation in Photoshop, rendering each image similar in size and surface treatment. The catalogue system was disregarded, and in many cases, references to materials, gender; age and function were blurred. In this process of declassification, a <b>mourning</b> <b>veil,</b> a gentleman 2 ̆ 7 s top hat, and a well-worn nurse 2 ̆ 7 s cap received equal treatment...|$|E
