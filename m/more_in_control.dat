25|$|Thinking of virginity as {{a stigma}} disempowered many boys {{because they felt}} deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E

This long period on the road {{finished}} in January 1996; she was due to begin work on her fourth album in April of that year, but was mentally exhausted. She later said [...] "When I got off the road, I thought Fumbling was my swan song, [...] I'd never make another record ever again. I couldn't imagine writing another song in my life. I had a huge psychological block for a long time." [...] She spent time working in the studio in Quebec but struggled to produce anything for her new album.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 15 reviews.

In The New York Times, Jon Pareles praised Scott's [...] "proudly and forthrightly feminine" [...] themes {{and said the}} songs are [...] "springy {{with a sense of}} improvisation, both in the rhythms and in their elaborate vocal overlays". The Washington Posts Bill Friskics-Warren noted its [...] "sumptuous orchestration, jazzy flourishes and neo-soul beats", and wrote, [...] "The full range of human emotion, from defiance to hurt and hope, is expressed {{over the course of the}} album." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek said that [...] "Scott sounds <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> than ever; her spoken and sung phrasing (now a trademark), songwriting, and production instincts are all solid".

Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of their lives. [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit".
