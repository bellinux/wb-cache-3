50|$|The Volcker Rule {{was first}} {{publicly}} endorsed by President Obama on January 21, 2010. The proposal specifically prohibits a bank or institution that owns a bank {{from engaging in}} proprietary trading, and from owning or investing in a hedge fund or private equity fund, and also limits the liabilities that the largest banks can hold. Under discussion {{is the possibility of}} restrictions on the way <b>market-making</b> <b>activities</b> are compensated; traders would be paid {{on the basis of the}} spread of the transactions rather than any profit that the trader made for the client.|$|E
5000|$|Delta One trading desks {{are either}} {{part of the}} equity finance or equity {{derivatives}} divisions of most major investment banks. They generate most revenue {{through a variety of}} strategies related to the various Delta One products as well as related activities, such as dividend trading, equity financing and equity index arbitrage. In theory such desks should be relatively low risk areas for the banks as the products are generally hedged. FT Alphaville has described Delta One trading as [...] "one of the hottest areas in banking" [...] and [...] "...the last domain of prop trading in the banking sector, where via <b>market-making</b> <b>activities,</b> traders can still get away with taking ample risks." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the amount of information disclosed by bank holding companies (BHCs) and their subsequent risk profile and performance. Using data from the annual reports of BHCs with large trading operations, we construct an index of publicly disclosed information about the BHCs 2 ̆ 019 forward-looking estimates of market risk exposure in their trading and <b>market-making</b> <b>activities.</b> The paper then {{examines the}} relationship between this index and the subsequent risk and return in both the BHCs 2 ̆ 019 trading activities and the firm overall, as proxied by equity market returns. The key findings are that more disclosure is associated with lower risk, especially idiosyncratic risk, and in turn with higher risk-adjusted returns. These findings suggest that greater disclosure is associated with more efficient risk taking and thus improved risk-return trade-offs, although the direction of causation is unclear...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{monetary}} exchange in over-the-counter markets to study the ef-fects of monetary policy on asset prices and standard measures of financial liquidity, such as bid-ask spreads, trade volume, and the incentives of dealers to supply immediacy, both by participating in the <b>market-making</b> <b>activity</b> and by holding asset inventories on their own account. The theory predicts that asset prices carry a speculative premium that reflects the asset’s marketability and depends on monetary policy {{as well as the}} microstructure of the market where it is traded. These liquidity considerations imply a positive correlation between the real yield on stocks and the nominal yield on Treasury bonds—an empirical observation long regarded anomalous. The theory also exhibits rational expectations equi-libria with recurring belief driven events that resemble liquidity crises, i. e., times of sharp persistent declines in asset prices, trade volume, and dealer participation in <b>market-making</b> <b>activity,</b> accompanied by large increases in spreads and abnormally long trading delays...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the over-the-counter (OTC) {{interest rate derivatives}} (IRD) market in order to inform the design of post-trade price reporting. Our analysis uses a novel transaction-level data set to examine trading activity, the composition of market participants, levels of product standardization, and market-making behavior. We find that trading activity in the IRD market is dispersed across {{a broad array of}} product types, currency denominations, and maturities, leading to more than 10, 500 observed unique product combinations. While a select group of standard instruments trade with relative frequency and may provide timely and pertinent price information for market participants, many other IRD instruments trade infrequently and with diverse contract terms, limiting the impact on price formation from the reporting of those transactions. Nonetheless, we find evidence of dealers hedging rapidly after large interest rate swap trades, suggesting that, for this product, a price-reporting regime could be designed in a manner that does not disrupt <b>market-making</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that {{a network of}} active stockjobbers existed in London’s Exchange Alley before the South Sea Bubble and that the network operated effectively during the bubble to intermediate exchanges among {{a wide variety of}} customers. Moreover, the existence of a new financial asset {{after the collapse of the}} bubble, the 5 % perpetual annuities issued by the government to the South Sea’s stockholders in 1723, allowed the resumption of profitable <b>market-making</b> <b>activity</b> by a new group of stock jobbers specializing in the new asset. We argue that the resiliency of the existing network of stockjobbers to the shock of the bubble and its collapse laid the basis for an effective microstructure in the London capital market, and therefore to the continued rise of a secondary market for the British national debt. Dickson’s classic study on the financial revolution in Britain (Dickson, 1967) has spawned a large and growing literature on the sources of that revolution, its development over time, and its ultimate effects on the British economy. Dickson focused on the increasing use of funded long-term debt that could be credibly backed by Parliament, a perpetual and self-renewing institution, and dated its start with the implementation of Dutch financial techniques under William III after the Glorious Revolution (or the Dutch coup d’état according to recidivist Jacobites). Not until 1750 and the completion of plans to consolidate the government’s accumulated long-term debt into the Three Per Cent Consols, however, did Dickson consider the revolution to be complete and its effects on public finance irreversible. Other elements that contributed to Britain’s success in public finance have been studied since. D. W. Jones (Jones, 1988) showed how the short-term financing of immediate war needs was developed over the course of William III’s firs...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the largest}} and most {{important}} of the money markets is the market for repurchase agreements. In a repurchase agreement, a borrower of money effectively agrees to provide securities as collateral to the lender to mitigate credit risk. GCF Repo is a recent innovation in this market that reduces transaction costs, enhances liquidity, and facilitates the efficient use of collateral. R epurchase agreements (“repos ” or “RPs”) play a crucial role in the efficient allocationof capital in financial markets. They are widely used by dealers to finance their <b>market-making</b> and risk-management <b>activities</b> and they provide a safe and low-cost way for mutual funds, depository institutions, and others to lend surplus funds. The importance of the repo market is suggested by its immense size: dealers with a trading relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—so-called primary dealers—reported financing $ 2. 48 trillion in Treasury, agency, mortgage-backed, and corporate securities at the end of 2002 with RPs. 1 GCF (General Collateral Finance) Repo was introduce...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{framework}} and a specific {{proposal for the}} re-regulation of key components of the U. S. financial system {{in the aftermath of}} the subprime mortgage crisis. It begins with a review of those aspects of the subprime crisis that required the large, observed government interventions, namely the feared bankruptcy of individual banks, insurers, and government sponsored enterprises with the potential to create a meltdown of the entire financial system. The paper then develops legislative responses that would make future systemic failures and bailouts of this magnitude highly unlikely. The paper’s key analytic device is to distinguish two financial firm activities: (1) risky investment activities (“hedge fund ” division) capable of causing firm bankruptcy, and (2) <b>market-making</b> and related <b>activities</b> (“infrastructure ” division), the failure of which would have systemic implications. The goal of the proposed regulatory change is to ensure that the infrastructure division is bankruptcy remote and can operate on a stand-alone basis if necessary even when losses from the hedge fund division threaten the holding company’s solvency.
