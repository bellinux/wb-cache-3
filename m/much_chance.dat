5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu was just starting to become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of seeing or learning about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} related {{that the}} spell of the banner meant that it would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, there was not <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.|$|E
25|$|In December 1941, {{after the}} Soviets had {{evacuated}} Hanko, Iku-Turso was docked for the winter. Though Iku-Turso {{had not had}} <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of using its torpedoes, the experiences from other Finnish subs were that the Italian torpedoes used (Finnish designation T/40) were unreliable. During 1942, Iku-Turso was upgraded with new 12-hydrophone listening arrays and equipped with a depth charge rack capable of carrying 4 depth charges. The submarine was further modified by streamlining the tower and moving the 20mm gun up to the tower.|$|E

25|$|The final Irish test of {{the regular}} season came on the road against the 5-5 Stanford Cardinal, in the last game in Stanford Stadium before it would be renovated. Stanford, coached by first-year coach Walt Harris and quarterback Trent Edwards, and Notre Dame played {{annually}} since 1997 and have a minor rivalry for the Legends Trophy. The Irish had won the three previous seasons when coached by former Cardinal head coach Ty Willingham, and the Cardinal didn't look to have <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> in this game after losing in the Big Game to rival California, with the Bears outrushing the Cardinal by 210 yards.|$|E
25|$|United Russia's {{predecessor}} was the Unity bloc, {{which was}} created {{three months before the}} December 1999 Duma elections to counter the advance of the Fatherland – All Russia (OVR) party led by Yuri Luzhkov. The creation of the party was heavily supported by Kremlin insiders, who were wary of what looked like a certain OVR victory. They did not expect Unity to have <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of success, since President Boris Yeltsin was very unpopular and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's ratings were still minuscule. The new party attempted to mimic OVR's formula of success, placing an emphasis on competence and pragmatism. Charismatic Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu was appointed as the party leader.|$|E
25|$|At the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson’s absence, Lloyd George urged greater {{effort to}} advance into Syria {{with a view}} to {{knocking}} Turkey out of the war altogether, and the ministers decided to redeploy 2 divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this, claiming that these troops would be needed in France. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat (although neither Allenby nor Robertson really thought there was <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of this happening), but urging Maude not to exaggerate his needs in Mesopotamia.|$|E

25|$|Neither {{team was}} given <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> to advance far into October by many {{baseball}} pundits. Both teams stumbled {{through the second}} halves of their seasons. The Tigers, enjoying their first successful season after 12 years of futility, surprised the baseball world by building a ten-game lead in the American League Central, but eventually the lead evaporated in the final months and they lost the division to the Minnesota Twins {{on the last day}} of the season after being swept by the last-place Kansas City Royals at home, settling for a playoff berth as the AL Wild Card. The Cardinals held a seven-game advantage in the National League Central over the Cincinnati Reds and an -game lead over the Houston Astros with just two weeks to play. However, the combination of a seven-game losing streak by St. Louis and an eight-game winning streak by the Astros (highlighted by a four-game sweep of the Cardinals in Houston) caused the Cardinals' lead to shrink to -game with only a few games left. However, the Cardinals held on to clinch the division after an Astros' loss to the Atlanta Braves {{on the last day of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, three left arm spinners {{dominated}} the Indian domestic cricket scene. Along with Doshi there were, Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay, & Rajinder Goel of Haryana & Delhi. Goel still holds {{the record for}} the highest number of wickets in the Ranji Trophy (640 at 17.14). Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S. Bedi. With a world class left arm spinner readily available, the selectors were reluctant to give the others <b>much</b> <b>chance.</b> Thus, Shivalker and Goel had to content themselves with a few unofficial test matches against Sri Lanka. Goel was specially unlucky, {{in the sense that he}} was originally selected to make his official Test Debut against WI at Delhi, in 1974–78. But a last minute change saw off spinner Venkat replacing him. Doshi, in that sense, can be considered to be the luckiest; at least he got the chance to represent India in full internationals. Nevertheless, he too lost the best years of his playing career waiting for his chance to come.|$|E
25|$|The Australian pace trio of Alderman, Lawson and Hughes looked set for {{the task}} and got the early break-throughs they required, Gooch trapped LBW by Lawson for 8, Gower, LBW by Alderman for 8, and Tavare caught at first slip by Mark Taylor off Alderman for 2 to leave England once again tettering at 47 for 3. Curtis who had reached 41 was next {{to go with the}} score on 75, and Barnett, out for 10, went soon after with the total unchanged. England were looking on the brink of an {{embarrassing}} first innings at 75 for 5 when veteran all-rounder Ian Botham, still not back to his best, came to the wicket. Although there was not <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of him repeating his match-winning heroics of the 1981 Ashes series, Botham was determined to help England avoid defeat. He and wicket-keeper Jack Russell put on 96 for the sixth wicket to stabilise England's innings. Botham was finally bowled by Merv Hughes for 46, and Jack Russell went soon after for 42, leaving England at 171 for 7, but Australia's hopes of an unlikely victory were fading. At the end of day four England finished 185 for 7, with John Emburey (2) and Angus Fraser (12) at the crease.|$|E

Just before his first race the 1500-metre freestyle, Djan accidentally cut his foot. He failed to qualify, swimming 34 seconds worse than his time at the U.S. Open. It was a huge blow and a shock to his Brazilian fans. The 4x200-metre freestyle relay was next, but the team's 200-metre results did not indicate <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of winning a medal. But Jorge Fernandes, Cyro Delgado and Marcus Mattioli all swam two seconds faster than they had in their individual events, and Djan finished like a champion, holding opponents and leading the team to Olympic podium, to win the bronze medal. They had swam 7:29.30, three seconds faster than the heats, and nine seconds faster than the previous South American record, set at the Pan American Games in San Juan. Their Moscow record stood for 12 years. Djan Madruga went on {{to qualify for the}} 400-metre freestyle final with the 3rd best time, narrowly coming 4th (3:54.15), 20 hundredths behind third placed.

25|$|Few, {{even in the}} Labour Party, gave Robinson <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> {{of winning}} the presidency, not least because of an {{internal}} party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former minister for Health, and hero to the left, Noel Browne. Browne was a household name for having done {{more than anybody else}} in Ireland for tackling Tuberculosis in the 1950s. However Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short lived Socialist Labour Party in 1977 after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left wing members within Labour such as Michael D. Higgins, he had little or no contact with Dick Spring and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for candidacy, in a contest where Labour never before contested, now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he could control Browne {{for the duration of the}} election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that Browne had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of the Irish Times newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's {{no way he could}} beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton set the record straight about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came out and said that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E

Both Bashō and Yoshitada gave themselves , or haikai pen names; Bashō's was , which was simply the on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of his adult name, [...] "". In 1662, the first extant poem by Bashō was published. In 1526, two of Bashō's hokku were printed in a compilation.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} August, the touring Australian team visited Taunton, {{attracting}} the largest crowd of the season, roughly 1,500 people. Somerset were not considered to have <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> in the match, though Australia were missing three of their better players. The Leeds Mercury offered Somerset faint praise, suggesting that they had [...] "no great cause to be dissatisfied with their performances." [...] The Australians batted first, and were restricted to 245 by Somerset. Alick Bannerman was the highest scorer for the tourists, with 50 runs, while Evans and Fothergill took three wickets each. In their response, Somerset's batsmen struggled against the bowling of Fred Spofforth, who {{was known as the}} [...] "Demon". Spofforth took nine wickets, while conceding only 51 runs, and Somerset were forced to follow-on; no batsman scored more than 17 runs in the first innings for the county. In the second-innings, Somerset performed slightly better; Newton scored 32 runs, and five other batsmen reached double figures. The Australian bowling once again proved too much though, and Somerset lost the match by an innings and 19 runs. The Western Daily Press praised the accurate bowling of both Spofforth and Harry Boyle during the match.|$|E
500|$|Neither empire {{was given}} <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> to recover, as {{within a few}} years they were struck by the onslaught of the Arabs, newly united by Islam, which Howard-Johnston likened to [...] "a human tsunami". According to George Liska, the [...] "unnecessarily {{prolonged}} ByzantinePersian conflict opened the way for Islam". The Sassanid Empire rapidly succumbed to these attacks and was completely destroyed. During the Byzantine–Arab Wars, the exhausted Byzantine Empire's recently regained eastern and southern provinces of Syria, Armenia, Egypt, and North Africa were also lost, reducing the empire to a territorial rump consisting of Anatolia and a scatter of islands and footholds in the Balkans and Italy. However, unlike Persia, the Byzantine Empire ultimately survived the Arab assault, holding onto its residual territories and decisively repulsing two Arab sieges of its capital in 674678 and 717718. The Byzantine Empire also lost its territories in Crete and southern Italy to the Arabs in later conflicts, though these too were ultimately recovered. However the Balearic Islands, Sardinia and Sicily were captured by Arabs and Corsica by Lombards by 8th century. Also, Visigoths captured Spania, Byzantine holdings in Spain, by 629.|$|E

500|$|The Leicester Chronicle {{felt that}} Darwen {{would have to}} [...] "play up" [...] to stand <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> against Small Heath, who had [...] "a smarter set of {{forwards}} than can be found amongst most of the first division teams", and pointed out that Small Heath were the only team in either division to have scored 100 goals during the season. The players prepared for the test match at Droitwich Spa, where the saturated salt water of the Brine Baths provided relief for tired muscles. The match, played at Stoke's Victoria Ground, was an exciting one. Darwen had much {{the best of the}} first half, but failed to take their chances. Small Heath were restricted to rare attacks, but were dangerous on the break, and opened the scoring through Jack Hallam. Darwen equalised before the interval, and continued their dominance until superior fitness told. With six minutes left, Small Heath took the lead, the goal variously attributed to Wheldon or an Orr own goal, after which Darwen lost heart and Tommy Hands scored again four minutes later. The Daily Post suggested that [...] "one would scarcely believe that they were the same five forwards who have so often delighted the spectators with their play at Coventry Road", but [...] "to every man [...] great praise is due for so ably checking the opposing forwards". The Nottinghamshire Guardian was less critical of the forwards, but took the view that Small Heath were fortunate to catch Darwen [...] "in a very crippled condition", and that goalkeeper Chris Charsley had done the club a considerable service in making himself available for such a vital game.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 2000s Pryce starred {{and participated in}} a variety of movies, such as The Affair of the Necklace (2001), Unconditional Love (2002), What a Girl Wants (2003), and Terry Gilliam's aborted project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. While the success of some of these films was variable, the 2001 London stage {{production}} of My Fair Lady and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers. This production turned out to be very stressful for Pryce because Martine McCutcheon, who portrayed Eliza Doolittle, was sick during much of the show's run. McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay, who would also fall sick hours before a performance, forcing her understudy, Kerry Ellis, to take the lead. Pryce was understandably upset and on her first night introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying [...] "This will be your first Eliza, my second today and my third this week. Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door. Wednesday and Saturday matinee available." [...] Pryce ended up dealing with four Elizas during the course of 14 months. Despite the difficulty, the show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001: Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon, Outstanding Musical Production, Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce. Pryce lost to Philip Quast, although ironically McCutcheon won in her category having played fewer performances than any of her understudies. Pryce did express interest in doing My Fair Lady in New York, but when asked if he would do it with McCutcheon he said that [...] "there's as <b>much</b> <b>chance</b> of me getting a date with Julia Roberts as doing My Fair Lady in New York with Martine McCutcheon." ...|$|E
