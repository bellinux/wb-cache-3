5000|$|With a {{land area}} of 24.87 km2, the {{population}} density in the Town of Peace River averages 253.9 /km2 /sq mi [...] compared to Grimshaw's 352.1 /km2 /sq mi and Manning's 436.1 /km2 /sq mi. The lower population density of Town of Peace River relative to surrounding communities is attributable, {{in part to}} the rugged terrain in the river valley. The town’s 2010 <b>Municipal</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Plan</b> indicates that 14.50 km2 of the land base or 58.3% of the town’s total land area is developable and 8.36 km2 has actually been developed. The density based on developed land is 755.38 /km2 /sq mi. The existing land base just meets the 30 year requirement of residential development based on the 2006 Peace River Growth study that projected the population growing to 28,200 citizens. If future residential development occurs at higher than current densities and in more land-efficient manner, the town’s existing residential land supply should last even longer. Citadel Park Area Structure Plan for example is on a 0.14 km2 parcel of land with a projection to accommodate 1600 persons, for a density of 11510.80 /km2 /sq mi. Due to the topographic constraints of the valley as well as the need to protect the natural areas and agricultural lands, the town is committed to optimize the existing developable land base as indicated in the 2010 <b>Municipal</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Plan.</b> Not only does higher density development lead to efficient use of available land and of existing infrastructure, but it also supports public transit.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>municipal</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> from 1997, {{the city}} {{introduced}} a new concept of green bicycle routes, envisioned to be a coherent network of cycle routes that, to the extent possible, will be off-street routes through parks and other open green areas or, where this is not possible, to a limited extent along quiet streets with low traffic volumes. These routes are {{intended to be a}} supplement to the existing network centered around busy corridors with high volume vehicle traffic. In 2000 the city released a proposal for a network of 22 green bicycle routes with a total length of 110 km at a total estimated cost of 500 million DKK. As of 2012 around 40 km of network has been completed and the city is committed to completing the network in the coming years. The city hopes that the recreational and enhanced safety qualities of this network will attract certain groups of the population that currently use cars on trips to and from work, especially those with a 5-10 km commute. In 2001 Copenhagen formulated its first bicycle strategy with the publishing of [...] "Cycle policy 2002 - 2012" [...] as a way to prioritize cycling in city planning, signal its importance to the city, and to coordinate initiatives for improvements of cycling conditions. The city also vowed to use bicycle accounts to follow up on the goals set forth the cycle policy. [...] Among these goals were an increase in modal share from 34% to 40%, a 50% decrease serious injuries or death, as well as targets for safety, comfort, and speed, measured in the surveys for the bicycle account.|$|E

However, {{there have been several}} examples of land development having taken place in areas with poor geotechnical characteristics, and a number of illegal constructions have disrupted the natural geomorphological evolution of the area, thus creating potential hazards for people and property. The current Almada <b>Municipal</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Plan</b> has not taken adequate account of geological and geotechnical information. Therefore, the authors have undertaken a research project to develop a set of engineering geological maps, as part of a spatial geoscientific database, to be offered online to potential users. This database also includes thousands of results from in situ and laboratory tests. The information is integrated into the so-called GEO-ALMADA Information System (SIGEO-ALMADA). Manipulation and analysis of the information in this system has allowed the derivation of several engineering geological maps in digital format (scale 1 : 10, 000) that show geotechnical units, landslide susceptibility and erosion potential. Finally, an engineering geological zoning map was prepared, which shows the main geotechnical restrictions to urban development.

A review of feminist approaches in the South African context shows that awareness regarding women’s participation and empowerment is recognised at societal and political levels and led to the establishment of the South African Women’s Charter in 1994. This awareness at the local government level gave rise to the Local Government White Paper of 1998; the Municipal Structures Act (Act 117 of 1998); and the Municipal Systems Act (Act 32 of 2000). These legislative measures put emphasis on improved participation of women in ward committees and also ensured that women’s needs during <b>municipal</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> have to be taken into consideration.
