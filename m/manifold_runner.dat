5000|$|Engine {{choice was}} the KL-ZE 2.5 DOHC V6 making , a high-compression {{version of the}} KL-DE, or the KF-ZE 2.0 DOHC V6 making all of the K-series engines in the MX6 {{were based on the}} same engine block and {{included}} those found in the Ford Probe, Xedos 6, and MX-3 V6 models. The KLZE had about 40 more horsepower than the KLDE versions for a few reasons. Although the displacement was the same, the KLZE had more durations on the cams, higher compression due to a different shape of pistons, and the intake manifold was different on the ZE. The KL-ZE intake <b>manifold</b> <b>runners</b> were shorter and wider than the KL-DE manifold. Also, the heads on the KL-ZE were ported and shaped differently. Not only was the ZE higher in compression, {{but it was also a}} higher-revving engine. The only flaws in the KL-ZE design were the weaker valve springs on the intake valves. This is usually corrected by using the KL-DE springs, keepers, and retainers which are stronger.|$|R
5000|$|A 3.8 L V6 with split port {{cylinder}} heads {{was introduced in}} the 1996 Ford Windstar along with a variable length intake manifold and intake <b>manifold</b> <b>runner</b> control (IMRC) in the six shorter runners. This engine was rated at [...] at 5000 rpm and 230 lbft Nm of torque @ 3000 rpm. The upper intake manifold has a sticker denoting [...] "Split Port Induction" [...] located on the passenger side of the forward plenum.|$|E
50|$|The 1993 - 1998 4-valve engines {{featured}} {{cylinder heads}} with two intake ports per cylinder (split-port) and variable runner length intake manifolds with either vacuum or electrically activated intake <b>manifold</b> <b>runner</b> controls (IMRC) depending on application. The engine was revised for 1999 with new cylinder heads featuring tumble-style intake ports (one intake port feeding two intake valves), new camshaft profiles, and fixed runner-length intake manifolds. These changes {{resulted in more}} power, torque and a broader power-band {{when compared to the}} earlier 4-valve engines.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Ford added Intake <b>Manifold</b> <b>Runner</b> Control (IMRC) to the V6, {{increasing}} the engine's output to [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] of torque @ 2800 rpm. During {{the second half}} of the 2004 model year, the 3.8 L Essex was replaced with the 3.9 L OHV Essex V6. The 3.9 L had a slightly longer stroke but output for the engine remained identical to the outgoing 3.8 L. The 3.9 L Essex was used in the Mustang for only half a year before being replaced by the 4.0 L Cologne V6 for the 2005 model year.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 SAE International. In a {{turbocharged}} engine, {{preserving the}} maximum amount of exhaust pulse energy for turbine operation will result in improved low end torque and engine transient response. However, the exhaust flow entering the turbine is highly unsteady, and the presence of the turbine as a restriction in the exhaust flow results in a higher pressure at the cylinder exhaust ports and consequently poor scavenging. This leads to an increase in the amount of residual gas in the combustion chamber, compared to the naturally-aspirated equivalent, thereby increasing the tendency for engine knock. If the level of residual gas can be reduced and controlled, it should enable the engine to operate at a higher compression ratio, improving its thermal efficiency. This paper presents a method of turbocharger matching for reducing residual gas content in a turbocharged engine. The turbine is first scaled to a larger size as a preliminary step towards reducing back pressure and thus the residual gas concentration in-cylinder. However a larger turbine causes a torque deficit at low engine speeds. So in a following step, pulse separation is used. In optimal pulse separation, the gas exchange process in one cylinder is completely unimpeded by pressure pulses emanating from other cylinders, thereby preserving the exhaust pulse energy entering the turbine. A pulse-divided exhaust manifold enables this by isolating the <b>manifold</b> <b>runners</b> emanating from certain cylinder groups, even as far as the junction with the turbine housing. This combination of appropriate turbine sizing and pulse-divided exhaust manifold design is applied to a Proton 1. 6 -litre CamPro CFE turbocharged gasoline engine model. The use of a pulse-divided exhaust manifold allows the turbine to be increased in size by 2. 5 times (on a mass flow rate basis) while maintaining the same torque and power performance. As a consequence, lower back pressure and improved scavenging reduces the residual concentration by up to 43 %, while the brake specific fuel consumption improves by approx. 1 %, before any modification to the compression ratio is made...|$|R

50|$|Ford — Dual-Stage Intake (DSI), {{on their}} Duratec 2.5 and 3.0-litre V6s, {{and it was}} also found on the Yamaha V6 in the Taurus SHO. The Ford Modular V8 engines and the V6 Cologne use either the Intake <b>Manifold</b> <b>Runner</b> Control (IMRC) for four-valve engines, or the Charge Motion Control Valve (CMCV) for three-valve engines. The SVT edition (in North America) and ST170 edition (in Europe) of the Ford Focus added IMRC to the Ford Zetec engine. A system called Split Port Induction (SPI) was used on the 2.0L CVH I4 of the 1997-2002 Escort and 2000-2004 Focus, and the 3.8L Essex V6 of the 1996-2003 Windstar and 2001-2004 Mustang.|$|E
5000|$|The 3.4 L SHO V8 was {{introduced}} in the spring of 1996. It incorporated many of the traits of the SHO V6, including the aluminum cylinder heads and 4-valve per cylinder DOHC design, but differed with an aluminum rather than iron block and no variable length intake manifold. A chain is also used to time the camshafts to crankshaft instead of the belts that the SHO V6s used. The SHO V8 has a split port style intake valve setup. The primary valve is exposed all the time and has the fuel injector spraying on it, while the secondary valve is only exposed when the Intake <b>Manifold</b> <b>Runner</b> Control opens the secondary plates at 3400 rpm. These secondary valves are called [...] "secondaries" [...] by SHO enthusiasts. Power was similar too, at 235 hp (175 kW) and 230 lb·ft (312 N·m) of torque.|$|E
50|$|The Chrysler Slant-6 {{engine was}} a clean-sheet design, led by Willem Weertman, later Chrysler's chief engine designer. Its {{characteristic}} 30° inclination of cylinder block {{gives it a}} lower height overall engine package. This enabled vehicle stylists to lower hoodlines, and also made room for the water pump to be mounted with a lateral offset, significantly shortening the engine's overall length. The slanted cylinder block also provides space in the vehicle's engine bay for intake and exhaust <b>manifolds</b> with <b>runners</b> of longer and more nearly equal length compared to the rake- or log-style manifolds typical of other inline engines. The Slant-6 manifold configuration gives relatively even distribution of fuel mixture to all cylinders, and presents less flow restriction. This, in turn, provides for relatively good airflow through the engine despite the intake and exhaust ports being {{on the same side}} of the head rather than in a crossflow arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The {{injection}} {{blow molding}} machine {{is based on an}} extruder barrel and screw assembly which melts the polymer. The molten polymer is fed into a hot <b>runner</b> <b>manifold</b> where it is injected through nozzles into a heated cavity and core pin. The cavity mold forms the external shape and is clamped around a core rod which forms the internal shape of the preform. The preform consists of a fully formed bottle/jar neck with a thick tube of polymer attached, which will form the body. similar in appearance to a test tube with a threaded neck.|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 Dodge Dakota and Ram pickup trucks, Dodge Durango and Chrysler Aspen SUV's, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Jeep Commander {{came with}} a Corsair version of the FFV 4.7 L engine, with dual spark plugs per cylinder, a new slant / squish {{combustion}} system design, and 9.8:1 compression, raising power to [...] and 320 - 334 lbft Nm of torque. The 2008 4.7 also features other upgrades including a more aggressive camshaft profile, a 74mm throttle body, and an improved intake <b>manifold</b> with shorter <b>runners.</b> See Allpar's page on the latest 4.7 L.|$|R
50|$|In diesel engines, a {{mechanical}} injector system vaporizes the fuel {{directly into the}} combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber (as opposed to a Venturi jet in a carburetor, or a fuel injector in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake <b>manifold</b> or intake <b>runners</b> as in a petrol engine). This forced vaporisation means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher {{as there is no}} risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.|$|R
5000|$|The CLK55 AMG {{is powered}} by a hand-assembled 5.4-liter V8 engine. The {{hardware}} list includes super-stiff forged billet steel crankshaft, forged, weight-matched connecting rods and pistons, lightweight AMG-specific chain-driven single overhead camshafts V8 (one cam per cyl bank) with two intake and one exhaust valves per cylinder, as well as 8 coil packs and 16 spark plugs (two spark plugs per cyl). Its bore and stroke are 97mm x 92mm. The dual-resonance intake <b>manifold</b> with tuned <b>runners</b> helps create optimized torque and power outputs by taking advantage of two resonant frequencies to increase performance. The engine features a high compression ratio of 10.5:1. All of these advanced technologies help deliver a healthy [...] and 376 lbft Nm of torque.|$|R
50|$|In May 1998 a NEO {{head was}} fitted, which enabled {{the engine to}} be {{classified}} as a low emission vehicle (LEV) engine due to their lower fuel consumption and emission output. The NEO head featured solid lifters rather than hydraulic, revised camshafts, with on/off solenoid Variable VCT, used a hotter 82 °C thermostat, model-specific coil packs and a revised inlet <b>manifold</b> (the <b>runner</b> diameter is reduced from 50mm to 45mm to increase air velocity and low end torque) in particular the RB25DE NEO which had two inlets going into the inlet manifold. The combustion chamber of the head is smaller so GT-R spec connecting rods are used to compensate as well as model-specific pistons. The turbo received the larger OP6 turbine which some came with steel compressor and turbine wheels, where others had the nylon plastic compressor wheel and ceramic turbine wheel. Some also used an N1 type oil pump and had the oil pump drive collar on the crank revised to help cope with the breakage problems associated with fast, high revs.All in all they are quite a different engine {{in their own right}} - a culmination of 20 years of Nissan RB engine building rolled into one.|$|R
50|$|Cylinder heads {{have been}} revised to {{increase}} flow. Though the intake manifold {{has also been}} changed on all applications, it is however model specific. Dodge Ram, non-Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Chrysler Aspens, and non-HEV Dodge Durango utilize an active intake manifold with a short runner valve to optimize torque and horsepower. At lower engine rpm the valve is closed, resulting in improved low-end torque from the longer runners. At higher engine rpm the valve is opened, diverting the incoming air {{into the center of}} the <b>manifold.</b> The shorter <b>runners</b> results in improved horsepower. Passenger cars, Jeep vehicles, as well as HEV Chrysler Aspen and HEV Dodge Durango do not use this manifold; instead, these vehicles utilize a passive intake manifold, which does not have a short runner valve.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{passenger}} car engines have been “down-sized” for improved fuel consumption, resulting in high speeds to obtain good performance. Consumers, however, are demanding improved low-end torque for improved drivability. The target engine; a 4 valve per cylinder, 1. 6 L engine with two intake cam profiles and 2 intake runner lengths, was modeled and correlated with measured engine performance characteristics (power, torque, etc.); and pressure traces from combustion chamber, {{intake and exhaust}} manifolds to establish the confidence level in the model's prediction. The model was then optimised for low-end torque by manipulating exhaust <b>manifold</b> configuration, exhaust <b>runner</b> length, intake diameter and intake runner length. It {{was found that the}} original exhaust system is too short and gives uneven exhaust cross-charging among the cylinders. Simulation result indicated that a 2. 7 - 5. 6...|$|R
5000|$|Modern intake <b>manifolds</b> usually employ <b>runners,</b> {{individual}} tubes {{extending to}} each intake port on the cylinder head which emanate from a central volume or [...] "plenum" [...] beneath the carburetor. The {{purpose of the}} runner is {{to take advantage of}} the Helmholtz resonance property of air. Air flows at considerable speed through the open valve. When the valve closes, the air that has not yet entered the valve still has a lot of momentum and compresses against the valve, creating a pocket of high pressure. This high-pressure air begins to equalize with lower-pressure air in the manifold. Due to the air's inertia, the equalization will tend to oscillate: At first the air in the runner will be at a lower pressure than the manifold. The air in the manifold then tries to equalize back into the runner, and the oscillation repeats. This process occurs at the speed of sound, and in most manifolds travels up and down the runner many times before the valve opens again.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} to study about the {{development}} of variable intake manifold for sparkignition engine. Variable intake manifold is one of the methods in optimizing the performance of an engine. Some of manufacture have great interest on this system such as Volkswagen and Volvo companies. Further research was held by those companies. Each of them has different in design in order to race in technology of engine optimizing. This experiment was conducted by using flow bench that test on the flow rate of the new design intake manifold that has been fabricated. The test is on the intake manifold that is used by the 1600 cc engine. Two intake manifolds were tested in this experiment, the Proton Waja intake manifold and the custom intake manifold that has been fabricated. The result found that the length of runner does affect the flow rate that produced by the intake <b>manifold.</b> The long <b>runner</b> will give better flow rate on the earlier phase of engine speed while the shorter runner will give better flow rate on the top end of engine speed. That is the reason why the variable intake manifold is better intake manifold compared to the standard intake manifold because it can be switch for the suitable length of runner depends on the engine speed condition...|$|R
5000|$|The 4A-FE is {{different}} from the 4A-GE in terms of performance and power. Although both have the same displacement and are DOHC, they were optimized for different uses. The first obvious difference are the valves, the engine's intake and exhaust valves were placed 22.3° apart (compared to 50° in the G-Engines). The second is that it employed a [...] "slave cam system", the camshafts being geared together and driven off one camshaft's sprocket (both camshafts' sprockets on the G-Engine are rotated by the timing belt). Some of the less directly visible differences were poorly shaped ports in the earlier versions, a slow burning combustion chamber with heavily shrouded valves, less aggressive camshaft profiles, ports of a small cross sectional area, a very restrictive intake <b>manifold</b> with long <b>runners</b> joined to a small displacement plenum and other changes. Even though the valve angle is closer to what is considered in some racing circles to be ideal for power (approximately 25 degrees), its other design differences and the intake which is tuned for a primary harmonic resonance at low RPM means that it has about 10% less power compared to the 4A-GE engine. This engine design improves fuel efficiency and torque, but compromises power. Power rating varied from 100-105 hp in the US market. Late-model engines are rumored to make slightly greater power but still received a 105 hp rating.|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, {{the engine}} {{continued}} in production from 1982 up to April 2000 {{for use in}} the Sapphire Saloon and Sierra vehicles, and Courier pick-ups. Late in its production life it was fitted with Lucas controlled electronic fuel injection designed by SAMCOR (South African Motor Corporation - now Ford SA) in co-operation with the University of Pretoria's engineering department. This conversion resulted in a power increase from [...] to [...] of the standard 3.0 version, and [...] for the fuel injection version, plus a useful boost to fuel economy. Only about 1,600 of the EFI variants were produced during 1992 and 1993. In October 1997, the 3.0L was enlarged to 3.4L by boring the cylinders [...]040 of an inch or 1mm to 94.6mm and a new crankshaft with a stroke of 80.0mm giving a displacement of 3375cc, this was done for the engine to be better suited to 4x4 vehicles where torque is needed. The 3.4 version produced [...] and 260 Nm. All 3.4 variants used the 38DGAS Weber carburetor with 29 mm venturis. Production tooling at the factory was scrapped and sold in 2000, {{to make way for the}} production of a new four cylinder OHC engine, the remaining old stock of 3.4 L Engines started to be sold as assembled crate engines, these engines had some differences from the 2.5 3.0 and 3.1 L Dagenham built engines such as: Ford Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 forged connecting rods, German made pistons with moly coating, [...]250" [...] smaller crank journals which reduced bearing speed, more aggressive camshaft timing and higher lift,larger 43mm inlet valves, shaft mounted rockers from Ford's Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 engine, unique cylinder head castings with extra oil galleries, solid pushrods with no oiling holes, unique exhaust manifold bolt pattern due to the head castings also being unique to the 3.4 litre engine and an improved inlet <b>manifold</b> with larger <b>runners</b> and an improved plenum chamber. From 1966 to 1998, the 3.0L was also used in industrial applications such as generator plants, airport vehicles, milk vans, jet boats (Hamilton jet) and even river barges.|$|R
