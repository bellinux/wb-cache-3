(Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.)

After a voting row, the Senate rejected on 2 June DNA request of retention and preventive arrest of Șova, being registered 66 votes [...] "for" [...] and 72 [...] "against".

Five types of programs, focusing on the oreparation of teachers, are examined, including: (1) the classroom techer with foreign language training, (2) the team teacher with foreign language training, (3) classroom exchange for foreign language instruction, (a) the itinerant specialist, and (5) lesson presentation by television.

While a considerable amount of research has been carried out studying theses critical elements to be used on the interior space of the buildings, BIM has not been exploited so far in order to enhance the accuracy of work.
