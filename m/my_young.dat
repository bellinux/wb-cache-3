5|$|The Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress is {{an award}} {{presented}} annually at the Hong Kong Film Awards (HKFA). It {{is given to}} honour an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a Hong Kong film. The 1st Hong Kong Film Awards ceremony was held in 1982, with no formal nomination procedure established; the award was given to Kara Hui {{for her role in}} <b>My</b> <b>Young</b> Auntie. After the first award ceremony, a nomination system was put in place whereby no more than five nominations are made for each category and each entry is selected through two rounds of voting. Firstly, prospective nominees are marked with a weight of 50% each from HKFA voters and a hundred professional adjudicators, contributing towards a final score with which the top five nominees advance to the second round of voting. The winner is then selected via a scoring process where 55% of the vote comes from 55 professional adjudicators, 25% from representatives of the Hong Kong Performing Artistes Guild and 20% from all other HKFA Executive Committee Members.|$|E
25|$|I {{arranged}} {{meetings with}} <b>my</b> <b>young</b> friends, {{some of whom}} were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.|$|E

25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few {{women and children who}} told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, <b>my</b> <b>young</b> wife, and my three small children were among the slain.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep <b>my</b> <b>young</b> men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E
500|$|In November 1957 Britten {{moved to}} The Red House, Aldeburgh, but {{continued}} {{to work on the}} opera throughout the upheaval. According to a letter he wrote to Edith Sitwell on 14 December, [...] "the final bars of the opera [...] punctuated by hammer-blows" [...] from workmen busy at the Red House. Before he finished the composition draft, Britten wrote to the baritone Owen Brannigan, who had sung in several previous Britten operas, asking if he would take the title role. Britten completed the full score of the opera in March 1958, which he dedicated [...] "To my nephew and nieces, Sebastian, Sally and Roguey Welford, and <b>my</b> <b>young</b> friend Ronald Duncan [...] ".|$|E

500|$|When we now {{heard many}} {{disputes}} about the inheritance, I brought King Æthelwulf's will to our assembly at Langandene, {{and it was}} read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me– and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against {{any one of them}} because they declared what was right– that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated <b>my</b> <b>young</b> kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And then they all pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. [...] "Now everything has come into your possession, and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crichton {{traveled}} to Junction, Texas, {{during the campaign}} to meet with former Democratic Governor Coke Stevenson, the official loser by eighty-seven votes in the 1948 runoff primary for the U.S. Senate against Lyndon Johnson. Stevenson had supported John Tower in the 1960 senatorial general election against Johnson and was backing Goldwater in 1964 {{as well in the}} presidential contest. Stevenson told Crichton that the election [...] "is an important part of American history, for it got Lyndon to the Senate, which he later controlled, and was a stepping stone to his becoming President. As for me, I was depressed for quite a while, but in retrospect it has allowed me to enjoy my ranch and <b>my</b> <b>young</b> daughter. With that, we had another bourbon and branch water, and I thanked him and departed." ...|$|E

Merezhkovsky's new drama Sylvio was published there, the translation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven followed suit. Other journals became interested in the young author too: Russkaya Mysl published his poem Vera (later included in his The Symbols compilation), hailed as one of the Russian Symbolism's early [...] masterpieces, its colourful mysticism providing a healthy antidote to narodniks's [...] "reflections" [...] of the social life. Bryusov [...] "absolutely fell in love with it," [...] and Pyotr Pertsov years later admitted: [...] "For <b>my</b> <b>young</b> mind Merezhkovsky's Vera sounded so much superior to this dull and old-fashioned Pushkin".|$|E
