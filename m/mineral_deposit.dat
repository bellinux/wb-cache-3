5|$|Marble is {{the most}} {{significant}} <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> of Romblon and {{is the most}} renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{different}} crystal structure, calcium carbonate can be mainly divided into three morphology of minerals, calcite, aragonite and vaterite (Wehrmeister et al. 2010). Even though confocal laser reflection achieve the observation {{of the distinction between}} <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> and biofilms, the detailed mineralogy composition of the deposits could not be determined. We developed a combined method of confocal laser scanning microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy to delineate the morphology and identify the composition of the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> The mineralogy of biomineralization products is calcite by spectra analysis of <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> with confocal Raman spectroscopy. The spectra of calcite was distinct between aragonite by identifying Raman shift yielded by lattice vibration. The simultaneous obtainment of fluorescence (biomass) images and reflection signal (<b>mineral</b> <b>deposits)</b> makes it realize for a real time, in situ and nondestructive observation on the processes of biomineralization and <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> producing.|$|R
30|$|Using {{confocal}} microscopy, three dimensional real-time {{observation of}} calcium carbonate biomineralization in biofilms (PAO 1 -gfp) were achieved.

25|$|Sub-surface mining {{consists}} of digging tunnels or shafts {{into the earth}} to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified {{by the type of}} access shafts used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit.</b> Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts. Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques.|$|E
25|$|To {{gain access}} to the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> within an area it is often {{necessary}} to mine through or remove waste material which is not of immediate interest to the miner. The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process. Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine, depending on the nature and location of the ore body. Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator, so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms {{an essential part of the}} geological exploration program for a mining operation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his official duties, Gass continued his prospecting efforts. [...] One such endeavour involved a tin deposit in the Temescal Mountains. [...] At the time, the United States imported all its tin, making a tin mine a very lucrative possibility. [...] Gass joined with Slaughter, David Sexton, and several other investors {{in an attempt to}} purchase the Rancho Temescal (Serrano), on which the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> resided, but found that Abel Stearns [...] had already bought the ranch. [...] A scramble for land and mineral rights soon developed as word of the find spread. [...] Gass ended up with several valid claims but the 1860 United States Presidential Election and approach of the American Civil War dried up investor interest. [...] Hopes for riches from the tin deposit soon faded as legal challenges tied up his interests for the next two decades.|$|E

2500|$|Pebble Mine [...] is {{the common}} name of a mineral {{exploration}} project investigating a very large porphyry copper, gold, and molybdenum <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> in the Bristol Bay region of Southwest Alaska, near Lake Iliamna and Lake Clark. The proposal to mine the ore deposit, using large-scale operations and infrastructure, is controversial. Proponents argue that the mine will create jobs, provide tax revenue {{to the state of}} Alaska, and reduce American dependence on foreign sources of raw materials. Opponents argue that the mine would adversely affect the entire Bristol Bay watershed; and that the possible consequences to fish populations, when mining effluents escape planned containments, are simply too great of a risk. Much of this debate concerns the tentative plan to impound large amounts of water, waste rock, and mine tailings behind several earthen dams at the mine site.
