40|$|The {{curing process}} of {{prosthetic}} socket <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> requires attention owing {{to a series}} of associated problems that are yet to be addressed and solved. However, to date, few relevant studies have been reported. In this paper, nanodiamonds modified with a silane coupling agent were dispersed into a prosthetic socket <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> and the performance of the modified <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> was investigated. Adding a predetermined amount of nanodiamonds to the prosthetic socket <b>base</b> <b>material</b> increased the glass transition temperature, improved the mechanical properties of the cured <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> and reduced the influence of the volatile gas formed during the curing process on the environment. With increasing nanodiamond contents, the glass transition temperature increased and the mechanical properties improved slightly. Owing to the high thermal conductivity of the nanodiamonds, the localized heat, {{as a result of the}} curing process, could be dissipated and released. Thus, adding nanodiamonds led to a more uniform temperature field forming in the curing system. This improved the curing process and reduced the formation of volatile monomers, thereby decreasing the adverse impact of the generated volatile gases on the environment. All of these provide a potential strategy for modifying prosthetic socket <b>base</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

As mechanical properties, tensile and impact strength of friction-stir-welded polyamide sheets are studied under varying processing parameters. Results show that welding strength increases when rotational speed increases. However, further increases in rotational speed (higher than 1570  rpm) will decrease the welding strength. Regarding the traverse speed, it is concluded that welding strength decreases when the traverse speed increases. The maximum tensile strength of the welded samples was obtained about 8.51  MPa. Since the tensile strength of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> is 15.57  MPa, the maximum relative strength of the joint was concluded approximately 55  % {{in comparison with the}} <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> Impact strength of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> was also obtained 36.6  kJ/m 2, while at the optimum conditions, the maximum amount of impact strength was achieved about 10.8  kJ/m 2.

Our model is based on the plastic frictional behaviour of cement <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> and integrates the physical mechanisms that govern material extrusion flow and extrusion force increase. When the process starts, a pressure gradient is created in the extruder due to wall friction of the paste which is submitted to plug flow. It induces a consolidation of the material. As a result, a large increase of extrusion force appears. A Coulomb law is used to model cement <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> which is considered as consolidating granular media.
