5|$|It had 24-step {{programming}} abilities, which <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> {{was highly}} limited for many purposes. It also lacked functions {{for the natural}} logarithm and exponential function. Constants used in programs were required to be integers, and the programming was wasteful, with start and end quotes needed to use a constant in a program.|$|E
5|$|Mallet {{traveled}} to Stockholm on 4 April {{where he met}} with Erik Boheman, the Swedish State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. During the meeting he presented the proposals for British reconnaissance flights and for the transport collaboration. The Swedish government rejected the former but accepted the latter. However, privately Boheman indicated that Sweden's air force would not pursue Allied planes in their airspace, and also that limitations of the transport collaboration <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> would have little benefit for the British.|$|E
50|$|Est.: Yes, she replied; but <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{more than}} <b>it</b> said. <b>It</b> <b>meant,</b> when <b>it</b> was given, that whoever had this house, could want nothing else. They {{must have been}} easily {{satisfied}} in those days, I should think.|$|R

5|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} the 87th season of {{competitive}} association football and fifth {{season in the}} Football Conference played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their 14th-place finish in 2007–08 <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was their fifth successive season in the Conference Premier. The season covers the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009.|$|E
5|$|The 2013–14 {{season was}} the 92nd season of {{competitive}} association football and 77th {{season in the}} Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England.

5|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} the 93rd season of {{competitive}} association football and 78th {{season in the}} Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their seventh-place finish in 2013–14 and loss to Fleetwood Town in the play-offs <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was their third successive season in League Two. The season ran from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with The Huffington Post, Melissa Rivers cited Courtney Love's public {{tribute to her}} mother as her favorite, adding: [...] "I loved seeing that outpouring from these women, especially the ones who took the heat on Fashion Police, because <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> they got <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>meant</b> they loved her. <b>It</b> <b>meant</b> they saw the humor." ...|$|R

2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that the differences}} between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde's works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily—race and sexuality. In Ada Gay Griffin and Michelle Parkerson's documentary A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde, Lorde says, [...] "Let me tell you first {{about what it was}} like being a Black woman poet in the '60s, from jump. <b>It</b> <b>meant</b> being invisible. <b>It</b> <b>meant</b> being really invisible. <b>It</b> <b>meant</b> being doubly invisible as a Black feminist woman and <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> being triply invisible as a Black lesbian and feminist".|$|R
5|$|The 2015–16 {{season was}} the 94th season of {{competitive}} association football and 79th {{season in the}} Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England.

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|Uxbridge {{had its own}} {{parliamentary}} constituency until boundary {{changes at}} the 2010 general election <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> {{became part of the}} Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. Uxbridge and South Ruislip is represented by Boris Johnson MP, of the Conservative Party. He took over from John Randall in 2015, who was first elected to represent Uxbridge in a 1997 by-election after the sitting MP, Sir Michael Shersby, died shortly after the 1997 general election.|$|E
60|$|Although {{her gown}} was purple, {{there was a}} little black crape bow upon each arm. He knew what <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> and <b>it</b> saddened him. 'Do you ever visit your mother's grave?' he asked.|$|R
60|$|Liffie said nothing, but if {{the widest}} {{extension}} of her lips, and the exposing of her bright little teeth from ear to ear, <b>meant</b> anything, <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that her sympathies were entirely with Kate.|$|R
50|$|For the {{software}} industry, {{the effect was}} profound. First, <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> was rational to write for the IBM PC and its clones as a high priority, and port versions for less common systems at leisure.|$|R
5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1990, lbut a decade-long hiatus between the mid-1990s and 2004 caused by funding {{issues and the}} setting up of a separate company to develop and operate the motorway <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was not completed until 2007. As of July 2011, the entire motorway route is completed, consisting of a dual-carriageway and four traffic lanes, except for a relatively short segment which is still a single carriageway road. The motorway is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was directly in the war zone itself. With Southampton being attacked, the halls of residence were also under siege: at South Stoneham windows were blown in by bombs. The School of Navigation at the College was relocated to the communal rooms of South Stoneham House {{for the duration of}} the war, and afterwards was moved to Warsash; in 1970 the school became independent of the University (instead it is affiliated to Southampton Solent University) and is known as the Warsash Maritime Academy.|$|E
50|$|It {{was later}} {{announced}} that 43 players {{had been cut}} from the professional clubs. For the Glasgow side <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> lost about half its squad {{to make way for}} around half of the Caledonia squad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Victrix causa deae--" [...] said Michael gloomily; {{and this}} angered her more, as, {{not knowing what}} <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> she {{imagined}} <b>it</b> to be witty.|$|R
60|$|Hitherto, I {{had kept}} my arm in his. I drew it out now. If his reply <b>meant</b> anything, <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{that he had}} once thought me capable of {{breaking}} faith with him. He saw that I was hurt.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} rounds, Garcia {{steadily}} pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was {{in serious trouble}} in rounds 5 and 6, then finally {{went down in the}} 8th. From there, things took a surprising turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, though his deficit from earlier in the fight <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> wasn't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the high ground {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the high ground at Koepel. The delay in England <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was 17:00 before the brigade started moving. With {{the element of surprise}} gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left. Bringing up the rear was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, the 26th Battalion was {{withdrawn}} to Australia {{on board the}} transport Taroona, and after leave reconstituted at Strathpine, Queensland, and began training for further operations. Gazetted as an AIF unit, which <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> could be deployed outside Australian territory, during December 1944 the battalion deployed to Bougainville as Australian troops from the 3rd Division relieved American forces around Torokina. The Australians subsequently launched three drives on the island in the northern, southern and central areas. Initially, the 26th Battalion was committed to the fighting in the central sector of the island conducting patrolling operations around Numa Numa before being withdrawn to Torokina {{at the end of}} January 1945. In February that year, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Callinan assumed command, taking over from Abbott.|$|E
60|$|The Major decided, {{after some}} consideration, that <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> mantraps; that <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{plotting}} and snaring; that Miss Tox was digging pitfalls. 'But you won't catch Joe, Ma'am,' said the Major. 'He's tough, Ma'am, tough, is J.B. Tough, and de-vilish sly!' over which reflection he chuckled {{for the rest}} of the day.|$|R
25|$|Tereshkova {{was invited}} to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's {{residence}} in Novo-Ogaryovo for the celebration of her 70th birthday. While there {{she said that she}} would like to fly to Mars, even if <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> was a one-way trip.|$|R

5|$|JFK was {{released}} in theaters on December 20, 1991. In its first week of release, JFK tied with Beauty and the Beast for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began {{to say it was}} a flop. Warner Brothers executives argued that this was at least partly because the film's long running time <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> had had fewer screenings than other films. Box office picked up momentum, however, in part due to a $15 million marketing campaign from the studio. By the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide, eventually earning over $200 million worldwide and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.|$|E
5|$|North Korea's lack {{of large}} airstrips and {{aircraft}} <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost {{no role in}} North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam {{could be used for}} the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
25|$|The car proved {{popular in}} the UK market, where its three-wheel {{configuration}} <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> qualified for a lower rate of purchase tax, lower vehicle excise duty and cheaper insurance than comparable four-wheel cars. The three-wheel configuration, low weight and lack of a reverse gear also <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> could be driven on a motor cycle licence.|$|R
50|$|Darbishire {{once said}} {{of that first}} meeting;"...a few gentlemen of {{intelligence}} and earnestness met in a small dusty room in King Street. The speeches were short, but there was the right ring in what was said; <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> work; <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> success."Little {{is known about the}} fundraising process other than it began with a city wide distribution of flyers. By 1876 they had managed to raise £2000 and the Board decided that this was sufficient for work to begin.|$|R
6000|$|If this <b>meant</b> anything, <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{that she}} was {{actually}} going to marry Herbert Linley again. This was too ridiculous. [...] "If it's a joke," [...] I said, [...] "I have heard better fun in my time. If it's only an assertion, I don't believe it." ...|$|R
