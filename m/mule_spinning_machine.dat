50|$|The Mill had 24 bays for <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>machines,</b> large paned {{windows were}} {{installed}} for {{light and the}} mill was innovatively designed and constructed using fireproof materials; floors made from reinforced concrete, supported with interior cast-iron columns and rolled steel beams".|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of automatic machinery, there was little difficulty in attaining a straight fibre, as long wool was always used, and the sliver was made up by hand, using combs. The introduction of Richard Arkwright's water frame in 1771, and the later introduction of cap and <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>machines,</b> required perfectly prepared slivers. Many manufactories used one or more preparatory combing machines (called gill-boxes) before worsting, to ensure straight fibres and to distribute the lubricant evenly.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the first}} and second floors {{originally}} housed thirty-four Arkwright water frames which spun 4236 ends simultaneously. This meant that 4236 rovings were continuously twisted together to become threads that were collected on small bobbins. Later <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>machines</b> were introduced to produce finer thread types which were in demand. The bobbins were sent to the fifth floor.On the fifth floor, reeling frames wound the spun thread into 'skeins' ready for dyeing at a factory in Milford. Doubling frames twisted two or more single spun thread together to make thicker and stronger thread. The amount of twist imparted determined the thread's properties.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Crompton (3 December 1753 [...] - [...] 26 June 1827) was an English {{inventor}} and {{pioneer of}} the spinning industry. Building {{on the work}} of James Hargreaves and Richard Arkwright he invented the <b>spinning</b> <b>mule,</b> a <b>machine</b> that revolutionised the industry worldwide.|$|R
25|$|The <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> <b>spins</b> {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an {{intermittent}} process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|R

50|$|It was {{designed}} as a double mill by P.S.Stott, in 1904. The first mill was built then and the second mill in 1915. It worked as a <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> mill.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> the roving {{is pulled}} off a bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several {{different}} speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause {{a break in the}} yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a [...] "cop", as the carriage returns. <b>Mule</b> <b>spinning</b> produces a finer thread than the less skilled ring spinning.|$|R
5000|$|Egbert Jannink {{set up his}} factory {{on another}} site in 1810. It {{expanded}} and moved to this site in the Roombek neighbourhood, next to the stream in 1900. The fireproof mill was designed and built by Sidney Stott. There were 70 fireproof textile mills were constructed in Twente between 1880 and 1914. Sidney the Oldham architect, not to be confursed with his cousins Stott and Sons was a millwright who cooperated with most advanced textile machine manufacturers: the mill was handed over complete with power source, line shafting and all the <b>spinning</b> <b>machines</b> needed to <b>spin</b> cotton. The building was modelled on similar double-mills in Lancashire. A central tower housed the engine and the water tank for the sprinkers, either side were the three storey mills with the large uninterrupted floors needed for <b>mule</b> <b>spinning.</b> The height of the chimney was determined by up-draught needed by the boilers. The factory operated until 1967. It is a Rijksmonument (listed building) The building was refurbished from 1975. [...] The Jannink museum moved into the ground floor in 1980, other floors were converted into housing.|$|R

All in preparation forspinning cotton equipment are aspects of automation, robotics and aggregatisation which led to increased qualityof products and increasing labor productivity. This paper is a continuation of other works in which we presentedthe preparation of <b>spinning</b> <b>machines.</b> We present only this time <b>spinning</b> <b>machines,</b> namely the modernization ofroving frame and ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> was {{gradually}} replaced in the British cotton industry with ring spinning as improvements in technology {{allowed it to}} process finer grades of cotton. The size of the British textile industry also declined dramatically during this period due {{to a decline in}} demand and competition from foreign industry. This process was accelerated dramatically by the Cotton Industry Act 1959 which encouraged Lancashire cotton producers to rationalise by replacing or retiring older <b>machines,</b> primarily <b>spinning</b> <b>mules.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{strength}} parameters of cotton yarns formed on the Rieter R 1 <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> {{and on the}} Textima ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> were analysed. For the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> the influence of linear density of the feeding sliver and of yarns on their specific strength, elongation and elasticity was evaluated. For the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> the following parameters were used: ■ rotational speed of the rotor- 100, 000 r/min (1666. 7 r/s) ■ rotational speed of the opening roller- 7, 000 r/min (116. 7 r/s) ■ linear density of yarns: 18, 20, 25, 30 tex. The <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> was fed with slivers after the second passage of drawing with the linear densi-ties: 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0 ktex. On the ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> yarns of linear densities of 25 and 40 tex were formed from the roving 400 tex. Analysis of the results for rotor-spun and ring-spun yarns showed that rotor-spun yarns are characterised by higher elasticity, which makes them a very good material for knitting purposes.

5000|$|The <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> or {{mule jenny}} {{was created in}} 1779 by Samuel Crompton. It was a {{combination}} of Arkwright's water frame and Hargreaves' spinning jenny. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process: On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the return traverse, the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the throstle frame or ring frame was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn twisted and wrapped in one action. The <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} who can successfully compete has been reduced, as the technical {{complexity of the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>machines</b> has increased. However, there are many competent companies serving the global market for <b>spinning</b> <b>machines</b> who continue to pursue innovative ways to increase spinning productivity and yarn quality.|$|R
50|$|Ellenroad Mill was {{a cotton}} {{spinning}} mill in Newhey, Milnrow, Rochdale in England. It was {{built as a}} <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> mill in 1890 by Stott and Sons and extended in 1899. It was destroyed by fire on 19 Jan 1916. When it was rebuilt, it was designed and equipped as a ring spinning mill.|$|R

50|$|The Roberts {{was made}} {{at a time when}} the power loom {{industry}} was set to expand. Until this moment, hand looms were more common than power looms. The reliable Roberts loom was quickly adopted and again it was the spinning side that was short of capacity. Roberts then addressed this, with the construction of a self-acting (automatic) <b>spinning</b> <b>mule.</b> Essentially, textile production was no longer a skilled craft but an industrial process that could be manned by semi-skilled labour. <b>Mule</b> <b>spinning</b> became the mans occupation, and weaving a girls occupation.|$|R

The foundations were faulty and the mill collapsed on 18 October 1895. There were 22 men killed.|$|R

50|$|Samuel Crompton's <b>Spinning</b> <b>Mule,</b> {{introduced}} in 1779, {{was a combination}} of the spinning jenny and the water frame in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating. Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost. <b>Mule</b> <b>spun</b> thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive cloth in large quantities.|$|R
