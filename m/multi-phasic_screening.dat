40|$|Multiphasic {{screening}} {{has been}} suggested as one method of controlling access to the medical care system. The suggestion was probably {{based on the assumption}} that screening can identify most of the problems that would be found by the physician. Our study was designed to compare the apparent problems identified by screening with those found on clinical evaluation. Forty-seven persons seeking employment were examined independently by both methods. Only 17 % of the conditions were identified in common by both screening and clinical evaluation. Twenty-six percent of the conditions were found by clinical evaluation alone and 57 % by screening alone. The study was replicated in a small group of clinic patients, with similar results. The two methods of patient evaluation appear to supplement each other rather than substitute for each other. GARFIELD (1, 2) has recently suggested that <b>multi-phasic</b> <b>screening</b> be used to regulate access to the medical care system, thereby preventing the inunda-tion of physicians by "well " and "well but worried" patients. This suggestion appears to be {{based on the assumption that}} screening can identify most, if not all, of the problems that would be found by the physician. The studies reported here were designed to test this assumption and to compare the yields of these two methods of patient evaluation...|$|E
40|$|CDATA[Background: The {{visualization}} of independent {{adverse health effects}} of chewing tobacco and areca nut compounds rather than “smokeless tobacco” were intended to study among chewing tobacco industry workers. The present study conducted to estimate the prevalence {{and the strength of}} association with premalignant lesions with regards to duration and frequency of consumption. Methods: A cross-sectional camp approach with <b>multi-phasic</b> <b>screening</b> of the 1414 workers was adopted in the study. Structured close ended questionnaire was used to gather the Socio-demographic and eating habits of various forms of tobacco and areca nut compounds. Clinical screening by oral examination was followed by staining with iodine and acetic acid (decolourizing agent) for diagnosis of premalignant oral lesions. Mean percentage proportion and chi square test of significance were used for data analysis. Results: Among total chewing study population, tobacco chewers (67. 01 %) were approximately twice of the Areca nut chewers (32. 99 %). The association between Areca nut chewers, tobacco chewers and non chewers with respect to development of oral lesion was highly significant. The areca nut chewers (3. 28 %) outnumbered the Tobacco chewers (2. 69 %) in age group of less than 25 years. 86. 88 % of oral lesions were due to Arecanut related compounds with in duration of 10 years and frequency of 5 times, which is greater than due to tobacco chewing (54. 31 %) Conclusion: Areca nut compounds have the potential like tobacco in producing oral lesions, with the most adverse effect among the young generation which is consuming Gutka (areca nut compound). Periodical Oral health examination and behaviour change communication strategies to sensitize these individuals {{plays a key role in}} refraining them from these “Flavored addictive carcinogens”. ]]...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 82) The {{purpose of}} this project is to define and demonstrate a method of providing health resources to a defined community, while educating providers of health care to the health needs and desires of the population. This paper discusses the phases of planning, development, and implementation of a campus-sponsored health fair. Analysis is made concerning planned events versus events that actually occured. Also, supporting exhibit material is provided {{to assist in the}} planning of future health fairs. The overall goal of the Health Fair was to establish rapport and goodwill in the community toward the campus and the health-care sector, while offering complete <b>multi-phasic</b> health <b>screening</b> at no cost. There were ten specific objectives: 1. To plan, organize, and implement the Health Fair at a cost not to exceed 2000 for administrative expenses. 2. To obtain at least thirty volunteers from the campus and community to staff designated committees. 3. To obtain the best possible site on campus in order to attract at least five-thousand people to the Health Fair. 4. To plot areas and assign spaces for exhibitors and screeners in order to obtain the best possible utilization of each provider. 5. To medically screen three-thousand people from a seven mile radius catchment area. 6. To arrange for appropriate medical follow-up and referral by each screening service. 7. To distribute a referral resource list to at least 80...|$|R
