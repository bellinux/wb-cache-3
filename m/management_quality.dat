25|$|In the 1780s {{there was}} fresh concern over security, quality and economy of supply. The deputy {{comptroller}} of the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich, Major, later Lieutenant General, Sir William Congreve advocated that the Waltham Abbey Mills should be {{purchased by the}} Crown to ensure secure supplies and to establish what would now be called a centre of excellence for development of manufacturing processes and to establish quality and cost standards by which private contractors could be judged. In October 1787 the Crown purchased the mills from John Walton for £10,000, starting a 204-year ownership. Congreve {{was a man of}} immense drive and vision, a pioneer of careful <b>management,</b> <b>quality</b> control and the application of the scientific method. Under his regime manufacture moved from what had been a black art to, in the context of its day, an advanced technology.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} in companies is <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> {{and its relationship to}} firm performance. Recently a growing interest in research is the important role of the business environment in the competitive strategy choices of companies. By proposing a conceptual framework for a general model that explains the <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> practices-firm performance link and the business environment-firm performance link, we test the moderating role of competitive strategy in the two links empirically. A survey was conducted of 229 pork-processing firms in the emerging economy of China. We find that specific <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> practices contributing to higher performance include in-company <b>quality</b> <b>management,</b> supplier <b>quality</b> <b>management,</b> employee involvement in <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> and process <b>management,</b> while <b>quality</b> design and customer <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> are not included. Findings also indicate that the business environment (government support in our research) has a positive relationship to firm performance. Competitive strategy only strengthens the relationship between firm performance and <b>quality</b> design, process <b>management,</b> supplier <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> and customer <b>quality</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between the practices of soft <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> and hard <b>quality</b> <b>management,</b> and to investigate the direct and indirect effects of soft and hard <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> on firm performance. The paper proposes several hypotheses relating to the relationship between soft <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> factors, hard <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> and performance. To test these hypotheses, the paper uses a sample of 255 electrical and electronics firms from Malaysia as the data source, and structural equation modeling (SEM) as the statistical tool. The findings show that soft <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> factors have a positive influence on hard quality management; hard <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> has a direct effect on performance and soft <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> factors have direct and indirect effects on performance. Consequently, hard <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> acts as a mediating variable between soft <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> factors and performance...|$|R

The study starts with a literature review of school-based <b>management</b> and <b>quality</b> <b>management,</b> including the development, concepts, features, the perception and relatedness of school-based <b>management</b> and <b>quality</b> <b>management.</b> The second part deals with the research design and methodology, including a literature review of research methods, theoretical framework and diagrammatic model of the research, subject sampling method, instruments and procedure of data collection method and data analysis method for survey, interview and documentation. The third part is an analysis and interpretation of the results. The thesis ends by presenting conclusions, implications and recommendations arising from the study. The findings showed that all eight elements of school-based management are perceived as being implemented in Hong Kong primary schools. However, the extent of their implementation is different. The most adopted elements of school-based management are school policy, financial planning and control and leadership competence and work relationship. As for <b>quality</b> <b>management,</b> all four elements are perceived as being implemented in Hong Kong primary schools, but the degree of their implementation is not the same. The most frequently used elements of <b>quality</b> <b>management</b> are value and duties and systems and teams.
