5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E

25|$|It {{makes good}} sense, for example, to say of the {{extensive}} variable , or {{of the extensive}} variable , {{that it has a}} density per unit volume, or a quantity per unit mass of the system, but it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system. On the other hand, it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, {{which in turn is}} why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E
25|$|The path the Ottoman army took is not known. Kritoboulos {{states that}} Mehmed crossed the Taurus Mountains, {{becoming}} one of only four generals to have crossed them. (The others being Alexander the Great, Pompey, and Tamburlane.) However, as his translator Charles Riggs points out, to Kritoboulos all of the mountain systems of Asia Minor {{were part of the}} Taurus. Doukas states that Mehmed led his soldiers across Armenia and the Phasis River, then ascended the Caucasus Mountains before reaching Trebizond. This <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> when one examines a map, for both the Phasis River and the Caucasus are far to the east of their destination. However, Mihailović wrote in his memoirs that the army marched into Georgia, so it is possible that Mehmed did make a show of force to intimidate the kings of Georgia from aiding their ally. Or this is further proof that the soldiers in the Sultan's army had as little idea where they were going as the hairs in the Sultan's beard.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b> For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{described}} {{the story as}} [...] "a thinly-disguised remake of Cigars of the Pharaoh", an Adventure of Tintin which had been first serialised in 1934.

[...] They also opined that artistically, the story represented [...] "a turning point in Hergé's career", {{because he had to}} switch to a daily format in , although {{as a result of this}} they felt that the final third of the story [...] "seems rushed".

500|$|In {{support of}} this theory, Rohrbacher {{provides}} an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus' work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II's attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: [...] "si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret" [...] ("For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint"). There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the Life of Caracalla (5.7), which <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> in Caracalla's time, and is worded in {{almost exactly the same}} way: [...] "qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent" [...] ("wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever").|$|E
500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting {{to say one}} thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E

500|$|Tresham {{has long}} been {{suspected}} as the letter's author.

[...] The two threatened to [...] "hang him", but [...] "with such oaths and emphatic assertions" [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot. [...] Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour's decision to believe him should not be disregarded. [...] While making his deathbed confession in the Tower of London, Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> if he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country's saviour.
