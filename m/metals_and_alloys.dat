Implantation of boron ions into <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys,</b> through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties {{to those of the}} bulk boride.|$|E
5|$|Franklin was {{a pioneer}} in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern {{materials}} analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. In the early 1960s Franklin was {{one of a number of}} scientists who participated in the Baby Tooth Survey, a project founded by Eric and Louise Reiss along with other scientists such as Barry Commoner, which investigated levels of strontium-90—a radioactive isotope in fallout from nuclear weapons testing—in children's teeth. This research contributed to the cessation of atmospheric weapons testing. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys</b> as well as on the history and social effects of technology.|$|E

25|$|The strict shape {{tolerance}} of gömböcs hindered production. The first prototype of a gömböc was manufactured in summer 2006 using three-dimensional rapid prototyping technology. Its accuracy however was below requirements, and the gömböc would often {{get stuck in}} an intermediate position rather than returning to the stable equilibrium. The technology was improved to increase the spatial accuracy to the required level and to use various construction materials. In particular, transparent (especially lightly colored) solids are visually appealing, as they demonstrate the homogeneous composition. Current materials for gömböcs include various <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys,</b> plastics such as Plexiglass, stones such as marble and ceramics, and injection-molded plastic. The balancing properties of a gömböc are affected by mechanical defects and dust both on its body and on the surface on which it rests. If damaged, the process of restoring the original shape {{is more complex than}} producing a new one. Although in theory the balancing properties should not depend on the material and object size, in practice, both larger and heavier gömböcs have better chances to return to equilibrium in case of defects.|$|E

30|$|The {{reduction}} of metal ions in solution {{is a typical}} approach to synthesize <b>metal</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloy</b> NPs [25, 27], which often involves chemical additives and/or byproducts, such as surfactants or polymers used to stabilize metal NPs. However, {{the introduction of the}} organic materials would block the active surface of <b>metal</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloy</b> NPs to some extent. To realize an additive/byproduct free approach, we develop a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)-assisted sputtering method to prepare supported <b>metal</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloy</b> NPs. RTILs herein play an important role for uniform dispersion of nanosupports and stabilization of small-sized metal NPs. In this method, metal is directly sputtered onto a suspension mixing RTILs and nanosupports [28, 29, 30, 31], where metal NPs may nucleate on the RTIL surface, and then diffuse into the suspension and finally self-decorate on the nanosupports [24, 32, 33, 34]. This method has been extended to prepare supported bimetallic NPs, such as AgPd and AgAu NPs decorated on graphene, and PdAu NPs decorated on carbon or TiO 2 nanosupports [31, 35, 36, 37].|$|R

2500|$|In March 1956, a US Patent {{was filed}} for [...] "process for warm {{extrusion}} of metal." [...] Patent US3156043 A outlines {{that a number}} of important advantages can be achieved with warm extrusion of both ferrous and non-ferrous <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys</b> if a billet to be extruded is changed in its physical properties in response to physical forces by being heated to a temperature below the critical melting point. Warm extrusion is done above room temperature, but below the recrystallization temperature of the material the temperatures ranges from 800 to 1800°F (424 to 975°C). It is usually used to achieve the proper balance of required forces, ductility and final extrusion properties.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{determination of}} the structures of liquid metals. There {{was a need for}} structural studies of liquid sodium and sodium-potassium alloys because these were used as coolants in fast-breeder reactors. [...] Fulmer developed a high temperature x-ray diffractometer for investigating the structures of liquid <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys.</b> In addition to its studies of liquid alkali metals, Fulmer discovered that certain eutectics, such as those in the gold-silicon and gold-germanium systems, have a structure in the liquid phase that has to be disrupted on crystallization. [...] This gives rise to considerable supercooling which results in multiple nucleation, and hence a very fine grain size in the resulting polycrystalline alloy.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, the {{scattering}} {{of light in}} optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, [...] "domains" [...] exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become {{the building blocks of}} both <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys,</b> as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are micro-structural defects that provide the most ideal locations for light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{biomaterial}} term is {{used for}} materials {{that can be used}} in biomedical and clinical applications. They are bioactive and biocompatible in nature. Currently, many types of <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>alloys</b> (stainless steel, titanium, nickel, magnesium, Co–Cr alloys, Ti alloys), ceramics (zirconia, bioglass, alumina, hydroxyapatite) [...] and polymers (acrylic, nylon, silicone, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, polyanhydrides) [...] are used for load bearing application. This includes dental replacement and bone joining or replacement for medical and clinical application. Therefore their mechanical properties are very important. Mechanical properties of some biomaterials and bone are summarized in table 1. Among them hydroxyapatite is most widely studied bioactive and biocompatible material. However, it has lower young’s modulus and fracture toughness with brittle nature. Hence, it is required to produce a biomaterial with good mechanical properties.|$|E
