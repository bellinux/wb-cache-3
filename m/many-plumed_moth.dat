50|$|The moth is also {{popularly known}} as the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moth,</b> while the {{specific}} name hexadactyla comes from the Greek for six-fingered.|$|E
5000|$|The twenty-plume moth (Alucita hexadactyla) is a [...] "micromoth" [...] of the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moth</b> family (Alucitidae). It {{is found}} in Europe and has been {{introduced}} into North America.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: In the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> (family Alucitidae), {{wings are}} split along each vein.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though they}} are [...] "micromoths", the Aluctoidea are not {{especially}} primitive Lepidoptera; the sizable carpenter moths (Cossidae) {{as well as the}} butterflies are not particularly distant relatives. The closest living relatives of the Aluctoidea, however, seem to be the plume moths (Pterophoroidea), which like the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> have wings consisting each of several narrow straps (though less strikingly so than in the Aluctoidea). However, the taxonomic treatment of the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> among the Ditrysia is disputed, mostly because of their unclear relationship to the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea).|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} plants {{growing in the}} park, {{including}} fruit trees, dog roses, margarites, medick and knautia. These plants attract several butterflies, for example the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moth,</b> the painted lady and Lycaenidae.|$|E
50|$|The Alucitidae or <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> are {{a family}} of moths with unusually {{modified}} wings. Both fore- and hind-wings consist of about six rigid spines, from which radiate flexible bristles creating a structure similar to a bird's feather.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} of plume moths usually {{consist of}} two curved spars with {{more or less}} bedraggled bristles trailing behind. This resembles the closely related Alucitidae (<b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths)</b> at first glance, but the latter have {{a greater number of}} symmetrical plumes. The hindwings are similarly constructed, but have three spars. A few genera have normal lepidopteran wings.|$|R
5000|$|Alucita is {{the largest}} genus of <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> (family Alucitidae); {{it is also the}} type genus of its family and the disputed {{superfamily}} Alucitoidea. This genus occurs almost worldwide and contains about 180 species new species are still being described and discovered regularly. Formerly, many similar moths of superfamilies Alucitoidea, Copromorphoidea and Pterophoroidea were also placed in Alucita.|$|R
50|$|Tineodidae {{are here}} united with the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> (family Alucitidae) the {{superfamily}} Alucitoidea. It {{may be that}} these two groups are actually polyphyletic with regard to each other, and merging Tineodidae into Alucitidae and/or redelimiting the groups is warranted. In the taxonomic scheme used here, the closest living relatives of the Alucitoidea are considered the Pterophoroidea, but this is somewhat disputed. This {{would mean that the}} strong similarities between e.g. Tanycnema and the basal plume moth genus Agdistopis are not a coincidence.|$|R
50|$|In the {{arrangement}} used here, the Copromorphoidea are considered obtectomeran Ditrysia, significantly {{more advanced than}} the Aluctoidea (which certainly belong to the basal lineages of Apoditrysia). Some authors disagree and instead assume the Copromorphoidea to be closer relatives of the Alucitidae than even the Tineodidae and Pterophoroidea. This splits the <b>many-plumed</b> <b>moths</b> into two lineages, the Alucitidae (as well as the fringe-tufted moths, Epermeniidae) being included in an expanded Copromorphoidea, and the Tineodidae affiliated with the plume moth instead. The subfamily Alucitoidea is thus abandoned in this approach. The rationale for doing so is the marked similarity of Alucitidae caterpillars and chrysalises to those of Copromorphoidea. But this may simply be convergent evolution or symplesiomorphies, considering that the Copromorphoidea otherwise appear to possess the characteristic synapomorphies of the Obtectomera, which are absent in Aluctoidea.|$|R
