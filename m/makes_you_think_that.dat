[...] Suparna Sharma of The Asian Age rated the movie with 4.5 out of 5 stars: [...] "Director Dibakar Banerjee loves this country dearly and Shanghai is his guttural, anguished wail. But being the super-smart, light-touch director that he is, he conducts the last rites of our beloved country to the loud, cheery strains of the song Bharat Mata ki, Bharat Mata ki... we are in mourning, but we are conducting Bharat Mata’s antim sanskar in a medieval fashion. We are dancing, screaming... And though the lyricist has added “jai bolo” at the end, that’s not the sentiment of this song, or our mourning, or the film. The correct rendition of this song would end with the words “le lo”.Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the movie with 4 out of 5 stars: [...] "On the whole, SHANGHAI is undeniably {{one of the most}} politically astute films ever made.

[...] Giving it 2½ stars out of 5, Michael McCall of New Country magazine considered it an improvement over his debut album, which he called [...] "a forgettable effort with clunky, outdated production and an aimless collection of lightweight pop-country songs", although he thought that most of the songs on Davis Daniel were [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "weightless".

40|$|Attempts to {{communicate}} with the inhabitants of other solar systems have been made since 1959. These initially involved sending and listening for radio transmissions. In the 1970 ’s, messages to aliens were included on the Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. There is an account of these efforts in the book [19]; see especially the chapter by F. D. Drake. The Voyager messages include some mathematics, e. g., a translation table between binary and decimal representation systems. (Recent updates on the search for extra-terrestial intelligence may be found at www. seti-inst. edu and www. setileague. org.) At a NATO Workshop at the University of Hawaii in October 2002, Jack Cohen raised the question: What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the aliens will recognize your mathematics? Might they not have an entirely different mode of thought? At the time, the feeling of the mathematicians present was that the fundamentals of discrete math, and in particular the integers, would be the same in any mathematical system. While aliens might have a different perception that changes the more complex structures that they would use to describe the universe, their natural numbers would be the same as ours. Furthermore, if they are very intelligent, then {{they should be able to}} add and multiply integers, so for example aliens would recognize a sequence of prime numbers. Now in fact, such questions about the fundamentals of mathematics have a long history, without the alien factor. My own interest was spurred years ago by a rather long but otherwise forgettable lecture on “The nature of duality ” by a visitor to the Philosophy Department. But Jack’s question has encouraged me to put down some of the thoughts that have been fomenting beneath the surface, in need for further development. Besides raising a number of topics for discussion, we will propose some problems that might be appropriate for student projects...|$|E
