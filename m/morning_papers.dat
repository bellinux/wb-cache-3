5|$|A late-night {{service from}} Ludgate Hill (departing 01:15) to Beckenham Junction via Herne Hill began in 1910. The {{intention}} was to satisfy journalists on Fleet Street who regularly complained in print about the poor quality of service on the line; those working on the <b>morning</b> <b>papers</b> often worked beyond midnight and missed the last train.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the <b>morning</b> <b>papers</b> went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, 1933, Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore, {{in a daze}} {{following}} what {{he thought}} was a check by Toronto's Ace Bailey, charged the latter player from behind, flipping Bailey into the air and causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head. [...] The check was so vicious that Bailey was given the last rites before being transported to the hospital in Boston. Neurosurgeons operated throughout the night to save his life; however, Bailey's prognosis was so grim that <b>morning</b> <b>papers</b> printed his death notice. [...] Bailey survived, but he never played professionally again. [...] Shore ultimately served a 16-game suspension for the hit, and avoided being charged with manslaughter had Bailey died.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the night}} of September 9–10, the city {{witnessed}} an outbreak of hooliganism and looting. Some was rowdy behavior that scared respectable citizens, such as youths throwing rocks at streetcars and overturning the carts of street vendors. More overtly criminal activity included the smashing of store windows and looting their displays or setting off false fire alarms. Such activity was restricted to {{certain parts of the}} city and, according to the New York Times, [...] "throughout the greater part of the city the usual peace and quiet prevailed." [...] In the morning the mayor asked the governor to furnish a force of State Guards; Coolidge promptly agreed and eventually provided almost 5,000 men. Commissioner Curtis later praised the State Guards' performance in his Annual Report: [...] "The whole community is now aware of the effectiveness with which the Massachusetts State Guard worked when it came into the city. I cannot add anything to the universal chorus of commendation that has greeted their work." [...] The <b>morning</b> <b>papers</b> following the first night's violence were full of loud complaints and derogatory terms for the police: [...] "deserters", [...] "agents of Lenin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Created in 2001, NewsNight with Aaron Brown {{focused on}} investigative journalism {{and had a}} strong {{emphasis}} on interviews. The program included segments such as [...] "The Whip" [...] (which quickly previewed segments from four reporters at large), [...] "On The Rise" [...] and [...] "Segment 7". The <b>Morning</b> <b>Papers</b> segment, known as [...] "The Rooster", featured a brief preview of compelling or interesting headlines from the next day's newspapers around the world. The segment concluded with the weather forecast for Chicago as provided in the Chicago Sun-Times. Newsnight was cancelled on November 5, 2005, Brown resigned from CNN shortly afterward.|$|E

2500|$|In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw {{rated the}} film {{three out of}} a {{possible}} five stars and added, [...] "This genial comedy, directed by Nigel Cole, with an excellent, tightly constructed script by Tim Firth and Juliette Towhidi, accentuates the positive. There's lots of wit and pluck and not much heartbreak," [...] and Mark Kermode of The Observer said, [...] "When the film succeeds, as it does magnificently in the first two-thirds, one can only marvel at the miracle of a world in which such plotlines could literally land on a producer's doorstep with the <b>morning</b> <b>papers.</b> When it fails, it is the film's acknowledgment of its own big-screen inevitability that is to blame. The result is half a great British screen comedy, twice as much as one usually expects from the genre nowadays ... Ultimately, however, this remains an immensely likeable and often impressive romp." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “While we {{were showing}} in Birmingham, England, a little {{daughter}} was born to us. [...] The <b>morning</b> <b>papers</b> discussed the event in big headlines that the first full-blooded Indian baby had been born at the Buffalo Bill grounds. [...] Colonel Cody was to be its godfather, and the baby was named after the reigning Queen of England. [...] The child’s full name was to be Alexandra Birmingham Cody Standing Bear. [...] The next morning Cody {{came to me and}} asked if my wife and baby could be placed in the side-show. [...] He said the English people {{would like to see the}} face of a newly born Indian baby lying in an Indian cradle or ‘hoksicalaa postan.' [...] I gave my consent, and the afternoon papers stated that the baby and mother could be seen the following afternoon. [...] Long before it was time for the show to begin, people were lining up on the road. [...] My wife sat on the raised platform, with the little one in the cradle before her. [...] The people filed past, many of them dropping money in a box for her. [...] It was a great drawing card for the show; the work was very light for my wife, and as for the baby, before she was twenty-four hours old she was making more money than my wife and I together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show premiered in Toronto, at the O'Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960. It overran {{drastically}} – it {{was supposed}} to last two hours forty minutes, and instead clocked in at four and a half hours. [...] The curtain came down at twenty to one in the morning; Lerner later noted that [...] "Only Tristan and Isolde equaled it as a bladder endurance contest." [...] Noël Coward was supposed to have remarked that the show was [...] "longer than the 'Götterdämmerung'...and not nearly as funny!" [...] In spite of this, the <b>morning</b> <b>papers</b> gave generally positive reviews, but hinted that the show needed much work, i.e. drastic editing, in order to succeed. Soon afterwards, Lerner was hospitalised for three weeks with a bleeding ulcer. [...] Soon after he was discharged, Hart suffered his second heart attack, and Lerner stepped in as temporary director {{for the rest of the}} out-of-town run. Camelot then moved to Boston, edited, but still running well over the intended length. The production team tried to find another director, even phoning Jose Ferrer, who could not undertake the job. Lerner and Loewe disagreed on how to proceed with the show, as Loewe did not want to make any major changes without Hart's guidance. Lerner wrote: [...] "God knows what would have happened had it not been for Richard Burton." [...] Accepting cuts and changes, he radiated a [...] "faith and geniality" [...] and calmed the fears of the cast. Guenevere's song [...] "Before I Gaze at You Again" [...] was given to Andrews at the last minute before the first New York preview, which provoked her famous quote, [...] "Of course, darling, but do try to get it to me the night before." [...] After the show opened on Broadway, Hart was released from the hospital, and he and Lerner began cutting the play even further. Two songs, [...] "Then You May Take Me To the Fair" [...] and [...] "Fie on Goodness," [...] were cut a few months into the run (though they remain on the cast album, and the former featured in the 1967 film).|$|E
