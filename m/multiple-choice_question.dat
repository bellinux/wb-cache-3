25|$|The four {{remaining}} teams {{stood on}} the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode's legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme {{for the remainder of}} the episode. The legend centered on an artifact which the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each <b>multiple-choice</b> <b>question</b> had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a button on their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he stopped talking immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given a chance to answer. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} study to {{evaluate}} {{the extent to which}} free-response questions can be approximated by multiple-choice equivalents. Two carefully designed research-based <b>multiple-choice</b> <b>questions</b> were transformed into a free-response format and administered on the final exam in a calculus-based introductory physics course. The original <b>multiple-choice</b> <b>questions</b> were administered in another, similar introductory physics course on the final exam. Our findings suggest that carefully designed <b>multiple-choice</b> <b>questions</b> can reflect the relative performance on the free-response questions while maintaining the benefits of ease of grading and quantitative analysis, especially if the different choices in the <b>multiple-choice</b> <b>questions</b> are weighted to reflect the different levels of understanding that students display.

2500|$|The contestants {{must first}} play a {{preliminary}} round, called [...] "Fastest Finger First" [...] (or, in the U.S. version, simply [...] "Fastest Finger"), {{where they are}} all given a question and four answers from the host and are asked to put those four answers into a particular order; in the first series of the British version and in pre-2003 episodes of the Australian version, the round instead required the contestants to answer one <b>multiple-choice</b> <b>question</b> correctly as quickly as possible. The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize (often a million units of the local currency). In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time, those contestants play another question to break the tie. If no one gets the question right, that question is discarded and another question is played in the same manner. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music begins.|$|E
