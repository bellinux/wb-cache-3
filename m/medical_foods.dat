40|$|Objective: The primary {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was to determine the association between the source of dietary protein intake and the sum of plasma concentration of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU). A secondary aim of the study was to examine the effect of dietary compliance on plasma concentration of LNAA. Methods: The analysis included combined participant data from two previous studies conducted at the Emory University School of Medicine. Subjects are males (n= 34) and females (n= 43) with PKU ages 4 - 50 years. A Student t-test was used to compare total combined plasma LNAA (excluding tryptophan and phenylalanine) by dietary compliance status (alpha= 0. 05). Correlation statistics were used to determine the association between the ratio of reported intact <b>food</b> protein to <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein on plasma levels of LNAA. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the contribution of intact protein to <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein ratio and other variables to plasma LNAA. Results: The median ratio of intact protein to <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein reported was 0. 354 (IQR: 0. 188, 0. 914). Median percent of PHE intake over the PHE intake recommendation was 31. 64 (Interquartile range [IQR]; 7. 44, 104. 98). Plasma concentration of LNAA did not differ significantly between those with plasma PHE levels within the therapeutic range μmol/L (compliant; 611. 7 μmol/L [n= 19]) vs levels above the therapeutic range (non-compliant; 595. 3 μmol/L [n= 47]); p= 0. 613). There was an inverse marginal correlation between the ratio of intact protein to <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein and plasma concentration of LNAA for those who were compliant (r = - 0. 436, r = 0. 1) although the association was not statistically significant (p= 0. 08). No correlation was found for patients who were non-compliant. Regression analysis revealed that plasma concentration of LNAA was not significantly affected by the ratio of intact protein to <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein ratio, age, or gender. Conclusions: Although not statistically significant, a negative trend was observed between plasma LNAA concentration and the intact protein to <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein ratio in patients compliant with the PHE prescription. This suggests that the ratio of intact dietary protein to protein coming from <b>medical</b> <b>food,</b> as reported by patient diet records, may promote increased plasma LNAA levels in the effective treatment of PKU. The majority of the sample (74 %) were non-compliant with diet based on plasma PHE levels. Future studies are needed to determine the consequences of non-compliance by decreased intake of <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> protein or increased intake of intact protein on plasma LNAA concentration and downstream health effects...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{diet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle {{contribute to the}} development of metabolic syndrome (MetS); addressing both is crucial for its management. A diet featuring the Mediterranean dietary pattern or low glycemic load has been shown to prevent and ameliorate MetS. Plant compounds, including soy protein and phytosterols, have been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Recently, phytochemicals from hops and acacia were identified as lipogenic, antiinflammatory compounds that reduced serum insulin and glucose levels in animals. A 12 -week, randomized lifestyle intervention study in overweight and obese women with LDL ≥ 3. 37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) compared a Mediterranean-style, low-glycemic-load diet and soy/phytosterol-based <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> to an AHA low-fat diet. The modified Mediterranean diet with <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> was superior in reducing markers of MetS and CVD risk. A subsequent,randomized 12 -week study in men and women with MetS and LDL ≥ 3. 37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) showed that supplementation with soy/phytosterol-based <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> plus phytochemicalsenhanced the benefits of a Mediterranean-style low-glycemic-load diet and aerobic exercise. At the completion of the study, 43 % of participants receiving <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> and phytochemicalsexhibited net resolution of MetS compared with only 22 % of those on diet and exercise alone. A subanalysis of participants at high risk (MetS + LDL ≥ 4. 14 mmol/L [160 mg/dL]) indicated minimal benefit from lifestyle change alone but marked benefits with the addition of <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> and phytochemicals. Case studies illustrate long-term benefits of this supplemented lifestyle change program. In conclusion, institution of a phytochemical-enhanced lifestyle intervention promises to be a clinically useful approach in MetS management...|$|R

Objective To assess the effects of nutritional therapy with a <b>medical</b> <b>food</b> on growth and protein status of patients with a urea cycle enzyme defect. Methods A 6 -mo multicenter outpatient {{study was conducted with}} infants and toddlers managed by nutrition therapy with Cyclinex- 1 Amino Acid-Modified <b>Medical</b> <b>Food</b> with Iron (Ross Products Division, Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Main outcome variables were anthropometrics and plasma amino acids (selected), albumin, and transthyretin concentrations. Results Seventeen patients completed the study. Mean (±SE) baseline age was 11. 30 ± 3. 20 months (median 4. 40 months; range 0. 22 – 38. 84 months). Length and weight z-scores increased significantly during the 6 -month study. Head circumference increased, but not significantly. Three patients were stunted and two were wasted (− 2. 0 z-score) at baseline while at study end, only one patient was both stunted and wasted. The majority of patients increased in length, head circumference, and weight z-scores during study. Mean (±SE) plasma albumin concentration increased from 34 ± 2 g/L at baseline to 38 ± 1 g/L at study end. Plasma transthyretin increased from a mean (±SE) of 177 ± 13 mg/L at baseline to 231 ± 15 mg/L at study end.

Impaired phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity in PKU inhibits the effective metabolism of its phenylalanine (Phe) substrate.
