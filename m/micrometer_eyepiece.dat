The exterior morphology and the interior appearance of beads were examined using optical microscope at the magnifications of 40 × and 100 ×. For examination of interior and exterior appearance, first we produced some beads larger than our normal beads we had produced (at about 1  mm). Then we prepared a cross section of beads by means of a microtome blade (for this purpose, we put beads on a plate and then divided them by microtome blade and by hand, then we applied gram staining on the cut surface) (Ghorbani-Choboghlo et al. 2015; Mirzaei et al. 2011, 2012). Moreover, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) method was used to differentiate between surfaces of the beads with or without a nanoparticles coating.|$|R
40|$|ALTHOUGH it is {{a matter}} of common {{observation}} that ciliates and other Protozoa when starved become smaller in size, and often more slender in shape, very little quantitative work has been done on these changes. It is the purpose of this paper to deal in a quantitative way with the effects of the starvation of Glaucoma; in particular with the changes that result in size and shape. It is hoped that this study may throw some light on the mechanism by which the shape of ciliates is controlled. Cultures of Glaucoma were starved by centrifuging them free from the Pseudo-monas on which they had been fed, and placing them in a solution of non-nutrient salts. It was impossible to remove all the bacteria in this way, but they were reduced to insignificant numbers and the few that remained were eaten by the ciliates in a very short time.

40|$|There are {{at least}} two {{distinct}} patterns of reaction in the peripheral nerves in cases of peripheral neuropathy. Axonal degeneration or segmental demyelination (or both) may occur and their histological appearances are now well known. Disorders associated with primary destruction of axis cylinders include the classical example of Wallerian degeneration, and the latter, sometimes termed 'Schwann cell diseases', includes the neuro-pathies of diabetes mellitus (Thomas and Lascelles, 1966) and metachromatic leucodystrophy (Dayan, 1967). We have recently studied one family in which peripheral neuropathy has occurred in members of three generations, and another unrelated family only one member of which was definitely affected. Nerve biopsies from both families have shown both axonal destruction and segmental demyelination associated with unique features of Schwann cell dysfunction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Under local anaesthesia, a sural nerve and peroneus brevis muscle were biopsied. For light microscopy they were fixed in buffered formol saline and paraffin and frozen sections cut and stained by conventional methods. Isolated fibres were 'teased ' from the nerve by freehand dissection after post-fixation in 10 % osmic acid and maceration in 60 % glycerine (Dayan, 1967).

40|$|Despite the {{acknowledged}} {{importance of}} the stratum corneum in limiting water loss and in controlling skin corneum in limiting water loss and in controlling skin permeability, the basis for these functions remains unknown. To pinpoint those factor(s) of importance for cutaneous barrier function, we correlated the thickness, number of cell layers, and lipid composition of leg vs. abdominal stratum corneum samples with penetration of 3 H-water and 14 C-salicylic acid across the same tissue sample. Viable upper epidermal sheets were obtained by incubating fresh autopsy or amputation full-thickness skin with staphylococcal exfoliatin. Each sheet was divided into 3 portions. The first piece was mounted in a diffusion cell for penetration studies. The second stratum corneum sample was frozen sectioned, stained with the fluorochrome, ANS, and measured with a <b>micrometer</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> The 3 rd piece was pooled with other leg (n = 6) and abdomen (n = 15) specimens for determination of lipid weight percent. In all cases, leg stratum corneum was ≅ 2 times more permeable than abdominal stratum corneum to water and slightly more permeable to salicylic acid, as well. Penetration of both substances correlated inversely with lipid weight % of leg (mean = 3. 0 %) vs. abdomen (mean = 6. 8 %), but neither the penetration of water nor of salicylic acid {{was influenced by the}} number of cell layers or the thickness of the stratum corneum. We conclude that: differences in the thickness and the number of cell layers in the stratum corneum are insufficient to account for differences in percutaneous transport across leg and abdomen and that total lipid concentration may be the critical factor governing skin permeability...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for directly measuring the shortest axis of an indlvktual particle by focusing successively on its mounting surface {{and then on}} its highest point {{is found to be}} feasible. Tfils distance, as read from a cali-hrated fine-focus drum, is both highly accurate and sufficiently precise for most purposes, though an easily determined correction factor may he required for built-in bias of the focus calibration. Comparison of 200 optical height measurements on 40 grains with paired observations derived by Plumley's (1948) <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer</b> method demonstrates an identity of mean values. Optical height data are nearly three times less precise; nevertheless, roughly 170 of 200 observations occur within six percent of their group mean values throughout the sand size range. After initial calibration of the microscope, no preparatory stages in grain mounting or equipment manu-facture are required; the routine petrographic microscope and accessories are sufficient for optical height determinations.

The increase in adrenal cortical function is paralleled by increased adrenal weight and zone specific cortical width. Method: Adrenal glands from persons aged 20 - 85 years who died unexpectedly either from road traffic accident or committed suicide and died immediately, were obtained from mortuary of Medical college and Hospital, Kolkata, within 48 hours of death and without any gross sign of putrefaction. After overnight fixation, the adrenals were carefully cleaned of adherent fat, blotted dry, weighed on electronic weighing machine having the accuracy of ± 0. 1 gram. After proper fixation, paraffin blocks were prepared, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.

40|$|ABsTRACT Seed-dimensions and root-diameters are {{characters}} of some taxonomic significance in Epipactis species. Preliminary data on these measurements {{is given in}} the tables. Epipactis are notoriously variable plants, {{and it is not}} surprising that their quantitative characters show a wide amplitude and much overlapping between species. The data which follows indicates that the dimensions of the roots and seeds are more absolute characters and of taxonomic significance. It is not the result of a serious biometric study, but simply arose from examination of material that happened to be available. It is presented as an indication of where properly designed studies might be profitable. SEED DIMENSIONS The size of seeds is well known to be almost independent of the size and vigour of the parent plant. Dymes (1921, 1923) has shown that seed morphology is sometimes a useful taxonomic character in the Orchidaceae. Table 1 gives the dimensions of the seeds of all species of Epipactis, Section Epipactis, of Europe and the Mediterranean region, including five non-British species.

40|$|Introduction: Few studies {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} bowel endometriosis on intestinal physiology. Nerve fibers and their neurotransmitters are known to contribute to intestinal inflammation. Substance P (SP) is the main neurotrans- mitter of sensory nerve fibers {{and it is a}} proinflammatory neuropeptide. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is sympathetic neurotransmitter and has antiinflammatory activity at high concentrations. This study aims to investigate the intestinal innervation around colorectal endometriotic lesion. Materials and methods: This study included women who had bowel endometriosis and underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection because of severe pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Bowel specimens were collected immediately after surgery. From each patient a bowel specimen including serosa, muscularis propria and mucosa was obtained at two sites: one sample was collected near the endometriotic lesion and the other sample was obtained at the limit of the resected specimen in histologically confirmed healthy tissue. Specimens were immediately fixed in formalin and treated with sucrose. Afterwards samples were frozen in Tissue-Tec and stored at 2808 C until analysis. Slices of 8 mm were used for immunofluorescence. Following air drying and rehydratation, the stain of the sympathetic nerve endings was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TH (Chemicon, dilution 1 : 1000) and the sensory nerve fibers were stained with a goat polyclonal antibody against SP (Santa Cruz, dilution 1 : 50). The slices were incubated with the primary anti- body for 3 h. After washing, samples were incubated with a secondary antibody for 90 min. For the TH staining, an Alexa Fluor 546 -conjugated monoclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody was used. For the SP staining, Alexa Fluor 546 -conjugated monoclonal rabbit anti-goat was used. After washing, nuclei staining was performed by 0. 1 % 4, 6 -diamidino- 2 -pheny- lindole (DAPI) in PBS for 4 min. Finally the slices were embedded with fluorescent mounting medium and stored until microscopy at 48 C. The numbers of positive nerve fibers per square millimeter were determined by averaging the number of stained nerve fibers (minimum length 50 mm, determined through a <b>micrometer</b> <b>eyepiece)</b> in 17 randomly selected high power fields of view. We controlled the positive nerve fiber staining by incubating the tissue with respective control antibodies which always yielded a negative result. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Specimens were obtained from 9 women. A significant loss of sympathetic nerve fibers in the bowel muscularis propria was observed in the proximity of the endometriotic nodule when com- pared with the specimen excised in healthy bowel tissue (260 %, P 1 ⁄ 4 0. 045). The density of the sensory nerve fibers in the muscle wall near to the lesions tended to be higher compared to the same region far away from the nodule, but {{there was no significant difference}} (P 1 ⁄ 4 0. 297). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that there is a loss of the sympathetic innervation around bowel endometriotic nodule; future studies should determine whether proinflammatory sensory nerves are up-regulated by the presence of endometriosis. Understanding of the effects of endometriosis on intestinal innervation may be useful to improve its treatment...|$|E

Segments of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were autoradiographed, and the migration of the labelled cells during the period between 2 and 23 hours was measured with an <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer.</b> The cells had migrated 35, 42, and 34 per cent of the total distance from the crypts to {{the tips of the}} villi in the control segments of duodenum, ileum, and jejunum respectively, and 43, 90, and 82 per cent, respectively, in similar segments from resected animals. The rate of migration in the portion of the intestine remaining after resection was approximately three times the normal rate in the ileum, twice the normal rate in the jejunum, and showed an increase of one-third in the duodenum. These results demonstrate that the rate of cell renewal is considerably greater in the remaining portion of the intestine of resected animals than in normal intestine. The increased rate of migration after resection, together with the increase in the height of the villi, resulted in an increase in the rate of cell renewal amounting to 141 per cent in the ileum, 114 per cent in the jejunum, and 23 per cent in the duodenum when compared with control segments...|$|R

Thirteen of 15 patients with carcinoma of the colon (87 %) and 21 / 22 patients (95 %) with large bowel dysplasia showed evidence only of rectal dysplasia. However, there was marked variability {{in the proportion of}} dysplastic rectal mucosa even in those patients with rectal carcinoma, while in some patients dysplasia was limited to a small focus. Because of the possibility of false negative biopsies due to sampling error, multiple biopsies should be taken to detect dysplasia. Their state should be recorded and deliberately varied at subsequent visits. Careful sigmoidoscopy and multiple biopsies in this study had potential value as an aid in the detection of 85 - 90 % of all carcinomas. In practice the figure would almost certainly be lower due to intrinsic bias (see discussion) so that, although regular sigmoidoscopy and biopsy would be of great value when colonoscopy is not available, the latter should be included in any long-term programme of carcinoma prevention...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{estimates}} of the lifetime of the neutral π meson have indicated a value {{of the order of}} 10 − 17 secs. In order to determine the lifetime by flight distance measurements a method employing very fine resolution is required. Nuclear emulsions provide a medium for resolution of distances of the order of a micron. This experiment uses the same principle as that first tried by Harris et al. (1957). The decay at rest of the K + meson in the K π 2 mode (π + π 0) provides a π 0 of unique velocity and a direction directly opposite to that of the π +; the latter being charged, leaves a track in the emulsion. The decay of the π 0 is detected in emulsion if it takes place in the Dalitz mode:- π 0 γ+e + +e − (br. ratio 1. 2 %) Detection is possible because of the emission of charged particles. A stack of Ilford L 4 emulsions was exposed to a beam of stopping K mesons. After processing, the stack was scanned for K π 2 decays with the emission of a Dalitz pair. Other π 0 producing decays of the K + (K μ 3, K e 3, τ′) were at first indistinguishable from the desired K π 2 decays. In order to reduce this contamination, grain density measurements were made on the charged secondary from the K + decay. By rejecting events in which g* was greater than 1. 3 all τ′ and 30 % of the K μ 3 events were rejected. A correction factor was calculated to account for the remaining decays. The co-ordinates of the grains composing the events were measured relative to axes fixed in the field of view. A bifilar <b>micrometer</b> <b>eyepiece</b> was used which has the motions of the cross-wires digitised to enable rapid measurement. The co-ordinates were automatically punched out on to tape ready for input to the computer. The tracks of the particles were obtained by fitting straight lines to the measured co-ordinates. The decay point of the π 0 was defined as the intersection of the electron tracks with the line of flight of the π +. The point of production was taken as the foot of the perpendicular from the measured position of the K + on to the π + trajectory. The effects of errors due to measurement, "grain noise" and grain size were thoroughly investigated. Use was made of co-ordinate measurements on τ decays of the K + (π + π + π −) where it is known that the three tracks converge on the point of decay of the K +. An estimation of the lifetime was made using a likelihood calculation. It was discovered that the presence of events giving anomalous flight distances affected the estimate considerably. A suitable cutoff criterion was applied to reject these events. The result after allowing for the effect of contamination events referred to earlier was:- τ π 0 = (1. 56 + 0. 55) × 10 − 16 secs. − 0. 45 </table...|$|E
40|$|La {{publication}} fait le point des connaissances sur le genre Lamprothamnium dans les domaines de la morphologie et du cycle de développement, de l'écologie et des végétations associées, de la répartition des espèces. Toutes les espèces monoïques de Lamprothamnium, parfois difficiles à distinguer les unes des autres, forment un groupe naturel dans la tribu des Chareae. Elles sont caractérisées par un thalle sans cortication et une seule rangée de stipulodes plus ou moins développés et disposés un sous chaque phylloïde. WOOD et IMAHORI (1965) distinguent trais espèces (avec six formes) auxquelles DONTERBERG (1984) ajoute un nouveau taxon endémique d'Argentine. Une clé systématique remaniée est proposée. C'est le seul genre de Characées dont toutes les formes, peuplant les eaux saumàtres et salées, peuvent supporter de larges et soudaines fluctuations du taux de salinité (eau hypersaline à eau douce et vice versa). La germination s'opère en eau de faible salinité, à température moyenne et sur un substrat meuble reposant sur de la vase compacte et salée dans des milieux souvent peu profonds, ensoleillés, donc à échauffement diurne notable. Les biotopes aquatiques, temporaires ou permanents, sont généralement peuplés de végétations mono- ou polyspécifiques de Characées, souvent denses, où peuvent s'introduire des Algues et des Phanérogames halophiles. Toutes les espèces sont en voie de raréfaction notable {{en raison de}} la profonde modification des milieux très spéciaux qui leur sont favorables. L. papulosumse trouve être, à l'échelle mondiale, la première espèce de Cryptogames à recevoir le statut de plante protégée en Grande-Bretagne (MOORE, 1991). All monoecious {{species of}} Lamprothamnium J. Gr., which often are difficult to distinguish from each another, from a natural group within the Chareae Tribe. The plants, from 5 to 80 cm high, are characterized by a thallus without codex round the axes and the branchlets, and one tier of stipulodes these ones are uniform or of irregular size, as numerous as the branchlets, and inserted one below each branchlet. The bract-cells are well developed and verticillate (fig. 1). The common form tends to develop compact foxtail-like upper portions; but a plant with the diffuse habit and extremely elongated branchlets can grow tell in some deeper brackishwater biotopes. The male and female gametangia are conjoined or sejoined on the branchlet modes (one of each) and sometimes aggregated {{at the base of}} the branchlets. The oogonium below the antheridium is the predominating position. The table 1 is bringing out the measurements of the male and female gametangia published in a few taxa of Lamprothamnium. It is obvious that the differences measured between them are so small that they are not a bit help in the species determination. The dried plants kept in the herbarium have become often breakable and cannot be investigated. The fresh plants must be preserved in ethanol at 70 % or in formalin at 5 %. The measurements of all parts of the fresh plants have been taken in water under the stereo- or the lightmicroscope with the help of a <b>micrometer</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> The mature plants with sex organs were fixed in acetic ethanol in the ratio of 1 / 3 for karyological studies, then the standard staining and squashing methods were followed. The chromosomes have been counted in the cells of the antheridial filaments (GUERLESQUIN, 1967). A few chromosome numbers of four taxa have been published in Lamprothamniumpapulosum (n = ca 25, 50, 56 in Europe; n = 70, 72 in Ouzbekistan; n = 14, 28, 30 in Australia on some doubtful samples); Lamprothamnium macropogon (n = 28, 55 in Australia); Lamprothamnium succinctum (n = 14, 42 in India; n = 42 in New Caledonia); Lamprothamnium succinctum var. australiensis (n = 42 in Australia). WOOD and IMAHORI (1965) have distinguished three similar species and six forms to which Donterberg (1984) added a new taxon endemic in Argentina. A revised key to the species and varieties of Lamprothamnium is propounded (table 2) : 1) Stipulodes well developed, of uniform size, male and female gametangia growing together:a) gametangtaa atbranchiet nodes and at base of branchlet : L. papulosum;b) gametangia restricted to branchlet nodes : L. hansenii; 2) Stipulodes irregular in size or absent :a) male and female gametangia growing on different branchlet nodes and at base of branchlets : L. succinctum;b) male and female gametangia growing on the same branchlet nodes only: L. haesseliae. A few taxa of an uncertain value have been described such as Lamprothamnium mediterraneum (Lovric, 1979, 1980). Lamprothamnium is the only genus of Characeae of which all brackish and saline water forms can tolerate wide and sudden fluctuations of the salinity rate (fresh- to hypersaline water and vice versa, NaCl, MgCl 2, calcium sulphate). The physicochemical composition of a few brackishwater biotopes of Western Europe is mentioned in the table 3. The ratio of Cl- can vary from 9 g. 1 - 1 to 59 g. 1 - 1 (more than six times); this one of the total salts from 32 g. l- 1 to 170 g. l- 1 (about five times). This tact is making clear the adaptability of these plants to the fluctuations. All the taxa of Lamprothamnium are sun-loving plants and thereby they can grow in the biotopes with an appreciable warming action of the sun during the day. In the temporary ponds, the plants are enough quick to develop their life cycle completely before the whole drying up. The germination occurs in a slightly brackishwater with a mild temperature, after a dormancy time more or less long (from a few months to several years : six in Morocco, GUERLESQUIN et al., 1987). From the germination of the oospore to the fertile plant with mature gametangia, the developmental process needs two or three months. The aquatic biotopes can be covered with dense mono- or polyspecific vegetations of Characeae into which halophilous Algae (Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae) and Angiosperme (Ruppia sp., Zannichellia sp., Althenia sp., Zostera sp. pl., Potamogeton pecfinatus, Groenlendia densa, etc.), are growing together. The brackish biotopes must be permanent (salt- or brackish lakes, stagnant or lightly running water, etc.), temporary (coastal lagoons, salt-marshes, etc.), continental or by the sea. The taxa of Lamprothamnium are widespread in scattered sites between 20 ° N and 59 ° N, from Sahara to Southern Norway, also in South Africa, Mauritius, Australia and Tasmania, New Zeatand, New Caledonia, Japan, Eastern Asia (Pakistan, India, China), South America (Bolivia, Argentina). Now they are unknown in North and Central America, and the Caribbean Islands. L. papulosum is the mort widely distributed species (maps 1 and 2). All the forms are becoming rarefied considerably owing to the great modifications of the very special favourable environments such as the draining or the filling in of the salt-water lakes and the coastal salt-pans. The localities where L. papulosum, the only species present in France, was seen again recently, are very few (map 1). In its quinquennial review (1987), the Nature Conservancy Council has decided to protect L. papulosum, a rare Charophyte in Great Britain, and its favourable habitats. These are often regarded as unproductive « wasteland » and frequently threatened by « the development at recreational amenities, holiday accomodations, shipping and salt industries » which induce pollution, disturbance and complete drying. Thus L. papulosum will be the first species of Cryptogams to receive the status of protected plant in the whole world (Moore, 1991) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop methods to {{identify}} glaucoma by examining the optic nerve head (ONH) of donor's eyes when information on the preexisting ocular disease is unavailable. Materials and Methods: The ONH of the donor's eyes was evaluated under a stereomicroscope for the cup-disc ratio (CDR) and focal retinal rim thinning. The vertical diameter of the cup and disc was also measured using a precalibrated <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer.</b> The suspect eyes were subjected to histological analysis to confirm the presence of specific glaucomatous changes. Results: A total of 202 eyes from 119 donors (68 males and 51 females, aged 42 – 96) were evaluated for glaucoma. Among them, 190 (94 %) eyes showing vertical CDR in the of 0. 0 – 0. 6 range were considered nonglaucomatous and the remaining eyes with > 0. 6 as glaucoma suspect. The calculated mean CDR of the two groups (0. 3 ± 0. 16, 0. 62 ± 0. 27) was highly significant (P = 0. 0003). Of 12 eyes suspected of glaucoma, 7 eyes from 5 donors showed specific glaucomatous changes by histology. The prevalence of glaucoma was 4. 2 % among the donors studied. Conclusions: A simple method of screening fresh donor eyes for selecting those with glaucoma features using CDR and histological analysis was reported. This method helps to obtain biologically active human ocular tissue for glaucoma research on gene expression, ultrastructural/proteome changes, and outflow mechanism...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Extensive {{collections}} of frogs from Queensland (reported in detail, Straughan, 1966) failed {{to include the}} species Cyclorana inermis (Peters), although Slevin (1955) recorded it as abundant in central Queensland. However a widely ranging species of ground Hyla (undescribed in that genus) occurred frequently in collections from central and northern Queensland. In all external features this species fitted the description of Cyclorana inermis given by Parker (1940 : 17). In the present paper Peters' syntype of C. inermis (reg. no. RMNH 1888) in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, is examined, and compared with the apparently new species of Hyla. MATERIAL AND METHODS X-ray plates of {{the feet of the}} syntype were provided by the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historic X-rays of five specimens of Hyla sp. were made by the X-ray section of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy, University of Queensland. A further ten specimens were cleared and stained with Toluidine Blue and Alizarin Red S. to distinguish bone from cartilage. All measurements were made with vernier calipers to the nearest 0. 1 mm or with an <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer</b> to the nearest 0. 01 mm. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Examination of the digits of the syntype of Cyclorana inermis by X-ray (plate 1) established the presence of intercalary cartilages and claw shaped terminal phalanges which are characters diagnostic of the family Hylidae in the Procoelous Anura. The osteology of the feet of the syntype is exactly the same as in all 15 specimens of Hyla sp. examined. In all other character...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study, {{measurements}} of lengths, diameters, {{and numbers of}} vessels contained in a peripheral vascular bed from distributing artery to arterial capillaries {{were made in the}} living animal. 1 From the data, total cross-sectional areas of the various portions of the arterial tree were calculated and compared with values from similar measurements of vessels in fixed tissue. In the living animal, a linear increment in total cross-sectional area was found from artery to arterial capillary, differing markedly from the long accepted concept of small increases in total area from artery to arteriole followed by a tremendous increase in area {{at the level of the}} capillaries. It was suggested at that time that the wide variance in results of the two studies was due mainly to inaccurate estimates in fixed tissue of the numbers of the various types of vessels, especially the capillaries. Further considera-tion reveals that vessel diameters may be a more important factor in accounting for the variance. In this paper, lengths, diameters, and num-bers of the collecting vessels are presented, thus completing measurements of a total vas-cular bed from a major distributing artery to its accompanying vein in the living animal. Comparisons are made with similar measure-ments and computations from fixed tissue. 2 Methods The site used for measurements of the collect-ing vessels was the wing of the common brown bat (Myotis). The vessels in this subcutaneous area were observed in the intact, unanesthetized animal. An <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer</b> was used to meas-ure the length and inside diameter of the vessel...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the potency of Centella asiatica extract to induce {{proliferation}} andneurogenesis process of newborn rats cortex cerebri.   Research has been conducted on in vitro culture ofthree days old rat (Sprague Dawley) cerebrum cells in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modiûed Eagle’s Medium) containing 10 % NEAA (Non Essential Amino Acid), 1 mM NaHCO 3, 10 % NBCS (Newborn Calf Serum) and 50 µg/mL gentamycin (mDMEM), with and without Centella asiatica (CA) leaf extracts. The experimentwas set in five groups of treatment consisted of positive control (mDMEM+ 30 µg/mL asiaticoside (AC)),negative control (mDMEM), and mDMEM with three concentration of CA extract i. e. 100 ppm, 200 ppmand 400 ppm. Culture was done in 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37 oC for six days. The parameters observed werecells proliferation based on Population Doubling Time (PDT), neuron and glia composition, and the lengthof axon and dendrite. Cells concentration were counted using Newbauer hemocytometer.  Neuron and gliacells were determined based on morphology after Hematoxylin-Eosin staining, and the length of axon anddendrite were measured using <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer.</b> Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Duncan test. The results showed that Centella asiatica extract at concentration 100 ppm could induce neurogenesisand increased the axon length growth.  However, at concentration 200 and 400 ppm, CA extract  inhibitedthe neuronal cells proliferation and the axonal growth (P< 0, 05). In conclusion, induction of Centella asiaticaextracts at concentration of 100 ppm on the cortex cell cerebrum cells culture increase the axon lengthgrowth and tends to induce neurogenesis; however at higher concentration CA extract was neurotoxic...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY – The aim was {{to analyze}} the {{regulation}} of growth and tissue differentiation in a unique in vitro culture model of gastrulating mammalian embryo by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) during two weeks. They both {{play a crucial role}} during embryogenesis and {{the purpose of this study}} was to test their possible synergistic influence in the period when mammalian embryos are extremely sensitive to external factors. We cultivated 9. 5 -day-old rat embryos on metal grid supported lens paper, at the air-liquid interface in culture medium (Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) with 50 % of homologous serum) with the addition of FGF, NGF and a combination of FGF/NGF in a time frame of 9 days. Other three groups of embryos were for 24 hours pretreated with 5 -azacytidine (5 azaC), an agent that can activate repressed genes. A parallel group of nontreated control embryos were cultivated with each experimental group. During 14 days of culture embryos grown in teratoma-like explants and growth rate were evaluated by measuring average size of explants using an <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer</b> on days 5, 7, 11 and 14 after the addition of growth factors. Differences between respective groups were estimated by Student’s t-test. Differentiated tissues were estimated on serial histologic sections. χ 2 -test or Fisher exact test were used to compare the proportion of tissues between respective groups. In embryo-derived teratomas NGF or FGF/ NGF combination used within the 9 day time frame did not stimulate differentiation of any kind of tissues...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY To help {{assess the}} microcirculatory {{component}} in the etiology of hypertension, blood flow, vessel diameter, {{and the distribution of}} blood flow in the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) microvasculature of the rat cremaster muscle have been determined in 7 - to 8 -week-old animals. By direct microscopic observation of the cremaster muscle, blood velocity (dual-slit method), arterial diameters (<b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer),</b> and blood flow calculated from these measurements were determined in each of five arterial branching orders from the entering artery (first order) to the terminal arteriole (fifth order). These measurements as well as the determination of the lengths between consecutive branches were made under con-trol conditions and following the application of 1 mM adenosine to produce a dilated vasculature. Under con-trol conditions, total cremaster blood flow in the SHR (11. 1 ± 1. 0 ml/min/ 100 g) was less than in the WKY group (21. 1 ± 2. 3); the distribution of total blood flow to each branching order was less in the SHR; and the arterial vessel diameters in the SHR group were smaller than the WKY counterparts except in the fifth order arteries. After dilation, blood flow increased in both groups, but flow in the SHR remained significantly less than in the WKY (27. 0 ± 1. 9 ml/min/ 100 g vs 45. 5 ± 4. 2). In spite of this, the control state flow differences beyond the second order vessels were eradicated by the dilation as were the diameter differences except in the first order vessel. Finally, under both control and dilated conditions, the distances between consecutive vesse...|$|R
40|$|Female SENCAR mice {{were treated}} with aqueous {{solutions}} of hypochlorous acid (HOCI), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorine dioxide (Cl 02), and monochloramine (NH 2 Cl) by whole body exposure (except head) for a 10 -min period for 4 days in the first experiment and for 1 day (except NH 2 Cl) in the second experiment. Animals were sacrificed the day following the last treatment (experiment 1) or on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 12 following treatment (experiment 2), and skin thickness was measured by light microscopy at x 400 by use of an <b>eyepiece</b> <b>micrometer.</b> Concentrations of disinfectants were 1, 10, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/L, for experiment 1 and 1000 mg[L for experiment 2. Thickness of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) for control animals was 15. 4 ± 1. 5,um. Mter 4 days of treatment at 1000 mg/L, HOCI and C 102 increased thickness to 39 ± 7. 0 and 40. 2 ± 11. 8, and NaOCl increased thickness to 25. 2 ± 6. 1,m. Only HOCl and C 102 were tested at 300 mgIL, yielding an IFE thickness of 30. 0 ± 13. 1 and 16. 8 ± 0. 8,um, respectively. The response to HOCI {{was found to be}} dose-related; the minimally effective dose was 100 mg/L. In earlier, preliminary tests to determine optimum treatment schedule, the response to HOCI appeared to be maximal after 4 days of treatment and tended to decrease with further treatment. The time-course study following a single treatment of 1000 mg/L HOCI, however, showed a progression of IFE thickening of from 18. 3 ± 1. 4 at 1 day to 30. 8 ± 8. 0 at 8 days, decreasing to 19. 1 ± 6. 2,um at 12 days. ClO 2 and NaOCl when tested in this manner did not produce increased thickness of IFE with time, but rather gave a persistent level of increase that remained for the 12 days. NH 2 Cl reduced skin thickness to 13. 6 ± 6. 1,m. Examination of sections of skin treated with HOCI and Cl 02 indicated an increase in cell numbers. HOCI and C 102 are therefore capable of inducing hyperplastic responses in the mouse skin. The basis for the decrease in skin thickness resulting from NH 2 Cl treatment remains to be established...|$|R
