40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the influence of aerodynamic forces (aerodynamic uplift) on the <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> acting between a pantograph and the contact wire. The analysis consists of experimental tests and CFD simulations, performed in both wind tunnel and on-track scenarios. A method for the computation of the aerodynamic uplift and for the assessment of the contact force imbalance between the leading and trailing collectors is proposed. The method is based on the virtual work principle, and exploits both the numerical forces resulting from CFD analysis, and the Jacobian terms obtained from a kinematic analysis of the pantograph. The proposed model takes into account stationary phenomena, and it is fully validated by means of experimental results...|$|E

In an effort to investigate the effectiveness of such an impact mitigation measure, preliminary tests were carried out: First, the dynamic response was recorded without pounding, and second, the test structure was placed with gap separation and pounding was induced. Absolute acceleration, relative excursion, <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force,</b> coefficient of restitution, and dissipated energy were recorded at steady state and the excitation frequency range for pounding occurrences was determined.

30|$|The {{contact force}} between the {{pantograph}} and catenary of straddle-type monorail {{should be in}} the range of 44 – 79  N in the whole working stroke, and in the range of 59 − 10 + 10  N in normal working positions. Therefore, according to evaluation index system in this study, the maximum contact force between the pantograph and catenary should be less than 79  N, the minimum contact force between the pantograph and catenary should be greater than 44  N, and the optimum <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> should also be in the range of 59 − 10 + 10  N [2]. The standard deviation of contact force directly reflects the fluctuation range of contact forces. The smaller the standard deviation is, the smaller the fluctuation range of the contact force is, and the better the power collection quality.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} particle-scale {{origin of the}} {{additional}} shear strength of unsaturated granular materials in pendular states induced by the capillary effect by applying the stress-force-fabric (SFF) relationship theory to unsaturated granular material stress analysis. The work is based on discrete element simulations with the particle interaction model modified to incorporate the capillary effect. By decomposing the total stress tensor into a contact stress tensor originating from <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> and a capillary stress tensor due to the capillary effect, the directional statistics of particle-scale information are examined. The observations are used to support {{the choice of the}} appropriate analytical approximations for the directional distributions associated with the solid skeleton and water bridges. The SFF relationship for unsaturated granular materials is formulated, and is shown to match the material stress state with good accuracy and is used to interpret the material strength in terms of the relevant microparameters. Macro and micro observations are carried out on both relatively dense and loose samples in triaxial shearing path to the critical state. The capillary force remains nearly isotropic during triaxial shearing. Anisotropy in the water bridge probability density, however, develops alongside the anisotropy in contact normal density, which decreases when the suction level decreases and the water content increases. The anisotropy effect in the water phase is much smaller than the solid skeleton, and a coupling effect with the solid phase makes the fabric anisotropy in wet materials smaller than that in dry materials. Combined with the SFF function, the increased solid coordination numbers and <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> by the water bridge effect are more important factors for the suction-induced shear strength.

40|$|Advanced ceramic {{materials}} have been extensively used in aerospace, automobile and other industries. However, {{the reliability of}} the advanced ceramics is the major concern because of the brittle nature of the materials. This work aims to model silicon nitride ceramics using Discrete Element Method (DEM) and simulating the crack formation and propagation. DEM software package PFC 2 D is used to simulate indentation test and four point bending test on silicon nitride ceramics and the behaviour of crack formation and propagation is identified. The numerical representation of {{ceramic materials}} is done by generating a densely packed particle system using the specimen genesis procedure and then applying the suitable microparameters to the particle system. Indentation test has been performed on the sample with different loading forces and the width and depth of cracks generated have been studied. Four point bending test has been simulated and the fracture origins has been identified. Simulation of four point bending test is performed on sample having no defects, sample having manufacturing-induced defects like cracks, and sample having material-inherent flaws like voids. For the above cases the initiation and propagation of defects is simulated and the <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> on the loading ball is also obtained and plotted.

40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between pantograph and overhead line (OHL) heavily influences {{the quality of}} the current collection that, on one side assures the correct power transmission from the contact wire to the electrical traction drives of the vehicle, {{and on the other side}} affects the amount of wear of both the contact wire of the OHL and the collector strips of the pantograph. Moreover the dynamics of pantograph-catenary coupled system is a mandatory topic when considering the interoperability issues, among which there is the requirement of the assessment of the quality of interaction between a pantograph running on a catenary belonging to a network different from its original one. Usually a pantograph is optimised and set-up for a given category of OHL, but it is not assured that running under different catenaries allows to obtain the same performances. To this purpose the key option is to perform test runs. Nevertheless an analysis before test trials would be very useful for a first evaluation of a new pantograph-OHL combination, enabling to save time and cost of the experimental runs. A first possibility, nowadays widely used especially in the design stage of new catenaries, is to perform numerical simulations by means of a validated numerical model, e. g. according to EN 50318. As an auxiliary option, a hardware in the loop (HIL) indoor set-up can be used in order to analyse the dynamic behaviour of a real pantograph coupled with a overhead line (OHL), virtually simulated in real time. This work focuses on the analysis of the correspondences between indoor test carried out on a pantograph, and the results that are obtained during test runs on the real line. The laboratory tests are fundamentally of two types: classical sinusoidal tests (step sine or sweep sine) and tests with HIL set-up. The results of both approaches are compared with on track test results considering the influence pantograph <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and contact wire mechanical tension. The potentialities of HIL approach as a useful tool for an effective application of the virtual homologation concept are pointed out...|$|E
40|$|In this investigation, the pantograph/catenary {{contact is}} {{examined}} using two different formulations. The first is an elastic contact formulation {{that allows for}} the catenary/panhead separation and {{for the analysis of}} the effect of the aerodynamic forces, while the second approach is based on a constraint formulation that does not allow for such a separation by eliminating the freedom of relative translation in two directions at the catenary/panhead contact point. In this study, the catenary system, including the contact and messenger wires, is modeled using the nonlinear finite element (FE) absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) and flexible multibody system (MBS) algorithms. The generalized aerodynamic forces associated with the ANCF position and gradient coordinates and the pantograph reference coordinates are formulated. The new elastic contact formulation used in this investigation is derived from the constraint-based sliding joint formulation previously proposed by the authors. By using a unilateral penalty force approach, separation of the catenary and panhead is permitted, thereby allowing for better evaluating the response of the pantograph/catenary system to wind loading. In this elastic contact approach, the panhead is assumed to have six degrees-of-freedom with respect to the catenary. The coordinate system at the pantograph/catenary contact point is chosen such that the contact model developed in this study can be used with both the fully parameterized and gradient deficient ANCF elements. In order to develop a more realistic model, the MBS pantograph model is mounted on a detailed three-dimensional MBS rail-vehicle model. The wheel/rail contact is modeled using a nonlinear three-dimensional elastic contact formulation that accounts for the creep forces and spin moment. In order to examine the effect of the external aerodynamic forces on the pantograph/catenary interaction, two scenarios are considered in this investigation. In the first scenario, the crosswind loading is applied on the pantograph components only, while in the second scenario, the aerodynamic forces are applied on the pantograph components and also on the flexible catenary. For the configuration considered in this investigation, {{it was found that the}} crosswind assists the uplift force exerted on the pantograph mechanism, increasing the <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> value. Numerical results are presented in order to compare between the cases with and without the wind forces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{employed}} {{the theory of}} directional statistics to study the stress state of granular materials from the particle scale. The work {{was inspired by the}} stress–force–fabric relationship proposed by Rothenburg and Bathurst (1989), which represents a fundamental effort to establish analytical macro–micro relationship in granular mechanics. The micro-structural expression of the stress tensor σij= 1 V∑c∈Vvicfjc, where fic is the contact force and vic is the contact vector, was transformed into directional integration by grouping the terms with respect to their contact normal directions. The directional statistical theory was then employed to investigate the statistical features of contact vectors and contact forces. By approximating the directional distributions of contact normal density, <b>mean</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and mean contact vector with polynomial expansions in unit direction vector n, the directional dependences were characterized by the coefficients of the polynomial functions, i. e., the direction tensors. With such approximations, the directional integration was achieved by means of tensor multiplication, leading to an explicit expression of the stress tensor in terms of the direction tensors. Following the terminology used in Rothenburg and Bathurst (1989), the expression was referred to as the stress–force–fabric (SFF) relationship. Directional statistical analyses were carried out based on the particle-scale information obtained from discrete element simulations. The result demonstrated a small but isotropic statistical dependence between contact forces and contact vectors. It has also been shown that the directional distributions of contact normal density, mean contact forces and mean contact vectors can be approximated sufficiently by polynomial expansions in direction n up to 2 nd, 3 rd and 1 st ranks, respectively. By incorporating these observations and revoking the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor, the stress–force–fabric relationship was further simplified, while its capacity of providing nearly identical predictions of the stresses was maintained. The derived SFF relationship predicts the complete stress information, including the mean normal stress, the deviatoric stress ratio as well as the principal stress directions. The main benefits of deriving the stress–force–fabric relationship based on the directional statistical theory are: (1) the method does not involve space subdivision and does not require a large number of directional data; (2) the statistical and directional characteristics of particle-scale directional data can be systematically investigated; (3) the directional integration can be converted into and achieved by tensor multiplication, an attractive feature to conduct computer program aided analyses...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{shoulder}} load during handcycling and wheelchair propulsion under similar conditions of external power in persons with spinal cord injury. Design: Cross-sectional. Subjects: Eight men with spinal cord injury. Methods: Kinetics and kinematics were measured during handbike and wheelchair propulsion at 25, 35, 45 and 55 W on a treadmill. Shoulder load (glenohumeral <b>contact</b> <b>forces,</b> relative muscle forces) was calculated with the Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model. Results: At all power output levels, glenohumeral <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> {{were significantly lower}} during handcycling compared with wheelchair propulsion (p < 0. 001). At 55 W, the <b>mean</b> glenohumeral <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> was 345 N for handcycling, whereas it was 585 N for wheelchair propulsion. Also, relative muscle forces were lower during handcycling.

Conclusion: Due to continuous force application in handcycling, shoulder load was lower compared with wheelchair propulsion. Furthermore, muscles that are prone to overuse injuries were less stressed during handcycling. Therefore, handcycling may be a good alternative for outdoor mobility and may help prevent overuse injuries of the shoulder complex. © 2012 The Authors...|$|R

They are easy to transport and more and more newly developed materials cannot stand the process of traditional casting, like energetic materials and bio-materials, but will survive the powder compaction process. Having {{a better understanding of the}} microstructure development of granular systems during compaction process, especially for particles that will heavily deform under loading, will give an insight of how to better process the powders to produce materials with overall better performance comparing to bulk materials. The main theory and mechanism applied are Hertz law and nonlocal contact formulation. Hertz law considers <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> as completely local, which <b>means</b> the <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> are independent. Nonlocal contact formulation removes this assumption and considers the effect of all the forces acting on one single particle, which extends the theory to granular systems at high relative density. Simulated results using both Hertz theory and nonlocal contact formulation are expected to differ more and more as the relative density increase, or with lower material modulus and higher Poisson ratio and the results from nonlocal contact formulation are expected to better match the experimental data. Hertz theory does not hold when the material is heavily deform since contacts are not independent anymore. When investigating into a granular system of soft particles, nonlocal contact formulation is a more precise model.

By contrast, quantities such as P, τ and Z are strongly hysteretic functions of the strain, ϵ. We find that the distributions of normal and tangential forces, when expressed in terms of the appropriate means, are essentially independent of strain. We close by analyzing a subset of shear data in terms of strong and weak force networks. Comment: 10 pages and 28 figure...|$|R

These <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> were compared to measured hip <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> [3]. The results showed that <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> were overestimated, especially when muscle forces were calculated using computed muscle control. For static optimization, results were closest to measured <b>contact</b> <b>forces.</b> Also, differences between measured and calculated <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> were dependent on the movement analyzed...|$|R

In this study, <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> equations {{that account for}} beam tip deflection and electric contact material defor-mation are derived. Tip deflection is modeled analyti-cally using beam bending theory and contact material deformation is modeled as elastic, plastic, or elastic-plastic. Contact resistance predictions, based on Maxwellian theory and newly derived <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> equations, are compared to experimental results. <b>Contact</b> <b>force</b> pre-dictions not considering tip deflection or material defor-mation overestimate <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and result in under-estimated contact resistance.

Additionally, other nonlinear <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> models are briefly presented. The <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> models are mostly developed based on the Hertzian theory, augmented with terms to accommodate the energy dissipation associated with the con-tact-impact process. The main differences and similarities among these continuous <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> models are discussed by utilizing an application example based on the externally collision between two spherical solids, and a comparative study of the various <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> models is presented.
