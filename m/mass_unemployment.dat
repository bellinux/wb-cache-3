5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment.</b> During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was essentially a rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E
5|$|Following Germany's {{defeat in}} World War I, hyperinflation, <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment,</b> poverty, crime and civil unrest plagued the country.

In 1920, it {{changed its name to}} the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP). It rejected the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and advocated antisemitism and anti-Bolshevism.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the factors influencing self employment and income among one hundred 100 agribusiness households in Abia State, Nigeria. In analyzing the factors influencing agribusiness household self employment and income, the level and the areas of self employment were also examined. Data for the analysis were collected using structured questionnaire and interview schedule. Descriptive statistics, probit regression and ordinary least square regression were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results from the analyses showed that self employment is common among the males. Education, age, gender, distances, landholding, size of household and value of livestock were significant variables that influenced self employment and income respectively. It was generally accepted that self employment is needful to alleviate the <b>masses</b> <b>unemployment</b> problem and to achieve food security goal of the nations especially Nigeria. It is therefore, recommended that the governmental and non governmental organizations, communities, individuals and corporate bodies should put in place policies that will make land and education available to the masses at a least cost to boost innovations and creativity development...|$|R
5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> among landless peasants {{during the}} Eastern Han period.

In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.|$|E

30|$|Increase in rural–urban {{inequality}} and <b>mass</b> agricultural <b>unemployment</b> alter de facto political power, which influenced de jure political power to reduce top income tax rates, among other things, and this worsened inequality. High {{inequality and}} forced savings during WWI created a large pool of loanable funds {{that did not}} find profitable avenues in agriculture, and the newly emerging industrial sector was insufficient to exploit the excess savings. These {{gave way to the}} unfortunate idea of cheap credit or buy now and pay later. Consequently, this created a debt-induced growth model since consumption expenditures exceeded the declining agricultural and urban incomes.|$|R
5|$|The {{depression}} of the 1930s brought <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> to Sunderland. But, for the Echo, {{it was also a}} time of important structural changes in ownership. A new company controlling the three titles owned by the Storey family was formed in 1934—Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd. There was a change in name for the Echo too, when the word Daily was dropped from its title of Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette. The decade also, however, brought a fire which destroyed most of the bound files of archive copies of the Echo. Nineteenth-century editions of the Echo can only be accessed in Sunderland at the City Centre Library in Fawcett Street.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment,</b> pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party {{then began to}} eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.|$|E
40|$|A radical {{proposal}} to address decisively {{the problem of}} <b>mass</b> involuntary <b>unemployment,</b> {{by way of a}} government committing itself to stand ready as 'employer of last resort', has recently been put forward by L. Randall Wray and others. To the question of how such large-scale policies would be financed, there has been a suggestion that issuing outside money would suffice. This review employs some simple modelling to show the limits to 'printing money' as a means of financing such an employment policy. The review also critically scrutinizes the claim that the policy can simultaneously act as an antiinflationary device, as well as some other aspects of the proposals. ...|$|R

During these years, Mujib developed an affinity for socialism as the solution to <b>mass</b> poverty, <b>unemployment,</b> and poor living conditions. On 26 January 1949 the government announced that Urdu would be the only official state language of Pakistan, although Bengali was the majority language in East Pakistan. Though still in jail, Mujib encouraged fellow activist groups to launch strikes and protests; he undertook a hunger strike for 13 days.|$|R
5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that the nation would slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the workhouse {{can be traced to}} the Poor Law Act of 1388, which {{attempted}} to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. But <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates, who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market. Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing bones to produce fertiliser, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike, perhaps the origin of the workhouse's nickname.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment,</b> pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions.

40|$|Leadership {{has been}} {{conceptualized}} variedly {{in the literature}} with various implications for those who lead and the people and organizations they lead. In this paper a thorough appraisal {{of the literature on}} the evolving conceptualization of leadership and its specific implication for leadership in vocational technical education is presented. A case is made in the paper that though vocational technical education is part of general education, it differs in many significant ways, hence the need to assess its leadership uniquely from that of general education. This study is particularly important because of the significance of vocational technical education as a conduit in the provision of practical know-how, first, {{for the good of the}} society, and second, for addressing the <b>mass</b> educated <b>unemployment</b> prevalent in many economies these days. Vocational technical education, no doubt, will fall short of meeting its mandate without effective leadership. </span...|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} Belarus {{has been in}} a state of flux since Lukashenko's {{election}} in 1994. His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment.</b> The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24million. The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011. One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies, such as the euro, US dollar and the Russian ruble {{in order to maintain the}} stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of devaluation. A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank. Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources, and while it has received loans from China, receiving loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according to standards set by the IMF and other agencies.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced <b>mass</b> <b>unemployment</b> after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little {{could be further from the}} truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the cost-effectiveness of different modes of occupational training, focusing primarily on employer-sited training, occupational training within formal education, and out of school center-based training. The literature can be divided into two categories: studies which have attempted to measure in quantitative terms the benefits and costs of different modes of training, and qualitative studies which have examined non-measurable aspects of cost-effectiveness. Among the conclusions brought to light are: that schools should be responsible for teaching basic skills and the theoretical aspects of vocational training, and employers should be responsible for the practical end - with on-the-job training supplemented in some cases by training at training centers. Institutionalized pre-employment training for entry-level jobs is less cost-effective - despite wishful thinking that it provides an easy solution to the problems of <b>mass</b> youth <b>unemployment.</b> Teaching and Learning,Curriculum&Instruction,Vocational&Technical Education,Gender and Education,Primary Education...|$|R
40|$|The {{discourse}} of disengagement has achieved ascendancy just as young people’s employment prospects have declined – {{in many countries}} to crisis levels. Conceptualising and interpreting young people’s non-particiapiton in dominant modes of education, training and employment has been a preoccupation of academics, policy-makers and journalists. This paper offers a critical analysis of the {{discourse of}} disengagement. It queries the primacy of particiapiton as the dominant policy response to <b>mass</b> youth <b>unemployment,</b> identifies some paradoxes of this policy priority, and locates them within a political-economic analysis of youth unemployment. It proposes a view of prevailing policy responses {{as a mode of}} governance of problematised populations of young ‘non-participants’. By juxtaposing two ostensibly incompatible analytical frameworks, the paper draws attention to some potentially illuminating tensions between materialist and governmentalist analyses of dominant policy responses to ‘disengagement’, and considers how these might be exploited in researching and re-conceptualising non-participation. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{challenging}} {{problem in}} some developing {{countries such as}} Nigeria is inadequate training of students in effective problem solving using the core concepts of their disciplines. Related to this is a disconnection between their learning and socio-economic development agenda of a country. These problems are more vivid in statistical education which is dominated by textbook examples and unbalanced assessment ‘for’ and ‘of’ learning within traditional curricula. The problems impede the achievement of socio-economic development objectives such as those stated in the Nigerian Vision 2020 blueprint and United Nations Millennium Development Goals. They also impoverish the ability of (statistics) graduates to creatively use their knowledge in relevant business and industry sectors, thereby exacerbating <b>mass</b> graduate <b>unemployment</b> in Nigeria and similar developing countries.
