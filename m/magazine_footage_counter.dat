50|$|On a {{practical}} level, synchros resemble motors, {{in that there}} is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, <b>footage</b> <b>counters,</b> and projectors.|$|R
5000|$|Millennium (1997): The Panaflex Millennium is a sync-sound 35 mm {{motion picture}} camera. Where the Panavision Platinum was mostly an {{evolution}} and refinement {{of the original}} 1972 Panaflex, the Millennium is a totally new design, having a new twin-sprocket drum incorporated with the movement, major electronics revisions, and a general weight reduction from 24 to 17 lb. The Millennium is capable of 3-50 fps forward and reverse, though reverse running requires a reversing magazine, {{and it has a}} focal-plane shutter, the aperture angle of which can be adjusted electronically while the camera is running, between 11.2° and 180°, allowing for four stops of exposure ramping within a shot with no iris adjustment. All of the focus, iris, and zoom motor controls have been moved to the camera's internal circuitry, removing the need for cumbersome external circuit boxes, and it has an integrated camera built into the lens light, allowing the first assistant camera to see witness marks without having to physically look at the lens. It also has a brighter viewfinder than the Platinum, multiple run switches, and <b>footage</b> <b>counters</b> {{on either side of the}} camera for easier readings.|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell Standard {{35mm camera}} - The {{original}} Mitchell rackover pin-registered studio camera, introduced in 1920 as a hand-cranked silent film camera. (The rackover device allowed the camera portion with its side-mounted viewfinder to be [...] "racked over" [...] upon its base, either {{left or right}} of the taking lens by turning {{a handle on the}} rear of the camera base. By racking to the right, the operator would focus the lens upon a ground glass element seen through the viewfinder. By racking back to the left, the camera with its film would be brought into position to record the view of the now focused lens). This standard model came with a 4-lens turret, a matte box on rails mounted {{to the front of the}} camera, and options included a veeder film <b>footage</b> <b>counter,</b> behind the lens iris, 4-way adjustable frame mattes, automatic or hand dissolve, internal matte disk with 9 pre-cut mattes including 1/2 frame, circles, keyhole, binocular, and oval. Various improvements and available options on this model took place over subsequent years, including a frames-per-second film speed meter, addition of a side-view parallax finder with upright view, various electric motors including variable speed, constant speed, and synchronized motors. The talking pictures introduced in 1926 soon required this somewhat noisy camera to run quieter with the so-called [...] "silent" [...] film movements, and soon thereafter a higher-speed [...] "silent" [...] movement and follow-focus devices were made available.|$|R

These narratives are shaped and disseminated by dominant legal, media, educational and economic institutions. It is these very narratives that activist video <b>footage</b> aims to <b>counter.</b> Witnessing is, {{in the words of}} Peters (2001) “an extraordinary moral and cultural force” for social change.|$|R

40|$|Ana Araujo curated this {{exhibition}} exploring {{the relationship between}} two seminal figures in twentieth-century design. Lina Bo Bardi (1914 – 1992), {{best known for the}} buildings she designed and built in Brazil, was a prolific designer, architect, writer and curator, deeply committed to the promotion of the social and cultural potential of architecture. Before adopting Brazil as her home country in the late 1940 s, Bo Bardi lived in Milan, where she collaborated with the renowned architect Gio Ponti (1891 – 1979). Ponti is perhaps better known as the founding editor of the celebrated design magazine Domus. Like Bo Bardi, he was a productive architect, designer, writer and curator. The exhibition comprised material sourced from archives in Milan (Italy), São Paulo (Brazil), Lisbon (Portugal) and London (UK) – original drawings by Lina Bo Bardi and Gio Ponti, letters exchanged between the two, <b>magazines,</b> film <b>footage.</b> It also displayed a selection of specially commissioned photographs by Spanish photographer Inigo Bujedo Aguirre...|$|R
50|$|The objects usually {{involve some}} kind of bricolage; {{combining}} two or more objects from Western Africa and their Western equivalent to talk about electricity, infrastructure, access and the reciprocal influences between technology and cultures. Similarly, her computer montages and video collage works bring together both video and photographs she shoots herself and found materials from commercials, <b>magazines</b> and archival <b>footage.</b> Meaning for Tuggar seems to lie in these juxtapositions which explore how media affects our daily lives. Overall Tuggar’s work uses strategies of deconstruction to challenge our perceptions and attachments to accustomed ways of looking. Her body of work conflates ideas about race, gender and class; disturbing our notions of subjectivity. Her work reflects her multifaceted identity and challenges {{the idea of a}} homogeneous Africa.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Grant won one of skateboarding’s {{most coveted}} awards, Thrasher Magazine Skater of The Year award. Grant won the award over other stand out skaters of 2011, {{including}} Nyjah Huston, Dennis Busenitz and Brandon Westgate. Several reasons attribute to Grant’s award of Skater of the Year. At {{the outset of}} 2011, Grant attained to back-to-back covers (January & February) for Thrasher magazine, an attribute previously only held by professional skateboarder Neil Blender. 2011 also marked the second year Grant would attend the Thrasher King of the Road contest tour event and his second Thrasher Skate Rock tour. While other contenders for the Skater of the Year award were taking the more traditional route of competing in contest after contest, and seeking mainstream attention from the skateboarding world, Grant utilized the more traditional and humble modes of coverage, mainly sticking to print <b>magazines,</b> video <b>footage</b> and word-of-mouth. In honor of Grant winning the skater {{of the year award}} his primary and longest serving sponsor Volcom released a statement and tribute to Taylor, “These last few years Grant put it in hyper drive, truly a calculated adrenalin junky in constant attack mode. We are simply pleased as punch that Grant is now Thrasher Magazine’s SKATER of the YEAR! Being alongside him, watching him grow up and become who he is today has been nothing short of incredible. We at VOLCOM all say Congratulations and wish you the best”. Grant’s professional shoe sponsor, Nike SB, also honored his achievement of what could be considered skate boarding’s most prestigious award by designing limited run team edition 2 shoes. The team editions 2’s are black suede, featuring a Skater of the Year ’11 and are showcased in a luxuriously engraved wooden shoe box. Only Grant, friends and family were awarded with the shoes.|$|R
