5|$|The {{rules of}} chess were amended {{to make this}} clear. Today, it is settled that the player must make that <b>move</b> (<b>or</b> resign). The same is true if an enpassant capture is the only move {{to get out of}} check.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to <b>move</b> <b>or</b> dead).|$|E
5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the <b>move</b> <b>or</b> while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E
50|$|For the fifty-move rule, {{a number}} {{representing}} one of 101 possibilities is needed: a pawn was just <b>moved</b> <b>or</b> a piece just captured, a pawn was <b>moved</b> <b>or</b> a piece was captured 1..99 <b>moves</b> ago, <b>or</b> a pawn was <b>moved</b> <b>or</b> a piece captured 100 <b>or</b> more <b>moves</b> ago. This fits in 7 bits.|$|R

5|$|Reverend Norman Balthus is Brother Justin's mentor. He rescued {{and raised}} young Justin and Iris {{after he had}} found them alone in the wilderness. Late in the first season, Norman grows {{suspicious}} of Brother Justin's inner motivations. He confronts his foster son but does not carry out Brother Justin's plea to kill him. At the beginning of season 2, Norman suffers a stroke leaving him unable to <b>move</b> <b>or</b> speak. He remains {{in the care of}} Brother Justin and Iris until the carnival sets up near Brother Justin's {{home at the end of}} the series. Ben heals Norman, but the reverend is fatally lacerated by Brother Justin seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Rowson cites as {{an example}} of the last {{phenomenon}} the well-regarded Zaitsev Variation of the Ruy Lopez. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves once with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. This puts Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) insist on the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play on with a different <b>move,</b> <b>or</b> (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to <b>move</b> <b>or</b> talk.|$|E

5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to <b>move</b> <b>or</b> smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot <b>move</b> <b>or</b> speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{slightly}} restricted in size {{due to its}} proximity to Cardiff Rugby Club's home in the adjacent smaller stadium within Cardiff Arms Park. The WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the new stadium, and the Millennium Commission would not allow any of its funds {{to be used in}} any way {{for the construction of a}} new stadium for Cardiff RFC. The WRU held talks with Cardiff RFC to see if it would be possible for the club to either <b>move</b> <b>or</b> secure funding for the Cardiff Arms Park to be re-developed, but these were unsuccessful. The stadium thus had to be completed with a break in its bowl structure in the North Stand, known colloquially as the Cardiff fault or Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, then chairman of the WRU and now a former president.|$|E

5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to <b>move</b> <b>or</b> change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E
5|$|Wimbledon's {{success as}} a club in the top flight of English {{football}} was founded on unorthodox financial management and judicious dealings in the transfer market. Rumours of a <b>move</b> <b>or</b> a merger with another London side persisted, leading the club's chief executive Colin Hutchinson to resign in 1987 amid talk of an amalgamation with Ron Noades's new club Crystal Palace or a groundshare at Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road ground in Shepherd's Bush. Wimbledon were granted planning permission to build a 20,000-seater ground in their home borough of Merton in 1988, soon after they won the FA Cup, but the site was instead made into a car park by a newly elected Labour council in 1990. Wimbledon's desire to move was made a necessity a year later, when the Taylor Report, which ordered the extensive redevelopment of football grounds, was released.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{released}} the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, {{at a price}} of JP¥44,800. Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special <b>move</b> <b>or</b> reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. Over to you, Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E
