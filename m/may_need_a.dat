25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy breathing {{is for the}} divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, but {{it is common for}} the receiver to be out of breath {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> few more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive and start the ascent, so buddy breathing training will usually include assisted ascents.

500|$|... "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, for her third studio album, Music Box (1993). It was released on May 31, 1994 through Columbia Records, as the fifth and final single from the album. The song is influenced by pop, R and gospel music genres. While the album focused heavily on pop oriented and radio friendly material, [...] "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] deviated from the formula, finishing as the only gospel-infused song on Music Box. Lyrically, the song's protagonist tells her love interest that anytime he <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> friend, she will be there unconditionally for him. Throughout the song's bridge and climax, critics noted the lyrics altering from those of a friend, to those of a lover.|$|E
500|$|Although Sharon {{also moved}} on, marrying Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Nick and Sharon remain in love. They kiss while Nick, {{suffering}} from amnesia, believes {{they are still}} married; Phyllis is jealous of Sharon, insulting her {{in an article in}} her magazine Restless Style. In January 2009, Nick and Sharon reunite in a sexual affair at the Abbott cabin, an event much anticipated by viewers. According to Case, Sharon wanted Nick more than anyone at the time but only if he left Phyllis; Morrow told TV Guide that although the reunion was [...] "messy", viewers wanted this for a long time. After another one-night stand Sharon becomes pregnant, briefly lying that Jack is the baby's father when Summer becomes ill and Phyllis needs Nick. Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother (Adam) and given to Ashley (Jack's sister). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed. Nick and Sharon are briefly engaged that November, but they break up when she sleeps with Adam and their relationship becomes bitter. Although Case and Morrow believe the couple belong together, they are apart for several years; during which they both believed a reunion wouldn't happen anytime soon. In late 2013, the characters begin to grow closer again despite the fact that Sharon secretly switched the paternity test results of Nick's daughter Summer; Case stated in an interview that Sharon is in [...] "constant turmoil" [...] regarding her secret, and Morrow stated that he believed a reunion was a possibility given Nick's vulnerability, saying: [...] "They've worked things out before—and they could work things out again. There is always a possibility for Nick and Sharon to get back together!"

2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that we <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> little time {{to know that it}} is also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties {{to those of us who}} lived in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast."

2500|$|While {{there are}} few {{scientific}} studies on the subject, the practice of butterfly gardening and creating [...] "Monarch Waystations" [...] is commonly thought to increase the populations of butterflies. [...] Efforts to increase monarch populations by establishing butterfly gardens and waystations require {{particular attention to the}} butterfly's food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate milkweed. For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarchs prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. As monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, A. syriaca needs to be cut back at least by half in June to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak. In addition, milkweed seed <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> period of cold treatment before it will germinate.|$|E
2500|$|Debt bondage is {{the most}} common form of slavery today. It is a {{condition}} in which a person “pledges him or herself against a loan of money, but the length and nature of the service is undefined, and the labor does not diminish the original debt.” [...] Debt bondage was included and defined as a form of slavery under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery. However, its many modern forms continue to include pawning, peonage, and worker debt. In India, debt bondage has been illegal since 1976; however, due to widespread poverty in the country, it continues to exist, as a man <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> loan to finance a wedding, funeral, medicine, fertilizer, or a fine. Because the interest rates on these debts as so high, debts are often inherited and children may replace their fathers or siblings. Debt bondage can also be incurred by specific industries – quarrying, carpet-making, agriculture, and fisheries – where the cost of equipment and supplies falls on the worker who needs a loan to pay for them.|$|E

2500|$|Corrective lenses {{are used}} to correct {{refractive}} errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (Hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> [...] "stronger", (i.e. more [...] refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which {{is caused by the}} eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Corrective lenses, to bring the image back into focus on the retina, are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. [...] A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. [...] Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.|$|E

Minkley stated that the inclusions of Pro features [...] "at once dramatically expand {{the potential of the}} game and fundamentally change the approach required to play and enjoy it". Reviewers appreciated the training modes, including their integration into the overall game's career progression and the breadth of material that is covered. Nina Shen Rastogi of Slate commented that Rock Band 3s training modes [...] helps to overcome the discouraging early period of trying to learn guitar as [...] "the gaming elements will mask the rote, homeworklike nature of the guitar training process". Kuchera noted that the modes were aimed at those who have some understanding of music theory already; [...] "If this is your first introduction to music theory, though, you <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> little more explanation", he concluded.
