5|$|After {{passing through}} Porthleven the path crosses the shingle bank of Loe Bar with the {{freshwater}} Loe Pool behind. At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by {{the radio station}} on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on <b>Mullion</b> Cove with <b>Mullion</b> Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588), the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse {{of which has been}} visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland.|$|E
5|$|The east front {{looks more}} medieval {{than the other}} sides but {{probably}} dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to be mostly sixteenth century. To {{the north of the}} house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled dormer windows, and a tall clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These buildings have <b>mullion</b> windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{north and}} south sides of the {{quadrangle}} have large arched carriage openings beneath shaped gables; the keystones are carved with horse's heads. The walls within the carriageway opening are decorated with bands of blue brick. The east, {{north and south}} faces are all finished with an openwork brick parapet with a stone coping. The west building has twelve arched openings accessed from the courtyard. The main storeys of the quadrangle mainly have three-light, stone-dressed <b>mullion</b> windows, with two-light windows at the attic level. All the roofs have tall octagonal chimneys and feature decorative ridge tiles. The interior of the stables block was rebuilt during the building's conversion to its present use of laboratories and offices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mullions</b> {{may be made}} of any material, but {{wood and}} {{aluminum}} are most common, although glass is also used between windows. I.M. Pei used all-glass <b>mullions</b> in his design of JFK Airport's Terminal 6 (National Airlines Sundrome), unprecedented at the time.|$|R
5000|$|This building, {{like many}} of his Chicago {{high-rise}} structures, causes controversy in the pure minimalist community due to its <b>mullions.</b> Mies is hailed as the father of [...] "less is more"; however, 860-880 Lake Shore Drive is covered in non-functional I-beam <b>mullions.</b> Mies explains how the <b>mullions</b> do not violate his less is more philosophy in a 1960 interview: [...] "To me structure is something like logic. It {{is the best way to}} do things and express them". The <b>mullions</b> on his buildings reflect the inner structure and therefore give truth to the aesthetic of the building. The idea of truth in architecture aligns with the aesthetic and principles of the international style as taught at the Bauhaus.|$|R

5|$|The plan of {{the house}} is unusual, partly because of its {{incorporation}} of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) façade. The elevations are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie {{at either end of the}} eastern and western sides. Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large <b>mullion</b> windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular.|$|E

50|$|This {{perpendicular}} linearity {{is particularly}} {{obvious in the}} design of windows, which became very large, sometimes of immense size, with slimmer stone <b>mullions</b> than in earlier periods, allowing greater scope for stained glass craftsmen. The <b>mullions</b> of the windows are carried vertically up into the arch moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by additional <b>mullions</b> (supermullions) and transoms, forming rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery. Buttresses and wall surfaces are likewise divided up into vertical panels. The technological development and artistic elaboration of the vault reached its pinnacle, producing intricate multipartite lierne vaults and culminating in the fan vault.|$|R

With the introduction of IMO Numbers in the late 1960s, Ardfinnan was allocated the IMO Number 5022716. In 1968, Ardfinnan was sold to <b>Mullion</b> & Co Ltd, Gibraltar and was renamed Court Harwell. She arrived at Hong Kong on 9 June 1969 for scrapping.|$|E

The window system is designed to promote verticality in the bays. The windows are three light vertical steel casements whose light colored vertical <b>mullions</b> are a visual design element. On the upper three floors, the windows are connected vertically by three-panel marble spandrels whose dividing rails form extensions of the window <b>mullions.</b> This presents an extremely vertical appearance where the two <b>mullions</b> extend upward continuously for three floors, separating the three story pilasters.|$|R

25|$|The {{first great}} {{exponent}} of Italian Renaissance architecture in England was Inigo Jones (1573–1652), {{who had studied}} architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the Queen's House at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at Whitehall three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with <b>mullion</b> windows, crenellations and turrets.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Belgian Captain {{was sold}} to Compagnie Maritime Belge SA and was renamed Capitain Lambe. Her Code Letters were changed to ONCC.

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was designed to have urban appeal with plain surfaces, clean lines and harmonious proportions. In order to avoid anonymity amongst other buildings, the structure features ornamentation with {{a strong sense of}} Sullivan's signature natural design motifs. Themes of dark brick and terra cotta ornamentation dominate the building's exterior design. The clean and simple lines and earth tones were intended to complement three unique ornamental terra cotta <b>mullions.</b> While at first glance, the <b>mullions</b> appear to be little more than creative personal flourish on the part of Sullivan, careful study of the building's structure reveals the genius behind the design. Sullivan used the ornamental <b>mullions</b> to visually correct imbalances in the building's proportions which were the result of designing the interior spaces first. Additionally, the decorative <b>mullions</b> serve to accentuate the height of the building and emphasize the wide spans of the interior aisles which made the building so unique.|$|R

She left on 4 July, and on 22 January 1799 Kingsmill was {{reported}} to be off the coast of Africa, with destination Dominica. She was still of the coast on 22 January. By 16 April she was at Martinique with destination Liverpool. She apparently carried 650 slaves, the second largest number of all Liverpool slave ships that sailed between 5 January 1798 and 5 January 1799.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{cross-arm}} of {{the church}} contains the altar, and also contains a half-round apse that is recognisable from outside. The apse contains a <b>mullion</b> which, like the two smaller windows next to the apse, is filled with colourful glass bricks. The red, green, yellow and blue glass bricks provide the only exterior light into the chancel, that is otherwise only lit through the opened doors of the iconostasis, or through it from the inner part {{of the church}}. North of the chancel, at the Northeast side of the building, is a narrow bell-gable with four bells that can be rung from outside using bell ropes.|$|E
25|$|All {{windows are}} lancets. The {{three in the}} north {{transept}} are very tall and have two quatrefoils above, while in the south transept two narrower windows with intricate tracery are separated by a thick <b>mullion.</b> There is also a quatrefoil and a sexfoil (six-lobed round window) in this wall. The aisles have three-light lancet windows, {{and there is a}} large lancet topped by a quatrefoil in the west wall of the nave. The Heaton, Butler and Bayne glass firm designed the stained glass in this window in 1892. Each lancet in the apse is separated by a thin stone shaft inside and out. This feature was copied from St Barnabas Church, Hove.|$|E
