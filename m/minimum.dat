5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the <b>minimum</b> spanning tree allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The {{root of the}} Cartesian tree represents the heaviest <b>minimum</b> spanning tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the <b>minimum</b> spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the <b>minimum</b> spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method that {{constructs}} and navigates {{a network of}} local <b>minima</b> of potential fields defined over multi-dimensional spaces. Though motivated by problems of motion planning for robotic manipulators, similar techniques have been proposed for use in other domains such as molecular chemistry and drug design. The method is based on building a roadmap of paths connecting local <b>minima</b> of a potential function. The novel approach consists of an up-hill search strategy used {{to climb out of}} local <b>minima</b> and find new nearby local <b>minima,</b> without doubling back on previous local <b>minima.</b> With this up-hill search strategy, one can find local <b>minima</b> otherwise difficult to encounter, and one can focus the search to specific local <b>minima</b> and specific directions from those local <b>minima.</b> The construction of the roadmap can be done in parallel with very little communication.
