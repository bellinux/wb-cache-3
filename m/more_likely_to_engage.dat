(In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E

The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and {{directed at the}} individual in their presence, with no regard for their feelings. Self-deprecating fat comments were much less common than those about or directed at another person. Male character were three times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engaged</b> in fat commentary than female characters.

The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} is that individuals are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> interact, <b>engage</b> and conduct transactions with other agents of similar religious, secular and expressive norms (Schelling 1971) and produce different co-evolutionary behavior via frequency and rate dynamics (McKelvey 1999).|$|R
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it {{plays an important role in}} word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E

Hare and Babiak noted that about 29 per cent of {{corporate}} psychopaths are also bullies. Other research has also shown that people with {{high scores on}} a psychopathy rating scale were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: An enriched {{environment}} (EE) facilitates physical, {{cognitive and}} social activity in animal models of stroke. The {{aim of this}} pilot {{study was to determine}} whether enriching the environment of a mixed rehabilitation unit increased stroke patient activity. Methods: A non- randomized controlled trial was conducted. Direct observation was used to determine the difference in change in physical, cognitive, social or any activity over 2 weeks in patients exposed to an enriched versus non-enriched environment. Results: Stroke patients in the EE (n[*]=[*] 15) were 1. 2 (95 % CI 1. 0 – 1. 4) times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> in any activity compared with those in a non-enriched environment (n[*]=[*] 14). They were 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 5) times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> in cognitive activities, 1. 2 (95 % CI 1. 0 – 1. 5) times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> in social activities, 0. 7 (95 % CI 0. 6 – 0. 9) times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be inactive and alone and 0. 5 (95 % CI 0. 4 – 0. 7) times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be asleep than patients without enrichment. Conclusions: This preliminary trial suggests that the comprehensive model of enrichment developed for use in a rehabilitation unit was effective in increasing activity in stroke patients and reducing time spent inactive and alone. Implications for Rehabilitation: Stroke patients within a mixed rehabilitation unit who are exposed to an enriched environment (EE) are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> in activity than those not exposed to the enriched environment. Patients in enriched conditions are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be “inactive and alone” or asleep during waking hours. These results suggest a comprehensive model of enrichment is effective in increasing activity levels...|$|R

25|$|Social {{psychological}} {{literature has}} found that the level of motivation one has to engage in an activity influences one’s behavior in a group setting. This finding, deemed the collective effort model by Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) details that individuals who are more motivated are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in social facilitation (that is, to increase one’s efforts when in the presence of others) whereas those who are less motivated are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in social loafing. Researchers have determined that two factors which determine an individual’s motivation, and subsequently whether or not the individual will resort to social loafing versus social facilitation, include the individual’s expectations about attaining the goal and the perceived value of the goal.|$|E
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or {{other people in the}} workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|In various species, such as {{the splendid}} fairywren, females benefit by mating with {{multiple}} males, thus producing more offspring of higher genetic quality. Females that are pair bonded to a male of poor genetic quality, {{as is the case}} in inbreeding, are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in extra-pair copulations in order to improve their reproductive success and the survivability of their offspring.|$|E

40|$|I {{conducted}} 10 one-hour {{observations in}} a Kindergarten classroom {{to determine if}} there were gender differences in the types of Rough and Tumble play (RTP) that children engaged in. Previous research reported that (a) boys were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than girls <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in RTP, (b) boys were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than girls <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in solitary forms of RTP, (c) girls were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than boys <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in collaborative forms of RTP, and (d) boys were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than girls <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in aggressive forms of RTP. My findings were similar to those of previous research. I found that boys participated in RTP more than girls and the forms of RTP engaged in by boys were more aggressive. I also found that boys engaged in more solitary RTP than girls, although both boys and girls engaged in more solitary than collaborative RTP. Unlike previous research findings, boys and girls in my study engaged in similar rates of collaborative RTP. I also found that the presence of one particular girl influenced the occurrence of collaborative mixed-gender RTP, which I refer to as the 2 ̆ 2 Amber Effect. 2 ̆ 2 The influence of one player on the likelihood of RTP occurring has not been reported in previous research.

Moreover, they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>engaging</b> in team citizenship behavior, going {{beyond the call of}} duty, picking up the slack for an absent colleague - all indirect effects of feeling more included in their workgroups (Prime & Salib, 2014).|$|R
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that men are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction {{may be more important}} to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that {{men and women who are}} involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|While doing {{research}} on sexual tendencies {{of women who have}} sex with women, one study, from the Journal of Bisexuality, concluded that bisexual women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in various high risk behaviors and were at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{higher rates}} of {{religious}} affiliation among immigrants and the expansive role of religious organizations in community life point to immigrant religious organizations' potential as an influential site for HIV/AIDS education. Using data from a study of Chinese immigrant religious organizations in New York City, this paper examines if specific forms of social capital are associated with an organization's likelihood {{of being involved in}} HIV/AIDS activities. We use survey and social network data to analyze social engagement orientation, bonding social capital and bridging social capital among church and temple members. We find religious organizations whose members value civic engagement in health issues and have more network contacts outside their immediate church or temple are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engaging</b> in non-religious issues such as HIV/AIDS. Our study highlights the importance of looking beyond religion type and religious leadership to social network structures to better assess organizational receptiveness to HIV/AIDS...|$|R

25|$|Those who are {{cheated on}} {{experience}} {{a great amount}} of anxiety, stress and depression. Shrout (2017) was among researchers who conducted a study based on the hypothesis that people experiencing those emotions because of an infidelity are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in activities that are a health risk (1). Health-compromising behaviors such as depriving themselves of food and nutrients, consuming alcohol or using drugs more often, increased sexual activity, having sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol or over-exercising.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that there are many other factors that increase the likelihood of anyone engaging in infidelity. Individuals exhibiting sexually permissive attitudes and those who have had a high number of past sexual relationships are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in infidelity. Other factors such as being well educated, living in an urban centre, being less religious, having a liberal ideology and values, having more opportunities to meet potential partners, and being older affected the likelihood of one being involved in an extramarital affair.|$|E
25|$|The American Psychological Association's 1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns {{stated that}} the {{correlation}} between IQ and crime was −0.2. It was −0.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to −0.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the explained variance is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect.

40|$|The {{ability for}} a child <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in the {{classroom}} is associated with better academic outcomes. Yet, there is limited information on how child characteristics of autism and adult behavior impact engagement. This study examined (1) the pattern of adult participation and child engagement in preschool classrooms that serve children with ASD, (2) the associations between child engagement and adult participation, and (3) how characteristics of ASD (autism severity, language ability, and challenging behavior) moderate the relationship between adult participation and child engagement. Overall, children were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> when adults were actively or passively participating with them. Moderators impacted this relationship. Children with higher levels of autism severity were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> when adults were actively or passively participating with them. Similarly, children with lower language abilities were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> when adults were actively or passively participating with them. Finally, children with higher levels of challenging behaviors were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> when adults were actively or passively participating with them. These findings have important implications for how adults can best support the engagement of children with ASD...|$|R

25|$|In humans, {{there is}} a {{seasonal}} variation in aggression associated with changes in testosterone. For example, in some primate species, such as rhesus monkeys and baboons, females are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in fights {{around the time of}} ovulation as well as right before menstruation. If the results were the same in humans as they are in rhesus monkeys and baboons, then the increase in aggressive behaviors during ovulation is explained by the decline in estrogen levels. This makes normal testosterone levels more effective. Castrated mice and rats exhibit lower levels of aggression. Males castrated as neonates exhibit low levels of aggression even when given testosterone throughout their development.|$|E
25|$|Bachelor {{groups are}} made up of {{adolescent}} and bucks not holding territory. Any new members must perform intimidation displays to enter the group. However, bachelor groups tend to be very loose and members can leave whenever they want. The larger, older males with thick horns have the best chance of establishing a territory. Conflicts between adult males are usually solved with intimidation displays. The bucks circle each other and swing their necks from side to side, displaying their neck power. Neck strength is important in an actual fight and the male that cannot keep up yields. Gazelles of nearly equal neck strength are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in actual combat. Fighting occurs in young bucks more often than older ones. Dominant bucks can simply run off subordinates rather than having to display to them.|$|E
