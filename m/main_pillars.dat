5|$|Jordan's well {{developed}} industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%). More than 21% of Jordan's labor force was employed in industry in 2002. In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP. The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers. The most promising segment of this sector is construction. Petra Engineering Industries Company, {{which is considered}} {{to be one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of Jordanian industry, has gained international recognition with its air-conditioning units reaching NASA. Jordan is now considered to be a leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the MENA region led by Jordanian pharmaceutical company Hikma.|$|E
5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of REBT is that irrational and {{dysfunctional}} {{ways and}} patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset.|$|E

25|$|Located in {{the middle}} of a rich {{agricultural}} region, since the beginning of the 20th century Plovdiv grew as an industrial center. Food processing, tobacco, brewing and textiles were the <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of the industry. During Communist rule the city's economy greatly expanded and was dominated by heavy industry; it still produces lead and zinc, machinery, electronics, motor trucks, chemicals and cosmetics. After the fall of Communism in 1989 and the collapse of Bulgaria's planned economy, a number of industrial complexes were closed.|$|E
25|$|The Bush Doctrine {{has been}} defined as a {{collection}} of strategy principles, practical policy decisions, and a set of rationales and ideas for guiding United States foreign policy. Some of these had reemerged from the 1992 draft Wolfowitz Doctrine, which had been leaked and disavowed by the first Bush administration; Wolfowitz, as deputy secretary of defense, {{was at the center of}} the new Bush administration's strategic planning. Two <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> are identified for the doctrine: preemptive strikes against potential enemies and promoting democratic regime change.|$|E

25|$|The {{recent history}} of this bridge has been turbulent; {{although}} there has been a need to restore the bridge, many of the projects were delayed, owing to financial issues or political problems. In 1963 and 1976, owing to threats of destruction and the consequences of constant traffic, the Junta Autónoma de Estradas (Autonomous Corporation for Roads) completed projects to consolidate and substitute the pavement on the road. More recently, the Instituto de Estradas de Portugal (Portuguese Institute of Roads), which was the predecessor of Estradas de Portugal, was responsible for cleaning the <b>main</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{experts believe}} {{the main reason}} the Modern Persian {{language}} today {{is more or less}} the same language as that of Ferdowsi's time over 1000 years ago is due to the very existence of works like the Shahnameh, which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the Shahnameh itself has become one of the <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the Shahnameh in their works.|$|E
25|$|The Latin {{inscription}} {{is still}} at its original location in Prüfening Abbey, attached {{to one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of its church. It reports the consecration act of the monastery in honour of St. George, carried out by the two bishops Otto of Bamberg and Hartwig of Regensburg. The inscription plate specifies the year of the act and, by implication, its own date as 1119 (•MCXVIIII•). It was made of baked clay, painted over in an alternating, red white pattern, and is approximately 26cm wide, 41cm high and 3cm thick, with a crack running through its entire breadth. The sunk letterforms are the classical capitalis monumentalis or Roman square capitals. Copies are at display in several German museums, including the Gutenberg Museum at Mainz.|$|E

To use the Telangana rebellion to herald in the Indian revolution was one of the <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of Ranadive strategy. During the peak of Telangana rebellion, 3,000 villages and some 41,000 square kilometers of territory were involved in the revolt. The ruler of Hyderabad state, nizam had not yet acceded his territory to India, but the violence of the communist-led rebellion, the central government sent in the army in September 1948.

25|$|McGeer's most {{indelible}} mark in BC {{was made}} {{during his time}} as Mayor of Vancouver. He won the 1934 election against incumbent L. D. Taylor with the biggest margin of victory in Vancouver's civic history. He established himself in his campaign as a populist reformer, painting his opponent as outdated and corrupt, with police and monetary reform the two <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of his campaign. As mayor, {{he would not have}} power to implement his monetary policies, which he believed could end the depression. He was, however, able to reform the police department and the civic government, but it was his battles against communism that garnered him the most publicity, at least in his first year in office. Unemployed men in the federal relief camps had been organized by Communist agitators into the Relief Camp Workers' Union. They struck on 4 April 1935 and arrived in Vancouver on boxcars shortly thereafter. The men stayed in Vancouver for two months, marching daily in protest of relief camp conditions.|$|E
25|$|The agro-food {{industry}} {{is one of}} the <b>main</b> <b>pillars</b> of industry of Campania. The organisation of the sector is improving and leading to higher levels of quality and salaries. Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. The value added of this sector represents around 6.5% of the total value added of the region, equalling €213.7 million. Campania produces over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes, which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point, however, for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares. Animal breeding is widespread (it was done in 70,278 farms in 2000) and the milk produced is used to process typical products, such as mozzarella. Olive trees cover over 74,604 hectares of the agricultural land and contribute by €620.6 million to the value added of agriculture, together with the production of fruit. Wine production has increased, together with the quality of the wine.|$|E

Three hydroelectric projects (HEPs) totalling 1416 MW, (336 MW Chukha HEP, the 60 MW Kurichu HEP, and the 1020 MW Tala HEP), are already exporting electricity to India. In 2008 the two governments identified ten more projects for development with a total generation capacity of 10,000 MW. Of these, three projects totalling 2940 MW (1200 MW Punatsangchu-I, 1020 MW Punatsangchu-II and 720 MW Mangdechu HEPs) are under construction and are scheduled to be commissioned {{in the last quarter of}} 2017–2018. Out of the remaining 7 HEPs, 4 projects totalling 2120 MW (600 MW Kholongchhu, 180 MW Bunakha, 570 MW Wangchu and 770 MW Chamkarchu) will be constructed under Joint Venture model, for which a Framework Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed between both governments in 2014. Of these 4 JV-model projects, pre-construction activities for Kholongchhu HEP have commenced. /mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Bilateral_Briefs_of_Bhutan.pdf> Tata Power is also building a hydro-electric dam in Bhutan.|$|E
