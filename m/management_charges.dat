40|$|Two new methodologies are {{introduced}} to improve inference {{in the evaluation of}} mutual fund performance against benchmarks. First, the benchmark models are estimated using panel methods with both fund and time effects. Second, the non-normality of individual mutual fund returns is accounted for by using panel bootstrap methods. We also augment the standard benchmark factors with fund-specific characteristics, such as fund size. Using a dataset of UK equity mutual fund returns, we find that fund size has a negative effect on the average fund manager’s benchmark-adjusted performance. Further, when we allow for time effects and the non-normality of fund returns, we find that {{there is no evidence that}} even the best performing fund managers can significantly out-perform the augmented benchmarks after fund <b>management</b> <b>charges</b> are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the cashless {{policy of the}} Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced in 2011, and on April 1, 2012 it commenced operation in Lagos as a pilot project.

Given the policy’s objectives, the paper x-rays the associated benefits of the policy as well as the attendant challenges that may encumber the successful achievement of the policy’s objectives. The paper therefore makes some suggestions that will make the policy succeed. They include: periodic review of the policy by the CBN to iron out grey areas; embarking on intensive awareness campaign and sensitization of the citizenry by the CBN; putting adequate security mechanisms in place to forestall fraudulent practices; making the public power supply work efficiently; and exempting cash lodgments and public holidays from cash <b>management</b> <b>charges...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Indian life {{insurance}} sector saw {{a series of}} regulatory changes in September 2010, with IRDA finally deciding {{to clamp down on}} the mis-selling of ULIPs as investment products designed for regulatory arbitrage, and not as insurance products. The major steps taken by the regulator included increasing the mortality risk cover to 10 times the annual premium, thereby, increasing the insurance content and reducing the investment content, significantly reducing the commissions, increasing the lock-in period from 3 to 5 years and imposing a ceiling on ULIP charges. Ironically, these changes can be attributed more to the much reported duel between capital market regulator SEBI and IRDA than any consumer activism. These new ULIP guidelines have resulted in new business premiums reducing by 21 % {{in the last six months}} of financial year 2010 - 11 (October 2010 – March 2011) for life insurers as compared to the previous financial year 2009 - 10, and have also adversely affected their operating profit margins due to reduction in ULIP fund <b>management</b> <b>charges.</b> The purpose of this paper is to closely examine the mortality and investment content of new ULIPs introduced by top 10 {{life insurance}} companies in India under the new regulatory regime and also review their performance and sustainability in the near future. The main objective is to research whether the current ULIP can be termed as a insurance product, or still it is very much an investment product despite the regulatory changes, whether agents are willing to sell them at such lower commissions and more importantly, whether customers’ interest and faith can be re-instated after so many years of mis-selling of ULIPs...|$|E

Objective: Text fragments are commonly copied between notes in electronic medical records and concerns have repeatedly been raised about the inappropriate use of the copy-and-paste feature to duplicate information across provider notes. It has been demonstrated that copied documentation of lifestyle counseling, unlike original records, is not associated with improvements in glycemic control in patients with diabetes, and therefore may not be a reliable representation of care provided. We sought to determine if there was evidence that copied documentation of lifestyle counseling is used by physicians to justify higher encounter and <b>management</b> <b>charges.</b> We also evaluated the relationship between frequencies of encounters with copied, distinct or no documented counseling with time to achievement of target hemoglobin A 1 c level. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 16, 006 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus who were followed by primary care physicians affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital for a minimum of two years between 01 / 01 / 2000 and 12 / 13 / 2009. An individual encounter with a provider in a primary care practice in the setting of an elevated hemoglobin A 1 c measurement served as the unit of analysis for the evaluation of the relationship between copied counseling and encounter and management charge level. To test the association, an ordered multinomial logistic regression model was constructed using GLIMMIX procedure to correct for clustering within individual providers and patients and adjusted for patient and treatment characteristics. Periods with hemoglobin A 1 c measurements above the treatment target served as the unit of analysis for the evaluation of the relationship between copied lifestyle counseling and glycemic control. Marginal Cox proportional-hazards model for clustered data and adjusted for patient and treatment characteristics was utilized to estimate the relationship. [TRUNCATED...|$|E
