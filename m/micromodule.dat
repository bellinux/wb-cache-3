40|$|The {{fabrication}} of functional tissue units {{is one of}} the major challenges in tissue engineering due to their in vitro use in tissue-on-chip systems, as well as in modular tissue engineering for the construction of macrotissue analogs. In this work, we aim to engineer dermal tissue <b>micromodules</b> obtained by culturing human dermal fibroblasts into porous gelatine microscaffold.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{variants of}} the heat insulating layers disposition {{in relation to the}} cladding load-carrying structures and demonstrates prime advantages and drawbacks of the three variants. The authors notice that from the heat-engineering viewpoint the variant with exterior side winterization is the most favourable. However, utilizing <b>micromodules</b> as heat-insulating layers screened with leafing aluminum makes it necessary to account for the screens reflecting power. It allows reducing the irradiating component in the combined value of thermal transport through the enclosure and consequently raises the structure thermal resistance or, with parity of these values, leads to lower thickness {{of the heat}}-insulating layer. The known data applied for calculating the total heat transmission helps demonstrate reduction of the general heat flux value by 1. 4 times, and the heat transmission resistance by 1. 76 m 2 deg. /W. This allows reducing thickness of the heat-insulating layer (with regard of two screens) by 0. 07 m. Computations illustrate the fact that account for the radiant reflectance of screening enables lowering the rated heat flux passing through the enclosure. Which again allows decreasing the structure thermal resistance and its general thickness (by 70 mm) at the expense of small thickness of the heat insulation of <b>micromodules.</b> The humidity regime calculations establish good acceptability of the enclosure service conditions in winter. The period will see no real water vapour condensation. The plotted diagrams of the cladding heat-and-humidity conditions demonstrate that condensation zones do not affect the layer of thermal insulation (<b>micromodules).</b> And the condensation zone with reduction of the heat-insulating layer appears only during ‘severe’ outside temperature conditions of a cold month. Reduced to 230 mm thickness of the wall construction allows utilizing ‘old’ stock of forms with prefabricated panels in parallel with energy saving during thermal treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Machine {{learning}} has made great progress {{during the last}} decades and is being deployed {{in a wide range}} of applications. However, current machine learning techniques are far from sufficient for achieving human-level intelligence. Here we identify the properties of learners required for human-level intelligence and suggest a new direction of machine learning research, i. e. the cognitive learning approach, that takes into account the recent findings in brain and cognitive sciences. In particular, we suggest two fundamental principles to achieve human-level machine learning: continuity (forming a lifelong memory continuously) and glocality (organizing a plastic structure of localized <b>micromodules</b> connected globally). We then propose a multimodal memory game as a research platform to study cognitive learning architectures and algorithms, where the machine learner and two human players question and answer about the scenes and dialogues after watching the movies. Concrete experimental results are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the game and the cognitive learning framework for studying human-level learning and intelligence. I...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in genomics and proteomics {{makes it possible}} to understand the biological networks at the systems level. We aim to develop computational models of learning and memory inspired by the biomolecular networks embedded in their environment. One fundamental question is how the systems rapidly adapt to their changing environment in a short period (learning) while performing persistently through the longer time span (memory). We study this issue in a probabilistic hypergraph model called the hypernetworks. The hypernetwork architecture consists of a huge number of randomly sampled hyperedges, each corresponding to higherorder <b>micromodules</b> in the input. We find that a system consisting {{of a large number of}} a wide range of heterogeneous low-dimensional components has a fairly competitive chance of long-term survival (memory, persistency) and short-term performance (learning, adaptability) as opposed to a system consisting of a small number of high-dimensional, fine-tuned, complex components.

40|$|To {{understand}} the physiological mechanisms underlying the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, {{the acquisition of}} data must be optimized to achieve the maximum possible spatial resolution and specificity. The term specificity implies the selective enhancement of signals originating in the parenchyma, and thus best reflecting actual neural activity. Such spatial specificity {{is a prerequisite for}} imaging aimed at the elucidation of interactions between cortical <b>micromodules,</b> such as columns and laminae. In addition to the optimal selection of functional magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequences, accurate superposition of activation patterns onto corresponding anatomical scans, preferably acquired during the same experimental session, is necessary. At high resolution, exact functional-to-structural registration is of critical importance, because even small differences in geometry, that arise when different sequences are used for functional and anatomical scans, can lead to misallocation of activ ation and erroneous interpretation of data. In the present study, we used spin-echo (SE) echo planar imaging (EPI) for functional scans, since the SE-BOLD signal is sensitive to the capillary response, together with SE-EPI anatomical reference scans. The combination of these acquisition methods revealed a clear spatial colocalization of the largest fractional changes with the Gennari line, suggesting peak activity in Layer IV. Notably, this very same layer coincided with the largest relaxivity changes as observed in steady-state cerebral blood volume measurements, using the intravascular agent monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of in vitro tissue models necessitates of tools {{to create an}} initial architecture and to systematically manipulate their microenvironments {{in space and time}} [10]. In this scenario, the modular tissue engineering is emerging as new paradigm for the in vitro {{fabrication of}} 3 D biological structures. The fabrication of engineered <b>micromodules</b> able to control the synthesis and the assembly of an endogenous ECM, represents a formidable task. In this direction, our group developed a new class of tissue <b>micromodules,</b> named micro tissue precursor (TP), which {{led to the formation of}} a completely endogenous 3 D tissue [7, 13]. In the first chapter of this work we proposed tp as a new class of bio-ink for organ printing strategy and demonstrate that they evolve during culture time and strongly influence the morphology of the final printed tissue. We argue that the initial composition of the ECM present in the TP change with TP "age" and affects the maturation of the ECM in the final 3 D tissue. We focused our attention on crucial aspects such as fusion capability, degree of maturation and mechanical properties of its ECM, as well as the evolution of oxygen consumption kinetic parameters. Finally we demonstrated the capability of tp to be printed in unusual shapes meeting one of the need of organ printing strategy to overcome shape limitation and to obtain functional and complex tissues. In the second chapter we proposed a model of TOC (tissue on chip) by inserted TP in a microfluidic platform, designed in order to induce flow perfusion of the TP. This micro-perfusion bioreactor, can be performed in order to evaluate the effect of flow rate and biochemical factors on the tissue development. By using this system together with TP, it is possible in "short time" optimize the fluid dynamics parameters and bio-chemicals concentration inside the medium and evaluating the effect of external factors on the collagen assembly, cells viability and metalloproteinase synthesis. These capabilities made it an important tool for studying cause-effect relation, in particular how each single factor influences the tissue characteristics. In the third chapter it is explored the possibility to realize TP by using bronchial fibroblast in order to obtain "lung-stroma" on which build up bronchial epithelium. We found that TP not only synthesize their own ECM, but that they organize it leading to a final tissue having a morphology very similar to native lung stroma. By seeding bronchial epithelial cells on this lung stroma, they differentiate and recreate the complete airway epithelium in air-liquid condition. Finally, by exploiting the knowledge of our group to recreate a human skin model, we evaluate its capability to maintains exogenous hair viability during the time, in terms of elongation capability and anagen phase of hair follicle maintenance. We realized a human skin model that, better than other competitors, is a good environment for the exogenous hair. This is a starting step in order to obtain a complete model that itself recapitulate all the hair follicle structures...|$|R
