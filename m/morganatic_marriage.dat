5|$|The {{letters and}} diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen {{generally}} demonstrate {{support for the}} King, while those from {{the middle and upper}} classes tend to express indignation and distaste. The Times, The Morning Post, Daily Herald, and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley, such as The Daily Telegraph, opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the Express and Mail newspapers, owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, respectively, appeared to support a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage.</b> The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5million, and those against had 8.5million.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{was born}} in the Tapestry Room at Windsor Castle in Berkshire in the {{presence}} of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. She was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse, the second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her father was the eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine through his <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> to Julia von Hauke, Princess of Battenberg. Her three younger siblings, Louise, George, and Louis, later became Queen of Sweden, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, Louis was denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious Highness and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother {{at the time of}} her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he {{automatically}} became His Serene Highness Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene Highness, by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the issue}} of <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> were ineligible to succeed to their families' {{respective}} thrones, children of <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> {{have gone on to}} achieve dynastic success elsewhere in Europe. Descendants of the 1851 marriage of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine to the German-Polish noblewoman Countess Julia von Hauke (created Princess of Battenberg) include Alexander, sovereign prince of Bulgaria, queen-consorts of Spain (Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg) and of Sweden (Louise Mountbatten), and, in the female line, Charles, Prince of Wales (through his paternal grandmother, Alice of Battenberg).|$|R
50|$|The counter-claim {{has been}} that the wording of the August 1911 ukase restricting the ban on <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> to grand dukes was silent on {{imperial}} princes, therefore the Frederiks memorandum was not given full legal effect.|$|R
50|$|His second {{marriage}} was to Katalin Bocskay de Felsö-Bánya (1909-2000), on 7 May 1938. They had two daughters, named below. Following {{the rules of}} <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages,</b> the daughters did not inherit the title of their father, {{in this case that}} of Archduchess; however, Otto von Habsburg granted them the (unofficial) title of Gräfin von Habsburg ("Countess of Habsburg"). Albrecht and Katalin divorced in 1951.|$|R
5|$|Wallis {{had already}} {{filed for divorce}} from her second husband {{on the grounds that}} he had {{committed}} adultery with her childhood friend Mary Kirk and the decree nisi was granted on 27 October 1936. In November, the King consulted with the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on a way to marry Wallis and keep the throne. The King suggested a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage,</b> where he would remain king but Wallis would not be queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada, and South Africa. If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, the Government would be required to resign, causing a constitutional crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{beauty of}} Beatrice's daughter, Ena, was known {{throughout}} Europe, and, despite her low rank, {{she was a}} desirable bride. Her chosen suitor was King Alfonso XIII of Spain. However, the marriage caused controversy in Britain, since it required Ena to convert to Catholicism. This step was opposed by Beatrice's brother, King Edward VII, and Spanish ultra-conservatives were against the King's marriage to a Protestant of low birth, as her father, Prince Henry, {{was the son of}} a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage.</b> Thus, they considered Ena to be only partly royal and thus unfit to be Queen of Spain. Nonetheless, the couple wed on 31 May 1906. The marriage began inauspiciously when an anarchist attempted to bomb them on their wedding day. Apparently close at first, the couple grew apart. Ena became unpopular in Spain and grew more so when it was discovered that her son, the heir to the throne, suffered from haemophilia, a disease for which Alfonso held Beatrice responsible for having brought the disease to the Spanish royal house and turned bitterly against Ena.|$|E
25|$|Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein, Eugenia's {{husband in}} a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage,</b> whose family demands their divorce.|$|E
50|$|In 1835, he married, morganatically, Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde (1812-1841), by whom he fathered three children: Claudine, Francis and Amalie. His {{wife was}} created Countess of Hohenstein {{in her own}} right and, {{following}} the rules of <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages,</b> the children inherited their mother's title as Count or Countess of Hohenstein from birth. They had no rights through their father to any royal status or inheritance.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, through {{either the}} deaths or <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> of his elder brothers, George became {{the head of}} the Russian branch of the House of Beauharnais. At {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, when still married to Princess Anastasia of Montenegro, George was {{considered}} as a possible successor to the childless Alexander I of Serbia. Alexander was overthrown and murdered in a military coup, and succeeded by Peter I of Serbia.|$|R
50|$|Miguel and Anita Stewart {{were married}} at Tulloch Castle near Dingwall in Scotland on 15 September 1909. This {{was the first}} royal wedding in Scotland {{since the days of}} the Stuarts. Shortly before the wedding Stewart was created Princess of Braganza by the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph. Upon his {{marriage}} Miguel was able to keep his place in the line of succession as <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> did not exist in Portuguese law.|$|R

25|$|Infante Francisco de Paula {{contracted}} a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> on 19 December 1852 with Teresa de Arredondo y Ramirez de Arellano. They had one son.|$|E
50|$|On 12 May 1879, Therese married Prince George Maximlianovich Romanovsky (1852-1912), {{youngest}} son of Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg {{and his wife}} Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia. Therese's elder brother Duke Alexander Petrovich had been married to George's sister Princess Eugenia Maximilianovna since 1868. Through either the deaths or <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> of his elder brothers, George {{was the head of}} the Russian branch of the House of Beauharnais.|$|R
50|$|With {{the death}} of William II in 1921, {{succession}} to the royal claim bypassed the former Duke of Teck and the Duke of Urach, both of whom descended from <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages,</b> and the headship of the royal house was inherited by Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg of the Roman Catholic, Altshausen branch of the royal family. The current head of the House of Württemberg is Carl, Duke of Württemberg.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding his <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> and his father's {{loss of his}} British {{title of}} Duke of Albany under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, Johann Leopold {{remained}} heir to the title and was eligible to apply for its reinstatement, {{though he did not}} do so. Since he and his siblings married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 the right to petition for the return of the title became extinct on his brother Friedrich Josias's death in 1998.|$|R
25|$|Although {{he had no}} {{succession}} rights due to the <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> of his parents, George was {{the last}} male-line descendant of Alexander III of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Prince George Alexandrovich Yuryevsky (12 May 187213 September 1913), {{who married}} Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau, herself {{the child of}} a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage,</b> and had issue. They later divorced.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} {{became popular}} in the courts of the nobility in Eastern Europe. There are numerous citations mentioning the existence of Ukrainian bandurists in both Russia and Poland.

50|$|Henri, Count of Paris (1908-1999) had {{amended the}} order of {{succession}} several times within the House of Orléans. Considering the marriages of his sons Michel and Thibaut with non-royal women and without his prior approval as misalliances, the Count of Paris excluded them and their descendants from the royal succession in 1967 and 1973. However, <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> never existed in French law and the fundamental laws of the kingdom did not require the royal princes to marry women of equal rank.|$|R
5000|$|Second son of Archduke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany. Like {{his cousin}} Archduke Leopold Salvator {{he had an}} {{interest}} in ballooning, and once flew his balloon from Linz to Dieppe in only 16 hours. His interest in things aeronautical had brought him into contact with the future head of the German air force, Hermann Göring, who later used his influence to free the Archduke from the German concentration camp at Dachau in 1938 after only 80 days there. Had issue from two <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Royal Marriages Act of 1772 made {{it illegal}} for all persons {{born into the}} British royal family to marry without the {{permission}} of the Sovereign, and any marriage contracted without the Sovereign’s consent was considered illegal and invalid. This led to several prominent cases of British princes who had gone through marriage ceremonies, and who cohabited with their partners as if married, but whose relationships were not legally recognised. As a result, their partners and children (the latter considered illegitimate) held no titles, and had no succession rights. This differs from <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages,</b> which are considered legally valid.|$|R
25|$|Her {{home life}} {{was said to}} be unhappy, as her elder brother Prince Hermann's affairs weighed heavily on her spirits. Just a few years previously, Hermann had lost his title and style, {{becoming}} known as Count Ostheim, after a long period of angering his family through extensive spending and later entering into a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> with an actress.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duke Boris {{would have}} liked to marry her, but as he was close in line to the Russian throne a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> would not have been authorized. To get out of his predicament, Boris quickly {{arranged}} Zinaida’s marriage to Peter Eliseev, a military officer from a prestigious family who accepted the deal in exchange for the grand duke payment of his gambling debts.|$|E

Nashik as Shrimant Gopalrao Gaekwad, second son of Meherban Shrimant Kashirao Bhikajirao Dada Sahib Gaekwad (1832–1877) and Shrimant Akhand Soubhagyavati Ummabai Sahib. His branch of the Gaekwad dynasty was a cadet branch descended from a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> of the first Raja of Baroda and so was not {{expected}} to succeed to the throne.|$|E
50|$|Ludwig and Leonilla had {{the former}} Baroque manor of the Counts of Boos-Waldeck below Sayn Castle reconstructed into a princely {{residence}} in Gothic Revival style. Their youngest son Alexander married Yvonne, {{the daughter of}} the French Duke of Blacas and inherited Sayn after the <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> of his older brothers Peter, Friedrich and Ludwig. After his wife's early death he remarried and spent his life as Count of Hachenburg in the former family residences in Hachenburg and Friedewald in the Westerwald. Princess Leonilla held a monarchist and Catholic salon and died in 1918 at the age of 101 at her villa of Mon Abri on Lake Geneva, Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|In the {{erstwhile}} princely {{state of}} Travancore, in India, the male {{members of the}} Travancore Royal Family were, under the existing matrilineal Marumakkathayam system of inheritance and family, permitted to contract marriages with women of the Nair caste only. These were <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages</b> called Sambandhams wherein the children gained their mother's caste and family name, due to Marumakkathayam. Although they could not inherit the throne, they did receive a title of nobility, Thampi(son of the Maharajah) and Kochamma(daughter of the Maharajah). These were {{the members of the}} Ammaveedus and their titles ensured a comfortable lifestyle and all other luxuries. The descendants of these Ammaveedu members were simply called Thampi and Thankachi and they didn't get any other distinguishing privileges.|$|R

25|$|Grand Duke Andrei {{could neither}} openly live {{together}} with Mathilda nor did there exist {{the possibility of}} contracting a <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriage</b> with her. Only in their trips to Western Europe did they enjoy enough freedom to live as a couple, but even abroad {{they were forced to}} maintain appearances. The couple always had to travel with his Aide-de-camp, Feodor Von Kube, and when Grand Duke Andrei was invited to events, Mathilda could not join him.|$|E
5000|$|His two eldest brothers, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm (born 1939) and Prince Michael (born 1940) married commoners in {{the mid-1960s}} and renounced their {{historical}} rights as Prussian princes. In 1975 his brother Prince Louis Ferdinand Jr. (1944-1977), dynastically wed a mediatised countess, Donata Countess of Castell-Rüdenhausen (1950 - 2015), but died accidentally during German military maneuvers two years later, leaving an only son, Georg Friedrich, as heir to the Hohenzollern legacy. Aware that his father strongly desired that he marry dynastically after his eldest brothers' <b>morganatic</b> <b>marriages,</b> Christian Sigismund nonetheless maintained {{that he did not}} feel unduly pressured: his eventual marriage to a countess, although non-mediatised, was also accepted as [...] "equal" [...] by his father.|$|R
