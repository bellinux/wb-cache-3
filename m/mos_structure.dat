40|$|Abstract — The {{photoelectric}} {{techniques are}} often used for the measurements of metal oxide semiconductor (<b>MOS)</b> <b>structure</b> parameters. These methods, which consist in illuminating the <b>MOS</b> <b>structure</b> with a semitransparent metal gate by a UV light beam, are often competitive for typical electric measurements. The results obtained by different photoelectric methods are, in many cases, more accurate and reproducible than the results of other measurements. The flat-band voltage VFB is an important parameter of any <b>MOS</b> <b>structure</b> since its value influences the threshold voltage VT, which decides for example about power consumption of MOS transistors. One of the methods to measure the VFB value is the electric method of C(V) characteristic. This method involves certain calculations and requires the knowledge about parameters of the investigated sample. The accuracy of this method is rarely better than ± 100 mV (for higher doping of the substrates the accuracy is worse). The other method of VFB value determination, outlined in this article, is the photoelectric light pulse technique (LPT) method. This method {{based on the idea}} proposed by Yun is currently being optimized and verified experimentally. As will be shown later, the gate voltage VG at which u changes sign is the flat-band voltage of the <b>MOS</b> <b>structure</b> under investigation. Hence, by adjusting gate voltage VG to obtain u = 0 the VFB value can be determined. The main difficulty in practical application of the LPT and SLPT measurement methods results {{from the fact that the}} signal |u| in the accumulation range is in most of the cases several orders of magnitude smaller than in inversion and depletion (as schematically shown in Fig. 1).
