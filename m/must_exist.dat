5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God <b>must</b> <b>exist.</b> Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century Tycho Brahe {{demonstrated}} that comets <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> outside the Earth's atmosphere {{by measuring the}} parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers.

5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God <b>must</b> <b>exist.</b> Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God <b>must</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E

His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} its not allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by a Creator.|$|E

5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God <b>must</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it <b>must</b> <b>exist.</b> This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God <b>must</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E
5|$|Before 1846, Gray {{had been}} firmly {{opposed to the}} idea of {{transmutation}} of species, in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time, including via hybridization. By the early 1850s, Gray had clearly defined his concept that the species is the basic unit of taxonomy. This was partly the result of the 1831–1836 voyage during which Darwin discovered the differentiation of species among the various Galápagos Islands. Local geography could produce variances, like in the Galápagos and Hawaii, which Gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted. Gray was insistent that a genetic connection <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> between all members of a species, that like begat like. This concept was critical to Darwin's theories. Gray was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: {{it does not include}} the effects of quantum physics. The quest for a quantum version of general relativity addresses one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime singularities. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such singularities <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E

5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the clique problem has led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.|$|E
