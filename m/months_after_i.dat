500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we could have done it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E

I made my way into Switzerland and so on down the Rhine, and it was nearly seven <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> left Madrid before I reached England.|$|E

"She {{was with}} my father in the battle, and was left for dead on the field; but I heard from a captive, taken a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> was, that she had survived, and was with the remnant of the tribe in the well nigh {{inaccessible}} fastnesses {{at the head of}} the Orcus." ...|$|R

60|$|Little {{more than}} a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{returned}} to Putney, I {{received a letter from}} Percy, now long since become Captain Desborough, saying that he should sail for England by the next mail, that he should, as he had warned me, claim me at once, and that he hoped I would not keep him {{more than a}} fortnight waiting.|$|R
60|$|Several <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had {{returned}} home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking {{me to come to}} him at once. I had always been his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, I hope not. I {{never had}} a fight at school except the one I had three <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> got there, and I only had that one row you speak of with a clerk.

6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of being a vender of broken diamonds, {{and there is nothing}} {{suspicious}} about honest labor. The object of my present endeavors was to reach England, and I journeyed northward. It was nearly a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had entered France that I was at a little village on the Garonne, repairing a stone wall which divided a field from the road, and I assure you I was very glad to get this job.|$|R

Also, I owe much to the guerilla chief Moras, with whom I acted for six weeks, last autumn. I had learned a little of your language before and, speaking Portuguese fluently, I naturally picked it up without any great difficulty." ...|$|R

60|$|I thought over {{things a}} good deal for myself, and a few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> left the academy I made up my mind to travel a little. I talked about it at home, and it was {{generally}} thought to be a good idea, although my sister was in favor of it only in case I took her with me. Otherwise she opposed it. But there were a great many reasons why I could not take her. She was only eleven.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had, as you know, {{been ill}} before I left India. I {{had not been}} home for fifteen years, and got two years' leave. As you may know, I had a good fortune, {{irrespective}} of the service; and I took a place called Holmwood Park, near Dawlish and, as I had thought of retiring, {{at the end of}} my leave, I was put on the commission of the peace. My boy was born a few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> got home.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the end of}} the siege, {{in which}} I had served as a medical officer, I {{returned}} to England. A few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> left, peace was made between England and France, and by its terms Dupleix had to restore Madras to the English. I hear that fighting has been going on ever since, the English and French engaging as auxiliaries to rival native princes; and especially that there was some hot fighting round Devikota. However, we shall hear about that when we get there." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{a little}} before the great rain just now mentioned, that I threw this stuff away; taking no notice of any thing, {{and not so much}} as remembering that I had thrown any thing there: when about a <b>month</b> <b>after,</b> <b>I</b> saw some few stalks of {{something}} green, shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley of the same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.|$|R
6000|$|For a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> that <b>I</b> saw Pyecraft {{constantly}} at {{the club}} and as fat and anxious as ever.

6000|$|... [181:1] Some <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{had written}} this line, {{it gave me}} {{pleasure}} to find [to observe An. Anth., S. L. 1828] that Bartram had observed the same circumstance of the Savanna Crane. 'When these Birds move their wings in flight, their strokes are slow, moderate and regular; and even when at a considerable distance or high above us, we plainly hear the quill-feathers: their shafts and webs upon one another creek as the joints or working of a vessel in a tempestuous sea.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, the dog {{was mine}} once, at all events--though I doubt not it is {{rightfully}} yours now," [...] said the young lady, {{with a smile that}} at once disarmed me. [...] "It was stolen from me a few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had bought it from this boy, who seems strangely altered since then. I'm glad, however, to see that the short time I had {{the dog was}} sufficient to prevent its forgetting me. But perhaps," [...] she added, in a sad tone, [...] "it would have been better if it had forgotten me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For some <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{had done}} crying for the flaxen-haired edition of her, my Love did not reappear. Then she came suddenly, unexpectedly, in a {{situation}} I should never have predicted. I {{was standing on the}} kerbstone of the pavement in Budmouth-Regis, outside the Preparatory School, looking across towards the sea, when a middle-aged gentleman on horseback, and beside him a young lady, also mounted, passed down the street. The girl turned her head, and--possibly because I was gaping at her in awkward admiration, or smiling myself--smiled at me. Having ridden a few paces, she looked round again and smiled.|$|E
60|$|For {{a man of}} my habits, {{who kept}} clear of drink, I was now rich. Instead of {{remaining}} in town, however, I went immediately down to the Harbour, and presented myself to its respectable superintendant, the venerable Captain Whetten.[18] I was received into the institution without any difficulty, and have belonged to it ever since. My entrance at Sailors' Snug Harbour took place Sept. 17, 1840; just one <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> landed at Sailors' Retreat. The last of these places is a seamen's hospital, where men are taken in only to be cured; while the first is an asylum for worn-out mariners, for life. The last {{is supported by a}} bequest made, many years ago, by an old ship-master, whose remains lie in front of the building.|$|R
60|$|About a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{had fallen}} into this most unhappy state an old friend came to see me. We had been school-fellows, but he {{differed}} from me in almost every respect. He was full of ambition and energy, and, although he was {{but a few years}} older than myself, he had already made a name in the world. He was a geologist, earnest and enthusiastic in his studies and his investigations. He told me frankly that the object of his visit was twofold. In the first place, he wanted to see me, and, secondly, he wanted to make some geological examinations on my grounds, which were situated, as he informed me, upon a terminal moraine, a formation which he had not yet had an opportunity of practically investigating.|$|R
5000|$|Ladyhawke first {{revealed}} {{plans to}} work on a second album in a message on her official website in May 2010. She explained the four-year gap between her self-titled debut album and Anxiety by saying, [...] "I had no idea how exhausted I'd be <b>after</b> <b>I</b> finished touring. I was physically incapable of doing anything. I tried to start recording about a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> finished on tour and I turned up at the studio and just fell asleep. I was like a zombie." [...] The album was recorded in New Zealand and at Pascal Gabriel's house in the south of France in early 2011. [...] "Working in London, I am quite bad at getting distracted, so I think it was a ploy to literally lock me away. My bedroom is right below the studio so there is no escaping. I can hear Gabriel's foot tapping in the morning as if to say 'wake up'", she told Stuff.co.nz.|$|R
60|$|About three <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{left school}} for good I {{received}} {{an invitation to}} go up to London and stay for a month with Ada Desborough. This was a great event. Ada told me that her mother was going to give a grand ball, at which she was to come out, and that I should be formally introduced to the world upon the same occasion; and she remarked that she flattered herself that society in general ought to rejoice at the advent of two such charming votaries at its shrine. She added, in a postscript, that her brother Percy would be at home on leave.|$|E
60|$|Alas, I got no {{message from}} Dorothy! Nor had she ever {{mentioned}} {{my name to}} Comyn. He had not seen her for eight <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> left England, {{as she had been}} taken to the Continent for her health. She came back to London more ravishing than before, and (I use his Lordship's somewhat extravagant language) her suffering had stamped upon her face even more of character and power. She had lost much of her levity, likewise. In short, my Lord declared, she was more of the queen than ever, and the mystery which hung over the Vauxhall duel had served only to add to her fame.|$|E
60|$|But my sage {{counsellor}} was gone, I {{was like}} a ship without a pilot, that could only run before the wind; my thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adventures; and all the pleasing innocent amusements of my farm and my garden, my cattle and my family, which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste: in a word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London; {{and in a few}} <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> did so.|$|E
5000|$|Initially {{released}} on Stax Records under their [...] "Partee" [...] imprint, the album's success was temporarily derailed {{by the sudden}} closing of Stax later in 1974. Pryor regained control of the master rights to the album and signed with Warner Bros. Records almost immediately; the album was reissued on November 10, 1975 on their Reprise subsidiary, three <b>months</b> <b>after</b> Pryor's ...<b>Is</b> It Something I Said? was released.|$|R
5000|$|Murphy {{said about}} {{starting}} martial arts: [...] "I took {{my son to}} a Jiu Jitsu class in late 2009, and I took the class with him to encourage him.

I began training MMA about 3 months later, and took my first pro fight 3 <b>months</b> <b>after</b> that. <b>I</b> did not have any amateur fights." ...|$|R
60|$|Amy. I can't {{give you}} any farther account, sir; my {{mistress}} would not let me stay with her any longer. She said she could neither pay me or subsist me. I told her I would serve her without any wages, but I could not live without victuals, you know; so I {{was forced to leave}} her, poor lady, sore against my will; and I heard afterwards that the landlord seized her goods, so she was, I suppose, turned out of doors; for as I went by the door, about a <b>month</b> <b>after,</b> <b>I</b> saw the house shut up; and, about a fortnight <b>after</b> that, <b>I</b> found there were workmen at work, fitting it up, as I suppose, for a new tenant. But none of the neighbours could tell me what was become of my poor mistress, only that they said she was so poor that it was next to begging; that some of the neighbouring gentlefolks had relieved her, or that else she must have starved.|$|R
60|$|I {{will not}} admit that, once {{sure it was}} doing me harm, I could not, unaided, have given up tobacco. But I was {{reluctant}} to make sure. I should {{like to say that}} I left off smoking because I considered it a mean form of slavery, to be condemned for moral as well as physical reasons; but though now I clearly see the folly of smoking, I was blind to it for some <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had smoked my last pipe. I gave up my most delightful solace, as I regarded it, {{for no other reason than}} that the lady who was willing to fling herself away on me said that I must choose between it and her. This deferred our marriage for six months.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three or {{four times}} they nearly got a footing on deck, but we managed to beat them off somehow. We lost a third of our crew. I don't {{think there was a}} man escaped without a wound. I was laid up for three <b>months,</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> got home, with a slash on the shoulder, which pretty nigh took off my left arm. However, we saved the ship and the cargo, which was a {{valuable}} one, and Messer Polani saw that no one was the worse for his share in the business. There's no more liberal-hearted man in the trade than he is, and whatever may be the scarcity of hands in the port, there is never any difficulty in getting a good crew together for his vessels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanwhile, {{the score}} had grown heavier. I {{went home to}} find the castle in usurping hands--in the hands of my enemies. My father was dead; he died a few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had gone to France; and those murderers had {{advanced}} a claim that through my marriage with their cousin, since dead, and through my own death, there being no next of kin, they were the heirs-at-law. The Parliament allowed their claim, and they were installed. But when I came they were away, following {{the fortunes of the}} Parliament that had served them so well. And so I determined to let my vengeance wait until the war were ended and the Parliament destroyed. In a hundred engagements did I distinguish myself by my recklessness even as at other seasons I distinguished myself by my debaucheries.|$|E
60|$|I {{came away}} for England in the <b>month</b> of August, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had been {{eight years in}} that country; and now a new scene of misfortunes {{attended}} me, which perhaps few women {{have gone through the}} life of.|$|R
6000|$|... "About a <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> landed, I {{heard that}} the chief was dead. He {{was the father of}} the present chief, who is now a most {{consistent}} member of the Church. It is a custom here that when a chief dies his wives are strangled and buried with him. Knowing this, I hastened to his house to endeavour to prevent such cruelty if possible. When I arrived, I found two of the wives had already been killed, while another was in the act of being strangled. I pleaded hard for her, but it was too late; she was already dead. I then entreated the son to spare the fourth wife, and after much hesitation, my prayer was granted; but in half-an-hour afterwards this poor woman repented of being unfaithful, as she termed it, to her husband, and insisted on being strangled, which was accordingly done.|$|R
6000|$|... “It is {{too much}} altogether, Tom. I had hoped that some day I might come to be a mate, or even a captain in a {{merchant}} ship, but to think that {{in less than two}} <b>months</b> <b>after</b> joining <b>I</b> could be on the quarter-deck was beyond my wildest dreams. Well I hope I sha’n’t get puffed up, and I am sure, Tom, that I shall be as much your friend as ever.” ...|$|R
