2500|$|The Main Concourse is {{the center}} of Grand Central. At [...] long by [...] wide by [...] high, the {{cavernous}} Main Concourse is usually filled with bustling crowds. and is often used as a meeting place. The ticket booths are here, although many now stand unused or have been repurposed since the introduction of ticket vending machines. The large American flag was hung in Grand Central Terminal {{a few days after the}} September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The main information booth is in the center of the concourse. The four-faced brass clock on top of the information booth, perhaps the most recognizable icon of Grand Central, was designed by Henry Edward Bedford and cast in Waterbury, Connecticut. Each of the four clock faces is made from opalescent glass (now often called opal glass or <b>milk</b> <b>glass),</b> though urban legend has it that the faces are made of opal and that Sotheby's and Christie's have estimated their value to be between $10 million and $20 million. A 1954 New York Times article on the restoration of the clock notes that [...] "Each of the glass faces was twenty-four inches in diameter...." [...] Within the marble and brass pagoda lies a [...] "secret" [...] door that conceals a spiral staircase leading to the lower-level information booth.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the Palace rises the most famous of the towers, Elizabeth Tower, {{commonly}} known as Big Ben. At 96metres (316ft), it is only slightly shorter than Victoria Tower but much slimmer. Originally known simply as the Clock Tower (the name Elizabeth Tower was conferred on it in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), it houses the Great Clock of Westminster, built by Edward John Dent on designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. Striking the hour to within a second of the time, the Great Clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by 19th-century clockmakers, and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials [...] in diameter, which are made of <b>milk</b> <b>glass</b> and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is [...] long and the minute hand [...] The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the Palace. In the 2012 BBC Four documentary, Richard Taylor gives a description of Pugin's Clock Tower: [...] "It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before you reach the clock face, picked out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold. Medieval windows above that and then it hits the grey slate roof, its greyness relieved by those delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf. And then rises up again in a great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross. It's elegant and grand and has fairy tale qualities." ...|$|E

50|$|Ancient <b>milk</b> <b>glasses</b> used {{crystals}} {{of calcium}} antimonate, {{formed in the}} melt from calcium present in the glass and an antimony additive. Opaque yellow glasses contained crystals of lead antimonate; bindheimite mineral {{may have been used}} as the additive. Under oxidizing condition, lead also forms incompletely dissolved lead pyroantimonate (Pb2Sb2O7). From 2nd century BC tin oxide appears in use as opacifier, likely in the form of cassiterite mineral. Opaque yellow can be produced as lead stannate; the color is paler than the lead antimonate one. Later calcium and sodium phosphates became used; bone ash contains calcium phosphate in a high proportion. Calcium fluoride was also used, especially in China.|$|R

40|$|The {{surface tension}} of milk {{was found to}} {{decrease}} logarithmically with time, regardless of fat content. Moreover, the surface tension decreased with fat content up to about 35 g. kg- 1. Above 10 MPa, homogenization resulted in increased surface tension, {{probably due to the}} lower creaming and lack of caseins in the continuous phase. The initial contact angle of homogenized <b>milk</b> on <b>glass</b> was similar to that of skim milk, probably due to the presence of casein micelles on the globule surface. After the first immersion, skim <b>milk</b> wetted <b>glass</b> surfaces completely. Conversely, the contact angle of whome milk increased with time, suggesting the formation of a hydrophobic adborption layer on glass. The composition and conformation of this layer can affect fouling and cleaning in technological dairy processes involving fat globules...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an inflammatory disorder {{which leads to}} an increase in casualties caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adipocytokines and hs-CRP play a main role in pathophysiology of RA and CVD. Soy foods and phytoestrogens have anti-inflammatory properties. So, {{this study was designed to}} determine the effects of soy milk consumption comparing with cow’s milk consumption on anthropometric indicators, blood pressure (BP), hs-CRP, adiponectin and leptin among patients suffering from RA. Material and methods: This randomized, crossover clinical trial was conducted on 30 patients. This study had two intervention periods, each lasted 4 -weeks. Subjects were divided in two groups of consuming soy <b>milk</b> (one <b>glass</b> per day) and cow's <b>milk</b> (one <b>glass</b> per day). The wash‐out period was two weeks.
