25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Indus valley developed a system of standardization, using weights and measures, evident by the excavations made at the Indus valley sites. This technical standardization enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Calibration was also found in measuring devices along with multiple subdivisions in case of some devices. One of the earliest known docks is at Lothal (2400 BCE), located away from the <b>main</b> <b>current</b> to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans must have possessed knowledge relating to tides {{in order to build}} such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary hydrography and maritime engineering.|$|E

25|$|The two <b>main</b> <b>current</b> {{competitors}} of the Panama Canal are the US intermodal {{system and}} the Suez Canal. The main ports and merchandise distribution centers in these routes are investing in capacity, location, and maritime and land infrastructure to serve post-Panamax container ships and their larger cargo volumes. According to the ACP, the growing usage of such ships in transcontinental routes competing with the canal is irreversible. It was estimated that by 2011 approximately 37% of {{the capacity of the}} world's container ship fleet would consist of vessels that did not fit through the current canal, and a great part of this fleet could be used on routes that compete with Panama.|$|E
25|$|In the parsonage in Oostkapelle, {{and later}} in The Hague, Vollenhoven {{performed}} his duties conscientiously, but he also continued his study of philosophy. In 1920 he received a scholarship and leave of absence to study psychology under Felix Krueger for five months in Leipzig. In the early 1920s Neo-Kantianism was the dominant school in the Netherlands. In philosophy Vollenhoven sought the reconciliation of thought and being, mediated theistically, with the priority given to being. In about mid-1922 this was radicalized: knowing (and thought) {{is a part of}} being. Neo-Kantianism, contrariwise, took its departure from thought and justified this in humanistic fashion. In other words, Vollenhoven rowed against the <b>main</b> <b>current</b> of his time. His many commitments and interests led to his becoming overworked. In (mid-)January 1923 he suffered a mental collapse, the recuperation took up most of that year.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to <b>main</b> <b>current</b> resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E

By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the <b>main</b> <b>current</b> almost cancels out, {{so most of the}} observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named [...] "auroral electrojets" [...] (see also Birkeland currents).|$|E

2500|$|A boulder or ledge in {{the middle}} of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river, and can also create a [...] "pillow"; when water flows {{backwards}} upstream of the obstruction, or a [...] "pour over" [...] (over the boulder); and [...] "hydraulics" [...] or [...] "holes" [...] where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp. (Holes, or hydraulics, are so-called because their foamy, aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface.) If the flow passes next to the obstruction, an eddy may form behind the obstruction; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest, scout or leave the <b>main</b> <b>current,</b> they may be swirling and whirlpool-like. As with hydraulics (which pull downward rather than to the side and are essentially eddies turned at a 90-degree angle), the power of eddies increases with the flow rate.|$|E
2500|$|Afghanistan {{currently}} has about [...] of areas cultivating grapes and excellent climate and terroir suitable for quality wine. While {{the history of}} wine goes back much longer, Viticulture {{seems to have been}} well established in parts of Afghanistan by at least the fourth century BC. It is said that Babur, the first Mughal emperor, learned about wine in Kabul. His autobiographical memoirs, the Baburnama, is said to mention especially [...] neighboring Istalif (the name possibly derived from Greekstaphile, grape), [...] "with vineyards and orchards on either side of its torrent, its waters cold and pure". The Mughal Empire received high quality wine from the Indus valley and Afghanistan. Medieval times saw a comparably flourishing wine production, which was ended in the 18th century. The 1960s saw trials to restart production, which was ended by the Taliban. Around 1969, a French survey estimated that (larger) vineyards covered about 37,500 hectare and 2% of the arable land. The largest part of vineyards was close to Herat, Kandahar and Kabul; smaller areas have been found on the northern border. The French survey has focused on the largest professional vineyards, but mentions grapes being grown in various gardens, even at 2,400m altitude in Nuristan Province. An 1968 estimate related to a local aid program came to [...] overall. By comparison, Austrian wine is grown in an area of about [...] The <b>main</b> <b>current</b> production is around Kabul and goes – for religious reasons – mostly into juice and raisins.|$|E
