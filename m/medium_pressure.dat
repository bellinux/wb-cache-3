25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand valve}} has a chamber, which in normal use {{contains}} breathing gas at ambient pressure. A valve which supplies <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> gas can vent into the chamber. Either a mouthpiece or a full-face mask {{is connected to}} the chamber for the diver to breathe from. The mouthpiece can be direct coupled or connected by a flexible low-pressure hose. On one side of the chamber is a flexible diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. The diaphragm is protected by a cover with holes or slits through which outside water can enter freely.|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston slides into the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E

40|$|We use {{the signal}} from the {{internal}} tubes of double-wall carbon nanotubes as an ideal pressure reference. The intensity associated with the G band of the external tubes is shown {{to be related to}} the interaction of the <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> and the carbon nanotube. We observe clear <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> dependent <b>pressure</b> coefficients of the Raman G band using atomic argon, oxygen, and alcohol. The G band of the internal tubes shifts between 5. 1 and 3. 3 cm– 1 /GPa and for the external tubes between 5. 8 and 8. 6 cm– 1 /GPa for the different pressure media used. We find that the spectral shape of the optical phonon band depends clearly on the <b>pressure</b> <b>medium.</b> Ab initio calculations support local partial ordering and shell formation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> around the nanotube. The shell formation around the tube has a strong impact on the local pressure transmission...|$|R
25|$|As {{a nearly}} {{universal}} standard practice in modern recreational diving, the typical single-hose regulator has a spare demand valve fitted for emergency {{use by the}} diver's buddy, typically {{referred to as the}} octopus because of the extra hose, or secondary demand valve. The octopus was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO around 1965-6 to support the free dive attempts of Jacques Mayol. Woodward believed that having the safety divers carry two second stages would be a safer and more practical approach than buddy breathing {{in the event of an}} emergency. The <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> hose on the octopus is usually longer than the <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> hose on the primary demand valve that the diver uses, and the demand valve and/or hose may be colored yellow to aid in locating in an emergency. The secondary regulator should be clipped to the diver's harness in a position where it can be easily seen and reached by both the diver and the potential sharer of air. The longer hose is used for convenience when sharing air, so that the divers are not forced to stay in an awkward position relative to each other. Technical divers frequently extend this feature and use a 5-foot or 7-foot hose, which allows divers to swim in single file while sharing air, which may be necessary in restricted spaces inside wrecks or caves.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{integrated}} solar-cryogen {{hybrid power system}} that uses solar thermal energy and cryogen as the feedstocks. The system consists of a direct expansion (open cycle) of cryogen from an elevated pressure and a closed-loop Brayton cycle operated at a <b>medium</b> to low <b>pressure.</b> The expansion occurs sequentially in three stages (high <b>pressure.</b> <b>medium</b> and low <b>pressure</b> turbines) using solar heat as the superheating source. The open cycle uses all the three turbines, whereas the closed cycle only uses the <b>medium</b> and low <b>pressure</b> turbines. A solar thermal power system and a cryogen fuelled power system are used as the benchmarks to evaluate {{the performance of the}} newly proposed hybrid system and the three systems are optimised using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The results show that the integrated hybrid system gives a far better overall system efficiency and provides over 30 % more power output that the summation of the power outputs of the two other systems.

50|$|The overall {{shape of}} the sample {{assembly}} is a cube (typically around 6mm), this shape allows {{for each of the}} 6 anvils to make contact with each face of the sample assembly. The outer portion of the sample assembly is the <b>pressure</b> <b>medium,</b> which is commonly either boron epoxy (BE) or mullite. The choice of <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> used in the sample assembly depends on the ultimate goal of the experiment. Boron epoxy is a self gasketing material in the D-DIA, which means it can produce a seal between all the anvils during deformation, but it has been shown to impart a significant amount of water to the sample during the experiment. This added water to the sample makes it impossible to conduct rheology experiments under anhydrous conditions. The other <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> material, mullite, leaves the sample very dry, but does not have the ability to self-gasket in the D-DIA. For this reason, when mullite is used as a <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> it needs to be used in combination with a gasket material. Typically the gasket material used is pyrophyllite, and the mullite will be machined into a sphere which sits in pyrophyllite “seats”, forming a cube.|$|R
