5000|$|Alternate spellings of {{the name}} are Mississaga, <b>Massassauga</b> and Missisauga, plural forms of these three, and [...] "Mississauga Indians". Before the Anishinaabe {{language}} replaced the Wyandot language in mid-17th century as the lingua franca of the Great Lakes region, the Mississaugas were also known by the name (exonym) which the Wendat called them.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} of {{the park}} also support significant animal species including spotted turtles, Blanding’s turtles and eastern <b>Massassauga</b> rattlesnakes. Uplands support both the hognose snake and five-lined skink, {{both of which are}} considered species of special concern. There is also a population of fox snakes, which use offshore islands extensively, and overwinter in hibernacula in the area.|$|E
50|$|The 1990s {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of new cabins, a water purification system, and bathymetry equipment. It also marked {{the last days of the}} original lodge. In 1999, after 12 years of planning and fundraising, the old lodge was demolished and construction of the new Operations Centre started in the fall. The old lodge served the station well for more than 50 years, however the usage demands of the station outgrew the abilities of the old building. In 2000, the new operations center opened, providing research space, conference rooms, computer networks, office space, and year-round kitchen and dining facilities. The following year saw the donation of a parcel of property along the <b>Massassauga</b> Road. A second parcel of land was donated in 2002. Combined, these landholdings totalled 193 hectares and were named the Massasauga Tract.|$|E
50|$|The French River Provincial Park protects most of {{the land}} along the French River except for the land {{occupied}} by the Dokis. Today, over 300 years after fur traders first navigated its waters, motorboats, kayaks, and canoes now travel the French River; lodges and cottages dot the landscape, and it provides an abundance of activities for anglers and hunters. For much of its length, the French River is a broad, tree-lined expanse of open water. It also features falls, rapids, and steep, narrow gorges. The difficult topography of the Canadian Shield supports more than 450 plant species, some of them rare. The <b>Massassauga</b> rattlesnake, the only poisonous snake in Ontario, is also found in this area. Deer, moose, elk and bear are some of the larger mammals in the area. Woodpeckers, ravens, Great Blue Herons and a variety of warbler {{are just some of the}} birds that can be found along the river’s shores.|$|E
