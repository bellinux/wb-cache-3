40|$|The LVTS is an {{electronic}} network for sending and receiving large-value payments. It {{is expected to}} become operational {{in the first half}} of 1999. Major chartered banks and other large deposit-taking institutions will provide access to the system for their clients in the financial, corporate, and government sectors. Canada's LVTS exceeds world standards for risk control in large-value systems. The author explains how this is achieved through the netting, bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>credit</b> <b>limits,</b> collateral, loss-sharing procedures used in the event of a default and, as a last resort, a guarantee by the Bank of Canada. The LVTS gives participating institutions certainty of settlement for their LVTS positions every day, even if one or more participants default. This greatly reduces systemic risk in the financial system. Moreover, the LVTS supports finality of payment; that is, it makes funds unconditionally and irrevocably available to the receiver. Finality is highly desirable when the amount of the payment is substantial, or when exact timing is critical. Since the LVTS will carry the great majority of the value of all payments in Canada, it should be considered the core of the national payments system. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>limit</b> {{variability}} is {{a crucial}} aspect of the consumption, savings, and debt decisions of households in the United States. Using a large panel this paper first demonstrates that individuals gain and lose access to credit frequently and often have their <b>credit</b> <b>limits</b> reduced unexpectedly. <b>Credit</b> <b>limit</b> volatility is larger than most estimates of income volatility and varies over the business cycle. While typical models of intertemporal consumption fix the <b>credit</b> <b>limit,</b> I introduce a model with variable <b>credit</b> <b>limits.</b> Variable <b>credit</b> <b>limits</b> create a reason for households to hold both high interest debts and low interest savings {{at the same time}} since the savings act as insurance. Simulating the model using the estimates of <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> volatility, I show that it explains all of the credit card puzzle: why around a third of households in the United States hold both debt and liquid savings at the same time. The approach also offers an important new channel through which financial system uncertainty can affect household decisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the importance of}} bank-firm relationships in obtaining higher credit “limits. ” We use data from a relatively unused section of the National Survey of Small Business Finance (NSSBF, 1993) on <b>credit</b> <b>limits,</b> <b>credit</b> sources, and contract terms for firms with lines of credit from multiple banks. This lets us isolate the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> that each bank provides the same firm, eliminating the need to control for often immeasurable, unreliable, or firm-specific “soft ” information. For a median Line of Credit (LOC) of $ 250, 000, we find that a bank with a five-year information advantage provides a LOC limit that is $ 20, 000 higher. We also find that purchase of loan and non-loan services by firm from the contracting bank affects the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> differently. Non-loan services increase the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> and loan services decrease the <b>credit</b> <b>limit.</b> Our findings confirm anecdotal claims from the small business community that relationships are vital to secure higher <b>credit</b> <b>limits.</b> We check for the robustness of our results to outliers, sample selection, and stratification across firm organization types...|$|R

40|$|Credit cards {{have become}} one of the major ways for {{conducting}} cashless transactions. However, they have a long term impact on the well being of their owner through the debt generated by credit card usage. Credit card issuers approve high <b>credit</b> <b>limits</b> to <b>credit</b> card owners, thereby influencing their credit burden. A system dynamics model has been used to model behavior of a credit card owner in different scenarios according {{to the size of a}} <b>credit</b> <b>limit.</b> Experiments with the model demonstrated that a higher <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> approved on the credit card decreases the budget available for spending in the long run.

This approach can explain the credit card puzzle: why around a third of households in the U. S. hold both debt and liquid savings at the same time. Unlike other approaches it is consistent with observed changes over time. It also offers an important new channel for financial system uncertainty to affect household decisions. One of the largest "assets" in the portfolio of U. S. households is their ability to borrow. Increased uncertainty about <b>credit</b> <b>limits</b> reduces the value of this asset, and so has effects similar to a decline in wealth. credit, debt, liquidity, credit card puzzle, financial uncertainty...|$|R

It was discovered that whether the comprehensive <b>limit</b> <b>credit</b> method is superior, equal or inferior to the line-state <b>limit</b> <b>credit</b> method depends on the combination of the types of its overseas branches. The results are much complicated than the general conclusion of the present literatures and indicated that the line-state <b>limit</b> <b>credit</b> method does not ensure the fiscal revenue.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a continuous-time consumption-investment {{model for a}} household without debt enforcement. Using a duality approach, we derive closed-form solutions for op-timal consumption and portfolio policies and for endogenous <b>credit</b> (debt) <b>limits</b> over time. Our model suggests that current income levels, particularly wages, {{play an important role}} in determining <b>credit</b> <b>limits.</b> However, current wealth or net worth including financial assets is not significant in determining the <b>credit</b> <b>limits.</b> We find, on the labor income growth effect, that an increase in the income growth rate or a decrease in income volatility leads to an increase in the household’s <b>credit</b> <b>limit.</b> On the household portfolio choice, investments in risky assets are endogenously related to the procyclical <b>credit</b> <b>limit,</b> in contrast to the countercyclical Sharpe ratio. Finally, these results generate the heterogeneous investment behavior among households: The proportion of risky asset holdings is higher for the rich who have high wealth-to-income ratios during the downturn with a higher Sharpe ratio than during the boom with a lower Sharpe ratio, while it is lower for the poor with low wealth-to-income ratios during the downturn than during the boom.

50|$|PCI Express uses credit-based flow control. In this scheme, {{a device}} advertises an initial amount {{of credit for}} each {{received}} buffer in its transaction layer. The device {{at the opposite end}} of the link, when sending transactions to this device, counts the number of credits each TLP consumes from its account. The sending device may only transmit a TLP when doing so does not make its consumed credit count exceed its <b>credit</b> <b>limit.</b> When the receiving device finishes processing the TLP from its buffer, it signals a return of credits to the sending device, which increases the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> by the restored amount. The credit counters are modular counters, and the comparison of consumed <b>credits</b> to <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> requires modular arithmetic. The advantage of this scheme (compared to other methods such as wait states or handshake-based transfer protocols) is that the latency of credit return does not affect performance, provided that the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> is not encountered. This assumption is generally met if each device is designed with adequate buffer sizes.|$|R
