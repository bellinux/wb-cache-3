40|$|We {{report a}} sibship of two {{brothers}} and one sister with the osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome and congenital heart disease. They presented in infancy with visual impairment and psychomotor retardation. Major features included bilateral cataracts, generalised osteopenia, severe platyspondyly, borderline mental retardation, muscular hypotonia, joint laxity, and ventricular septal defect. Parental consanguinity and affected sibs of both sexes strongly suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Analysis of the present and previously reported cases showed {{a wide range of}} interfamilial variability which may point to the existence of <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> or genetic heterogeneity in this syndrome...|$|R
50|$|Cuénot {{spent two}} years working on mice {{and came to the}} {{conclusion}} that three “mnemons” (genes) are responsible for the production of one “chromogen” or pigment and two “distases” enzymes. The pigment (if present) is acted upon by the enzymes to produce black or yellow colour. If no pigment is present the result is an albino mouse. Cuénot studied the offspring of various crosses between mice and concluded that these “mnemons” or genes were inherited in a Mendelian fashion.Subsequently, Cuénot was the first person to describe <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> at a genetic locus.|$|R
40|$|Silencing {{of genes}} is mostly studied in diploid, homozygous, {{self-fertile}} and sexually propagated species. However, conclusions drawn for these species {{are not always}} applicable to crops like potato, which is an autotetraploid, highly heterozygous, vegetatively propagated species. Factors influencing the level of silencing in potato are discussed, with emphasis on inhibition of the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) gene. Type of construct, number of integrated T-DNA copies, structural arrangement of the T-DNA locus, integration site, target tissue and genetic background are important factors for all plant species. Ploidy level and <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> are factors deserving special attention when the efficiency of silencing of endogenous genes is studied in polyploid, heterozygous species such as potato...|$|R
40|$|Two intervarietal {{substitution}} {{lines of}} common wheat cv. Sava bearing chromosome 5 B from Saratovskaya 29 and Diamant 2 donors and two near-isogenic lines (NILs) of winter cv. Bezostaya 1 with the Vrn-B 1 locus {{from the same}} donors were developed. <b>Multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> of the dominant Vrn-B 1 locus was studied in these lines. It manifested itself as earing time variation in plants grown near Novosibirsk (West Siberia), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and in a greenhouse. One dominant allele, Vrn-B 1 S, having a stronger effect on earing time, was detected in Saratovskaya 29 and another, Vrn-B 1 Dm, in Diamant 2. The NILs and substitution lines are late-ripening. Lines with Vrn-B 1 S come to earing earlier than with Vrn-B 1 Dm...|$|R
40|$|The {{cultivated}} potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a clonally propagated autotetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 48) {{that represents}} the third most important crop in the world. Breeding e orts are complicated by some typical genetic features including, among the others, tetrasomic inheritance, chromatid segregation, high levels of heterozygosity and <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism.</b> However, unique reproductive characteristics of cultivated and wild potatoes may facilitate breeders’ work: the production of 2 n gametes; {{the presence of an}} endosperm dosage system that predicts success of interspeci c crosses; the possibility to easily extract haploids. After illustrating the genetics and reproductive characteristics of this important autotetraploid and the signi cance of its wild relatives, our chapter describes main breeding targets and reviews results obtained in manipulating whole chromosome sets, from the monoploid to the hexaploid level. Finally, the perspectives of molecular breeding are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} the principal features of inheritance in the bacteriophage T 2 H, and describe some new experiments. The genetic structure of this virus has been analyzed {{in terms of}} mutational patterns (Hershey, 1946) and by recombination tests (Hershey and Rotman, 1949). These two types of evidence agree in showing that mutational changes occur in localized regions of a complex genetic system. Mutations producing different effects usually occur at different loci, but one example of <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> has been found (Hershey and Davidson, 1951). In this instance, the locus of the alternative mutations could be analyzed rather completely {{because most of the}} host-range mutations selected in a particular way proved to belong to a single allelic series. It was found that one pair of distinct mutants satisfied all three criteria of allelism listed below, and that another pair satisfied none of them...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigations: {{the seeds of}} the wild-growing and sort samples of species of multi-year kin Couchgrass (Elymus L.), the tribes wheat (Triticeae Dum.) : couch grass Siberian (Elymus sibiricus), couch grass rough-stem (E. trachycaulus), couch grass new-English (E. novae-angliae) and some other species with the differing genome constitution. The purpose of the work: the electrophoretic study of {{variation}} and specificity of the reserve proteins of the couch grass endosperm as compared with other representatives of the tribe. The method of extraction of the minor cowpea weevils endosperm proteins, being in the base of the electrophoretic method of identification of the multi-year cereals genotypes of the wheat tribe has been developed. The <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> of genes, controlling the prolamin-gluteline complex of the multi-year cereals, has been shown. The electrophoretic spectres of the reserve proteins reflect the genome constitution and, mainly, the type of the taxons pollination.

40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> in {{heterozygous}} autopolyploid species like potato {{not only}} occurs for genes that affect morphological characteristics {{but also for}} genes involved in metabolic pathways. Based {{on a combination of}} Southern and PCR analyses, at least eight alleles encoding granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), which is responsible for amylose biosynthesis, have been identified in potato. These alleles were grouped into four classes, distinguishable by Southern analysis, and subdivided based on PCR. Despite the heterozygous and polyploid character of potato it was possible to assign variation in GBSSI activity to the allelic composition at the GBSSI loci within a large population of Solanum tuberosum cultivars and Solanum breeding lines. Moreover, the availability of an amf allele made it possible to reduce heterogeneity and enabled us to demonstrate an effect of GBSSI allelic composition on amylose content. The major difference between the alleles identified was the absence or presence of a 140 -bp fragment at a site 0. 5 kb upstream of the ATG start codon of the gene for GBSSI. The absence of this 140 -bp fragment had a major effect on GBSSI activity and amylose content, while the presence of small deletions and simple sequence repeats had no obvious effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{example of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> is {{the series of}} eye-color mutants at the white (w) locus in Drosophila melanogaster. The altemative interpretation of this series, namely, that it {{is made up of}} "pseudoalleles," or closely linked genes with similar effects, has usually been considered ruled out by two kinds of evidence. In the first place early attempts to resolve the series by crossing over failed in spite of numerous tests involving most of the mutants available at the time. (1 - 4) Secondly, a heterozygote for two different mutant genes of the series does not have the phenotype expected for non-allelic genes, namely, wild-type (or red) eye color, but instead has a mutant eye color which is usually intermediate between the colors of the two respective homozygotes. In recent years, however, several cases have been found in which non-allelic genes give a positive phenotypic test for allelism by virtue of a position effect. (5 - 7) In such cases, which have been termed "position pseudoalleles,"(7) mutant genes at the different loci (say, a and b) give a mutant phenotype in the a +/+ b heterozygote, but a wild-type, or more nearly wild-type, phenotype in the a b/+ + heterozygote...|$|R
40|$|Heterokaryon (vegetative) incompatibility, {{governing}} {{the fusion of}} somatic hyphal filaments to form stable heterokaryons, is of interest because of its widespread occurrence in fungi and its bearing on cellular recognition. Conventional investigations of the genetic basis of heterokaryon incompatibility in N. crassa are difficult because in commonly used stocks differences are present at several het loci, all with similar incompatibility phenotypes. This difficulty is overcome by using duplications (partial diploids) that are unlikely to contain more than one het locus. A phenotypically expressed incompatibility reaction occurs when unlike het alleles are present within the same somatic nucleus, and this parallels the heterokaryon incompatibility reaction that occurs when unlike alleles in different haploid nuclei are introduced into the same somatic hypha by mycelial fusion. —Nontandem duplications were used {{to confirm that the}} incompatibility reactions in heterokaryons and in duplications are alternate expressions of the same genes. This was demonstrated for three loci which had previously been established by conventional heterokaryon tests—het-e, het-c and mt. These were each obtained in duplications as recombinant meiotic segregants from crosses heterozygous for duplication-generating chromosome rearrangements. The particular method of producing the duplications is irrelevant so long as the incompatibility alleles are heterozygous. —The duplication technique has made it possible to determine easily the het-e and het-c genotypes of numerous laboratory and wild strains of unknown constitution. In laboratory strains both loci are represented simply by two alleles. Analysis of het-c is more complicated in some wild strains, where differences have been demonstrated at one or more additional het loci within the duplication used and <b>multiple</b> <b>allelism</b> is also possible. —The results show that the duplication method can be used to identify and map additional vegetative incompatibility loci, without the necessity of heterokaryon tests...|$|R
