50|$|To {{extend the}} {{usefulness}} of early treatment, Pantridge went on to develop the portable defibrillator, and in 1965 installed his first version in a Belfast ambulance. It weighed 70 kg and operated from car batteries, but by 1968 he had designed an instrument weighing only 3 kg, incorporating a <b>miniature</b> <b>capacitor</b> manufactured for NASA.|$|E
40|$|Very {{little has}} been done to {{quantify}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sound amplitudes and background noise and to determine the spectrum from healthy TMJs. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} record acoustically the sounds emitted by healthy TMJs with and without mandibular movements, for determination of baseline spectra. TMJ sounds were recorded bilaterally from 40 subjects with healthy joints by means of a self-developed recording system using <b>miniature</b> <b>capacitor</b> microphones inserted into the earpieces of a medical stethoscope placed in the meatus of the auditory canal. The recordings were performed without mandibular movements and during three consecutive opening and closing movements. The signals were high-pass-filtered at 50 Hz, low-pass-filtered at 2 kHz, and analyzed by fast Fourier transform computation on a 1024 -point window (fs = 5 kHz). The linearly weighted average baseline spectrum recorded without motion showed maximum values of 31 dBSPL (sound pressure level) with a standard error of + 2 to - 3 dB. The linearly weighted average movement spectrum had a peak of 66 dBSPL at 156 Hz and decreased almost linearly by about 40 dB/decade to 25 dBSPL at 2000 Hz with a standard error of +/- 2 dB. Thus, the TMJ sound spectrum of mandibular movements in asymptomatic subjects differed at low frequencies by up to 35 dB from the baseline spectrum in absence of motion...|$|E
40|$|<b>Miniature</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{containing}} multiple alternating thin-film dielectric {{and metal}} layers proposed, especially {{for use in}} integrated and hybrid electronic circuits. Because capacitance inversely proportional to thickness of dielectric layers, use of thin, high-quality dielectric layers affords capacitance and energy-storage densities much greater than now available. These devices much smaller and more reliable than state-of-art capacitors...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} cost effective, high performance, long life {{capacitors}} with improved reliability is discussed. It is {{shown that a}} low cost, <b>miniature</b> aluminum <b>capacitor,</b> with improved reliability and proven life, can be produced with existing technology. It is further shown that the capacitor can be specified for 125 C life and shelf test requirements, and meet established standards for their parametric performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of polythylene - 2, 6 -Naphthalate (PEN) semicrystalline film with thicknesses of 0. 9 mu, 1. 5 mu, 4. 0 Mu and community. Its unique chemical and high temparterure stability, {{as well as}} superior thermo-mechanical properties allow ultra thin (2 mu) PEN film to be processed into <b>miniature</b> multilayer chip <b>capacitors</b> for surface mount technology (SMT) application {{that can be used}} with standard soldering techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the {{electronic}} component industry {{has led to a}} demand for <b>miniatured</b> multilayer ceramic <b>capacitor</b> (MLCC), where BaTiO 3 is used due to its superior frequency characteristics, higher reliability, high breakdown voltage, excellent volumetric efficiency of the capacitance and reduced cost. MLCCs with a dielectric thickness of 2 µm have already been commercialized but the next generation components demand a thickness of 1 µm. Such requirement demands dielectric powders with uniform composition and size distribution, and weak agglomeration to allow low temperature sintering with minimum grain growth. Various methods of preparation of BaTiO 3 is available in the literature. The solid state route needs high calcinations temperature to get perovskite phase and often results in the formation of multiphase and inhomogeneous powders. High energy ball milling is also reported to produce 10 nm particle size but the approach suffers from small batch size, high processing time and energy consumption. The complex double metal salts methods involve the use of solid precursors for the manufacture of pure BaTiO 3. The process suffers from the use of costly materials, multisteps, uncontrolled particle size and interparticle agglomeration. But A simple soft chemical method of synthesizing barium titanate nanopowders is described here, which is simple and cost effective, where titanium dioxide/titanium isopropoxide was taken as a source of titanium, and tartaric acid was taken as a template material, nitric acid as an oxidizing agent. The synthesized powders then characterized by XRD, TG and DTA, SEM spectroscopy. In this process phase pure barium titanate nanopowders can be prepared at a temperature of 900 °C...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) {{lumped elements}} are crucial {{building blocks for}} designing any type of passives circuits for RF front-end applications in mobile devices. In particular, high-quality (Q) factor lumped elements are desirable for improving both insertion loss and noise performance. Integrated passive devices (IPD) technology is a platform that can provide <b>miniature</b> inductors, and <b>capacitors</b> with high- Q values that are unattainable with traditional CMOS technologies. Over the past several years, IPD technology {{has been used to}} implement devices such as filters, couplers and impedance-matching networks {{for a wide range of}} system-in-package applications. However, most of the IPD circuits do not yet have any tunable/reconfigurable functions for use in frequency agile applications. The objective of this research is to develop tunable integrated passive devices (IPDs) using barium strontium titanate (BST) and micro-electrical-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technologies. Another objective is to develop a fabrication process for monolithic integration of MEMS switches and IPD devices. A 4 -mask IPD glass/alumina-based fabrication process is developed at the University of Waterloo for the first time. Details of the modeling and characterization of high-Q lumped elements, L and C, are investigated. The RF performance of these elements is compared with that of similar designs fabricated in a commercial IPD foundry. To highlight the benefits of the IPD process, lumped element bandpass filters are designed, fabricated, and tested. BST varactors are integrated with IPD circuits to demonstrate a highly miniaturized tunable impedance matching network featuring a wide impedance coverage from 2 - 3 GHz and an insertion loss of approximately 1 dB. The network promises to be useful in a broad range of wireless applications. A high performance tunable IPD/BST bandstop filter with a wideband balun as a multichip module is also proposed. Reconfigurable IPD/BST bandpass filters with tunable transmission zeros are presented and investigated experimentally for operation under high power levels. Intermodulation test results are presented for the integrated IPD/BST devices. Making use of the fact that the IPD fabrication process is amenable to the realization of MEMS devices, the IPD process originally developed for realizing passive circuits is further expanded to accommodate monolithic integration of MEMS switches with IPD circuits. Contact-type MEMS switches are developed, fabricated and tested. Also, a monolithically integrated IPD/MEMS 3 -bit high resolution true-time delay network and high-Q switched-capacitor bank are fabricated and tested to demonstrate the benefits of integrating MEMS technology with the IPD technology...|$|R
