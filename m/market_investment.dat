40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{research}} what <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage is and how it can impact firms’ financial performance. The literature review provides a theoretical overview of <b>marketing</b> <b>investments,</b> their characteristics and targets, investment courage and the routes through which <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage can impact firms’ financial performance through actual investments. The empirical study investigates the current state of <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage among Finnish companies. The empirical data were collected through an online survey aimed at CEOs and marketing directors of Finnish companies. The effective sample of the survey was 545. Several multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the current state of <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage within Finnish firms. First, the data were analyzed with factor analysis to identify the dimensions of <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage in terms of investment targets. Second, different <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage profiles in terms of courage to invest in sets of marketing-related actions and sub-goals were identified by clustering the respondents, and the groups were characterized through contextual background variables. Finally, these groups were examined with analysis of variance to discover the possible differences in financial performance between the groups with different <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage profiles. The findings of the study identified five dimensions of <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage in terms of investment targets, named “Awareness creation and communication”, “Customer relationship and product/service development”, “Skilful workforce”, “Distribution networks and company acquisition” and “IT-systems for customer relationship management”. These dimensions were emphasized differently in the different <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage profiles identified. Differences in the financial performance between the groups were found, especially indicating a lower profit performance of the group having little courage to invest in any marketing-related actions and sub-goals compared to the other groups. The study provides an overall view of the current <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> practices in Finland and sheds light on how <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> courage can impact financial performance. The results serve as a ground for further investigations concerning particular industries or countries and qualitative studies on the underlying reasons for specific <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> practices...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to, {{building}} {{on the concept of}} relational benefits, relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments,</b> gratitude, satisfaction and favorable reciprocal behaviors, examine the mechanism of cultivating relationships with valued customers at an upscale restaurant. Design/methodology/approach – To capture the traits of the population (upscale restaurant customers who perceive relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> by experiencing relational benefits), upscale restaurant customers with membership cards were contacted in the survey. Structural equation modeling was used to test measurement and structural models. Findings – Empirical findings indicated that confidence and social benefits positively contributed to relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments,</b> whereas special treatment benefits were not significantly related to relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments.</b> In turn, relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> positively affected both gratitude and satisfaction; relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> were also more associated with gratitude than satisfaction. Gratitude positively evoked favorable reciprocal behaviors; however, satisfaction did not trigger favorable reciprocal behaviors. Originality/value – The integration of relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> and gratitude into the conceptual model would allow the current findings to generate rich theoretical and practical implications that the extant hospitality literature has not elucidated.

We present resource-based and capability-based {{arguments}} of <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> intensity to offer a strategic view of <b>marketing</b> as an <b>investment</b> in shareholder value. We find that <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> intensity has a U-shaped quadratic effect on shareholder value creation (Tobin’s q) that calls for <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> to be protected and increased, not surrendered. We show how <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> interact with investments in R&D, human capital and operations to reveal how strategic co-investments can alter the shareholder value of marketing. Finally, we show how competitive intensity and failings in the firm’s investment productivity (its ability to convert investment expenditure into sales) point to malaise in the firm’s own strategic architecture as fault for perceived poor returns from <b>marketing</b> <b>investments.</b> Our findings suggest that <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> should not be scapegoated when its contributions to shareholder value are not as expected. When invested in strategically and {{in combination with other}} <b>investments,</b> <b>marketing</b> can unlock exciting improvements in shareholder value...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{attention to}} the financial implications of <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> in <b>marketing</b> literature, several aspects of the topic remain underresearched. Building on theories related to <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> effectiveness (i. e., corporate goal attainment through <b>marketing</b> <b>investments),</b> sources of capital (used to fund the investments), and market-based assets (e. g., brand equity, customer relationships), the present thesis empirically examines the <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> of privately-held firms whose main corporate goal is on business growth. Specifically, the present research addresses both (1) the selection of marketing activities by such firms, and (2) {{the effectiveness of the}} selected investment in terms of attaining the business growth goal. The specific research questions are: (1 a) What kind of marketing activities do privately-held growth-oriented firms select to invest their external funding in?; (1 b) How do (i) the source of funding and (ii) strategic factors such as market-based assets affect the selection of marketing investments?; and (2) What configurations of <b>marketing</b> <b>investments,</b> sources of funding, and strategic factors such as market-based assets are effective in attaining the business growth goal? The research questions are examined with a sample of 200 growth-oriented private firms, merging survey data on their <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> selection, and objective data on their financial business performance. The findings reveal how the source of capital and market-based assets as well as other strategic factors (e. g., business-to-consumer [B 2 C] vs. business-to-business [B 2 B] profile; business model) affect the selection of <b>marketing</b> <b>investments,</b> and the effectiveness of those investments for growth. Considering the effectiveness, the study indicates, for instance, that a combination of product development (PDM) investment, mass-produced product, debt funding, and extensive stocks of market-based assets was consistently associated with high growth in B 2 B context, while a combination of PDM investment, customized product, other equity funding (than entrepreneur herself), and modest stocks of domestic assets and assets abroad was associated with high growth in B 2 C context. Taken together, the findings further advance marketing science and practice by increasing understanding of the financial implications of <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> and, specifically, the roles of source of capital and market-based assets in <b>marketing</b> <b>investment</b> selection and effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Firms invest {{heavily in}} {{different}} types of business-to-business relationship marketing activities {{in the belief that}} such programs bolster their bottom line. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual model that links customer-specific relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> to short-term, customer-specific financial outcomes. Data from a matched set of 313 business customers covered by 143 salespeople of 34 selling firms indicate that investments in social relationship marketing pay off handsomely, financial relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> do not, and structural relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> are economically viable for customers serviced frequently. We conceptualize relationship marketing in a context involving nested participants (customers, salespeople, selling firms) and employ a hierarchical linear modeling approach to account for observations that are not independent. Across the three hierarchical levels, the impact of the financial, social, and structural components of relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments</b> and the potential moderating factors offer valuable insights into contextual factors and managerial strategies for leveraging relationship <b>marketing</b> <b>investments.</b> In an attempt to suggest normative guidelines to managers, we extend our analysis to a simple resource allocation model that describes the optimal mix of relationship marketing resources based on firm strategies. relationship marketing, customer relationship management, marketing strategy, financial outcomes, allocation, hierarchical linear modeling...|$|R
