500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} decided I would step out, for us, not for <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>my</b> own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|Mays {{performed}} a cover version of [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] from My Fair Lady in the episode [...] "Mash-Up", a studio recording {{of which was}} included as a bonus-track on copies of [...] purchased from Target stores. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called the performance [...] "lovely", and Andrea Reiher for Zap2it similarly praised the piece: [...] "wow, she has a nice voice! She's no Julie Andrews, but she'll do." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented: [...] "Seeing Emma sing [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] was sweet, though was it just <b>me</b> (<b>or</b> <b>my</b> TV), or was the volume on her vocals a bit unusually loud? I also could have done without Will's line telling her she should sing to help her keep the beat as she danced – come on Glee, you're a musical. Embrace it and just let her sing." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of South Africa's {{laws and}} {{emergency}} regulations mandated particular penalties which judges had no discretion to modify. South Africa's whites-only parliament pursued {{a doctrine of}} parliamentary supremacy, passing laws which judges were absolutely bound to enforce {{if they had been}} enacted by parliament or were faithful to what parliament had done. Goldstone distressed civil rights lawyers in 1986 when he concurred without comment with a decision that allowed the jailing of a 13-year-old boy for disrupting school. Goldstone later remarked that he was constrained by the law, that [...] "the emergency regulations covered the situation." [...] The laws and regulations also included the death penalty for certain crimes such as murders committed without any extenuating circumstances; although Goldstone was personally opposed to the death penalty, he was nonetheless required to pass death sentences on two convicted murderers. His reluctance to impose death penalties prompted criticism from judges who were in favour of capital punishment. Another Transvaal Supreme Court judge, D. Curlewis, commented in 1991 that [...] "a person who deserves to hang was more likely to get the death sentence from <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>my</b> ilk" [...] than Goldstone or other liberal judges, who were [...] "at heart abolitionists for one reason or another... Obviously, and for that reason, they cannot be sound on the imposition of the death penalty." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>my</b> students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E

As a founding member I find this to be disrespectful to me, and to the fans that have made us {{one of the biggest}} bands in the world." [...] Criss stated in a radio interview in 2004 with Eddie Trunk that Simmons and Stanley were going to start a new Kiss, and felt that he was getting too old to play the drums for two hours (Criss was almost 59 at this time).|$|E

He had {{appeared}} on another linked adult website {{as an actor}} in Peep shows broadcast via Web cam in 2014, advertised on his official company website, his official Twitter account, #brentcorrigan, verified by link from his company page, and his Tumblr blog. On October 6, 2014, Lockhart published a Tweet stating [...] "PLEASE NOTE: Several imposter acts are soliciting money/friends on FB using my image.

2500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s Tani's work enjoyed a renewed surge of interest. Wife to be Sacrificed was {{released}} theatrically in the U.S. in 1998, playing in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. In {{preparation for this}} event, Tani was interviewed by the U.S. publication, Asian Cult Cinema for its April, 1998 issue. Surprised by this attention from the U.S., Tani commented [...] "I didn't think U.S. movie fans were interested in <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>my</b> movies. I thought Americans ignored my films because of the SM theme, since these movies {{give the impression of}} being abusive toward women. Regardless of the filmmaker's intent - the intellectual or artistic merit - I thought Americans viewed these productions as politically incorrect." ...|$|E

He has not been the same dog since. I am accustomed to hearing malicious falsehoods about myself ... But I think I have a right to resent, to object, to libelous statements about my dog.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a private}} dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice {{president}} of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber. Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who has accused Uber of sexism and misogyny. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism against Uber. [...] "The comments, reportedly made by {{senior vice president}} for business Emil Michael at a New York dinner attended by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith," [...] wrote a Washington Post columnist, [...] "ignited a powder keg of criticism about a company already perceived as cut-throat – landing Uber on the front pages of The Washington Post, USA Today and The New York Times." [...] Michael issued a public apology. Later, he sent an email to Lacy: [...] "I was at an event and was venting, but what I said was never intended to describe actions that would ever be undertaken by <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>my</b> company toward you or anyone else. I was definitively wrong and I feel terrible about any distress I have caused you." ...|$|E

2500|$|I am very {{sensible}} {{that you}} are let into {{the knowledge of the}} intrigues of the compter, particularly with relation to the securing of pocket books. But your experience is inferior to mine... I can put you in a far better method than you are acquainted with... But I must first tell you that you'll spoil the trade of thief-taking in advancing greater rewards than are necessary. I give but half a crown a book... And when the thieves and pickpockets see us confederate they'll submit to our terms.Thus their partnership started taking Hitchen and his assistant first to Temple Bar, westernmost limit of his area of Jurisdiction. There marshal was revered with different [...] "fine" [...] drinks at different taverns, to which he only gave a brief sign asking for information on stolen goods. He was verbose, though, in his [...] "promises of protection" [...] to female visitors of those establishments:"I'll give you my word...you shall be detected, unless you deliver all the pocket books you from time to time meet with to me...If you at any time for the future, refuse to yield... either to <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>my</b> servant, you may be assured of being all sent to Bridewell... Wild gives an example of marshal's treatment of well-dressed women too. Once he seized a baillif's wife in the street in Ludgate Hill for talking to a man and accused her of being [...] "lewd". He took her to Cheapside and made her wait till he dined and pay for his meal. Pickpockets, or [...] "mathematicians" [...] as Hitchen called them affectionately", appear with a noteworthy incident in this period. On their regular night walks near St.Paul's, Hitchen and Wild saw the boys running away. Hitchen, having information on a stolen book, saw the reason of their hiding. He caught and arrested one, whose name was James Jones, the same juvenile who stole Lord Barnard's bills. The boy gave the address of his friends next morning before the justice and Hitchen took Wild to Barbican to attack their house during the night. The uninvited guests were welcomed with unfriendly 'damn ye', upon which the assistant Wild was left inside with the company while the marshal fled for bringing more constables. The gang of around 12 year-olds was taken and tried at Kingston assizes as their robbery was committed in Surrey. To the great disappointment and fury of marshal, court acquitted the boys upon their parents' complaint on marshal forcing their children to commit crime. He could not claim usual 40 pounds for their dead or alive heads. Moreover, was reprimanded by the court for the base interest. Wild gives very interesting account of the other side of Hitchen's relation to pickpockets we will mention below.|$|E
