5000|$|Founded in 1950, {{and first}} located on Washington Boulevard and Western Avenue, then on Crenshaw Boulevard, {{afterward}} on Adams Boulevard {{and later on}} Washington boulevard in Los Angeles, Stewart filled the seats with quality productions. The couple did all remodeling of the building themselves, {{with the help of}} salvaged lumber from the CBS Television City construction site. Stewart hosted a variety show called Ebony Showcase Presents on KTTV from the theatre in 1953. Because CBS believed Nick Stewart's work with his theater was impairing his ability to perform on Amos 'n' Andy, he was notified that his contract would not be renewed; this was shortly before the decision to take the show off the air. By 1964, the Ebony Showcase had grown and moved again, this time to the <b>Metro</b> <b>Theater</b> near Washington and La Brea. Around this time, Nick Stewart wrote his own musical called Carnival Island. In 1973, Nick and Edna Stewart were honored by Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley and the California Museum of Science and Industry's Advisory Board for their work with the Ebony Showcase theatre.

5000|$|The Washington Post {{declared}} that [...] "Albright {{is among the}} most gifted musicians of his generation." [...] It continued that [...] "An impressive range of differently colored sounds at the keyboard was matched by overwhelming virtuosity" [...] and that Albright [...] "leapt the most outrageous technical hurdles... with a sense of dangerous self-abandon that was thrilling to hear. At the same time, musical shape was never sacrificed to showmanship." [...] With regards to Albright's 2015 tour with Keith Lockhart and the BBC Concert Orchestra, they wrote that Albright [...] "made quite an impression. He is full of ideas...and has a dazzling natural keyboard affinity. He does not have an overpowering sonority (fingers more velvet than steel) but a lot of nuance." [...] After an April 24, 2015 concert, the DC <b>Metro</b> <b>Theater</b> Arts wrote that [...] "Albright was brought back to perform an encore: the audience picked four musical notes and he improvised a piece using those four notes as a base. To hear the initial sequence of four notes and then what an elaborate, beautiful piece Albright turned those simple notes into was thrilling. To listen to his own improvisation, and the emotion he poured into this simple piece...really showed his skill and passion for the piano and for music." ...|$|R
