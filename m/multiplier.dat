5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score <b>multiplier</b> by one, up to a maximum of four times the original <b>multiplier.</b> Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current <b>multiplier</b> (up to 8x).|$|E
5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a <b>multiplier</b> bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for {{destroyed}} cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the <b>multiplier</b> reaches a certain amount it will begin to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring <b>multiplier</b> up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the <b>multiplier</b> back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring <b>multiplier</b> is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

5|$|Linear {{combinations}} combine multiplication and summation; {{they are}} sums {{in which each}} term has a <b>multiplier,</b> usually a real or complex number. Linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule, such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics.|$|E

This would deflect the grenades from falling into the American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} <b>multiplier</b> onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|The machine's most {{significant}} innovation {{is generally considered}} to be its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers. The SSEM had included two registers, implemented as Williams tubes: the accumulator (A) and the program counter (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index registers, originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the registers could be used to modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the multiplicand and <b>multiplier</b> for a multiplication operation.|$|E
40|$|Matrix <b>multiply</b> is {{ubiquitous}} in scientific computing. Considerable {{effort has been}} spent on improving its performance. Once methods that make efficient use of the processor have been exhausted,methods that use less operations than the canonical matrix <b>multiply</b> must be explored. Combining the two methods yields a hybrid matrix <b>multiply</b> algorithm. Hybrid matrix <b>multiply</b> algorithms {{tend to be less}} accurate than the canonical matrix <b>multiply</b> implementation, leaving room for improvement. There are well-known techniques for improving accuracy, but they tend to be slow and it is not immediately obvious how best to apply them to hybrid algorithms without lowering performance. Previous attempts have focused {{on the bottom of the}} hybrid matrix <b>multiply</b> algorithm, modifying the high-performance matrix <b>multiply</b> implementation. In contrast, the top-down approach presented here does not require the modification of the high-performance matrix <b>multiply</b> implementation at the bottom, nor does it require modification of the fast asymptotic matrix <b>multiply</b> algorithm at the top. The three-level hybrid algorithm presented here not only has up to 10 % better performance than the fastest high-performance matrix <b>multiply,</b> but is also more accurate...|$|R

5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score <b>multiplier</b> grows as players {{maintain}} a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} restored {{confidence in}} the British forces operating in Sierra Leone, which had been undermined by the capture of the Royal Irish patrol. After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, through the United Nations Security Council, and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL. The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced {{the creation of the}} Special Forces Support Group—a permanent unit, initially built around 1 PARA, whose role is to act as a force <b>multiplier</b> for British special forces on large or complex operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force <b>multiplier,</b> permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} Operation Barras {{was a factor}} in the {{decision}} to form the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force <b>multiplier</b> for British special forces on large or complex operations. The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion—originally 1 PARA, which was the first battalion to serve in the role—with supporting elements from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment. The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E
5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as <b>multiplier</b> onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a <b>multiplier</b> to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{is similar}} to {{previous}} titles in the series. The player hits notes as they scroll towards {{the bottom of the}} screen in time with music to maintain their performance and earn points. To hit notes using the guitar controller, the player hits the strum bar while holding down the corresponding colored fret buttons. If the player uses the standard controller instead of the guitar controller, the correct buttons need to be pressed, but the player is not required to strum. Notes can be sustained, during which the fret button is held until the note is complete, and they can also form two- to four-note chords. The game simulates hammer-ons and pull-offs for sections with a rapid series of notes, allowing the player to forgo strumming on specifically marked notes. Missing a note causes the performance meter to drop. When the meter drops too low, the player fails the song, represented in-game by the band being booed off the stage. A string of 10 consecutive correct notes earns a <b>multiplier</b> to increase the player's score, which can occur up to four times. Special sections, marked by starred notes, can be used to build Star Power. When the player has enough Star Power, they can activate it and further double the scoring <b>multiplier</b> either by tilting the guitar controller vertically or by pressing a specific button on the controller. While Star Power enabled, the performance meter increases more quickly when a correct note is hit, and missing notes have a decreased penalty. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock contains four difficulty levels: Easy, which uses three of the fret buttons; Medium, which makes use of four of the fret buttons; Hard, which uses all five fret buttons; and Expert, which adds no new fret buttons, but increases the number of notes and the general difficulty.|$|E
25|$|The Lagrange <b>multiplier</b> {{method has}} several generalizations. In {{nonlinear}} programming {{there are several}} <b>multiplier</b> rules, e.g., the Carathéodory-John <b>Multiplier</b> Rule and the Convex <b>Multiplier</b> Rule, for inequality constraints.|$|E

A special case exists where a defined special {{authority}} can set its own <b>multiplier</b> within centrally defined limits. The only currently qualifying authority is the City of London. The <b>multiplier</b> is increased annually, in April. The increase is capped at the same proportion as {{the increase in the}} Retail Prices Index for the month of September the preceding year. When revaluations take place, the <b>multiplier</b> is adjusted so that the overall change across the country {{is the same as the}} Retail Prices Index change.|$|E
