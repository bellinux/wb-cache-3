5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} <b>mitral</b> valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset <b>mitral</b> valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include <b>mitral</b> valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing of the {{pulmonary}} artery as it exits the heart. Other cardiac abnormalities may be present, including aortic stenosis, or <b>mitral</b> valve prolapse.|$|E
5|$|The left {{heart has}} two chambers: the left atrium, {{and the left}} ventricle, {{separated}} by the <b>mitral</b> valve.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and <b>mitral)</b> are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and <b>mitral</b> valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include <b>mitral</b> valve disease, in which the <b>mitral</b> valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the <b>mitral</b> valve.|$|E
5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the <b>mitral</b> valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The <b>mitral</b> valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} options for <b>mitral</b> stenosis include medical management, <b>mitral</b> valve replacement by surgery, and percutaneous <b>mitral</b> valvuloplasty by balloon catheter.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{auscultation}} of {{an individual}} with <b>mitral</b> stenosis, the first heart sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the <b>mitral</b> valve. The first heart sound is made by the <b>mitral</b> and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in <b>mitral</b> stenosis. It {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitral</b> {{stenosis}} is a valvular {{heart disease}} characterized by the narrowing of the orifice of the <b>mitral</b> valve of the heart.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitral</b> {{valvuloplasty}} is a {{minimally invasive}} therapeutic procedure to correct an uncomplicated <b>mitral</b> stenosis by dilating the valve using a balloon.|$|E
25|$|Heart valve {{dysplasia}} (including <b>mitral</b> and {{tricuspid valve}} dysplasia) is a congenital heart abnormality in dogs. Dysplasia of the <b>mitral</b> and tricuspid valves - {{also known as}} the atrioventricular (AV) valves - can appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves. Chordae tendineae are also usually abnormal.|$|E
25|$|Degenerative (myxomatous) <b>mitral</b> valve disease* is {{a common}} cause of {{congestive}} heart failure in dogs, especially small, older dogs. The leaflets of the valve become thickened and nodular, leading to <b>mitral</b> valve regurgitation and volume overload of {{the left side of the}} heart. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Dachshunds have an inherited form of this disease.|$|E
25|$|AF in {{the context}} of <b>mitral</b> {{stenosis}} is associated with a seventeenfold increase in stroke risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{indication}} for {{invasive treatment}} {{with either a}} <b>mitral</b> valve replacement or valvuloplasty is NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>mitral</b> insufficiency {{depends on the}} acuteness {{of the disease and}} whether there are associated signs of hemodynamic compromise.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} and {{a corresponding}} {{enlargement of the}} left atrium may cause an increase in size of the <b>mitral</b> valve annulus.|$|E
25|$|If {{pulmonary}} hypertension secondary to <b>mitral</b> stenosis is severe, the P2 (pulmonic) {{component of the}} second heart sound (S2) will become loud.|$|E
25|$|Rheumatic {{fever and}} Marfan's {{syndrome}} are other typical causes. MI and <b>mitral</b> valve prolapse are also common in Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Stickler {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be associated with an increased incidence of <b>mitral</b> valve prolapse of the heart, although no definitive research supports this.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{that have}} been used to assess the regurgitant {{fraction}} in <b>mitral</b> regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI.|$|E
25|$|The left atrial {{appendage}} {{can also be}} surgically amputated, sutured or stapled simultaneously with other cardiac procedures such as a maze procedure or during <b>mitral</b> valve surgery.|$|E
25|$|Case {{reports have}} noted cardiac arrhythmias {{emerging}} {{in relation to}} trazodone treatment, both in patients with pre-existing <b>mitral</b> valve prolapse and in patients with negative personal and family histories of cardiac disease.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI is {{most often}} caused by endocarditis, mainly S. aureus. Rupture or {{dysfunction}} of the papillary muscle are also common causes in acute cases, dysfunction, which can include <b>mitral</b> valve prolapse.|$|E
25|$|Stenosis of the <b>mitral</b> valve, if severe, also rarely {{produces}} an audible, low frequency soft rumbling murmur, best recognized by a practiced ear using a high quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope.|$|E
25|$|Significant <b>mitral</b> valve {{regurgitation}} has a {{prevalence of}} approximately 2% of the population, affecting {{males and females}} equally. It {{is one of the}} two most common valvular heart diseases in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|In {{individuals}} {{having been}} offered <b>mitral</b> valve surgery but refused, survival with medical therapy alone was 44 ± 6% at 5 years, and 32 ± 8% at 10 {{years after they}} were offered correction.|$|E
25|$|Steroids are {{reserved}} for cases where {{there is evidence of}} an involvement of the heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent the development of sequelae such as <b>mitral</b> stenosis.|$|E
25|$|Patients with <b>mitral</b> valve {{prolapse}} {{may have}} a holosystolic murmur or often a mid-to-late systolic click and a late systolic murmur. Cases with a late systolic regurgitant murmur may still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences.|$|E
25|$|Other causes include infective {{endocarditis}} {{where the}} vegetations may favor increase risk of stenosis. Other rare causes include <b>mitral</b> annular calcification, endomyocardial fibroelastosis, malignant carcinoid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, whipple disease, fabry disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. hurler' disease, hunter's disease, amyloidosis.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} causes MI by the {{combination}} of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles, and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This {{can lead to the}} subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the <b>mitral</b> valve annulus.|$|E
25|$|In babies, scurvy is {{sometimes}} referred to as Barlow's disease, named after Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it in 1883. However, Barlow's disease or Barlow's syndrome may also refer to <b>mitral</b> valve prolapse, first described by John Brereton Barlow in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{prosthetic}} valves {{also carry}} {{a significant increase}} in risk of thromboembolism. Risk varies, based on the valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical); the position (<b>mitral</b> or aortic); and the presence of other factors such as AF, left-ventricular dysfunction, and previous emboli.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{drug users}} {{tend to get}} their right-sided heart valves {{infected}} because the veins that are injected drain into {{the right side of}} the heart. In rheumatic heart disease, infection occurs on the aortic and the <b>mitral</b> valves on the left side of the heart.|$|E
25|$|If the LA is enlarged, {{there is}} an {{increased}} risk of thrombi that originate in the LA. Moderate to severe, non-rheumatic, <b>mitral</b> regurgitation (MR) reduces this risk of stroke. This risk reduction may be due to a beneficial swirling effect of the MR blood flow into the LA.|$|E
