5|$|Main <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing {{elements in a}} single address space), or distributed <b>memory</b> (<b>in</b> which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> St. Petersburg. Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{scenarios}} where customized allocators are desirable. Some {{of the most common}} reasons for writing custom allocators include improving performance of allocations by using memory pools, and encapsulating access to different types of memory, like shared memory or garbage-collected <b>memory.</b> <b>In</b> particular, programs with many frequent allocations of small amounts of memory may benefit greatly from specialized allocators, both in terms of running time and memory footprint.|$|E
