40|$|This paper {{looks at}} some of the {{emerging}} issues since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (UR) in the world trading system from the perspective of developing countries in Asia. Two important issues are the linking of trade and the environment, and the proposed “social clause ” to the WTO charter relating to labor standards. The author suggests that developing countries should resist the linking of market access to performance in nontrade-related areas and, in particular, the inclusion of the social clause. Concern is raised that the commitment to the phaseout of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) might be reneged and MFA recreated in effect through antidumping and safeguard measures. Potential problems with the UR agreement on these measures and the dispute settlement mechanism are presented. Institutional reforms in developing countries related to global integration and issues of transparency and corruption are addressed. A brief discussion of the potential danger for the WTO from proliferating preferential regional trading arrangements follows. Finally, the implications of the global trading system of recent us legislation are touched upon.

40|$|The initial post–World War II {{pursuit of}} capital account {{liberalization}} (CAL) by advanced economies was Europe-centric, with roots {{in a broader}} political—rather than economic—agenda of greater European integration. In continental Europe, CAL was addressed mostly through the adoption of <b>multilateral</b> instruments and <b>codes.</b> In contrast, CAL by the United States and United Kingdom was pursued unilaterally, motivated by their status as global reserve currency issuers and global financial centers. China’s situation is fundamentally different. China today has no equivalent to the European political motivation for CAL or the domestically driven financial motivation of the United States or the United Kingdom. And while China may have long-term aspirations to be a global reserve currency issuer, {{the extent to which}} it internationalizes its currency is constrained by powerful domestic economic and political interests that continue to benefit from an export-led growth model underpinned by a pegged and undervalued exchange rate, both of which are difficult to maintain with an open capital account. Alongside China’s overarching concern with the maintenance of financial and economic stability, these factors imply a different path for China than paths taken by advanced economies, with significant acceleration in the gradual pace of liberalization unlikely without accelerated development of domestic constituencies that traditionally support CAL.
