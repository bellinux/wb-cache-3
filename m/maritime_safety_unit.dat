2500|$|On February 10, 2013, {{while the}} ship was docked in Santa Cruz de la Palma in the Canary Islands, five crew members were killed and three others injured during a safety drill when the {{lifeboat}} they were in fell into the sea, trapping the occupants. Julian Bray, Marine Analyst in the UK, [...] writing in the Cduck media news blog, confirms that crew were {{taking part in a}} training exercise to load, launch, and recover lifeboats, complete a regular risk/ safety programme and to ensure crew members have had recent practical training. Malta’s <b>Maritime</b> <b>Safety</b> Investigation <b>Unit</b> subsequently issued a safety alert following the discovery of significant corrosion on the inner strands of the fall wire involved. The wire rope had parted approximately where it rested over the topmost sheave, when the davit was in its stowed position. The fore and aft davit’s fall wires had been replaced on 22 August 2010 and the next scheduled replacement was due in August 2014.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the term}} <b>{{maritime}}</b> <b>safety</b> {{is widely used}} in the maritime industry, there is no exact definition of what it entails. An explorative study of the VTS domain has been conducted to approach the concept of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety.</b> Four VTS centres were visited and 16 VTS operators were interviewed and observed to derive insights in how <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> is constructed {{from the perspective of}} an operator. Further, definitions of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> by central actors in the maritime domain have been investigated through a literature study and several interviews. The results indicate that there is no common definition of the term <b>maritime</b> <b>safety.</b> The organizations generally identify <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> as an overall goal or an umbrella term for measures such as traffic separation schemes or fairway design. In contrast to this, VTS operators consider <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> as a context-dependent condition that is shaped by their own actions. Risk and safety therefore are assessed based on situational factors, such as traffic density and geography, {{as well as on the}} individual experiences. We conclude that there is a gap concerning the understanding and definition of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> between most of the central actors (regulators, administrative bodies etc.) and the VTS operators...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{accidents}} are aimed to be prevented with an extensive amount of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> regulation. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present the findings of a questionnaire study that was targeted at Finnish maritime experts and addressed the question: how to prevent an oil accident in the Gulf of Finland. This study also includes a literature study about the problems of the current <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> regime. The findings of the questionnaire study are compared to the findings of the literature study. The questionnaire study showed that many kinds of policies have improved <b>maritime</b> <b>safety,</b> and they are needed to ensure <b>maritime</b> <b>safety.</b> For instance, ship construction, fairway maintenance, nautical charts and rules of the road at sea can be considered the cornerstones of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety.</b> However, the results ranked voluntary activities of companies as the most effective way to improve <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> in the future.

40|$|Although {{the term}} <b>{{maritime}}</b> <b>safety</b> {{is widely used}} in the maritime domain, there is no exact definition of what is included in it. This thesis is an explorative study with focus on the Vessel Traffic Service domain. VTS operators were interviewed and observed to gain insights in how <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> is constructed {{from the perspective of}} an operator. Further, definitions of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> by central organizations in the maritime domain have been studied through a literature study and several interviews. The results of the study indicate that there is no common definition of the term <b>maritime</b> <b>safety.</b> The organizations generally identify <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> as an overall goal or an umbrella term for measures such as traffic separation schemes or fairway design etc. In contrast to this, the analysis of the data obtained indicates that VTS operators define <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> as a context-dependent condition which is shaped by their own action. It is concluded that there is a gap between the central actors’ and the VTS operators’ understanding and definition of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety.</b> To increase the overall <b>safety</b> in the <b>maritime</b> domain, there is the need to overcome this gap through constructing common values, norms and identities. Instead of having several definitions of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety,</b> there should be one definition which can capture the fact of safety being a dynamic condition which is shaped by the enactment of reliability through, in this case, the VTS operators. Finally, the VTS as service to the maritime community should be seen as the subject in the construction and promotion of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety,</b> not as just an object...|$|R

40|$|The {{maritime}} {{transportation industry}} currently employs several mandatory and non-mandatory norms of organizational safety management. These safety norms are commonly included in integrated <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> management systems, which aim at developing, monitoring, controlling {{and improving the}} safety of all related shipping operations. These systems are typically evaluated by following key performance indicators, which enable defined measures for various safety management components. However, the identification of indicators addressing safety management requirements constitutes a complex and generally unsystematic process for safety managers in the maritime industry. This article proposes a new method to assess the guidelines available in <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> management norms. The proposed method is applied to assess the content of two <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> management norms. The aim of this assessment is to identify a set of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> management indicators that can systematically measure the most relevant components of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> management. The application of this method resulted {{in the identification of}} 53 key performance indicators for monitoring and reviewing 23 identified safety management components that are commonly integrated into the functioning of <b>maritime</b> <b>safety</b> management systems. The method proposed provides guidance to accurately capture the actual aim and function of the key performance indicators. Furthermore, the indicators and safety components obtained with this method can be adopted as the basis for a safety management system and/or for the analysis of a safety management system already established in the industry.
