The models yield interesting results regarding the pattern of trading outcomes with government intervention to protect or defend domestic producers operate with delay lags in the presence of linear and non-linear demand patterns. A ‘Prisoner’s Dilemma ” type game is revealed where both traders are better off when working together rather than pursuing independent trading patterns. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{conclusion of}} this essay is that regionalisation of infrastructure regulation (i. e. the creation of supranational regulatory authorities such as WATRA or ECTEL) is likely to yield significant benefits that go beyond exploiting economies of scale in both infrastructure industries and regulatory institutions. Regional integration of regulation, combined with regionalisation of regulated firms, assists developing countries in overcoming national limits in technical expertise, enhances national capacity to make credible commitments to stable regulatory policy, facilitates the introduction of competition into historically <b>monopolised</b> <b>markets,</b> improves the efficiency of infrastructure industries {{by allowing them to}} grow without respecting economically artificial national boundaries, and ultimately increases infrastructure investment. ...|$|R

50|$|Market {{penetration}} {{refers to}} the successful selling of a product or service in a specific market, {{and it is a}} measure of the amount of sales volume of an existing good or service compared to the total target market for that product or service. Market penetration involves targeting on selling existing goods or services in the targeted markets to increase a better market share/value (Arkolakis, 2010). It can be achieved in four different way including growing the market share of current goods or services; obtaining dominance of existing markets; reforming a mature <b>market</b> by <b>monopolising</b> the <b>market</b> and driving out competitors; or increasing consumptions by existing customers (Free Management Ebooks, 2013).|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, and {{influenced}} by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege. A negative aspect of the patent law also emerged in this period - the abuse of patent privilege to <b>monopolise</b> the <b>market</b> and prevent improvement from other inventors. A notable example of this was the behaviour of Boulton & Watt in hounding their competitors such as Richard Trevithick through the courts, and preventing their improvements to the steam engine from being realised until their patent expired.|$|R

40|$|Gambetta's {{theoretical}} framework focuses on two important aspects directly {{relating to the}} birth and development of mafias, namely a demand for private protection and a supply of the same. In the Post-Mao era, China started its transition from a centrally controlled economy to a market-directed economy by adopting reform and opening-up policies. The widespread creation of property rights has exponentially enlarged the demand for protection. However, property rights are ambiguously defined in the Chinese legal system, and the state is unable and unwilling to provide efficient and sufficient law enforcement mechanisms for needy people because of the rampant corruption of government officials and the weak judicial system. In this case, the mafia that {{is interested in the}} private provision of protection developed into an alternative enforcement mechanism for 'securing' property rights in China's economic transition. The most important service offered by the mafia in China is not only to assist business enterprises in <b>monopolising</b> the <b>market,</b> but also to assist local government in China's economic reform. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The Third Energy Package of the European Commission, {{enforced}} in March 2011, brought {{significant changes}} to the energy market of the European Union while implementing anti-monopolistic measure of unbundling.

By studying a single case of a conflict between Lithuania and Gazprom, so far erupted around the new measures, via the analysis of recent events and previous actors’ behaviour tendencies, the thesis concludes that, in a short-term perspective, Third Energy Package regulations are unprofitable and even dangerous to develop within the monopolized gas market of Lithuania {{taking into account the}} lack of alternative energy sources and gas suppliers as well as of financial reserves for energy infrastructure transformation. It is proposed, that factual de-monopolization of the energy sector should be realized before implementing relevant administrative regulations...|$|R

40|$|We {{explain the}} {{economics}} of deregulation in the Norwegian market. We observed a transition from a regulated duopoly prior to 1994 to a <b>monopolised</b> airline <b>market</b> in 2001. We explain how eight years of deregulation and competition led to this outcome. In particular we discuss and model {{a feature of the}} Norwegian airline market {{that was one of the}} main factors behind the merger; the competition on the large customer contracts. We explain how these contracts led to Bertrand-like competition on the large customers and a prisoner’s dilemma situation for the airline companies. They operated costly excess capacity, they did not price discriminate correctly according to the demand elasticities, and they lost a lot of revenue from fierce competition for the large customers. The merger solved all these problems. Then within the present competitive situation, which resembles the situation in most European countries with one large dominating flag-carrier, we discuss some measures we believe may create future domestic competition. We focus on the anticompetitive effect of frequent flyer programs, but also discuss issues like airport charges, airport handling and predatory behaviour. Finally, we briefly comment upon the future situation and the European low-cost-no-frills ‘revolution’...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} {{of one of}} two competitors on a line {{to open a new}} plant is analysed. Three levels of interdependence -or independence- between the already existing firm and the new plant are studied: complete independence, joint decision making with respect to the location of the new plant only and joint decision making with respect to both pricing and location of the second plant. The latter is shown to make the already existing firm not to open the new plant. On the contrary, if the intention of the already existing firm is to drive its rival out of the <b>market,</b> <b>monopolising</b> thereafter the line, the new plant is located on the same point on which the multiplant firm's rival is located.

40|$|For over 150 {{years the}} names Boosey and Hawkes {{dominated}} the British music scene, at first independently, and from 1930, {{in response to}} the difficult trading conditions of the Depression, as a single firm – Boosey & Hawkes. Although it was run as one company it comprised two divisions – the publishing business and instrument manufacturing. This thesis examines the history, role and significance of Boosey & Hawkes and its associated companies as musical instrument makers. Acquisition of new firms played an important part in business expansion, and particular focus is given here to the complex and lengthy incorporation of Besson & Co. into Boosey & Hawkes. The influence of Boosey & Hawkes extended far beyond Great Britain; in its heyday, besides providing wind instruments for the numerous civilian bands at home, the company supplied instruments to military regiments of the British armed forces, resulting in global distribution. Consequently the company became a symbol both of the British Empire and of British music. After the upheaval of the Second World War hand-crafting instruments gave way to mass production with many instruments made for educational purposes. Productivity increased, but quality-control declined, and {{it has been argued that}} the more successful new instruments were essentially the result of old-fashioned craftsmanship. These changing methods of manufacture are appraised here, and instrument design and innovation are examined and evaluated. During the 1960 s and 1970 s Boosey & Hawkes <b>monopolised</b> the <b>market</b> and the firm became one of the largest and most successful instrument manufacturing companies in the world. However, competition from companies abroad, mismanagement and bad workmanship caused the demise and eventual closure of Boosey & Hawkes instrument-making division in 2003...|$|R

50|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known pathogens, and began having a major impact on human {{survival}} about 10,000 years ago with the birth of agriculture. The development of virulence in the parasite has been demonstrated using genomic mapping of samples from this period, confirming the emergence of genes conferring a reduced risk of developing the malaria infection. References to the disease can be found in manuscripts from ancient Egypt, India and China, illustrating its wide geographical distribution. The first treatment identified is thought to be Quinine, one of four alkaloids from the bark of the Cinchona tree. Originally it was used by the tribes of Ecuador and Peru for treating fevers. Its role in treating malaria was recognised and recorded first by an Augustine monk from Lima, Peru in 1633. Seven years later the drug had reached Europe and was being used widely with the name 'the Jesuit's bark'. From this point onwards the use of Quinine and the public interest in malaria increased, although the compound was not isolated and identified as the active ingredient until 1820. By the mid-1880s the Dutch had grown vast plantations of cinchona trees and <b>monopolised</b> the world <b>market.</b>|$|R

40|$|Developing {{countries}} greatly need {{to boost}} economic investment {{in order to}} spur growth, boost jobs, transfer advanced technologies, reduce poverty and increase their capacity to expand social welfare programmes. Towards this end, most have constructed and coordinated vigorous policies to attract new foreign direct investment (FDI) and India is no exception to this (OECD, 2002; Stiglitz, 2006; Rao and Dhar, 2011 b). Transnational corporations (TNCs), the source of most FDI, are powerful actors {{in the global economy}} and they, in turn, try to get the best possible deals from governments who are desperate to host them. In such a charged economic and political environment, {{there is no guarantee that}} FDI will implant these desired assets (Nunnenkamp, 2002; OECD, 2002; 2008; Lipsey, 2003). Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that TNCs bring a great many risks, as well as benefits, including labour exploitation, corrupt practices, including bribery, and the ability to unduly influence policy outcomes and <b>monopolise</b> domestic <b>markets</b> (Madeley, 1999; Richter, 2001; Farnsworth, 2004). Thus, TNCs carry great risks, for the citizens, economies and local communities of host countries enticing FDI in the hopes of securing seriously needed development assistance. This thesis analyses the potential benefits and disadvantages of FDI to India and its citizens as reported by elite policy stakeholders. The research is based on qualitative interviews in New Delhi, India with 40 participants from NGOs, IGOs, and policy and research organisations that target economic and social development issues. In addition, it utilises documentary and policy analysis methods in order to investigate India’s investment and development strategy through the Indian investment bureaux. Through this analysis, the thesis reveals that FDI to India brings both benefits and disadvantages to its citizens and economy. India’s current growth model is catering to the middle class consumer and employment needs and in this regard, FDI has increased opportunities and brought advantages. However, FDI is not bringing much benefit for those in the lower social classes. What’s worse, it is attributed to socioeconomic ills such as widening inequalities, increased social tensions, land displacement and the transport of low levels of global value chains which are rife with poor working conditions and exploitation. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the new era}} of modernity, the {{competitive}} environment has spread widely into all sectors including the electricity market which began since 1980 s. A number of market models have been introduced and each model was designed appropriately with its local condition. The selection of the model used depends on the justification determined by power utilities or regulatory policies {{taking into account the}} technical and economic aspect point of view. Looking forward to an opened and competitive electricity trading market, Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) has aimed to restructure its current model to become a wholesale market model by taking the first step in 1992 through the introduction of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Since then MESI applies the Single Buyer Model which produces no transparent competition either on generation or demand side. Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) is the only company that acts as the power off taker by all power producers and sells the energy to all relevant parties. The purpose of this research is to study in depth the restructuring of electricity supply industry and identifying the advantages and disadvantages for each electricity market models, i. e. existing single buyer, pool and bilateral market model. The economic benefits from the view point of power producers under these models were also analyzed. The findings can be used by the Energy Commission (EC) as a starting point in planning towards the next step of competitive environment. Besides, the current power authority (TNB) and other private investors may also use these findings for their own forecast on the system planning. A case study was carried out in order to compare the three market models in term of generation revenue by using the Matlab Simulation under the real load profiles for peninsular of Malaysia. The results showed that the single buyer is uncompetitive but is controllable as TNB <b>monopolise</b> the <b>market.</b> However, both pool and bilateral market models are able to provide a competitive environment but creates higher risk as the energy price might fluctuate {{from time to time in}} practical.

40|$|Free (Libre) /Open Source Software (FLOSS) is an open, {{evolutionary}} {{arena in}} which hundreds and sometimes thousands of users voluntarily explore and design code, spot bugs in code, make contributions to the code, release software, create artwork, and develop licenses in a fashion that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the otherwise hugely <b>monopolised</b> software <b>market.</b> This ‘computerisation movement’ emerged {{as a challenge to}} the monopolisation of the software market by such mammoth firms as Microsoft and IBM, and is portrayed as being revolutionary (Elliot and Scacchi, 2004; DiBona, Ockman, and Stone, 1999; Kling and Iacono, 1988). Its ‘ultimate goal’ is ‘to provide free software to do all of the jobs computer users want to do and thus make proprietary software obsolete’ (Free Software Foundation, 2005). However, if it is to succeed in bringing about a new social order (Kling and Lacono, 1988), this movement must be re-evaluated from a critical standpoint through a look into the practices of knowledge production based on radical licenses for property sharing and development such as the General Public Licence (GPL) and the emerging subjectivities of participants. Free Software may be viewed as a social movement while Open Source is perhaps a development methodology, but it is not always necessary to isolate analysis to one or the other, firstly due to the extensive overlap in software communities, and secondly because their rhizomatic roots emerge from a shared intellectual and moral response to the exploitation of markets by powerful firms (see Elliot and Scacchi, 2004). Here, I query whether the activities of collaborative software producers as well as hardware production communities such as those found in FabLabs, which release playbots and other blueprints for machine replications as well as agricultural and construction initiatives, can indeed be perceived as revolutionary due to their subversive work and production methods. The recursive communities (Kelty 2006; Powell 2008) that develop around these practices are linked, with shared practices, goals and self-perceptions. People’s emerging subjectivities are the most important dimension of such radical production ecologies, because they reflect both the immaterial and material dimensions of the inherently political projects involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} 'Fine Art' is {{dominated}} by institutions and auction houses. These act as gatekeepers by <b>monopolising</b> the primary <b>market.</b> The choice of art as an investment vehicle {{is based on a}} combination of expected return and subjective preference. The reason for investing in 'Fine Art' is more than purely for financial gain. There are other more intrinsic factors that are considered as part of the investor decision-making process. This market for 'Fine Art' can be considered largely inefficient. Exclusivity, high prices, institutional based indexes and the overall lack of information are by far the greatest drivers of this market inefficiency. „Art‟ prices are usually set in the primary market for 'Fine Art' through the auction process and the auction process should also typically reflect an efficient way of creating shared value. However, the auction process in the primary art market is not efficient and does not create shared value as would occur in a typical free market structure. The systems employed by the auction process in the primary art market is a strategy in itself, giving the impression that there is shared value, and thus distorting prices while simultaneously stimulating investor confidence. This becomes apparent when the price for 'Fine Art‟ does not necessarily reflect the „true‟ value of the respective „Fine Art‟ being sold. Thus investors may take advantage of this situation, by traveling across international borders to purchase what they would consider valuable art. In effect, art tourism is driven by market inefficiency in the 'Fine Art' market...|$|R
5000|$|The British {{were selling}} very high cost cloths to the Indians. The Indian Mill owners wanted to <b>monopolise</b> the Indian <b>market</b> themselves. Ever since the American Civil War had caused a {{shortage}} of American cotton, Britain would buy cotton from India at cheap prices and use the cotton to manufacture cloth. The khadi movement by Gandhi aimed at boycotting foreign cloth [...] Mahatma Gandhi began promoting the spinning of khadi for rural self-employment and self-reliance (instead of using cloth manufactured industrially in Britain) in the 1920s in India, thus making khadi an integral part and an icon of the Swadeshi movement. The freedom struggle revolved around the use of khādī fabrics and the dumping of foreign-made clothes. When some people complained about the costliness of khadi to Mahatma Gandhi, he started wearing only dhoti though, of course, he used wool shawls when it got cold. Some {{were able to make}} a reasonable living by using high quality mill yarn and catering to the luxury market. Mahatma Gandhi tried {{to put an end to}} this practice. He even threatened to give up khadi altogether if he didn't get his way. However, since the weavers would have starved if they listened to Gandhi, nothing came of this threat.After Independence, the Government reserved some types of textile production- e.g. towel manufacture- for the handloom sector. This resulted in a deskilling of traditional weavers and a boost for the power-loom sector which was supposed to be a cottage industry. Private Sector enterprises have been able to make handloom weaving somewhat remunerative. Mahatma Gandhi's khadi program- despite huge subsidies- failed to do so. This does not prevent various state governments and the Government of India periodically appealing to citizens to promote the usage of Khadi.|$|R
