40|$|Spatial layout {{problems}} affect architects, physicists {{and many}} other professionals {{in their attempts to}} streamline factory designs, find optimal molecular configurations or arrange components for micro-circuitry design. Although genetic algorithms have been used successfully in many of these areas, certain aspects of these problems still represent a major challenge for the GA community. This paper discusses the problems of adding heterogeneous objects, continuous placement and forbidden zones to the general layout problem. The factory floor layout problem is used {{as an example of the}} effect and problems of dealing with these extensions. Results are achieved through the use of an iterative local optimizer and a genetic algorithm. 1 Introduction Spatial layout problems occur in many fields including component placement in <b>micro</b> <b>circuitry</b> design, modeling of theoretical physics problems such as the C 60 Bucky Ball [1] and operations research problems like the factory floor layout problem [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|How do local {{circuits}} in {{the inferior}} colliculus (IC) process and transform spectral and temporal sound information? Using a four-tetrode array {{we examined the}} functional properties of the IC and metrics of its <b>micro</b> <b>circuitry</b> by recording neural activity from neighboring single neurons in the cat. Spectral and temporal response preferences were compared for neurons found on the same and adjacent tetrodes, as well as across distant recording sites. We found that neighboring neurons had similar preferences while neurons recorded across distant sites were less similar. Best frequency was the most correlated parameter between neighboring neurons and best frequency differences exhibited unique clustering at ~ 0. 3 octave intervals, indicative of the frequency band lamina. Other spectral and temporal parameters of the receptive fields were more similar for neighboring neurons than for those at distant sites and the receptive field similarity was larger for neurons with small differences in best frequency. Furthermore, correlated firing was stronger for neighboring neuron pairs and increased with proximity and decreasing best frequency difference. Thus although response selectivities are quite diverse in the IC, spectral and temporal preference within a local microcircuit are functionally quite similar. This suggests a scheme where local circuits are organized into zones that are specialized for processing distinct spectrotemporal cues...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{interest}} researches in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which involves the maturing techniques of integrated <b>circuitry,</b> <b>micro</b> electro mechanical systems (MEMS) and digital signal processing [1]. WSNs usually can be composed of hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes, each one of which is capable of sensing its environment, performing simple computations, and communicating to its neighbors [2]. Due to the sensing behavior on a larger geographical region and sending their readings (raw data) to the sink, the sensor nodes with limited energy being supplied from built-in battery will die gradually. Apparently, the power saving of sensor nodes is vital to prolong the lifetime of the entire network.|$|R

40|$|CoCoMac (cocomac. org) {{is a large}} {{data base}} on {{structural}} connectivity in the Macaque brain, based on over 450 published axonal tracing studies [1]. This huge curation effort took place {{under the guidance of}} Rolf Kötter, and provided data to numerous brain network analysis and modeling studies. While working on a major new release of the database, Rolf Kötter sadly passed away in June 2010. We are committed to foster the further development of CoCoMac and are gradually releasing the newly developed web interface at the CoCoMac 2. 0 server hosted at the German INCF Node (cocomac. g-node. org). Macaque structural connectivity data is relevant for uncovering the large-scale human connectome and increasingly plays a role in constraining neuronal network models that link the connectivity structure to activity dynamics and network function. With recent advances in computer hardware and simulation software [2], brain-scale simulations with millions of spiking neurons become feasible, accounting simultaneously for the macroscopic and the microscopic structure of cortical networks. These models promote the integration of local <b>micro</b> <b>circuitry</b> and long-range connectivity data on the level of the cell-type specificity of connections. Such level of detail cannot be provided by diffusion MRI-based techniques: for layer-specificity, intracortical resolution and directionality, one has to fall back to axonal tracing experiments. Combining these into a complete picture for the entire brain is an enormous challenge, as it involves experiments that have been measured in thousands of individual brains {{over the course of a}} century...|$|E
40|$|Industry often requires, in {{a variety}} of processes, the {{measurement}} of deformation induced in a solid object by mechanical stress. One such process is during the manufacture of very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI). During this process a substrate is coated with a thin film to protect the <b>micro</b> <b>circuitry</b> formed on the substrate. Due to the differences in thermal expansions between film and substrate, mechanical stresses can develop which may lead to deformation of the substrate surface. Any deformation of the substrate surface will result in mechanical stress in the interconnections of the circuitry, which could result in severe damage to the operation of the circuit. Different measurement techniques are available to measure the spherical deformation of substrates, with the latest known technique being a combination of a laser beam deflection and light scattering techniques. Many of the existing techniques reveal shortcomings, one of which is a 2 -dimensional scanning capability with a minimum of moving components. Another shortcoming is the incapability of previous techniques to calculate the relative error which the measuring technique induces into the results. The aim of this study has been to develop an electro-optical system embodying the successful principles of these techniques in a system which will eliminate the shortcomings and produce results in excess of those previously recorded. In this work, we have concentrated on discussing the development of a system which will produce in situ real time monitoring of mechanical stresses in a solid. The system includes the minimization of system induced errors through the calculation of error voltage gains, and the introduction of a 2 -dimensional scanning capability to determine the true position of the laser beam without prior knowledge of the initial substrate curvature. A four-quadrant position sensitive detector (PSD) with relevant Lab View software and programs were also introduced into the system...|$|E
40|$|The lateral {{entorhinal cortex}} {{is a part}} of the parahippocampal region, and has {{received}} attention for being involved in object and object characterization task, hence conveying nonspatial input to the hippocampal formation. In order to fully comprehend the functional role of the lateral entorhinal cortex, an important step is to understand the function of its local <b>micro</b> <b>circuitry.</b> Interneurons have been strongly implemented in the functioning of cortical networks. However, little is known concerning the interneurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the distribution of somatostatin cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex, and to look at their monosynaptic inputs. For the distribution analysis we injected an adeno-associated helper virus into the lateral entorhinal cortex of somatostatin- Cre mice. In our monosynaptic tracing experiments, we injected both adeno-associated helper virus and a G-deleted rabies virus into the lateral entorhinal cortex in our transgenic mouse line. We tested several viral strategies to optimize the viral tracing protocol. Cresyl Violet stained sections were used to delineate brain areas. Viral tracers were visualized either by the expression of fluorescent proteins or immunohistochemically enhanced with AlexaFluor dyes. The tissue was subsequently analyzed by using traditional microscopical techniques. After testing several viral injections strategies, we found that the most optimal strategy involved separate injections of virus, separated by a sufficient incubation period which serves to ensure the framework for viral transport. The results from the monosynaptic viral tracing experiments showed that the somatostatin cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex have a strong intrinsic connectivity within the LEC, but also receive a substantial amount of input from extrinsic sources. Our distribution analysis showed that the majority of somatostatin cells are situated in deeper layers of the lateral entorhinal cortex, and that they are evenly distributed throughout the dorsoventral axis...|$|E
