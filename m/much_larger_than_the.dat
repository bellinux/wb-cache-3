5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, {{and it is}} <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E
5|$|The corona is the {{extended}} {{atmosphere of the}} Sun, which has a volume <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Pratt's {{curriculum}} is narrower in scope, but still accommodates double majors {{in a variety}} of disciplines. The school emphasizes undergraduate research—opportunities for hands-on experiences arise through internships, fellowship programs, and the structured curriculum. More than 27 percent of Pratt undergraduates study abroad, small compared to about half of Trinity undergraduates, but <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> recent national average for engineering students (3.2%).|$|E

5|$|The greater noctule bat also {{interacts with}} parasites {{that live in}} the trees that they roost in and {{transfer}} themselves to the bats while they are sleeping. The greater noctule bat also interacts with the few nocturnal flying predators in its area, mainly owls that are <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> bat. Evidence of greater noctule bat bones have been found in owl pellets.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-compact dwarfs {{resemble}} {{globular clusters}} {{but have a}} diameter of 10 parsecs (33 light-years) or more, <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 3-parsec (10 light-year) maximum of globular clusters. Their nature is unclear {{as to whether they}} are dwarf galaxies captured by M87 or a new class of massive globular cluster. Almost a hundred have been identified from the thousands of globular clusters in M87.|$|E
5|$|King Rufus, {{the leader}} of a furry race of creatures called the Gobbos, is {{watching}} the sunrise over Gobbo Valley when he sees a large, woven basket carrying a baby crocodile floating down the river. Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of their own and teach it in the ways of the Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Gobbos.|$|E

5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, because of the color pattern around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|The future site of Cardiff Castle {{was first}} used by the Romans as a {{defensive}} location for many years. The first fort was probably built about AD55 and occupied until AD 80. It was a rectangular structure <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> current site, and formed part of the southern Roman border in Wales during the conquest of the Silures. When the border advanced, defences became less important and the fort was replaced with a sequence of two, much smaller, fortifications {{on the north side}} of the current site.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of the Haupiri statistical district, which covers a <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> area <b>than</b> <b>the</b> locality, was 531 in the 2013 Census, an increase of 150 people from 2006.|$|R

5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E
5|$|The castle's fourth corner forms its {{gatehouse}}. Here {{the classic}} Edwardian gatehouse design {{has been transformed}} into an asymmetrical structure, with one tower <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other. The gatehouse included portcullises, murder-holes and a drawbridge. Beyond the gatehouse lies a large barbican, inspired by a similar design of the period at the Tower of London and possibly built by the same workmen, designed to protect the causeway leading to the gatehouse. The barbican today is only half of its original height, and includes its own gate, designed to trap intruders within the inner defences. The gatehouse and barbican are linked by a stone causeway.|$|E

5|$|The {{historic}} {{range of}} the species included much of the southern half of the United States, and in the south extended much farther to cover most of the South American continent. In total, its northern range has receded 1,000km (621mi) southward and its southern range 2,000km (1243mi) northward. Ice age fossils of the jaguar, dated between 40,000 and 11,500 years ago, have been discovered in the United States, including some at an important site {{as far north as}} Missouri. Fossil evidence shows jaguars of up to 190kg (420lb), <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> contemporary average for the animal.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake {{and seemed to be}} making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.|$|E
