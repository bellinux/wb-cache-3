In 1976, the ownership of IDBI {{was transferred to the}} Government of India and it was made the principal financial institution for coordinating the activities of institutions engaged in financing, promoting and developing industry in India. IDBI provided financial assistance, both in rupee and foreign currencies, for green-field projects as also for expansion, <b>modernisation</b> and <b>diversification</b> purposes. In the wake of financial sector reforms unveiled by the government since 1992, IDBI also provided indirect financial assistance by way of refinancing of loans extended by State-level financial institutions and banks and by way of rediscounting of bills of exchange arising out of sale of indigenous machinery on deferred payment terms.|$|R
5|$|The Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation (UPFC) was {{established}} in the year 1954 under the SFCs Act of 1951 mainly to develop small- and medium-scale industries in the state. UPFC provides financial assistance to new and existing units undergoing <b>diversification,</b> <b>modernisation,</b> expansion, or acquisition of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. The UPFC also provides working capital to existing units with a sound track record and to new units under a single window scheme. As of July 2012, due to financial constraints and directions from the state government, lending activities have been suspended except for State Government Schemes. The state has reported total private investment worth over Rs. 25,081 crores during the years of 2012 and 2016. According to a recent report of World Bank on Ease of Doing Business in India, Uttar Pradesh was ranked among the top 10 states and first among Northern states.|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication {{facility}} {{has been provided}} in most countries as a user pay public service managed, typically, through the Post, Telegraph and Telephone departments or by some government-owned monopoly. The tradition has been to regard it as a natural monopoly to be supplied by the public sector. 1 This perception has changed. Telecommunication is now increasingly recognised as a prime mover of the modern day economy. It is opening to participation by the private sector. The economic benefits of telecommunications are enormous, both as a growth industry {{in its own right}} and in terms of its impact on economic development. It has a significant social role in transforming how people communicate, become informed or do business. Additionally, it is also environment-friendly because it disseminates information without shifting goods or people. The practice now in vogue is to establish a regulatory agency {{with a high degree of}} independence from both operator and government. The regulator’s task is to implement government policy, ensure performance accountability by the operators and other players in respect of economic and social policy objectives, resolve disputes between competitors, monitor changing industry conditions and advise government on developments bearing on policy. The regulatory agency acts as a buffer between telecom operators and government, helping to ensure the separation of functions. Of late governments have increasingly been pursuing the policy of privatisation, liberalisation and de-regulation of telecommunication services. Pakistan has also made an advance in this direction with the promulgation of the Pakistan Telecommunications (Reorganisation) Act 1996. The main objectives are the promotion of rapid development, <b>modernisation</b> and <b>diversification</b> of telecommunication services and protection of consumer interest. In this paper an attempt has been made to answer the question as to why there is need to regulate telecommunication. Determining reasonable prices for a monopoly public service is an important area in telecom sector. ...|$|R
40|$|William Cottrell-Dormer {{became the}} first Director of the newly formed Department of Agriculture Stock and Fisheries (DASF) after World War II. After {{completing}} his tertiary studies, Cottrell-Dormer became an agricultural research officer with coconut companies in the British Solomon Islands. During the War, he served as the Director of Agriculture in Tonga, where {{he was responsible for}} the introduction of the modern marketing of copra. Cottrell-Dormer arrived in Port Moresby in 1946 where he envisaged and created a Department of Agriculture for the newly amalgamated Territories of Papua and New Guinea. In line with Australian policies of the time, he attempted not only to keep the people on the land but with the aid of his "grassroots" organisations, attempted to include them in all areas of decision making when implementing changes with in the community. By adopting a community development approach to agricultural change, Cottrell-Dormer created opportunities for Indigenous farmers to participate in a wider, even global trade network. The government’s overall goals were for <b>modernisation,</b> expansion and <b>diversification</b> into export crops, and for new food crops to improve the standards of living and nutrition. Cottrell-Dormer’s vision for an agricultural extension program in Papua New Guinea continues today in the now Independent country...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} deindustrialisation, {{the declining}} contribution of industrial activities to economic output and employment, in Lanarkshire, Scotland’s largest coalfield between {{the early nineteenth}} and mid-twentieth century. It focuses on contraction between the National Coal Board’s (NCB) vesting in 1947 and the closure of Lanarkshire’s last colliery, Cardowan, in 1983. Deindustrialisation was not the natural outcome of either market forces or geological exhaustion. Colliery closures and falling coal employment {{were the result of}} policy-makers’ decisions. The thesis consists of four thematic chapters: political economy, moral economy, class and community, and generation and gender. The analysis is based on archival sources including Scottish Office reports and correspondence relating to regional policy, and NCB records. These are supported by National Union of Mineworkers Scottish Area and STUC meeting minutes, and oral history testimonies from over 30 men and women with Lanarkshire coalfield backgrounds, as well as two focus groups. The first two chapters analyse the process of deindustrialisation, with the first offering a top-down perspective and the second a bottom-up viewpoint. In chapter one deindustrialisation is analysed through changes in political economy. Shifts in labour market structure are examined through the development of regional policy and its administration by the Scottish Office. The analysis centres upon a policy network of Scottish business elites and civil servants who shaped a vision of <b>modernisation</b> via industrial <b>diversification</b> through attracting inward investment. In chapter two the perspective shifts to community and workforce. It analyses responses to coalfield contraction through a moral economy of customary rights to colliery employment. A detailed investigation of Lanarkshire colliery closures between the 1940 s and 1980 s emphasises the protracted nature of deindustrialisation. Chapters three and four consider the social and cultural structures which shaped the moral economy but were heavily altered by deindustrialisation. Chapter three focuses on the dense networks that linked occupation, community, and class consciousness. Increasing coalfield centralisation and remote control of pits from NCB headquarters in London, and mounting hostility to coal closures, contributed to an accentuated sense of Scottish-ness. Chapter four illuminates gender and generational dimensions. The differing experiences of cohorts of men who faced either early retirement, redundancy or transfer to alternative sectors, or those who never attained anticipated industrial employment due to final closures, are analysed in terms of constructions of masculinity and the endurance of cultural as well as material losses. This is counterpoised to women who gained industrial work in assembly plants and the perceived gradual attainment of an improved economic and social position whilst continuing to navigate structures of patriarchy...|$|R
