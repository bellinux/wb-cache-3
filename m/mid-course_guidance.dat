5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August 2017, the LRASM {{conducted}} {{its first}} flight test in a production representative, tactical configuration. The missile was {{dropped from a}} B-1 Lancer, navigated through all planned waypoints, transitioned to <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and flew toward a moving maritime target using inputs from its onboard sensor, then descended to low altitude for final approach, positively identifying and impacting the target.|$|E
25|$|Launched on 26 March 1961, Groznyy was {{initially}} {{accepted into the}} Northern Fleet. After visits from General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Admiral Sergey Gorshkov on 4 May 1962, the ship undertook tests that culminated in the successful launch of two P-35 missiles in front of Khrushchev on 22 July. The ship undertook the first successful deck landing and take off of the <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> derivative of the Kamov Ka-25 in 1966 and {{was transferred to the}} Black Sea Fleet on 5 October that year.|$|E

50|$|In 2015, {{an upgrade}} of the Type 88 became {{operational}} called the Type 12. The Type 12 features INS with <b>mid-course</b> GPS <b>guidance</b> and better precision due to enhanced contour/terrain matching and target discrimination capabilities. The weapon is networked, where initial and mid-course targeting {{can be provided}} by other platforms, and also boasts shorter reload times, reduced lifecycle costs, {{and a range of}} 124 mi.|$|R
50|$|The Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Missile (12式地対艦誘導弾) is a truck-mounted {{anti-ship missile}} {{developed}} by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 2012. It is an upgrade of the Type 88 Surface-to-Ship Missile. The Type 12 features INS with <b>mid-course</b> GPS <b>guidance</b> and better precision due to enhanced contour/terrain matching and target discrimination capabilities. The weapon is networked, where initial and mid-course targeting {{can be provided}} by other platforms, and also boasts shorter reload times, reduced lifecycle costs, {{and a range of}} 124 mi.|$|R

5000|$|Guidance: Inertial with <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> update {{from ground}} based phased array radar, Semi-active radar homing (SARH) for {{terminal}} guidance ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> is {{provided}} by the fighter (though not necessarily the one that launched the missile) until the active seeker acquires the target; the missile then becomes autonomous for the terminal engagement phase.|$|E
50|$|The Aegis system {{communicates}} {{with the}} Standard missiles through a radio frequency (RF) uplink using the AN/SPY-1 radar for <b>mid-course</b> update missile <b>guidance</b> during engagements, but still requires the AN/SPG-62 radar for terminal guidance. This means that with proper scheduling of intercepts, {{a large number}} of targets can be engaged simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{a further}} {{developed}} version, the RBS-15 Mk. II, {{began in the}} early 1980s. But it took until 1994 to get a development contract for the upgraded anti-ship missile. The Mk. II has the same range (70+ km), but the <b>mid-course</b> and terminal <b>guidance</b> system, as well as the radar and IR signature were upgraded. The Mk. II has been produced since 1998.|$|R
50|$|The missile {{guidance}} {{is provided}} by a terminal active radar-seeker and an updated <b>mid-course</b> internal <b>guidance</b> system, which locates and tracks targets. On-board electronic counter-measures jam radar signals from enemy radar, making tracking of the missile difficult. The performance characteristics of the missile {{are similar to the}} R-77RVV-AE (AA-12) and Super 530D, both currently used by the IAF. It is 3.8 metres long and is narrower in front of the wings. The propellant used is HTPB (solid-fuel). The warhead is a 15 kg HE (high-explosive) which is activated by a proximity fuse. The missile's maximum speed is Mach 4.5+ and can attain maximum altitude of 20 km. The missile can handle 40 g turns near sea level while attacking a manoeuvring target. Astra has ECCM features and has improved effectiveness in multi-target scenarios. It can be launched in both autonomous and buddy mode operation and can achieve lock-on on its target before or after it is launched.|$|R
50|$|It has a track {{capacity}} of 400 air and surface targets {{and is able}} to achieve automatic target detection, confirmation and track initiation in a single scan, while simultaneously providing <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> updates to the MBDA Aster missiles launched from the ship.|$|E
50|$|China {{obtained}} the Russian Krasnopol laser-guided projectile {{technology in the}} 1990s, and successfully developed its own 155mm laser-guided ammunition. Designed to defeat armoured vehicles and weapon emplacements, the projectile has inertial <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and semi-active laser homing. The projectile has a range of 3 - 20 km, and can hit a target by the first shot without registration.|$|E
50|$|The L band seeker and radar {{altimeter}} originally {{designed for the}} 'Siren' were first used on the 'Starbright' whilst the Soviets sorted out the P-120's troublesome engines. However the 'Siren' has space for datalink equipment, allowing <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> from the launch platform or something else. When fired from a submarine, the missile can be launched at a maximum depth of 50 meters.|$|E
5000|$|AR-1 - Chinese {{development}} of the PHL03. This is actually the first model of the Chinese versions of the BM-30 SPMRL that is a truly a guided rocket system, in that the rockets themselves are guided by the simple primitive cascade inertial terminal guidance used on the WS series SPMRL, which became standard for later Chinese versions. Russia had already developed a guided version of the BM-30 with <b>mid-course</b> radio command <b>guidance</b> to immediately correct the error in the flight of the rocket once detected by the ballistic tracking radar, {{but this was not}} adopted due to financial constraints.|$|R
5000|$|The TK-1 is {{designed}} primarily to target low and medium altitude attacks. Each TK-1 battery has one Change Bai S-Band phased-array radar for search and target tracking and two CS/MPG-25 target illuminator radars that operates in the X-Band (18-32 GHz) range for the terminal phase, servicing {{three or four}} 4-round missile launchers. [...] The combination of inertial/autopilot and <b>mid-course</b> command <b>guidance</b> with a terminal semi-active radar seeker allows the TK-1 missile to fly an energy-efficient flight path to {{the vicinity of the}} target where the seeker's semi-active radar would then receive target illumination for the final seconds of the engagement, giving the target minimum amount of time either to evade or commence electronic countermeasure (ECM). [...] The CS/MPG-25 is a continuous wave disk antenna illuminator radar with a 200 km range that is solely developed by CSIST, and was derived from the I-HAWK AN/MPQ-46 High-Power Illuminator (HPI) radar but is estimated to be 60 percent more powerful in output with improved EW, ECM, and IFF capabilities. [...] It is tied into the main phased-array radar on a time-share basis similar to that employ by the US Navy's AEGIS air defence system, allowing the TK-1 surface-to-air missile system multiple target engagement capability.|$|R
50|$|On 17 August 2017, the LRASM {{conducted}} {{its first}} flight test in a production representative, tactical configuration. The missile was {{dropped from a}} B-1 Lancer, navigated through all planned waypoints, transitioned to <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and flew toward a moving maritime target using inputs from its onboard sensor, then descended to low altitude for final approach, positively identifying and impacting the target.|$|E
50|$|The {{upgraded}} AGM-130 <b>Mid-Course</b> <b>Guidance</b> (MCG) weapon, employs {{an improved}} global positioning and inertial navigation system. This allows the weapon {{to be used}} with less input from the launch aircraft, freeing the pilot and weapon systems officer for other tasks. The weapon became operational in 1998 when two F-15Es from the 335th and 336th Fighter Squadrons at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, fired one weapon each.|$|E
50|$|Weakness are {{the need}} for a {{helicopter}} for <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and a quite difficult uplink in the TESEO system (at least in the original model), big dimensions (affecting radar cross section RCS and IR signature), the lack of complex maneuvres (synchronization of attacks, re-engagement capabilities, ECCM capability not up to current standards and never publicized), and the availability of surface versions only: no submarine and aircraft versions were developed.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 39 torpedo was {{the first}} homing torpedo in United States Navy service to use a {{trailing}} wire for <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> through the submarine's fire control system. The Mark 39 was a Mark 27 Mod 4 torpedo converted for development of wire guidance techniques, which were eventually incorporated into the Mark 37 Mod 1 and the Mark 45. Due to this development, the Mark 39 was considered obsolete and the remaining inventory was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|SAM-1C {{upgraded}} missile use a {{phased array}} active radar seeker, with {{the capability of}} receiving <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> updates from the Fire Control Systems vehicle. The upgrade also increases the missiles maximum range to 14 kilometers while increasing the missile weight to 105 kilograms. A new smokeless motor with improved thrust is also fitted, replacing the existing motor. Also the Fire Control Systems vehicle is fitted with a thermal imager to improve operation in an ECM heavy environment.|$|E
50|$|On 15 November 2016, Russia {{announced}} it had deployed K-300P Bastion-P systems to Syria, where it fired Oniks missiles at land targets {{as part of}} the Russian military intervention in Syria, demonstrating a previously undisclosed land attack capability for the coastal defense system; the P-800 uses a combination of autopilot, INS, and a radio altimeter for <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and a monopulse dual-mode active/passive seeker for terminal guidance. Modified software in the Bastion's guidance system enables the missiles to dive onto stationary land targets, striking programmed coordinates.|$|E
50|$|Nimrod is {{transonic}} {{in operation}} and is powered {{all the way}} to the target. The gunner preselects the flight trajectory mode. This can be direct trajectory, high cruising trajectory or low cruising trajectory, the cruising altitude being constant and between 300 and 1,500 m. <b>Mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> is provided by an integral inertial platform, and terminal guidance by a semi-active laser homing seeker for the last 15 to 30 seconds of missile flight. The target can be illuminated either by a ground-based or airborne laser designator.|$|E
50|$|Launched on 26 March 1961, Groznyy was {{initially}} {{accepted into the}} Northern Fleet. After visits from General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Admiral Sergey Gorshkov on 4 May 1962, the ship undertook tests that culminated in the successful launch of two P-35 missiles in front of Khrushchev on 22 July.

50|$|The missile {{features}} an Inertial Navigation System, a data-link for <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and active radar homing for terminal guidance, beyond visual range. It also has ECCM capability and can engage multiple targets. According to Su Tzu-yun, Chief Executive Officer at the Center for Advanced Technology at Tamkang University, {{they are a}} cost-effective design which can perform {{a key role in}} Taiwan's defense strategy, and substantially offset China’s air superiority. Some details of its design were revealed {{for the first time at}} the Paris Air Show in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The warhead {{is reduced}} to 110 kg, but the {{adaption}} of HVTD-H high-explosive directional warhead enabled the missile to effectively neutralize targets size up to 1,500 tons. Several seekers has already been developed for the C-705, including radar, TV and IR. For <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance,</b> GPS or GLONASS are used, though the sample shown at the 2008 airshow is only compatible with GPS due to export purpose. Developer claimed that domestic Chinese satellite navigational can also be used. Currently Indonesia is planning on licensed/joint manufacturing the C-705 and installed them on Indonesian design and built KCR type fast attack craft.|$|E
50|$|As anti-ship weapons, {{there are}} Otomat, {{missiles}} with very long range (180 km or more), with <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> by AB-212s, sea skimmer capability and a 210 kg warhead. They {{began as a}} Franco-Italian program, but only Italy ordered them (and a dozen other navies as well) while the French navy ordered only the national Exocet, which has much shorter range. The main characteristic of OTOMAT, the long range, ironically, is achieved thanks to the Microturbo engine, the main French effort for this missile. The MILAS version, an ASW missile with a light torpedo, was developed for ranges to 40 km, but still not acquired by the French navy despite the need to replace the MALAFON missile. 8 missiles are placed mid-ship, between the two main superstructures.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/SPY-1 {{phased array}} radar, {{part of the}} Aegis Combat System {{deployed}} on modern U.S. cruisers and destroyers, [...] "is able to perform search, track and missile guidance functions simultaneously with a capability of over 100 targets." [...] Likewise, the Thales Herakles phased array multi-function radar used in service with France and Singapore has a track capacity of 200 targets {{and is able to}} achieve automatic target detection, confirmation and track initiation in a single scan, while simultaneously providing <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> updates to the MBDA Aster missiles launched from the ship. The German Navy and the Royal Dutch Navy have developed the Active Phased Array Radar System (APAR). The MIM-104 Patriot and other ground-based antiaircraft systems use phased array radar for similar benefits.|$|E
5000|$|The Arrow 1 was {{reportedly}} a two-stage solid propellant missile, {{with an overall}} length of 7.5 m, a body diameter of 1200 mm, and a launch weight of around 2000 kg. It was estimated that the second stage had a length of 2.5 m, {{and that it had}} inertial and command update <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance,</b> with a terminal infrared focal plane array. The missile was described as being relatively high-speed and maneuverable, with thrust vectoring in the both stages. The range capability has been described as around 50 km. On the other hand, the Arrow 1 could be a single stage missile. Development of the [...] "big and cumbersome" [...] Arrow 1 then ceased and further research continued with the [...] "smaller, faster and more lethal" [...] Arrow 2.|$|E
50|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile.

50|$|The ship's AN/SPY-1 radar {{finds the}} {{ballistic}} missile target and the Aegis weapon system calculates a solution on the target. When the missile is ordered to launch, the Aerojet MK 72 solid-fuel rocket booster launches the SM-3 {{out of the}} ship's Mark 41 vertical launching system (VLS). The missile then establishes communication with the launching ship. Once the booster burns out, it detaches, and the Aerojet MK 104 solid-fuel dual thrust rocket motor (DTRM) takes over propulsion through the atmosphere. The missile continues to receive <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> information from the launching ship and is aided by GPS data. The ATK MK 136 solid-fueled third-stage rocket motor (TSRM) fires after the second stage burns out, and it takes the missile above the atmosphere (if needed). The TSRM is pulse fired and provides propulsion for the SM-3 until 30 seconds to intercept.|$|E
50|$|The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile has {{its roots}} in a Technology Demonstration Programme (TDP), jointly funded by MBDA and the Ministry of Defence as part of the United Kingdom's Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS). Phase 1 of the TDP worked on {{technologies}} for soft vertical launch, the low-cost active radar seeker, a dual-band two-way datalink and a programmable open systems architecture. Phase 2 began in 2008 and covered the manufacture of flight-worthy subsystems, <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> firings and captive airborne seeker trials on a Qinetiq Andover experimental aircraft. The Soft Vertical Launch was proven over a series of trials, culminating in a successful truck launch in May 2011. The MoD decision on the business case for the naval variant was scheduled for 2010. After publishing the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010, the business case was approved in April 2011.|$|E
50|$|The ERATO (Extended Range Air Targeting for Otomat) system, {{used by the}} Al-Madinah class frigates, is the French {{version for}} <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> of the Otomat missile. In this case updated target {{information}} is provided to the ship which controls up to 16 missiles. This allows a multi-ship launch (Madinas have eight missiles each) and single ship control of an Otomat salvo for coordinated attack. The downside of this system is that the Otomat missile must rise to a 900-meter altitude to achieve uplink data. This could theoretically warn a target ship of the impending attack, but there are few possibilities to notice such small missiles at ranges {{of more than a}} few dozen kilometers. Maximum range for data-link is 100 km, limiting somewhat the missile's maximum range. It is possible to send up to six corrections for each missile, and attack up to six different targets at once. Consoles are called CLIO, integrated with ship's combat system.|$|E
50|$|Some 17 further ex-AMARC {{aircraft}} {{were also}} procured along with six ex-Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16BMs for training purposes (Combat Capable) along with 16 ex-Belgian F-16AM/BM in MLU (Mid Life Update, Block 20) standard in 2009, Another 2 ex-Spanish Mirage F1CE/EE aircraft were procured in 2006. In July/Aug 2011 RJAF received another 9 ex-Belgian F-16AM/BM MLU standard, thus boosting the RJAF's own multi-role capabilities.RJAF pilots {{have participated in}} 'Bright Star' in Egypt against regional F-16 Fighting Falcons and have improved their skills considerably, especially in defining critical areas of upgrading. The AIM-120 AMRAAM has been procured by the RJAF and will improve combat capabilities of the basic F-16. Unlike the AIM-7M Sparrow III the AMRAAM is lighter and more versatile with superior ECM/ECCM and capable of engaging high-g targets, along with an active radar homing warhead (unlike the semi-active homing warhead of the 'Sparrow III') with standard datalink for <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance</b> and correction purposes.|$|E
50|$|The RIM-66C/D Standard MR (SM-2MR Block I) was {{developed}} in the 1970s and was {{a key part of the}} Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade (NTU). The SM-2MR introduced inertial and command <b>mid-course</b> <b>guidance.</b> The missile's autopilot is programmed to fly the most efficient path to the target and can receive course corrections from the ground. Target illumination for semi-active homing is needed only for a few seconds in the terminal phase of the interception. This capability enables the Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade equipped vessels to time share illumination radars, greatly increasing the number of targets that can be engaged in quick succession. Mk 41 VLS adopts modular design concept, which result in different versions that vary in size and weight. There are three lengths: 209 in for the self-defense version, 266 in for the tactical version, and 303 in for the strike version. The empty weight for an 8-cell module is 26800 lb for the self-defense version, 29800 lb for the tactical version, and 32000 lb for the strike version.|$|E
