5|$|The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage (MMC) was a {{self-propelled}} artillery mount on a half-track chassis {{used by the}} United States Army during World War II.

5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets. Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised {{during the dry}} season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> boiled by women.|$|E

At 00:30 on 25 October, the 11th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion under Captain Jiro Katsumata found and {{attacked}} Company A of Puller's battalion. Katsumata's attack was impeded by heavy barbed wire {{in front of the}} Marine line and then hit heavily by American machine gun, <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> artillery fire. By 01:00, the Marine fire had killed most of Katsumata's company.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} morning, September 3, the North Koreans heavily {{attacked}} Check's men {{in an effort}} to regain the ridge. Artillery, <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> tank fire barrages, and an air strike directed from the battalion command post, met this attack. Part of the battalion had to turn and fight toward its rear. After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position. A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check's battalion had lost 1,000 men.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5-6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked {{vehicles}} in the withdrawal. The 1st Battalion completed its withdrawal without opposition. During its night march west, the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times by groups of North Korean soldiers who apparently thought {{it was one of}} their own columns moving south. They were made prisoners and taken along in the withdrawal. Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under North Korean <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> T-34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July, the {{military}} {{launched a new}} assault on Tikrit from Al-Awja.

However, ISIL militants sprung an ambush, with suicide bombers reportedly leaping from windows into groups of soldiers. Government troops retreated from the city before sunset four kilometers to the south under constant <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> sniper fire. Several security force vehicles were seen abandoned, with {{at least one of them}} burnt out. 52 soldiers and 40 militants were killed in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|On 5June 1944, {{the company}} made final {{preparations}} for the mission. Each man was issued their personal weapons and ammunition as well as up to nine hand grenades and four Bren gun magazines. Each platoon also had a 2-inch <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> a radio. Just before the men boarded the gliders, codewords were issued. 'Ham' indicated the canal bridge was captured and 'Jam' the river bridge. Capture and destruction of the canal bridge would be signalled using the codeword 'Jack'; 'Lard' would be used if a similar fate befell the river bridge.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, {{with the}} Belgians and Dutch under its command, {{had to contend}} with German delaying tactics. The lead battalions {{advanced}} under heavy <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> machine gun fire, until stopped by a strong defensive position at Cabourg. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, unable to outflank the position, were ordered to dig in. The next day, the battalion was relieved by the Belgians and moved to a brigade concentration point, first at Le Plein and then at Troan, which they reached by the morning of 21August. The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from here with the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in the lead. The battalion was unopposed until that afternoon, when they had several casualties from German <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> machine-gun fire. With night approaching the battalion had to dig in, and prepared to continue the advance the next day. At 03:00 on 22August, the battalion started an outflanking attack on Branville, which they occupied by 08:00, and later the same day they liberated Vauville and Deauville, where they secured the high ground {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|The MTB had {{withdrawn}} {{out of range}} at about 01:30, but not before it had suffered engine damage; a bullet had disabled the starboard engine.

The MTB was forced to withdraw once again under increasingly heavy <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> machine gun fire. Unable to locate any survivors, it recrossed the German minefield and arrived back in Portsmouth at 10:00.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E.

There the North Koreans {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{results on the}} effect of nano-CaCO 3 on compressive strength development of <b>mortars</b> <b>and</b> concretes containing high volume fly ash (HVFA). The effect of various nano-CaCO 3 contents such as 1, 2, 3 and 4 % (wt. %) as partial replacement of cement on the compressive strength of mortars are evaluated in the first part. The nano-CaCO 3 content which exhibited the highest compressive strength above is used in high volume fly ash <b>mortars</b> <b>and</b> concretes containing 40 % and 60 % class F fly ash. The results show that among four different nano-CaCO 3 contents, the addition of 1 % nano-CaCO 3 increased the compressive strength of <b>mortars</b> <b>and</b> concretes. The addition of 1 % nano-CaCO 3 also increases the early age and 28 days compressive strengths of HVFA <b>mortars</b> <b>and</b> concretes. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis results also support the above findings...|$|R
