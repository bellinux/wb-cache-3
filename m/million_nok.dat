50|$|DNV GL also {{conducted}} a socio-economical assessment, concluding {{that for the}} economy overall the games overall led to a negative net result of 15 890 <b>million</b> <b>NOK</b> in monetary terms. Of the positive non-monetary effects, enjoyable events and the predicted nationwide enthusiasm was considered the most significant. Non-monetary effects aside, the games would leave a legacy with a socio-economical worth of 2,45 billion NOK. This included mainly sporting venues (1 100 <b>million</b> <b>NOK),</b> infrastructure improvement (510 <b>million</b> <b>NOK)</b> and investment in security equipment (660 <b>million</b> <b>NOK).</b> Aside from the legacy, {{the difference between the}} public net cost of 21,7 billion NOK and the overall negative net result of 15,89 billion NOK consisted mainly of discounting the future cost to present value (3 930 <b>million</b> <b>NOK)</b> and positive effects for the tourism industry valued at 1 780 <b>million</b> <b>NOK.</b> The review considered the socio-economic costs of tax financing the event to 3 000 <b>million</b> <b>NOK.</b> The effects for the tourism industry were contested in the public debate, as research gives little support of a correlation between hosting the olympics and increased tourism. In the socio-economical assessment, the quality control review removed an alleged 4,9 billion NOK in positive effects of improved health in the population, finding no basis for the claim that hosting the olympics increases physical activity in the population.|$|E
