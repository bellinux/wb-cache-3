50|$|The 1931 Junior TT Race was run at a {{very fast}} pace by Jimmie Simpson riding for Norton who {{completed}} the first lap in 30 minutes and 49 seconds and was 6 second ahead of fellow Norton team-mate Stanley Woods in 2nd place and 18 seconds ahead of Freddie Hicks in 3rd place riding an AJS motor-cycle. Although, Jimmie Simpson was able {{to hold on to}} the lead for the next 5 lap, he was slowed by having to refuel every two laps because of carburetor problems. Fellow, Norton team-mate, Tim Hunt recovered from a slow first lap with a loose plug-lead to set the fastest lap on lap 4 of 30 minutes and 5 seconds an average race speed of 75.27 mi/h km/h and steadlly <b>moves-up</b> the leaderboard. Further, carburetor problems causes Jimmie Simpson to drops off the leaderboard and eventually finishes in 8th place. This allows the 1931 Junior TT Race to be won by Tim Hunt riding for Norton, in 3 hours 34 minutes and 21 seconds, at an average race speed of 73.94 mi/h km/h, from Norton team-mates Jimmie Guthrie, and Ernie Nott riding a Rudge motor-cycle.|$|R

Data collection included comparison literature reviews, male and female focus groups, a researchers-developed survey, and interviews conducted during the Detroit Auto Show. The study team created a new logo for the CTS, including the new tag-line: Revive the Drive. Given the boundaries of a| 30 M media budget the team designed a media and communications plan encompassing both traditional and non-traditional methods. Additional findings included: (1) the automotive press is biased against American manufacturers which translates into consumer bias; (2) wheels on the CTS are a prime example of past mistakes that apparently Cadillac is not willing to recognize; (3) {{it will be difficult to}} break the current brand persona as an older person's car without radically changing the surroundings in both sales outlets and promotional advertising; and (4) simply stated, likely buyers are not classifying the CTS with other similar models from alternative companies...|$|R

5000|$|In August 2010, Managing Director Gary Aragon {{enacted a}} laundry list of radical changes to the NBL's programming, {{membership}} format and relationship with tracks—in an effort to jumpstart participation and [...] "out-innovate" [...] the ABA. The centerpiece of this was the [...] "All You Can Race" [...] membership. Modeled after a traditional health club membership (where you pay a monthly fee, and enjoy unlimited access to any facility in the system), the All You Can Race membership removed traditional per-race entry fees, in favor of a three-tiered, all-inclusive annual membership fee. For $99, $245 or $395, a member could race an unlimited number of local, regional or national races, respectively. With no per-race entry fees being paid by participants, the NBL announced it would pay tracks a fixed rate of ~US$6 per entry (20" [...] and/or cruiser). Furthermore, tracks would no longer need to pay the NBL any fees at all—but would rely on the central office for nearly 100% of their revenue. Critics quickly hit the message boards with their assertions that the All You Can Race program was mathematically impossible to sustain, and would likely spell the end of the organization before the first season was out (afterall, it only required 16.5 local races to put the NBL in the red on a single membership). The 2010 changes also included a spaghetti bowl of changes to the NBL's class structure (effectively doubling the number of classes), points table, proficiency <b>move-up</b> methodology and professional/elite race series. Many members and track operators found it difficult or impossible to follow the new ruleset, which led to uncertainty and inconsistency in how programs were being run and administered.|$|E

Instead of the original crew, a <b>move-up</b> crew may take {{over the rest of}} the delayed crew’s duty, which is then on time. In this paper, we address both {{the problem of how to}} create robust crew schedules yielding many of such <b>move-up</b> crews, as well as the problem of making optimal crew swap decisions during operations. We show how the first problem is related to a set cover variant with profits for pairs of sets and to densest k subgraph. We develop algorithms and complexity results for subproblems and show how to profit from these in heuristics for the original problem. For the second problem we give efficient algorithms for the local case and show that optimizing crew swaps over the whole railway network is NP-hard...|$|E

Platooning of the major road traffic with random intra-bunch headways is included. The results focus on the distributions of queue lengths and delays and, in particular, on capacities.

40|$|This paper proposes {{an exact}} {{analytical}} model which evaluates {{the capacity of}} a crossing manoeuvre when the major stream has two lanes with traffic travelling in the same direction. The model allows for a general gap acceptance function and major-stream headway distribution in each lane and for a general <b>move-up</b> time distribution. The general form of the distributions ensures that the various traffic and driver behavior characteristics fed into the model are realistic and hence so are the results. A partial capacity is defined in relation to each major-stream lane by assuming that drivers may cross only {{after the passage of}} a car in the lane considered. The total capacity is evaluated as the sum of the two partial capacities. It is believed that the idea of partial capacities can be used for the realistic analytical evaluation of the crossing manoeuvre capacity in the case that the major stream has more than two lanes or has lanes with traffic travelling in opposite directions...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{shows that}} {{regional}} aid for trade has {{a critical role}} to play in boosting the participation of particularly low income and least developed countries in regional production networks, and in enabling them to connect and <b>move-up</b> value chains. The chapter highlights that one of the main motivations of the trend towards regional integration is the need to reduce barriers in regional production networks. Barriers to trade, bureaucratic bottlenecks, and infrastructure deficiencies reduce the attractiveness of countries as spokes in the hubs of the production networks. Regional aid-for-trade programmes – which have increased significantly since the 2002 - 05 baseline – are an effective means to address these constraints. The chapter highlights that while regional aid-for-trade programmes are inherently complex because of the need to involve and coordinate multiple governments, their various agencies and a multitude of private stakeholders, they constitute a cost-effective approach to helping countries achieve their trade and development objectives...|$|E

This procedure can handle all possible stream and lane configurations (e. g., number of lanes and ranks of streams, etc.) at unsignalized intersections. First, a overview of all common approaches for the simplest configuration with one major stream and one minor stream is given. From the basic idea of Heidemann and Wegmann (1997) some new explicit capacity formulae are derived considering the distributions of critical gaps, <b>move-up</b> times, and minimum time headways between two vehicles going in succession. Relationships between the common approaches can be derived. A new universal formula for the simplest configuration with one major stream and one minor stream is then introduced. The formula {{is based on the}} idea that the time scale of the major stream can be divided into four regimes according to the relative positions between the vehicles in the major stream: 1) that of free space (no vehicle), 2) that of single vehicle, 3) that of bunching, and 4) that of queuing.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a universal procedure for calculating the capacity at unsignalized (priority-controlled) intersections. This procedure can handle all possible stream and lane configurations (e. g., {{number of lanes}} and ranks of streams, etc.) at unsignalized intersections. For the simplest configuration with one major stream and one minor stream, a new universal capacity formula is introduced. The formula {{is based on the}} idea that the time scale of the major stream can be divided into four regimes according to the relative positions between the vehicles in the major stream: (1) that of free space (no vehicle), (2) that of single vehicle, (3) that of bunching, and (4) that of queuing. The probability of these regimes can be calculated according to the queuing theory. Therefore, the capacity of the minor stream that depends predominantly on the probability of the state that no vehicle blocks the major streams (state of free space) can also be calculated. Combining the basic idea of Heidemann and Wegmann (1997) some new explicit capacity formulae are derived considering the distributions of critical gaps, <b>move-up</b> times, and minimum time headways between two vehicles going in succession. Starting from this capacity formula for the simplest configuration with one major stream and one minor stream, a universal calculation procedure for configurations with arbitrarily many streams of arbitrary ranks is derived. This procedure is constructed according to the parallel or serial configurations of the streams. The present procedure is derived mathematically using the queuing theory. It is a generation of all of the known procedures for calculation capacities at unsignalized intersection. The model is calibrated and verified by measurements at roundabouts and by intensive simulations. Based on the theoretical background, the model can easily be extended to other priority systems with arbitrary priority ranks. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeavy {{vehicles}} behave {{differently from}} ordinary passenger cars {{due to their}} characteristics such as size and operational performance. At roundabout, entry capacity estimation mainly focuses on passenger cars. In HCM 2010, the impact of heavy vehicles on entry capacity is considered through a heavy vehicle adjustment factor fHV which includes heavy vehicle percentage and passenger car equivalent (PCE hereafter) value. It is generally set as 2. 0, which means a heavy vehicle {{is assumed to be}} equivalent to two passenger cars. In existing methods, the PCE value at roundabouts is estimated based on several considerations such as entry capacity and <b>move-up</b> time. All of these considerations are influenced by local driver behavior and geometry conditions. Thus, this paper aims to estimate entry capacity considering the characteristics of heavy vehicle behavior in Japan. In this paper, characteristics of heavy vehicle behavior such as speed and gap parameters are firstly analyzed by using data observed at several roundabouts in Japan. Then, a simulation study which is calibrated based on the observation data is conducted by applying VISSIM 5. 40. Roundabout entry capacity is estimated through assuming different heavy vehicle percentage values of each entry. Based on the estimated results of entry capacity, PCE value is calculated. The PCE values from the simulation study are compared with those values adopted by several design guidelines. Through the empirical analysis, it is found that heavy vehicles move in lower speed than passenger cars in the process of travelling roundabouts. The headways which are formed by heavy vehicles are commonly greater than those only formed by passenger cars. Then, PCE values which are calculated from simulation output are shown to change with different combinations of heavy vehicle percentage of each entry. The results in this paper provide a reference for roundabout entry capacity estimation considering heavy vehicle behavior in Japan. Future works are some further analysis from the viewpoint of geometry, since heavy vehicle behavior is significantly influenced by roundabout geometry such as inscribed circle diameter and circulatory roadway width, particularly at compact roundabout which is often the case in Japan...|$|E
