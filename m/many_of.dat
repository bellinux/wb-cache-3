5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained {{without the possibility of}} air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
