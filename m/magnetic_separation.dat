The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%.

50|$|Microfluidic sample {{separation}} can {{be achieved}} by capillary electrophoresis or continuous-flow separation. In capillary electrophoresis, a long thin tube separates analytes by voltage as they migrate by electro-osmotic flow. For continuous-flow separation, the general idea is to apply a field at an angle to the flow direction to deflect the sample flow path toward different channels. Examples of continuous-flow separation techniques include continuous-flow electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, continuous-flow <b>magnetic</b> <b>separations,</b> and molecular sieving.|$|R

25|$|The {{iron ore}} at Bjørnevatn was {{originally}} discovered by {{assistant director of}} the Norwegian Geological Survey, Tellef Dahll, in 1868. It was at the time not commercially viable to mine. With the development of <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation,</b> merchant Christian Anker from Halden started acquiring deeds for the area. In 1903 he contacted the government and started negotiating an agreement to start operations. After several rounds of proposals he received permission and the contract was signed on 9 March 1905. Anker's principal assistant, Engineer Henrik Lund, arrived at Kirkenes in 1903 and started designing the plant. He was assisted by Hans Johan Bernhard Hansen from 1905. They decided that the port should be located at Kirkenes and that a railway would have to be built between the mine and the port.|$|E

In this report, a facile one-step coating approach to MSPs suitable for <b>magnetic</b> <b>separations</b> was investigated. Methods: Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was derived into PEG-bis-(maleic monoester) and maleic monoester-PEG-succinic monoester as the monomers. Magnetofluids were prepared via chemical co-precipitation and dispersion with the monomers. MSPs were prepared via one-step coating of magnetofluids in a water-in-oil microemulsion system of aerosol-OT and heptane by radical co-polymerization of such monomers. Results: The resulting MSPs contained abundant carboxyl groups, exhibited negligible nonspecific adsorption of common substances and excellent suspension stability, appeared as irregular particles by electronic microscopy, and had submicron sizes of broad distribution by laser scattering. Saturation magnetizations and average particle sizes were affected mainly by the quantities of monomers used for coating magnetofluids, and steric hindrance around carboxyl groups was alleviated {{by the use}} of longer monomers of one polymerizable bond for coating. After optimizations, MSPs bearing saturation magnetizations over 46 emu/g, average sizes of 0. 32 &micro;m, and titrated carboxyl groups of about 0. 21 mmol/g were obtained. After the activation of carboxyl groups on MSPs into N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, biotin was immobilized on MSPs and the resulting biotin-functionalized MSPs isolated the conjugate of streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase at about 2. 1 mg/g MSPs; streptavidin was immobilized at about 10 mg/g MSPs and retained 81 % &plusmn; 18 % (n = 5) of the specific activity of the free form.

2500|$|Although {{individual}} grains or pebbles of alluvial tin {{collected by}} streaming were often of high purity {{it was usually}} still necessary to remove the unwanted [...] "gangue" [...] material before the ore could be smelted. The need for this process, which was known as dressing the ore, increased as the poorer sources of lode tin were exploited. The principle of concentration was a refined version of that used by the early tin-streamers: it depended on the large difference in specific gravity between the wanted tin ore and the gangue. Many different mechanical methods were used, including rectangular and circular buddles, Wilfley tables and revolving slime tables, kieves, trommels, and even <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
