25|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} {{became popular}} {{very early in}} the islands of the Pacific Ocean, spreading from Polynesia to Japan and the Philippines. One reason is that they were a reliable crop in cases of crop failure of other staple foods because of typhoon flooding. They are featured in many favorite dishes in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other island nations. Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and some other Asian countries are also large sweet potato growers. Sweet potato, also known as kelang in Tulu, is part of Udupi cuisine in South India. Uganda (the second largest grower after China), Rwanda, and some other African countries also grow a large crop which {{is an important part of}} their peoples' diets. The New World, the original home of the sweet potato, grows less than three percent (3%) of the world's supply. Europe has only a very small sweet potato production, mainly in Portugal. In the Caribbean, a cultivar of the sweet potato called the boniato is popular. The flesh of the boniato is cream-colored, unlike the more popular orange hue seen in other cultivars. Boniatos are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> their fluffier consistency and more delicate flavor.|$|E
500|$|The desired or correct {{sentence}} spacing {{is often}} debated but many sources now say additional space {{is not necessary}} or desirable. [...] From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers, {{and the majority of}} style guides that use a Latin-derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence. [...] However, some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable. [...] The debate continues. [...] <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type. [...] There is a debate on which convention is more readable; the few recent direct studies conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results.|$|E

2500|$|When {{producing}} alphabetized {{lists of}} Portuguese names, generally {{the full name}} is used. This occurs mainly in schools or official documents, and it is usually done because <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> to use multiple surname combinations in their daily life, or do not use the last surname at all.

[...] A common way to fish a soft plastic worm is the Texas Rig.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike in {{many parts}} of the world, there is a {{significant}} market in Europe (the UK in particular) for beer containing live yeast. These unfiltered, unpasteurised brews are more challenging to handle than the commonly sold [...] "dead" [...] beers; [...] "live" [...] beer quality can suffer with poor care, but <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> its taste. While beer is usually matured for relatively short times (a few weeks to a few months) compared to wine, some of the stronger so-called real ales have been found to develop character and flavour over the course of as much as several decades.|$|E

2500|$|Within the naturist and nudist movements, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> {{to adopt}} only one label or the other. Others do not bother or like {{adopting}} labels. In the traditional view, the nudist in the U.S. {{is a person}} who seeks out organized social settings for the practice of the nudist philosophy. This often takes the form of membership in a landed or non-landed nudist club, with a well-defined system of conduct and social structure. It is believed to be a predictable environment, which offers the participants the safety that comes with facilities for secluded, lawful nudity (without the threat of legal action or observation by outsiders seeking to view them for prurient purposes). However, others avoid [...] "organized" [...] naturism and nudism, and are content with clothing-optional public beaches, home naturism, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Wood can be stained {{to change}} its colour or left unstained before {{application}} of lacquer, or other types of top-coats. Staining should enhance the appearance of wood by reducing colour variation between and within sapwood and heartwood. It also provides a way of giving bland looking woods such as poplar, the appearance of prized furniture woods such as ebony, mahogany or walnut. [...] Wood can be stained using dyes or pigmented finishes. These finishes are available {{in a wide variety}} of colours, many of which are not part of the natural colour palette of wood, for example, blues and greens. Pigmented stains tend to highlight the grain (and also sanding scratches), whereas dyes do not have this effect and are more transparent. Wood can also be coloured by exposing it to chemicals that react with the wood to form coloured compounds. Chemical staining of wood is rarely carried out because it is easier to colour wood using dye or pigmented stain, however, ammonia fuming is a chemical staining method that is still occasionally used to darken woods such as oak that contain a lot of tannins. Staining of wood is difficult to control because some parts of the wood absorb more stain than others, which leads to problems such as blotchiness and streaking. For this reason, as pointed out by Flexner, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>prefer</b> to omit the staining step when finishing wood.|$|E

Because {{it was such a}} well-developed road, many famous persons, including the haiku master Matsuo Bashō, traveled the road. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>preferred</b> traveling along the Nakasendō because it did not require travelers to ford any rivers.|$|R

50|$|The Thames Gateway {{is an area}} of land {{stretching}} 70 km {{east from}} inner east London {{on both sides of the}} River Thames and the Thames Estuary. The area, which includes much brownfield land was designated during the early years of the Blair ministry a national priority for urban regeneration, taking advantage of the development opportunities realised by the completion of the High Speed 1 (officially known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link).

As time went on, Newport and Carisbrooke have largely engulfed and absorbed all of these villages except for Gunville, although even for Gunville there have had to be concerted efforts to keep the name alive, with <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>preferring</b> to refer to it as a part of Carisbrooke.
