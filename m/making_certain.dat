5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} saw graphical {{and musical}} revisions {{and is based}} on the international versions of both games, <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> content accessible to players outside of Japan for the first time. The collection sold favorably in Japan and the west, and has received positive reviews in western territories. Many praised the graphical upgrade and the chance to play through the games on the new platforms. The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults and uneven quality between the two, while some of the collection's added content drew mixed opinions. The minor upgrade faults and uneven quality were fixed in the PlayStation 4 version.|$|E
5|$|Two {{enduring}} royal traditions {{emerged in}} Imerina {{as a consequence}} of the power struggle between Andriamasinavalona and his older brother. Some versions of oral history describe a combat between their armies at Ambohibato in which Andriamasinavalona emerged victorious. He erected a commemorative stone at the battle site that he named Ankazonorona, designating it the site where newly enthroned kings would stand to receive their first expression of hasina (homage, affirmation of authority) from their subjects. Andriamasinavalona also introduced the practice of gathering his subjects to consult them and obtain their consent before <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> decisions. This practice was continued by subsequent rulers in Imerina.|$|E

5|$|When {{writing the}} album's lyrics, Yamaguchi tried to express both the {{feelings}} that he had, and those that he saw were common in society in the early 2010s. He focused on questioning what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E
5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjective}} Orwellian connotes {{an attitude}} and {{a policy of}} control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth, and manipulation of the past. In Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from Nineteen Eighty-Four have entered popular language. Newspeak is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. Doublethink means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The Thought Police are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. Prolefeed is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music, used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. Big Brother is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.|$|E

The new section also allows the Lord Chancellor to prohibit the County Courts from <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> other types of order, with these types to be introduced by Statutory Instrument.

Nominally Henry was subordinate to the lord-deputy, Charles Fleetwood, but Fleetwood's departure for England in September 1655 left him for all practical purposes the ruler of Ireland. He moderated the lord-deputy's policy of deporting the Irish, and unlike him he paid some attention to the interests of the English settlers. Moreover, again unlike Fleetwood, he appears to have held the scales evenly between the different Protestant sects, and his undoubted popularity in Ireland is attested by Clarendon.|$|E
25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a psychotic episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, <b>making</b> <b>certain</b> she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards.
