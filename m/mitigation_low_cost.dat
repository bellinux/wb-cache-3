40|$|Accident {{rate and}} {{severity}} reduction at roadwork sites requires an integrated and systematic approach aimed at identifying and solving the safety problems. An effective approach, which is quickly spreading at international level, is the workzone safety audit. Road safety audit is a formal examination {{of a future}} road or traffic project, an existing road, or any project which interacts with road users, where an independent, qualified team reports on the project’s potential accident and safety performance, by trying to investigate how the road environment is perceived, and ultimately utilised by different road users. The paper presents a road safety audit procedure specifically suited for workzones. It is based on detailed checklists and on risk assessment. New risk indicators, that involve the prediction of the number and severity of potential accidents associated with each safety item, have been defined: the Total Weighted Score of the main safety aspects, which relates to the risk factors {{that may be improved}} by engineering measures, and the Global Safety Index, which allows the evaluation of the global safety of the workzone and the ranking of workzones in the road network. The proposed safety evaluation procedure is strongly related to the safety consequences of the identified problems, rather than on the standard non-compliance or on the number of deficiencies. Pilot safety audits, which have been carried out both in urban and rural areas, have identified many safety issues, whose removal or <b>mitigation</b> requires <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> safety measures...|$|R
40|$|As a {{renewable}} energy source, wind power is gaining popularity as a favoured alternative to fossil fuel, nuclear and hydro power generation. In Europe, countries {{are required to}} achieve 15 % of their energy consumption from wind by 2010 as the EU strives to meet its Kyoto obligations. Wind power {{is considered to be}} environmentally friendly and <b>low</b> <b>cost.</b> While environmental friendliness has come under scrutiny because wind turbines continue to pose a hazard to birds, are visually unappealing, affect the uses of land and change air flows, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine the question of its presumed <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> and effectiveness at reducing CO 2 emissions by replacing power generated from fossil fuels. To do so, we develop a mathematical programming model of an electrical energy grid that employs power generated by a base-load nuclear power plant, a coal-fired power plant and a gas facility, with the latter used primarily to meet peak-load demand. We then introduce varying levels of wind power generating capacity into the grid. The results indicate that, at low levels of penetration, wind power can provide CO 2 <b>mitigation</b> benefits at <b>low</b> <b>cost.</b> However, as the degree of penetrability increases, the costs of reducing CO 2 emissions rise rapidly because of the spinning reserves required in the coal- and gas-fired power plants. Fossil fuels are consumed even though no power is generated in the eventuality that wind power is suddenly unavailable. The whimsical nature of wind energy makes it a less than desirable long-term source of energy...|$|R

The model includes assumptions on policy constraints, as well as technology and resource costs and availability. Multiple scenarios are developed to analyze the changes and investments in low-carbon electricity generation, alternative fuels and advanced vehicles in transportation, resource utilization, and efficiency improvements across many sectors. Results show that major energy transformations are needed but that achieving the 80 % reduction goal for California is possible at reasonable average carbon reduction cost ($ 9 to $ 124 /tonne CO 2 e at 4 % discount rate) relative to a baseline scenario.

To meet the challenge of these <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> airlines, several ‘legacy’ or full service carriers (FSCs) around the world have created their own <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> subsidiary. The most notable example in the UK was Go, initially a <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> subsidiary of British Airways (BA) that was subsequently sold to its senior management team and then bought by easyJet, the UK's leading <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> airline. For <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> subsidiaries to survive and prosper, ‘matching’ models of human resource management (HRM) predict that they need to create a <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> employment system, which will be very {{different from that of the}} parent company. However, cost is only one variable in the competitive equation. In a ‘customer facing’ industry such as civil aviation a minimum level of service quality is also required and there is clearly scope for ‘low frills’ (e. g.

Moreover, there is always the danger that (well organized) employee groups will take umbrage at walking the ‘low road’ of employee relations, especially when their colleagues in the parent airline are walking the ‘high road’. Although competing head on with well-established <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet, Go was able to forge a distinctive management style that combined <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> operations with high road employment relations.

This paper carries out a qualitative assessment on the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> short haul business model and a quantitative analysis on whether or not it can be successfully transferred to the long haul market. Taking Ryanair {{as an example of a}} very successful <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> short haul carrier, this dissertation develops a feasibility study, including a profitability analysis, on the applicability of Ryanair’s <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> short haul model to a long haul route. The results of this research show that some but not all of the main elements of the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier model can be successfully transferred to long haul airline operations. The results highlight that the move for a <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier, in this instance Ryanair, to long haul operations appears to require substantial cost reduction, a large injection of capital and considerable cultural change. Another important finding of the study is that if Ryanair were to move to long haul operations it would no longer be able to adhere as rigidly to the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier model. Instead the evidence suggests that it would probably be transformed into a type of hybrid model between a full service and <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier, such as a network specialist, product specialist or pricing specialist.
