5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under <b>Mirabella,</b> {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. <b>Mirabella</b> had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|Under her editorship, the {{magazine}} renewed {{its focus on}} fashion {{and returned to the}} prominence it had held under Vreeland. Vogue held its position as market leader against three contenders: Elle; Harper's Bazaar, which had lured away Liz Tilberis, Wintour's most prominent deputy, and <b>Mirabella,</b> a magazine Rupert Murdoch created for Wintour's fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: Tina Brown, editor of Vanity Fair and later The New Yorker.|$|E
5|$|Anger at Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later. The motion was moved by Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on the spill motion was considered a blow to Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie <b>Mirabella</b> and Tony Smith.|$|E

5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran <b>Mirabella</b> III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E

She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine's first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities. Her changes to the magazine were often made without <b>Mirabella's</b> knowledge, causing friction among the staff. She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London. They married in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Her autobiography, In and Out of Vogue, gave {{insight into}} her {{relationships}} with the various people that she worked with such as Diana Vreeland, Andy Warhol, and Si Newhouse. Fashion photographer Helmut Newton published several notable editorials in the magazine from 1971 {{to the end of}} <b>Mirabella's</b> leadership. Further, Richard Avedon photographed most of the covers and other photographers, such as Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort, Albert Watson, Denis Piel and Chris von Wangenheim published several examples of their early work in her editions.|$|R

40|$|LIKE {{many people}} around Australia, a group of Indi locals watched {{the past three years}} of {{politics}} – one of the ugliest and most negative in the country’s history – in despair. Feeling alienated from what they saw in Canberra, and from their own MP’s part in it, they began meeting quietly at the Wangaratta Library. So constrained was political discourse in the area – and so strong was Sophie <b>Mirabella’s</b> grip on the seat – that these meetings began with a distinctly clandestine edge, for fear of retribution in participants’ professional or personal lives. This motley group of various political colours became Voice for Indi, and their goal was to begin a conversation that had not been taking place in Indi {{for a very long time}} – a conversation about needs, values and political leadership… Read the full article Photo: Cambell Klos...|$|R

500|$|The game's visuals were {{a source}} of {{disagreement}} between some critics. Extended Play's Matthew Keil wrote that the game's visuals are the [...] "most notable improvement" [...] over Rogue Squadron. <b>Mirabella</b> agreed {{and went on to}} call Battle for Naboo [...] "one of the prettiest games to grace the N64." [...] Both Keil and <b>Mirabella</b> praised the game for being less dependent on distance fog and [...] "vastly" [...] improving the draw distance over Rogue Squadron. Davis, however, wrote that [...] "the graphics in Battle for Naboo are exactly the same as those of Rogue Squadron, flaws and all", and Nintendo Powers Andy Meyers cited [...] "drab backgrounds and dry cinemas". EGM enjoyed the game's models and lighting, but thought the environments looked [...] "blurry". Reviewers' opinions on the game's music and sound effects were generally less divided. Keil stated that the game showcases Factor 5's audio talents, and <b>Mirabella</b> and Davis described the audio as [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "immersive", respectively. [...] One EGM reviewer lamented [...] "the low-quality cartridge EpisodeI music", but another thought the sound was impressive.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, {{she became}} fashion editor of New York. There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots {{she had been}} putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving Rachel Ward how effectively celebrity covers sold copies. [...] "Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did," [...] Grace Coddington said three decades later. A former colleague arranged {{for an interview with}} Vogue editor Grace <b>Mirabella</b> that ended when Wintour told <b>Mirabella</b> she wanted her job.|$|E
500|$|Battle for Naboos {{controls}} {{were described as}} tight and responsive. Reviewers praised the addition of ground vehicles, which were completely absent from Rogue Squadron. Both Davis and <b>Mirabella</b> remarked that this addition keeps the game from getting stale or redundant. Nintendo Power thought that the game is at its best when the action isn't grounded, however, describing some of the ground missions as [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "uninspired". Some reviewers believed that the game's EpisodeI setting is less engaging than Rogue Squadrons original trilogy setting. <b>Mirabella</b> stated that [...] "any fan of Rogue Squadron should enjoy Battle for Naboo just as much {{if they can get}} past the EpisodeI barrier", and Davis wrote that the game's setting [...] "does not carry the same impact as the story of the original [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Streisand herself took a {{negative}} {{view of her}} portrayal, stating in a <b>Mirabella</b> interview, [...] Parker and Stone created the second season episode [...] "Spookyfish" [...] in response, where they {{took a picture of}} Streisand's head, placed the image into all four corners of the screen and called it [...] "Spooky vision".|$|E
500|$|Melees visuals {{garnered}} {{a positive}} reaction. GameSpot lauded the game's character and background models, stating that [...] "the character models are pleasantly full-bodied, {{and the quality}} of their textures is amazing". IGN's Fran <b>Mirabella</b> III praised the game's use of physics, animation and graphics, although his colleague Matt Casamassina thought that [...] "some of the backgrounds lack the visual polish endowed upon the characters" [...] when giving a second opinion about the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{expanded}} and refined Crash mode was embraced by critics {{who found the}} gameplay to be addictive. Reiner highlighted Crash mode as his favourite part of the game, and Eurogamer writer Kristan Reed stated {{that it was the}} mode he spent the most time playing. Edge welcomed the inclusion of ramps and aftertouch, stating that the design of the mode had become [...] "more complex and focused". They thought Crash mode had evolved into a substantial component that was capable of being released as a standalone product. <b>Mirabella</b> and Reed both complimented the balance and variation of events in World Tour, and GamesTM was pleased with the amount of content featured in the single-player component. Gerstmann agreed that Burnout 3 offered a large amount of content and excellent replay value. He also felt that the progression of difficulty in World Tour was done effectively by introducing a faster cars throughout the campaign at reasonable pace. Reviewers were in agreement that Burnout 3s engaging and frenetic gameplay remained intact during online play. Reed stated that {{he would have liked to}} see the single-player content become more integrated into the online component, citing other existing racing games as examples. He thought that progress across single-player events should be recorded in online leaderboards enabling score comparisons with friends. <b>Mirabella</b> believed Criterion had largely triumphed in creating a great online component.|$|E
500|$|Miyamoto {{introduced}} a playable demo {{at the next}} year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) on May 22–24, 2002. It debuted alongside another upcoming GameCube Zelda, eventually titled [...] Miyamoto's presentation experienced serious glitches while he attempted to demonstrate Link's new ability to use enemies' dropped weapons. Despite this setback, reception was more positive than the Space World demo. The game picked up the 2002 Game Critics Awards for Best Console Game at E3. IGN editor Fran <b>Mirabella</b> said the cartoon look [...] "works very nicely" [...] and that [...] "it feels very much like Zelda". The whimsical style was compared to [...] and promotional artwork from previous Zelda games. The E3 demo also introduced new features, {{such as the ability}} to connect to the Game Boy Advance and receive help from Tingle. However, divided response over the cel-shaded design followed the game through its release.|$|E
500|$|Super Smash Bros. Melee {{generally}} {{received a}} positive reception from reviewers, {{most of whom}} credited Melee expansion of gameplay features from Super Smash Bros. Focusing on the additional features, GameSpy commented that [...] "Melee really scores big in the 'we've added tons of great extra stuff' department." [...] Reviewers compared the game favorably to Super Smash Bros.—IGN's Fran <b>Mirabella</b> III stated that it was [...] "in an entirely different league than the N64 version"; GameSpot's Miguel Lopez praised the game for offering an advanced [...] "classic-mode" [...] compared to its predecessor, while detailing the Adventure Mode as [...] "really a hit-or-miss experience." [...] Despite a mixed response to the single-player modes, most reviewers expressed the game's multiplayer mode as a strong component of the game. In their review of the game, GameSpy stated that [...] "you'll have a pretty hard time finding a more enjoyable multiplayer experience on any other console." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} also {{received}} criticism, {{mainly because of}} its length. GameSpot said that Luigi's Mansion [...] "fails to match the classic status of Mario's adventures" [...] and that the [...] "short {{amount of time it}} takes to complete it makes it a hard recommendation." [...] The review, however, also considered that the short length prevents the gameplay and audio from getting tiresome. GameSpy also criticized the game's length, saying that it could be beaten in about six hours. Allgame declared that Luigi's Mansion [...] "ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive gameplay experience over the long-term." [...] Fran <b>Mirabella</b> III of IGN felt that the game was sub-par, due to its [...] "predictable, formulaic gameplay." [...] G4's TV show X-Play criticized Luigi's Mansion in their special on Mario games and media, calling the game a letdown for players waiting for the first Mario game on the GameCube. Luigi's Mansion was awarded the 2002 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for audio. The game placed 99th in Official Nintendo Magazine's 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time.|$|E
500|$|Tyre {{problems}} and engine reliability hampered the LC2s all season; the Pirelli tyres were eventually replaced with British Dunlop crossply tyres, although the car's suspension had been optimised for the Italian product. Neither car managed {{to finish a}} race again until the fifth round, the 1000km of Spa. [...] There the two Martini Racing LC2s {{as well as the}} privateer <b>Mirabella</b> LC2 all finished, but only after suffering various difficulties that dropped them from contention earlier in the race. [...] The LC2s finally ran reliably at the European Endurance Championship round at Brands Hatch, where Michele Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese finished fourth. [...] Lancia chose not to participate in the World Sportscar event in Japan, instead running the European Endurance event at Imola. [...] The choice paid off as Teo Fabi and Hans Heyer earned the LC2 its first victory, although the factory Porsche team had not participated in this event. [...] Lancia finished off the season with back-to-back second-place finishes at Mugello and Kyalami. [...] Even with their difficulties Lancia took second place in the World Constructors Championship, although they earned only 32 points to Porsche's 100.|$|E
