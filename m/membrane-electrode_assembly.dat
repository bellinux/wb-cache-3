To improve performance and allow for higher operating temperatures, water can be replaced as the proton carrier by less volatile imidazole or triazole molecules within the pores. The maximum temperature achieved was 150°C with an optimum conductivity of 5 x 10−4 S/cm, which is lower than other current electrolyte membranes. However, this model holds promise for its temperature regime, anhydrous conditions, and ability to control the quantity of guest molecules within the pores, all of which allowed for the tunability of proton conductivity. Additionally, the triazole-loaded PCMOF2 was incorporated into a H2/air <b>membrane-electrode</b> <b>assembly</b> and achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100°C that was stable for 72 hours and managed to remain gas tight throughout testing.
