For answering the question, soil degraded by long-term application of mineral fertilizers was chosen and laboratory experiment was designed. The soil comes from the locality Březová nad Svitavou. The following parameters were monitored in the experiment: dry basis of the plant, leakage of ammonium and nitrate ions, physical parameters of soil, mycorrhiza, root exudate and their influence on microbial respiration.

40|$|Israel and the Gaza Strip {{shares the}} {{southern}} Mediterranean coastal aquifer with Israel. Long-term overexploitation in the Gaza Strip {{has resulted in}} a decreasing water table, accompanied by the degradation of its water quality. Due to high levels of salinity, most of the ground water is not suitable for both domestic and agricultural consumptions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the chemical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>qualities</b> of the drinking water in Gaza Strip. The rapid rate of population growth in the Gaza Strip and dependence upon ground water as a single water source presents a serious challenge to future development. Data were collected from the Palestinian Ministry of Health on the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride (Cl-) and nitrate (NO 3 -) in drinking water wells, and contamination of total and faecal coliforms in water wells and distribution networks. From the collected data on chemical water analysis, we obtained that the average concentration of TDS (1687 mg/l), Cl- (577 mg/l) and NO 3 - (131 mg/l) were higher than that of the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, i. e., 1000, 250 and 50 mg/l, respectively. Upon microbiological water analyses, total and faecal coliform contamination percentages were found to exceed that of the WHO standard, i. e., < 5 % for total coliform and free (0 %) for faecal coliform for all water wells and networks distribution system, and the level of contamination in water networks were higher than that in wells. The chemical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>qualities</b> of drinking water thus deteriorated in Gaza Strip, and water demand is increasing rapidly due to rapid population growth and absence of alternative water resources. This may result in adverse human health impacts. Key words: Chloride; contamination; coliform; Gaza Strip; nitrate; water wells; water quality...|$|R

50|$|Apart from spoiling foods, as {{a direct}} {{consequent}} of growth, Z. bailii can modify the product texture and composition such {{that it may be}} more readily colonized by other spoilage microorganisms. For example, by utilizing acetic acid, the yeast can raise the pH of pickles sufficiently to allow the growth of less acid-tolerant bacteria. Besides, as with other yeasts, the concentration of fermentable sugar in a product affects the rate of spoilage by Z. bailii, e.g. the yeast grows faster in the presence of 10% (w/w) than 1% (w/w) glucose. Particularly, Z. bailii can grow and cause spoilage from extremely low inocula, as few as one viable cell in ≥ 10 liters of beverages. That means detection of low numbers of yeast cells in a product does not guarantee its stability. No sanitation or <b>microbiological</b> <b>quality</b> control program can cope with this degree of risk. Hence, the only alternatives would be reformulation of food to increase the stability and/or application of high-lethality thermal-processing parameters.|$|E

Pollution of freshwater sources constitutes a major problem hindering access to safe water for drinking and other domestic uses. Wastewater effluent discharges often impact the <b>microbiological</b> <b>qualities</b> of surface waters with its attendant health and environmental problems. This study evaluated the <b>microbiological</b> <b>qualities</b> of the discharged effluents of four selected wastewater treatment plants in Amathole and Chris Hani District Municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province over a twelve-month sampling period. Microbiological analysis (faecal coliform, Escherichia coli and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7) was done using standard methods and polymerase chain reaction method was used to confirm identities ofbacterial isolates. Presumptive bacteria counts ranged as follows: faecal coliforms 0 to 1. 6 × 103 CFU/ 100 ml, E. coli 0 to 1. 4 × 103 CFU/ 100 ml and E. coli O 157 :H 7 0 to 9. 6 × 102 CFU/ 100 ml. Forty eight percent (305 / 626) of the presumptive E. coli isolates were confirmed using species-specific uidA gene which code for β-glucuronidase enzyme in E. coli. Antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolate using a panel of 10 antibiotics shows 100 % (150 / 150) resistance to antibiotics rifampicin and penicillin G while 49. 3 % (74 / 150) of the isolates and 46. 7 % (70 / 150) were susceptible to streptomycin and cefotaxime respectively. Multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes (MARP) of the isolates showed resistance to two or more test antibiotics while the calculated multiple antibiotic resistance index (MARI) for the tested isolated is 0. 49. The detection of potentially pathogenic E. coli in the final effluents suggestspotential danger to the receiving water bodies where the effluents are discharge. The high MARI valued obtained in this study indicates that the isolates are form environment where the tested antibiotics are being used and may further lead to the spread of multiple antibiotics resistance among other pathogens that may be present in the same environment...|$|R
