50|$|Hamiltons {{experience}} in state <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{came to the}} fore in the 1930s. The public <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals</b> in the various states had become overcrowded, understaffed, and received inadequate funding. Public interest had been aroused by publications of hospitals conditions. In 1935, the American Medical Association (AMA) began an investigation at the instigation of its Mental Health committee. The AMA surveys were discontinued and only a statistical report of the findings was published, with no known further action. Later, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) took up the effort and joined the national and state mental health associations in the effort to improve conditions in the <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals.</b> In 1928, the State Society for Mental Health of Connecticut obtained funds to conduct a survey of <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals,</b> under the direction of Hamilton. The survey was published in 1936 with numerous recommendations. The survey reports met wide acceptance as numerous states began obtaining funds for similar surveys, which often resulted in increased funding by state legislatures to improve conditions in the state <b>mental</b> <b>hospitals.</b>|$|R
