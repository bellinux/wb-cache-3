50|$|Laquin, in Franklin Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, {{was founded}} about 1902 as a lumber town, (although the ghost town of Barclay is nearby {{and it is}} an old coal mining town).

40|$|By way of an {{experiment}} rigorous measures were taken to prevent rat-run traffic in residential areas and to improve the safety {{and quality of life}} in two dutch cities, eindhoven and Rijswijk. The road network was divided into main traffic <b>roads,</b> <b>major</b> <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> and streets for living. Thereafter each road was reconstructed according to its typical function. The main traffic roads are intended to provide a good flow in high speed traffic with a priority for public transport. In addition, measures were taken to improve the safety for other road users. For the residential streets three options were drawn up. Option one: one way traffic and a single speed hump; option two; one way traffic with various speed limiting provisions and option three: the woonerf concept. All these measures have the aim of giving slow traffic a more or less equal position with respect to high speed traffic. The effects of these measures on traffic safety are studied and the results are presented...|$|R
