500|$|The CSMIP Cape Mendocino {{station was}} {{installed}} in 1978 and was located just [...] from the epicenter on the slope of a ridge in the coast ranges. The instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained firmly secured to the rock platform following the shocks. A landslide came within [...] of the device and left debris on the road, but a lack of large rocks close to the instrument and no cracking of the rocks near the platform left geologists with no clear explanation for the extraordinarily high vertical component reading of 1.85g. The tri-axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into the recording. A post-earthquake lab test of the seismometer and an inspection of the photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that the limit was hit twice, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>deflection</b> of 31mm, as the needle bounced off the unit's mass. An extrapolation of the vertical record led to a maximum acceleration estimate of 2.2g for that site, and the unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity digital device.|$|E

2500|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the first Boeing 307 Stratoliner (not a prototype, as it was planned to be {{delivered}} to Pan Am following testing and certification), registration NX 19901 took place from Boeing Field, Seattle on December 31, 1938. It crashed on March 18, 1939, while its performance with two engines inoperative on one wing was being demonstrated to representatives of KLM. When the engines were shut down, the pilot moved the rudder to <b>maximum</b> <b>deflection</b> to counter the resulting yaw. The Stratoliner then experienced rudder lock, where the control loads prevented the rudder from being re-centered. As a result, the 307 went into a spin and crashed. The ten people aboard, including KLM test pilot Albert von Baumhauer, Boeing test pilot Julius Barr, Boeing Chief Aerodynamicist Ralph Cram, Boeing Chief Engineer Earl Ferguson, and a TWA representative were killed. Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of an extended dorsal fin ahead of and attached to the vertical tail prevented rudder lock. This was incorporated into the 307's rudder redesign, while also being incorporated in Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for their models [...] "E" [...] through [...] "G" [...] B-17 bomber.|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} as concrete road slab, {{appear as}} a strong alternative for flexible superstructures especially because of their low cost for maintenance and repair and the high performance they show under heavy axle loads. The design of these concrete road slabs {{is quite different from}} the traditional concrete and reinforced concrete structures’ design. In the design for this kind of pavements, traffic conditions should be defined properly and considered an addition to the concrete and platform properties. There have been designing methods developed based on both experimental and mechanic foundations for concrete pavements. The most important ones of these methods are AASHTO (1993) and PCA (1984). In both design methods, it’s significant to know the <b>maximum</b> <b>deflections</b> and <b>maximum</b> strains the vehicles’ loads cause on the pavement. The calculation of this <b>maximum</b> <b>deflections</b> and <b>maximum</b> strains can be done via the finite element method or the closed formulas which have been developed by Westergaard. In this study, a user-friendly software has been developed based on AASHTO 1993, PCA 1984 design methods and Westergaard formulas. Thanks to this software, the user who wants to design the concrete pavement as concrete road slab can obtain the essential parameters automatically by entering the required data for the design. ...|$|R
