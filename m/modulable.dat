In part, this was due to the particular nature of piano manufacture in England. Joseph Haydn, for instance, composed his famous E-flat sonata after playing a piano of greater range lent to him by Dussek. Much of Dussek's piano writing drew upon the more <b>modulable</b> and powerful tonal qualities and greater keyboard range of English-manufactured pianofortes. The enhanced possibilities offered by the instrument help explain some of his stylistic innovations.|$|E

40|$|Hydrophobically {{modified}} polysaccharides show unusual rheological and interfacial {{properties in}} solution {{due to the}} self association of hydrophobic entities grafted onto their hydrophilic backbone. Their properties are tunable according to some well known parameters, such as {{the length of the}} hydrophobic moieties or the grafting density. However, very few studies deal with the influence of the backbone conformation on the properties of such systems in solution. Therefore, the objective of this work is to determine the impact of the backbone rigidity on the behavior of an amphiphilic polysaccharide based on xanthan. Indeed, in solution, this polymer can adopt two different conformations depending on the experimental conditions: an ordered, rigid helix or a disordered, flexible coil. Hydrophobic moieties have been grafted on xanthan either under its ordered and disordered conformation. Chains modified under the ordered conformation remain ordered and rigid after grafting and the overall properties are controlled by the high rigidity of the polymer backbone. On the contrary, macromolecules grafted under the disordered form show a more flexible conformation in solution. As a result, the organization of these derivatives is mainly controlled by the attractive interactions between the grafted moietiesLes polysaccharides amphiphiles possèdent des propriétés rhéologiques et interfaciales singulières dues aux interactions attractives entres les groupements hydrophobes greffés le long du squelette hydrophile. Leurs propriétés sont <b>modulables</b> suivant certains paramètres bien identifiés (nature des groupements hydrophobes, densité de greffage, etc.). Néanmoins, peu d’études s’intéressent à l’impact de la conformation du squelette sur le comportement de ces systèmes. L’objectif de ce mémoire est de déterminer l’influence de la rigidité du squelette sur les propriétés en solution d’un polysaccharide amphiphile à base de xanthane. En solution, ce polymère peut adopter deux conformations distinctes suivant les conditions opératoires : une forme ordonnée hélicoïdale rigide ou une forme désordonnée de type pelote flexible. Deux protocoles de greffage ont été développés afin de modifier le xanthane sous ces deux formes. Les xanthanes greffés sous forme ordonnée conservent une conformation hélicoïdale rigide, qui gouverne l’organisation globale des macromolécules. Au contraire, pour les polymères greffés sous forme désordonnée, l’organisation des chaînes est principalement contrôlée par les interactions attractives entre les groupements hydropho...|$|R
40|$|My PhD {{project was}} {{conducted}} {{within the framework}} of the “GRECO” project (ANR- 06 -TecSan- 025) which is coordinated by our group and funded by the French National Research Agency. Following the success of femtosecond laser technology in refractive surgery, the project aims to extend the application of these lasers to corneal grafting. Most of the indications for corneal grafting are associated to an insufficient optical quality of the patient's cornea, which also compromises the intervention by laser. Our findings suggest that the strong optical scattering of the pathological corneas at the laser wavelengths presently used can be compensated by an increase of the wavelength of lasers towards the window of relative tissular transparency centred at 1, 65 µm. Our project partners are the Hôtel-Dieu hospital at Paris, the Imagine Eyes company and the Institut d'Optique Graduate School. Objectives of the thesis The principal objectives of my thesis were the following: - The development of laser sources optimised for corneal grafting based on nonlinear wavelength conversion; - The study of the laser-tissue interaction process in view of optimising the laser parameters; - The conception and realisation of a demonstrator device for laser surgery. Results Laser source based on Optical Parametric Amplification The work plan of the GRECO project comprised the assembly of a flexible and parametric laser source based on a laser titanium:sapphire pump source in order to perform laboratory experiments covering a broad wavelength range. We chose an architecture based on the OPA principle which consists of two amplification stages (based on two crystals of different characteristics) preceded by the injection of a supercontinuum. The first stage provides good wavelength selectivity and the second a strong gain, particularly at twice the pump wavelength. The conversion efficiencies on the system are of about 20 % over the entire wavelength range of accordability. The system supplies pulses of 300 µJ tuneable between 1. 2 µm and 1. 75 µm for the signal. This source served for all the exploratory surgical experiments of the first half of the GRECO project. Laser source based on Optical Parametric Generation (OPG) In parallel to the surgical experiments on the laser-tissue interaction, I developed a second source taking into account the requirements for clinical use. This second source is pumped by a compact and stable commercial solid state laser emitting at 1. 03 µm. This wavelength is converted by optical parametric generation in a single nonlinear periodically poled crystal without injection; the system remains thus simple, compact and stable. The wavelength tuneability of the amplified signal is obtained by a change in the temperature of the crystal. Thus, no realignment is needed, which contributes to the robustness of the system. A single passage provides a conversion efficiency of about 20 % and maximum pulse energy of 20 µJ, which corresponds to a performance a 100 times greater than the state of art. The use of several periodically poled structures in the same crystal leads to an overall tuneability of the signal between 1450 nm and 1900 nm and thus covers the entire spectral range of corneal transparency and opacity in the short wavelength infrared. Surgical results on the cornea and on the sclera Our surgical experiments have been performed on corneas obtained under permission from the French Eye Bank. We have conducted a systematic study of the penetration depth and the quality of the surgical result as a function of wavelength and the pathological state of the cornea. In parallel, systematic measurements of the corneal transparency depending on the presence and degree of oedema have been made. The transparency measurements and the surgical experiments using the OPA or OPG have shown a strong dependence of the penetration depth on wavelength. - The use of wavelengths around 1 µm corresponding to present clinical systems is compromised by a very limited penetration depth in oedematous cornea. This conclusion agrees with the experience of our medical partners who estimate that the performances of clinical systems are limited when used for corneal grafting. - Using longer wavelengths limits the contribution of light scattering. However, the absorption band of water centred at 1. 45 µm increases the contribution of thermal effects; the use of wavelengths close to this band therefore is not possible - A window of relative transparency centred at 1. 65 µm exists, within which absorption is weak and the contribution of light scattering is almost negligible. We have observed an overall improvement of a factor of about 3 compared to lasers working at wavelengths around 1 µm. The quality of the incisions is excellent and the validity of the work hypothesis of the GRECO project has thus been demonstrated. The demonstrator device for an automated corneal graft with complex geometries The work plan of the GRECO project also comprised the assembly of a demonstrator device, combining the elements for an optimised system permitting corneal grafting. The demonstrator consists of three modules. The first unit contains the laser is alternatively the aforementioned OPG device or a compact fibre laser emitting at 1. 6 µm developed at the Institut d'Optique Graduate School. The second unit contains a module of adaptive optics. The third unit allows the delivery of the beam to the cornea and its positioning in three dimensions. The system is controlled by a computer interface based on LabView software. Conclusion and perspectives During my thesis work I have developed two innovative and powerful nonlinear laser sources respectively based on the principle of optical parametric amplification and generation. The performances notably of the second system are largely superior to the state of art and have permitted us to anticipate a milestone of another project funded by the National Agency of Research. The source corresponds to the criteria of reliability and compactness necessary for a clinical device. This source is at the basis of ongoing discussions of a technology transfer project. These sources have permitted to identify and to demonstrate the advantages of corneal surgery at 1. 65 µm. We have mounted a demonstrator system based on this wavelength which incorporates a wavefront correction module and a beam delivery system. The OPS group is now in a position to extend its activities in femtosecond laser surgery to other applications as glaucoma surgery in the sclera and new projects in cataract surgery or gene transfection. Mon projet de thèse se déroule dans le cadre du projet ANR TecSan 2006 GRECO (GREffe de COrnée automatisée par laser femtoseconde avec optimisation de la longueur d'onde et correction du front d'onde, ANR- 06 -TecSan- 025) piloté par notre groupe. Ce projet de 3 ans a été proposé suite au succès de l'utilisation des lasers à impulsions ultra-rapides dans la chirurgie réfractive et à la volonté d'étendre cette technologie à la greffe. La plupart des indications de greffe sont associées à une qualité optique de la cornée du patient insuffisante, ce qui rend difficile l'intervention par laser. Comme nos recherches l'ont démontré, la forte diffusion optique des cornées pathologiques aux longueurs d'onde actuellement utilisées peut être compensée par une augmentation de la longueur d'onde des lasers vers 1, 65 µm. Nos partenaires sont l'hôpital Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, la société Imagine Eyes et l'Institut d'Optique Graduate School. *** Objectifs de la thèse *** Les principaux objectifs de mon projet étaient les suivants : - Le développement de sources lasers optimisées pour la greffe de cornée basées sur la conversion de longueurs d'onde par optique non-linéaire; - L'étude de l'interaction laser-tissu en vue d'une optimisation des paramètres laser; - La conception et la mise en place d'un système démonstrateur pour la chirurgie laser. *** Présentation des principaux résultats obtenus *** (1) Source accordable par Amplification Paramétrique Optique (OPA) Dans un premier temps, le plan de travail du projet GRECO prévoyait le montage d'une source flexible et accordable basée sur un laser titane:saphire disponible au laboratoire. Nous avons choisi une architecture originale de type OPA, composée de deux étages d'amplification (basés sur deux cristaux de caractéristiques différentes) avec injection d'un supercontinuum de lumière blanche. Le premier étage assure une bonne sélectivité en longueur d'onde et le deuxième étage fournit un fort gain notamment au double de la longueur d'onde de pompe. Les efficacités de conversion sur l'ensemble du système atteignent 20 % quelque soit la longueur d'onde amplifiée. Le système fournit des impulsions de 300 µJ accordables entre 1, 2 µm et 1, 75 µm pour le signal. Cette source a servi pour toutes les expériences chirurgicales exploratoires de la première moitié du projet GRECO. (2) Source accordable par Génération Paramétrique Optique (OPG) En parallèle des expériences chirurgicales sur l'interaction laser-tissu, une deuxième source, plus compacte et potentiellement adaptée à un contexte clinique, a été développée. Cette deuxième source est pompée par un laser industriel également compact et stable, et émettant à 1, 03 µm. Cette longueur d'onde est convertie par génération paramétrique optique dans un seul cristal nonlinéaire périodiquement polarisé ne nécessitant aucune injection. Dans un premier temps, l'ajustement de la longueur d'onde du signal amplifié se fait par simple changement de la température du cristal sans nécessiter d'alignement, ce qui contribue à la robustesse du système. Un seul passage permet une efficacité de conversion d'environ 20 %, et un maximum d'énergie de 20 µJ ce qui correspond à une amélioration d'un facteur 100 par rapport à l'état de l'art. L'utilisation de plusieurs structures périodiques juxtaposées permet d'obtenir une accordabilitée totale entre 1450 nm et 1900 nm qui couvre donc les bandes d'absorption et notamment de transparence des tissus du segment antérieur. (3) Résultats chirurgicaux sur la cornée et la sclère Nos expériences chirurgicales ont été effectuées sur des cornées obtenues auprès de la Banque Française des Yeux. Nous avons réalisé une étude systématique de la profondeur de pénétration et de la qualité du résultat chirurgical en fonction de la longueur d'onde et de l'état pathologique de la cornée. En parallèle, des mesures systématiques de transparence cornéenne en fonction de la présence et du degré d'œdème ont été menées. Les mesures de transparence puis les expériences chirurgicales utilisant l'OPA ou l'OPG ont mis en évidence une forte dépendance entre profondeur de pénétration et longueur d'onde. - L'utilisation des longueurs d'onde autour de 1 µm correspondant aux systèmes cliniques actuels se heurte à une profondeur de pénétration très limitée dans des cornées œdémateuses. Ce constat est en accord avec l'expérience de nos partenaires cliniques qui estiment également que les performances des systèmes actuels sont limitées pour une application à la greffe de cornée. - L'augmentation de la longueur d'onde limite la contribution des processus de diffusion de la lumière. Néanmoins, la bande d'absorption de l'eau centrée à 1, 45 µm augmente la contribution des effets thermiques. L'utilisation de longueurs d'onde proches de cette bande n'est donc pas réaliste. - Il existe une fenêtre de relative transparence optique centrée à 1, 65 µm au sein de laquelle l'absorption est faible et la contribution de la diffusion de la lumière est quasi négligeable. Dans l'absolu, nous avons pu constater une amélioration d'environ un facteur 3 par rapport aux lasers cliniques travaillant aux longueurs d'onde autour de 1 µm. La qualité des incisions est excellente et la validité des hypothèses de travail du projet GRECO a pu être vérifiée. (4) Le dispositif démonstrateur pour la greffe de cornée automatisée et de géométrie complexe. Le programme de travail du projet GRECO prévoyait le montage d'un système démonstrateur regroupant les éléments d'un système de greffe de cornée. Le démonstrateur est composé de trois parties <b>modulables.</b> La première unité contient le laser qui peut être soit un laser fibré centré à 1590 nm développé par l'Institut d'Optique Graduate School soit le système laser accordable par OPG qui a été développée au cours de la présente thèse. La deuxième unité contient un module d'optique adaptative qui corrige la qualité du front d'onde du faisceau laser. La troisième unité permet la délivrance du faisceau en 3 dimensions dans le volume de la cornée. Le tout est piloté automatiquement à travers une interface ordinateur basée sur le logiciel LabView développé au cours de la présente thèse. *** Conclusion *** Durant mon doctorat, j'ai développé deux sources nonlinéaires performantes et innovantes basées respectivement sur le principe de l'amplification et de la génération paramétrique optique. Les performances notamment de la deuxième source sont largement supérieures à l'état d'art et nous ont permis d'anticiper un jalon d'un deuxième projet ANR. Elle respecte les contraintes de fiabilité et de compacité nécessaires à un appareil clinique. Cette source est à la base de discussions actuelles sur un projet de valorisation. Ces sources ont permis d'identifier puis de démontrer les avantages d'une chirurgie de la cornée à 1, 65 µm. Nous avons mis en place un système démonstrateur basé sur cette longueur d'onde qui incorpore un module de correction du front d'onde et un dispositif d'administration du faisceau. Le groupe OPS est désormais en mesure d'étendre les champs d'investigations en chirurgie femtoseconde, tout d'abord dans la sclère puis plus généralement dans l'ensemble des tissus notamment au travers de nouveaux projets aujourd'hui en préparation tel que la chirurgie de la cataracte ou encore le transfert de gènes...|$|R

40|$|Using {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from individuals {{with or without}} coccidioidal delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), we examined and attempted to modulate the in vitro responses of PBMC from various donors to the coccidioidal antigen toluene spherule lysate (TSL). Among healthy DTH-positive donors, 100 ng of human recombinant interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) per ml suppressed both PBMC proliferation (P = 0. 01) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and IL- 12 production (for both, P 0. 05). Human recombinant IL- 12 increased IFN-gamma production by PBMC from active, DTH-positive donors (P = 0. 01) but not by PBMC from DTH-negative groups. For healthy DTH-positive donors, the median antigen-reactive cell frequency per 10 (5) PBMC was 3. 7, compared to 1. 7 in DTH-negative donors with active coccidioidomycosis (P = 0. 03). These data indicate that the in vitro TSL response is highly dependent on coccidioidal DTH. Not only do PBMC from individuals with DTH appear to respond to TSL, but their response can be modulated in vitro with either IL- 10 or IL- 12. On the other hand, PBMC from DTH-negative individuals do not respond in vitro to TSL and their response is not <b>modulable,</b> suggesting a lack of antigen response...|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} {{was developed to}} create a <b>modulable</b> polymer surface architecture (topography, chemical composition) at the nanometer scale. Therefore, collagen was first adsorbed on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate and dried at high or low rate to produce continuous or discontinuous layers, respectively. Solutions of PMMA in chlorobenzene were then spin-coated on top of these collagen layers. The obtained surfaces were investigated using atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Spin-coating with pure chlorobenzene on the continuous collagen layer produced pits in the PMMA substrate through the collagen layer; spin-coating with PMMA solutions of increasing concentrations progressively {{led to the formation}} of a surface covered by particles made of PMMA and collagen, resulting from a combination of dissolution of PMMA from the substrate and deposition of PMMA from the solution. Spin-coating with pure chlorobenzene on the discontinuous collagen layer led to dissolution of PMMA and to its redeposition on the collagen pattern, which served as a template. This provided a surface entirely composed of PMMA, with cavities in the range of 0. 1 - 1 mum diameter and 50 - 250 nm depth. In this case, the surface relief was independent of the PMMA concentration of the spin-coated solution, the substrate PMMA dissolution and redeposition being the dominant processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} as non {{viral gene}} vector of a protein-like polymer, the a,b-poly(N- 2 -hydroxyethyl) -D,L-aspartamide (PHEA) were exploited after its derivatization with 3 -(carboxypropyl) trimethyl-ammonium chloride (CPTA) as molecule bearing a cationic group, inorder to obtain stable polycations able to condense DNA. PHEA was firstly functionalized with aminic pendant groups by reaction withethylenediamine (EDA) obtaining the a,b-poly(N- 2 -hydroxyethyl) (2 -aminoethylcarbamate) -D,L-aspartamide (PHEA-EDA) copolymer. We demonstrated that polymer functionalization degree is easily <b>modulable</b> by varying reaction conditions, so allowing to produce two PHEA-EDA derivatives at different molar percentage of amine groups. Subsequently, the condensation reaction of PHEA-EDA copolymers with CPTA yielded a,b-poly(N- 2 -hydroxyethyl) (2 -[3 -(trimethylammonium chloride) propylamide]-amidoethylcarbamate) - D,L-aspartamide (PHEA-EDA-CPTA) polycation derivatives. In vitro studies {{were carried out}} to evaluate polycations ability to complex DNA and to protect it from nuclease degradation. Obtained results demonstrated the good ability of our new PHEA polycationic derivatives, PHEA-EDA-CPTA, to complex and condense genomic material, neutralizing its anionic charge even at very low polycation/DNA weight ratio. Finally, PHEA-EDA-CPTA polycations were characterized by in vitro cytotoxicity studies to evaluate their effects on the viability of HuH- 6 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by MTS assay. No cytotoxicity was evidenced by both polycationic derivatives after 48 h of incubation at all tested concentrations...|$|E
30|$|However, {{adjusting}} {{the band alignment}} through the above structural factors is complex and inflexible. The band structure of heterojunction can also be externally controlled by an electric field, magnetic field and light field [44]. The band engineering regulated by the gate voltage leads to the transitions in 2 D heterostructures between band alignments of type I–III. Particularly, graphene has a unique linear dispersion relationship with a finite DOS; thus, the Fermi level and work function of graphene are gate <b>modulable,</b> making graphene widely used as the contact between the electrodes and the channel of the 2 D material to reduce the contact resistance (Rc). What’s more, band structure can also be optically modulated to behave like a photogate, a phenomenon looking like {{the addition of a}} local gate (ΔVg) to the device when under illumination [45]. The band diagram of a photodetector with the WS 2 /MoS 2 hetero-bilayer as a light absorption layer and the graphene as the electrode contact is shown in Fig.  3 f [42]. Under illumination, the accumulation of holes at the region acts as a positive gate on the source graphene electrode, effectively raising the Fermi level of the graphene electrode and lowering the SBH. Figure  3 g [43] shows a typical band structure of floating-gate devices with an Au floating-gate layer to form energy well to trap the charges.|$|E
40|$|Order in {{molecular}} {{thin films}} is of fundamental importance to gain and exploit {{a series of}} properties in nanotechnology. In this contest, engineering 2 D supramolecular and molecular superstructures is of particular interest. They offer great possibilities for several applications whose achievement also allows for new theoretical approaches and nanoscale laws [1]. A natural extension of 2 D nanopatterning concerns the attainment of a 3 D nanoscale control in molecular films [2]. This question is complex to challenge and it is of ultimate importance in emerging fields like organic and hybrid photovoltaics, organic thin film transistors and sensors as well as plastic electronics. For example, the development of nanostructured bi-continuous bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) is an important advancement leading to improved photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) with respect to planar heterojunctions. In a previous work we obtained PCE of about 3 % employing the BHJ concept for all-polymer solar cells [3, 4]. In this study, we show an innovative approach {{for the construction of}} 3 D ordered and <b>modulable</b> BHJs architectures of two different polymer blends: Poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) :Phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P 3 HT:PCBM) and Poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) :Poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (P 3 HT:F 8 BT). When exposed to light irradiation, these blends give rise to two different mechanism of electro-optical interaction: Charge Transfer (CT) and the Forster Res...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} an aggregator controlling heat pumps in households to offer a direct control flexibility service for network management purposes, such as solving system balance or congestion issues. The service is defined by a 15 minutes power modulation, upward or downward, followed by a payback effect on a fixed duration that models the corresponding relative decrease or increase of consumption. The service modulation is relative to an optimized baseline that minimizes the energy costs given a forward price signal. The amount of <b>modulable</b> power and payback effect is computed by solving a series of mixed integer linear programs. Within these optimization problems, the building thermal behavior is modeled as an equivalent thermal network made of thermal resistances and lumped thermal capacitances whose parameters are identified from more complex and validated models. With an average heat pump nominal power of 4. 3 kW installed in one hundred houses, results show {{that it is possible}} to harvest an average upward modulation of 1. 2 kW per house with a payback of 600 Wh leading to 150 Wh of overconsumption. An average downward modulation of 500 W per house can be achieved with a payback of 420 Wh leading to 120 Wh of overconsumption. In this case, the payback effect can be contained in a one hour and 15 minutes period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Three {{experiments}} examined {{reaction time}} (RT) performance in visual pop-out search. Search displays comprised of one color target and two distractors which were presented at 24 possible locations on a circular ellipse. Experiment 1 showed that re-presentation {{of the target}} at a previous target location led to expedited RTs, whereas pre-sentation of the target at a distractor location led to slowed RTs (relative to target presentation at a previous empty location). RTs were also faster when {{the color of the}} target was the same across consecutive trials, relative to a change of the target’s color. This color priming was independent of the positional priming. Experiment 2 revealed larger posi-tional facilitation, relative to Experiment 1, when position repetitions occurred more likely than chance level; analo-gously, Experiment 3 revealed stronger color priming eVects when target color repetitions were more likely. These position and color manipulations did not change the pattern of color (Experiment 2) and positional priming eVects (Experiment 3). While these results support the inde-pendency of color and positional priming eVects (e. g., Maljkovic and Nakayama in Percept Psychophys 58 : 977 – 991, 1996), they also show that these (largely ‘automatic’) eVects are top-down <b>modulable</b> when target position and color are predictable (e. g., Müller et al. in Vis Cogn 11 : 577 – 602, 2004) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{activated}} states, neocortical neurons receive intense synaptic background {{activity that}} induces large-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations {{and a strong}} conductance in the membrane. However, {{little is known about}} the integrative properties of neurons during such high-conductance states. Here we investigated the integrative properties of neocortical pyramidal neurons under in vivo conditions simulated by computational models. We show that the presence of high-conductance fluctuations induces a stochastic state in which active dendrites are fast conducting and have a different dynamics of initiation and forward-propagation of Na+-dependent spikes. Synaptic efficacy, quantified as the probability that a synaptic input specifically evokes a somatic spike, was approximately independent of the dendritic location of the synapse. Synaptic inputs evoked precisely timed responses (milliseconds), which also showed a reduced location dependence. This scheme was found to apply to a broad range of kinetics and density distributions of voltage-dependent conductances, as well as to different dendritic morphologies. Synaptic efficacies were, however, <b>modulable</b> by the balance of excitation and inhibition in background activity, for all synapses at once. Thus, models predict that the intense synaptic activity in vivo can confer advantageous computational properties to neocortical neurons: they can be set to an integrative mode that is stochastic, fast conducting, and optimized to process synaptic inputs at high temporal resolution independently of their position in the dendrites. Some of these predictions can be tested experimentally...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to approach, {{even though}} in a briefly way, the subject of {{invention}} in the training of teachers. In order to do this, we will make a brief overview on Virgínia Kastrup contributions about this issue. One of the questions is the time - through Henri Bergson’s duration concept and its using in training theme. From this point, {{we will try to}} deconstruct a view about the identity reference in contemporaneity toward to multiple and open ways of existence. In the inventive movements of the processuality, the time is considered as an expression of human being individuation. It means to last refer to an immediacy of being, of being time, which are <b>modulable</b> and mutant, always in a creation process. In a movement of building a body which leaves an identity reference – that is opposite of self-transformation – necessarily we report us to the relation between the idea of time as duration and the individuation principle by Gilberto Simondon. With these concepts and their possible resonance in the discussion about formative politics, we can develop a view over the invisible to training of teachers and over the learners and another ways of operating in the world. The invention as a lever direct us to a field of possibilities to conceive and experience another time (and space) which is producer of subjectivity, singularities and differences...|$|E

These structures can be designed and fabricated with a variable, interconnected and accessible porous network, resulting in <b>modulable</b> mechanical properties, permeability, and architecture that can be tailored to mimic a specific tissue to replace or regenerate. In this study, we evaluated whether anatomical meniscal 3 D scaffolds with matching mechanical properties and architecture are beneficial for meniscus replacement as compared to meniscectomy. After acquiring CT and MRI of porcine menisci, 3 D fiber-deposited (3 DF) scaffolds were fabricated with different architectures by varying the deposition pattern of the fibers comprising the final structure. The mechanical behaviour of 3 DF scaffolds with different architectures and of porcine menisci was measured by static and dynamic mechanical analysis {{and the effect of}} these tissue engineering templates on articular cartilage was assessed by finite element analysis (FEA) and compared to healthy conditions or to meniscectomy. Results show that 3 DF anatomical menisci scaffolds can be fabricated with pore different architectures and with mechanical properties matching those of natural menisci. FEA predicted a beneficial effect of meniscus replacement with 3 D scaffolds in different mechanical loading conditions as compared to meniscectomy. No influence of the internal scaffold architecture was found on articular cartilage damage. Although FEA predictions should be further confirmed by in vitro and in vivo experiments...|$|E
