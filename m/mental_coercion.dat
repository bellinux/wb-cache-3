40|$|In 2010, unmet {{medical care}} and sexual health {{counseling}} needs were assessed among students at a Ugandan University. Unmet medical care need was associated with poor mental health, experience of sexual coercion, and poor self-rated health. Unmet sexual health counseling need {{was significantly associated with}} being female, coming from an urban area, low social participation, poor mental health status, experience of sexual coercion, poor self-rated health, inconsistent condom use, and having multiple sexual partners. Gender differences, poor <b>mental</b> health, sexual <b>coercion,</b> poor self-rated health, and risky sexual behavior must be considered when designing intervention models to reduce unmet health care needs among young people in this setting...|$|R

40|$|Background Norway has {{extensive}} and detailed legal requirements and guidelines concerning involvement of {{next of kin}} (NOK) during involuntary hospital treatment of seriously mentally ill patients. However, we have little knowledge about what happens in practice. This study explores NOK’s views and experiences of involvement during involuntary hospitalisation in Norway. Methods We performed qualitative interviews-focus groups and individual-with 36 adult NOK to adults and adolescents who had been involuntarily admitted once or several times. The semi-structured interview guide included questions on experiences with and views on involvement during serious <b>mental</b> illness and <b>coercion.</b> Results Most of the NOK were heavily involved in the patient’s life and illness. Their conceptions of involvement during <b>mental</b> illness and <b>coercion,</b> included many important aspects adding to the traditional focus on substitute decision-making. The overall impression was, with a few exceptions, that the NOK had experienced lack of involvement or had negative experiences as NOK in their encounters with the health services. Not being seen and acknowledged as important caregivers and co sufferers were experienced as offensive and could add to their feelings of guilt. Lack of involvement had as a consequence that vital patient information which the NOK possessed was not shared with the patient’s therapists. Conclusions Despite public initiatives to improve the involvement of NOK, the NOK in our study felt neglected, unappreciated and dismissed. The paper discusses possible reasons for the gap between public policies and practice which deserve more attention: 1. A strong and not always correct focus on legal matters. 2. Little emphasis {{on the role of}} NOK in professional ethics. 3. The organisation of health services and resource constraints. 4. A conservative culture regarding the role of next of kin in mental health care. Acknowledging these reasons may be helpful to understand deficient involvement of the NOK in voluntary mental health services...|$|R

The British government has determined the techniques would be classified as torture, and dismissed President Bush's claim to the contrary. A report by Human Rights First (HRF) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) stated that these techniques constitute torture. They also cite the U.S. Office of the Inspector General report which concluded [...] "SERE-type interrogation techniques constitute 'physical or <b>mental</b> torture and <b>coercion</b> under the Geneva conventions.' [...] "A United Nations report denounced the US abuse of prisoners as tantamount to torture. The UN report called for cessation of the US-termed [...] "enhanced interrogation" [...] techniques, as the UN sees these methods {{as a form of}} torture. The UN report also admonishes against secret prisons, the use of which, is considered to amount to torture as well and should be discontinued.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} mental health and {{functioning}} of female sex workers (FSW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh, a population that has commonly been neglected in mental health policy and research. Methods: We included 259 women in the study (M age: 23. 2 years; range: 11 - 48). The comprehensive Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) {{was used to assess}} their 12 -month prevalence rates of DSM-IV mental disorders and a comprehensive questionnaire was adapted to explore various factors such as socio-demographics, working and living conditions, or experiences of abuse. Results: On average, participants began their commercial sex work at 18. 5 years old (range: 10 - 45). Their main motives for sex work were coercion (49. 4 %) and the necessity to financially support families (54. 8 %). In total, 224 FSW (86. 5 %) wanted to quit commercial sex work. A mental disorder within the past 12 months was reported by 100 FSW (38. 6 %), with drug abuse clearly being the most prevalent diagnosis (15. 4 %). Sexual, physical and emotional abuse were very common among the FSW, and substance use disorders (SUD) were significantly more prevalent in persons who experienced emotional abuse (OR= 2. 2). Prevalence rates of any mental disorder and SUD were higher in women who did sex work to support their family while mood disorders were more frequent in those who needed the money to pay debts. Participants with any disorder were significantly older than those without (M age: 24. 4 vs. 22. 5 years) and had started significantly later in the sex business (M age: 19. 7 vs. 17. 7 years). Conclusions: Our study revealed that FSW in Chittagong are very vulnerable and highly impaired, as expressed by high rates of abuse and <b>mental</b> disorders. <b>Coercion</b> is very common and many FSW are required to work in the sex business because they need the money to support their families. FSW are a very marginalized population, especially in developing countries where awareness for mental health is low and the availability of mental health services is insufficient...|$|R

40|$|Over the years, {{a pattern}} has emerged where judges {{routinely}} engage in practices that violate the {{constitutional rights of}} the defendants who come before them, and which {{run counter to the}} ethical conduct that {{we have a right to}} expect and demand from those empowered to engage in critical decisions concerning the liberty of our citizens. The Supreme Court, when it held that plea bargaining between a prosecutor and defense counsel did not violate the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional rights, offered a caveat: 2 ̆ 2 Of course, the agents of the State may not produce a plea by actual or threatened physical harm or by <b>mental</b> <b>coercion</b> overbearing the will of the defendant. 2 ̆ 2 The Court must realize what is patently clear: in at least some situations, judicial involvement in plea negotiations can constitute <b>mental</b> <b>coercion.</b> The most appropriate way of dealing with that possibility is to adopt a prophylactic rule, a 2 ̆ 2 bright-line 2 ̆ 2 prohibition. Such a ban on the judge negotiating a plea with the defendant exists in the federal courts, the time is long overdue for it to apply to the state courts as well...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} {{representations of the}} physical construction and landscape of Southern slave plantations in order to explore the power relationships among inhabitants of those plantations and how those power relationships attempted to function and failed {{to establish a system}} of discipline and governance. While every plantation functioned violently in some form, many plantations appear to have attempted to instill a sense of place and permanence of status in slaves with more than just physical violence or obvious and overt forms of <b>mental</b> <b>coercion</b> and abuse. As a supplement to the strategic (and oftentimes random) physical violence inflicted on slaves in the attempts to control their behaviors, owners seem to have also attempted to discipline their slaves through strategic constructions of the plantation landscapes. While concluding that this strategy ultimately failed, this thesis examines attempts by owners to implement particular strategies in regulating and disciplining the behavior of slaves which can be compared with the strategies implemented in a panoptic system as described by Michel Foucault...|$|E

Use of direct coercion in social welfare homes for persons with mental disorders according to the rules specified in the Act on the Protection of <b>Mental</b> Health.

At the same time it introduced restrictions on the use of all forms of coercive measure by indicating what type of product can be used in certain situations. Coercive measures are holding, forced administration of medication, immobilization, isolation. Particular attention was paid to the lack of legal regulations regarding the use of direct coercion in medical entities. It is about patient care and treatment and nursing care as well as patient wards other than a branch of psychiatry. In this case, the basis for their application will be regulations contained in the Act on Professions of Physician and Dentist and the provisions of the Criminal Code. In order to provide necessary medical care, the doctor who deals with patients with mental disorders which show somatic background may use direct coercion...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research from sub-Saharan Africa {{has shown}} that persons with {{same-sex}} sexuality experience are at elevated risk for ill health due to sexual risk taking, stigma, and discrimination. However, studies of healthcare seeking among young people in this region with same-sex sexuality experience are limited. Objective: To identify determinants of unmet healthcare and sexual health counselling needs, respectively, among Ugandan university students with experience of same-sex sexuality. Design: In 2010, 1, 954 Ugandan university students completed a questionnaire assessing socio-demographic factors, mental health, alcohol usage, sexual behaviours, and healthcare seeking. The study population consisted of those 570 who reported ever being in love with, sexually attracted to, sexually fantasised about, or sexually engaged with someone of the same sex. Results: Findings showed that 56 % and 30 % reported unmet healthcare and sexual health counselling needs, respectively. Unmet healthcare needs were associated with poor mental health and exposure to sexual coercion (OR 3. 9, 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 2. 7 – 5. 7; OR 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 3 – 3. 0, respectively). Unmet sexual health counselling needs {{were significantly associated with}} poor mental health (OR 3. 2, 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 4. 8), exposure to sexual coercion (OR 2. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 7 – 3. 9), frequent heavy episodic drinking (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 9 – 5. 8), and number of sexual partners (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 04 – 3. 3). The associations between poor <b>mental</b> health, sexual <b>coercion,</b> and unmet healthcare needs (AOR 4. 2, 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 8. 5; AOR 2. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 3 – 5. 8) and unmet needs for sexual health counselling (AOR 3. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 6 – 7. 1; AOR 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 4 – 5. 4) persisted after adjustment for socio-demographic factors, number of sexual partners, and frequent heavy episodic drinking. Conclusions: These findings indicate that exposure to sexual <b>coercion</b> and poor <b>mental</b> health may influence healthcare seeking behaviours of same-sex sexuality experienced students. Targeted interventions that integrate mental health and trauma response are critical to meet the health needs of this population...|$|R
