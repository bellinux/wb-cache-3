5|$|Some {{elements}} of the station, including the size of internal support structures, the amount of glass panels, and {{the width of the}} roof, were eliminated or reduced to save $20 million in construction costs. <b>Moving</b> <b>walkways</b> and electric carts were both considered and rejected for the station because of engineering difficulties and cost. In 2017, the Port of Seattle began a $3.5 million capital program to improve the walk from the station to the terminal by installing windscreens and adding a cart shuttle service.|$|E
25|$|The station {{consists}} of two separate sections, one for each line, {{at the same level}} and 150 metres apart. The north–south platforms, which opened in 1978, were originally planned as a separate station, but the TTC decided to join to the existing 1966 east–west station with a pedestrian tunnel containing a pair of long <b>moving</b> <b>walkways.</b> The cost of the <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> themselves became an issue when they became due for refurbishment or replacement, and they were shut down and ultimately removed in 2004, leaving the corridor as a simple underground walkway. The former location of the <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> remains visible because the tiles used to cover their removal are noticeably different. Warnings to hold the handrails are still embossed on the walls where the ends of the <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> were once located.|$|E

The Short Term garage is {{attached}} to the Landside Terminal via the enclosed <b>moving</b> <b>walkway.</b> There are 2,100 spaces available. The Long Term section also has quick access to the enclosed <b>moving</b> <b>walkway.</b> There are 3,100 spaces available here. The Extended section does not have access to the enclosed <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> but does have regular parking shuttles that can be accessed from the Baggage Claim level of the Landside Terminal outside doors six and eight. There are 8,000 spaces available in the Extended lot.|$|R
25|$|Logan International Airport has 102 gate {{positions}} total, {{divided among}} four terminals, A, B, C and E. All terminals are connected by pre-security shuttle buses {{and by the}} SL1 branch of the MBTA Silver Line BRT, {{as well as between}} Terminals A, B and E via pre-security <b>moving</b> <b>walkways.</b> <b>Moving</b> <b>walkways</b> also connect the terminals to a central parking garage designed for consolidated service between all four terminals and the garage itself. Massport ultimately plans to connect all terminals and gates post-security, thereby allowing for seamless connections between flights from different terminals. The concession program at the airport is developed, leased and managed by AirMall USA (formerly BAA USA) in Terminals B and E and Westfield Concession Management Inc. in Terminals A and C.|$|E
25|$|The eight-level {{parking garage}} has over 8,100 parking spaces {{and uses a}} Smart Technology System that lets guests know which floors are full.

25|$|The {{terminals}} and concourses {{are connected}} by the Transportation Mall, a pedestrian tunnel {{with a series}} of <b>moving</b> <b>walkways,</b> and The Plane Train, an automated people mover. The Plane Train has stations along the Transportation Mall at the Domestic Terminal (which also serves Concourse T), at each of the six other concourses (including concourse F which is connected to the International Terminal), and at the domestic baggage claim area. The Plane Train is the world's busiest automated system, with over 64 million riders in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Universal Orlando's {{internal}} {{transportation system}} is often dubbed Universal Transit. The system consists of water taxis, buses, escalators, elevators, <b>moving</b> <b>walkways,</b> and pathways which transport guests between the parking structure, hotels, CityWalk, and the theme parks. Onsite hotel guests {{can get to}} the theme parks and CityWalk by either boarding a water taxi which will take them directly to CityWalk or may use walkways. The dock at CityWalk is located at the center of CityWalk and can be accessed by theme park visitors via the bridges connecting CityWalk to the theme parks. Along the pathways, bicycles also transport guests for an additional cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} currently houses all non-SkyTeam airlines {{serving the}} airport, {{and is considered}} D Concourse. (Concourses A, B, and C are housed in the McNamara Terminal) The concourse has 26 gates, two of which opened {{in the middle of}} 2009 to accommodate international wide-body aircraft. The two gates were unusable at the building's opening because they were extremely close to Smith Terminal's C Concourse, which was demolished after operations moved to the new facility. The terminal features four long segments of <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> on the departures level, and another moving walkway on the lower level; that is for international arriving passengers to access the Federal Inspection Services area.|$|E

25|$|Terminal 3 opened as the Oceanic Terminal on 13 November 1961 {{to handle}} flight departures for {{long-haul}} routes for foreign carriers to the United States, Asia and other Far Eastern destinations. At {{this time the}} airport had a direct helicopter service to Central London from the gardens {{on the roof of}} the terminal building. Renamed Terminal 3 in 1968, it was expanded in 1970 with the addition of an arrivals building. Other facilities added included the UK's first <b>moving</b> <b>walkways.</b> In 2006, the new £105 million Pier 6 was completed to accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo; Emirates and Qantas operate regular flights from Terminal 3 using the Airbus A380.|$|E
25|$|The B and C concourses are {{connected}} to the main terminal building and the A Concourse by a pedestrian walkway under the Airport ramp. This walkway, known as the Light Tunnel, features an elaborate multi-colored light show behind sculpted glass panels extending {{the entire length of the}} walkway, as well several <b>moving</b> <b>walkways.</b> The light patterns are synchronized with an original musical score composed by Victor Alexeeff, which runs for nearly 30 minutes before repeating. This installation, one of the first large-scale uses of color changing LED lighting in the United States, was produced by Mills James Productions with glasswork by Foxfire Glass Works of Pontiac, Michigan. The display won multiple lighting design awards including the prestigious Guth Award of Merit. For passengers who are prone to medical conditions such as seizures, there are buttons at each end of the tunnel that will suspend the light show for five minutes so they can pass through with no adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 3 {{uses the}} Jetway system. The overall layout {{is similar to}} that of {{airports}} in Europe and North America, with multiple levels and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by escalators and <b>moving</b> <b>walkways.</b> The upper level departures hall, with an area of over , is equipped with 110 check-in counters and as well as flight information display systems. A small shopping mall, known as Buy & Bye, is open to both travellers and the general public. The mall, which includes shops, restaurants and a post office, was planned to be a draw for non-flyers too. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. The arrivals hall is located on the ground floor where there are also 20 additional check-in counters (serving Star Alliance airlines). Car rental counters are located in an intermediate level situated between the departing and arriving passenger halls. Terminal 3 has two synagogues.|$|E

25|$|A new train system, dubbed AeroTrain and {{developed}} by Mitsubishi, began in 2010 to transport passengers between the concourses {{and the main}} terminal. The system, which uses rubber tires and travels along a fixed underground guideway, {{is similar to the}} people mover systems at Singapore Changi Airport, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Denver International Airport. The train is intended to replace the mobile lounges, which many passengers found crowded and inconvenient. The initial phase includes the main terminal station, a permanent Concourse A station, a permanent Concourse B station, a permanent midfield concourse station (with access to the current temporary C concourse via a tunnel with <b>moving</b> <b>walkways),</b> and a maintenance facility. Mobile lounges continue to service the D Concourse from both the main terminal and Concourse A. Even after AeroTrain is built out and the replacement Concourses C and D are built, the mobile lounges and plane mates will still continue to be used, to transport international arriving passengers to the International Arrivals Building, as well as transport passengers to aircraft parked on hardstands without direct access to jet bridges. Dulles has stated that the wait time for a train does not exceed four minutes, compared to the average 15-minute wait and travel time for mobile lounges.|$|E
500|$|The {{increased}} {{realism of}} the puppets meant that their mobility was significantly reduced, ironically leaving {{the new design}} less lifelike than Anderson had hoped, as he recalls: [...] "Suddenly, all the movements had to be as realistic as the puppets and that {{made it difficult for}} the puppeteers to animate them." [...] To minimise the amount of movement required, the puppets were made to stand on <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> or sit at moving desks: for example, Colonel White's desk on Cloudbase is seen to rotate, while Lieutenant Green is seen to operate the Cloudbase main computer from a sliding chair.
