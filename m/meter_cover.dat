40|$|Although paddle is {{the second}} most practiced sport in Spain, the {{scientific}} knowledge about the players' work-load is still very low. The serve is a critical situation because the team has the opportunity to start the point attacking by approaching the net straight after the serve. However, the distance covered by the serve team still has not been studied in pádel. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse the distance covered by the serve team according performance level. It was hypothesized that the server would cover more distance than his partner due to the approach to the net after the serve. Moreover, it also was hypothesized that the difference between serve and partner would be greater to the highest performance level. METHODS: We analysed a sample of 1500 points divided in 3 levels of performance (high, medium and recreational, 500 points each one). We compared the distance covered between the server and his partner in 500 hundred points to each level performance. The points were taken from 14 matches (4 of high, 5 of medium and 5 of recreational level). SAGIT software (Vučković et al., 2002) was used to get the data. Analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel and SPSS 20. 0. RESULTS: Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test were performed. At high level, the median of distance covered by the server was of 10. 7 meters, significantly greater than the 7. 5 <b>meters</b> <b>covered</b> by the partner of the server (Z = - 11. 7; p <. 001). At medium level, the median of distance covered by the server was of 9. 2 meters, also significantly greater than the 6. 6 <b>meters</b> <b>covered</b> by the partner of the server (Z = - 12. 1; p <. 001). At recreational level, the median of distance covered by the server was of 8. 4 meters, also significantly greater than the 6. 1 <b>meters</b> <b>covered</b> by the partner of the server (Z = - 10, 2; p <. 001). DISCUSION: Independently of the level performance, the player serving covered more distance than his partner. These results have implications to training and tactics used in games, as the decision about what player is going to start serving each set, the skill fullest or the toughest...|$|R
