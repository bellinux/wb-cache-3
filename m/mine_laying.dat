Six Bristol Blenheims undertook an armed reconnaissance over the North Sea. RAF Coastal Command flew 95 sorties for anti-invasion, anti-submarine, <b>mine</b> <b>laying</b> and reconnaissance missions. Spitfires photographed every port from Antwerp to Cherbourg.

5|$|Until the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to begin {{operations}} over the mainland, {{the first phase of}} the German air offensive targeted British shipping in the Channel. The raids rarely involved attacks against RAF airfields inland, but encouraged RAF units to engage in battle by attacking British Channel convoys. These operations lasted from 10 July to 8 August 1940. The attacks against shipping were not very successful, and only 24,500 GRT was sunk. <b>Mine</b> <b>laying</b> from aircraft had proved more profitable, sinking 38,000 tons. The impact on Fighter Command was minimal. It had lost 74 fighter pilots killed or missing and 48 wounded in July, but British strength rose to 1,429 by 3 August, leaving it only short of 124 pilots. Still, the attacks succeeded in forcing the British to abandon the Channel convoy route and to redirect shipping to ports in north-eastern Britain. With this achieved the Luftwaffe began the second phase of its air offensive, attacking RAF airfields and supporting structures in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Poltava (renamed Frunze in 1926) was {{the second}} of the s of the Imperial Russian Navy built before World War I. The Ganguts were the first class of Russian dreadnoughts. She was named after the Russian victory over Charles XII of Sweden in the Battle of Poltava in 1709. She was {{completed}} during the winter of 1914–15, but was not ready for combat until mid-1915. Her role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so she spent her time training and providing cover for <b>mine</b> <b>laying</b> operations. She was laid up in 1918 for lack of trained crew and suffered a devastating fire the following year that almost gutted her. Many proposals were made to reconstruct or modernize her in different ways for the next twenty years, but none were carried out. While all this was being discussed she served as source of spare parts for her sister ships and was used as a barracks ship. She was finally struck from the Navy List in 1940 and scrapping began at a very leisurely rate. She was intentionally grounded in late 1941 to prevent her from being sunk in some inconvenient location by the Germans. She was refloated in 1944 and scrapped beginning in 1949.|$|E

One Bf109 from II./JG 27 and another from III./JG 53 force-landed, the pilots wounded, {{probably}} by 41 Squadron. Two Ju88s from 9./KG 4 were damaged by anti-aircraft fire over the Thames Estuary, with one crew member killed and seven wounded.

25|$|Another more {{plausible}} theory from foreign experts, also favored by Pakistan, {{is that the}} explosive shock waves {{from one of the}} depth charges set off the torpedoes and mines (some of which may have been armed for laying) stored aboard the submarine. The Navy NHQ counter-argued: Ghazi itself may have inadvertently passed over the mines during the <b>mine</b> <b>laying</b> operations; patrolling Indian vessels or Indian depth charges might also have tripped the count mechanism of one or more mines. Credibility is added to this story by the later discovery made by Indian Coast Guard divers in 2003, that the damaged parts of the submarine had been blown inside out.|$|E
