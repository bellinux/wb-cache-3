2500|$|The new {{government}} under Dimitrios Gounaris {{prepared for a}} plebiscite on the return of King Constantine. Noting the King's neutrality during World War I, the Allies warned the Greek government that if he {{should be returned to}} the throne they would cut off all financial and military aid to Greece [...] A month later a plebiscite called for the return of King Constantine. Soon after his return, the King replaced <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> War I veteran officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions. The leadership of the campaign was given to Anastasios Papoulas, while King Constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command. In addition, many of the remaining Venizelist officers resigned, appalled by the regime change. The Greek Army which had secured Smyrna and the Asia Minor coast was purged of Venizelos's supporters while it marched on Ankara.|$|E

6000|$|Clarinda, my life, {{you have}} wounded my soul. Can I {{think of your}} being unhappy, even though it be not {{described}} in your pathetic elegance of language, without being miserable? Clarinda, can I bear to be told from you that you [...] "will not see me to-morrow night"--that you [...] "wish the hour of parting were come?" [...] Do not let us impose on ourselves by sounds. If {{in the moment of}} tender endearment I perhaps trespassed against the letter of decorum's law I appeal even to you whether I ever sinned in the very least degree against the spirit of her strictest statute. But why, my love, talk to me in such strong terms?--every word of which cuts me to the very soul. You know a hint, the slightest signification of your wish is to me a sacred command. Be reconciled, my angel, to your God, yourself, and me: and I pledge you Sylvander's honour--an oath I daresay you will trust without reserve--that you shall never more have reason to complain of his conduct. Now, my love, do not wound our next meeting with any averted looks or restrained caresses. I have marked the line of conduct, a line I know exactly to your taste, and which I will inviolably keep; but do not you shew the least inclination to make boundaries. Seeming distrust where you know you may confide is a cruel sin against sensibility. [...] "Delicacy, you know, it was, which won me to you at once--take care you do not loosen the dearest, most sacred tie that unites us." [...] Clarinda, I would not have stung your soul, I would not have bruised your spirit, as that harsh, crucifying [...] "Take Care" [...] did mine--no, not to have gained Heaven! Let me again appeal to your dear self, if Sylvander, even when he seemingly half-transgressed the laws of decorum, if he did not shew more chastened trembling, faltering delicacy than the <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> do in keeping these laws? ...|$|E

60|$|Ans. For a {{reply to}} {{the first part of}} this argument, go back to the answer to the seventh. Now that none have put on Christ in Paul's sense; yea, in a saving, in the best sense; but them that have, as you would have them, gone into water, will be hard for you to prove, yea, is ungodly for you to assert. Your {{comparing}} water baptism to a gentleman's livery, by which his name is known to be his, is fantastical. Go you but ten doors from where men have knowledge of you, and see how <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> or Christians, will know you by this goodly livery, to be one that hath put on Christ. What! known by water baptism to be one that hath put on Christ, as a gentleman's man is known to be his master's servant, by the gay garment his master gave him. Away fond man, you do quite forget the text. 'By THIS shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another' (John 13:35). That baptism is in itself obliging, to speak properly, it is false, for set it by itself, and it stands without the stamp of heaven upon it, and without its signification also: and how, as such, it should be obliging, I see not. Where you insinuate, it comes in the room of, and obligeth as circumcision: you say, you know not what (Acts 15:1,2). Circumcision was the initiating ordinance, but this you have denied to baptism. Further, circumcision then bound men to the whole obedience of the law, when urged by the false apostles, and received by an erroneous conscience (Gal 5:1-4). Would you thus urge water baptism! would you have men to receive it with such consciences? Circumcision in the flesh, was a type of circumcision in the heart, and not of water baptism (Rom 2:28,29; Phil 3:3).|$|E
