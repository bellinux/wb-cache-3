As of March 2017, in just over five years since its first batch of students graduated in 2011, the school has won 21 championships and 20 first-runner-up titles in international moot competitions, in addition to 12 national round championships (including four Jessup national titles in the last five years). It set a world record of eight international moot finals in a single season in 2014/15 (winning a world record five), a feat it bettered in 2015/16 when it reached nine international moot finals. It also became the first university in the history of international moots to successfully defend a major moot international title when it won back-to-back championships in the ICC moot in 2015 and 2016; it became the second university to do the same when it won back-to-back championships in the Price moot in 2016 and 2017.

40|$|AbstractThe {{goals of}} this paper have been to explore and define the {{advantages}} of resolving <b>maritime</b> disputes through <b>arbitration</b> compared to their settlement in state courts, to emphasise the importance of <b>arbitration</b> in resolving <b>maritime</b> disputes, to encourage the parties to settle maritime disputes in this way, and to determine and quantify {{the values of the}} most relevant variables of the information model for resolving maritime disputes by means of arbitration versus state courts through the period 2008 - 2018. The research proves that arbitration clearly presents a faster, more creative and cost-efficient way of settling maritime disputes when compared to judicial proceedings. The advantages also include practical and economical aspects, flexibility and confidentiality. Due to these advantages, arbitration becomes the principal means of resolving disputes in maritime trade. Quantification of the values of the main variables of the information model for the period 2008 - 2018 proves that it is more beneficial to the parties involved in maritime issues to settle their disputes through arbitration than before state courts...|$|R

40|$|On April 27, 2010, the United States Supreme Court {{decided a}} case that will have {{far-reaching}} implications for virtually all sectors within the arbitration industry, including {{the subject of this}} article-maritime arbitration. The question presented in Stolt-Nielsen v. AnimalFeeds International Corp. dealt with class arbitration and whether its imposition on parties whose arbitration clauses are silent on that issue is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). This article will primarily examine the history and viability of class arbitration-and arbitration in general-in the far more narrow context of maritime and the admiralty. Stolt-Nielsen provides an excellent backdrop against which to explore the more maritime-specific aspects of the topic, an endeavor not often undertaken by the Court or legal scholars. Part II will briefly expound on the facts before the Court in Stolt-Nielsen. Part III will explore the rich and fabled history of maritime law and dispute resolution, and the benefits derived from submitting <b>maritime</b> disputes to <b>arbitration</b> rather than litigation. Part IV will focus briefly on the history of class arbitration and recent trends in the field. Part V will attempt to synthesize the various arguments made by the parties as to whether class arbitration should apply in maritime disputes regardless of contractual silence or express inclusion.

50|$|After {{earning his}} Ph.D. in 1961, he {{immediately}} {{went to work}} for Union Carbide Corporation. He spent the next 39 years there, retiring in 2000. His career at Union Carbide was multi-dimensional: he did fundamental research in organic chemistry in an industrial setting, contributing to Union Carbide’s research and development program through his scientific innovations. His early work involved the vinyl acetate process, research on rhodium and acrylic acid work. He served as a technical witness for Union Carbide in lawsuits involving <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration,</b> industrial accidents, and participated with the firm’s attorneys in intellectual property development. He was innovative {{in the development of a}} method of producing vinyl acetate without halide, and later benzyl acetate, acrylic acid, and rhodium triphenylphosphite in the oxo process. Union Carbide recognized his leadership skills as he was on the selection team for new chemists, mentored them throughout their careers and was instrumental in implementing continuing education programs for all employees. He received numerous promotions and was the youngest Union Carbide appointment to Senior Corporate Fellow. He won the prestigious Union Carbide Chairman’s award three times. He is listed as inventor on more than 90 U.S. patents. Some thirteen of these were filed after his retirement from Union Carbide. During his career at Union Carbide, he pursued approximately thirty-five different processes, nine of which reached commercial operation.

40|$|<b>Maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> {{has been}} a practiced method of dispute {{resolution}} since remote times, particularly in Ancient Greece. During the Middle Ages {{the application of the}} lex maritima among seaborne traders resulted in a wide use of arbitration, as demonstrated by the provisions contained in the statutes of some Italian communes. In the following centuries arbitration remained quite popular until its definitive achievement in parallel with the rise of international uniform law. <b>Maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> belongs to the genus of international commercial arbitration but it differs from the general model for a number of reasons, which make it somehow “special”: from the sources of law, to the kind of arbitrated disputes, to the characteristics of the maritime arbitral proceedings. Nowadays arbitration is widely used among international shipping operators to solve almost every kind of dispute and, consequently, arbitral clauses are included in many maritime contract forms. This is due to its remarkable advantages over litigation, such as flexibility, specialization, confidentiality and, more generally, possibility for the parties to determine every aspect of the procedure according to their needs. However, despite such benefits, there are some drawbacks and issues which affect contemporary arbitration and whose consequence is the increasing popularity of other mechanisms of dispute resolution, such as negotiation and mediation. In order to successfully defend its leading role in the next decades, <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> (and in particular London <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration)</b> will necessarily have to make some changing, overcoming the proverbial reluctance to innovation of the maritime industry...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} ancient and most practiced -until nowadays- forms of {{international}} commercial arbitration is International <b>Maritime</b> <b>Arbitration.</b> Despite its history and importance for world trade, very little literature and academic research has been produced on this matter. The article explore in a critical manner singularities existing as regards the validity of arbitration agreements, {{the role played by}} arbitrators, the arbitration institutions, the organization of arbitration, among some others. Final considerations over the development of electronic <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> are presented advocating the need of a reform of the existing legal framework. More broadly, globalisation and cyberspace/electronic technology are two factors advancing mobility and changeability into societies' life, including the maritime one, as expressed by new norms incorporating new values and this means that the rule of law has to keep pace with such a mobility. The interaction of societies in maritime trade causes changes ultimately in society's life as a whole, changes which have to be endorsed by the rule of law. For all these reasons, existence of formal and informal dispute systems is fundamental for the understanding and existence {{of the rule of law}} because both systems of dispute resolution contribute into the shaping of its content. This paper thus covers some reflections over the role of <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> in the development of the rule of law on the sea...|$|E
40|$|The sea lies {{all about}} us. The {{commerce}} of all lands must cross it. The very winds that move over the lands have been cradled on its broad expanse and seek ever {{to return to}} it. The continents themselves dissolve and pass to the sea, in grain after grain of eroded land. So the rains that rose from it return again in rivers. In its mysterious past it encompasses all the dim origins of life and receives in the end, after, it may be, many transmutations, the dead husks of that same life. For all at last returns to the sea-to Oceanus, the ocean river, like the ever-flowing stream of time, {{the beginning and the}} end. Since the dawn of humanity, the sea {{has been a source of}} sustenance, providing food and avenues of trade. The earliest civilizations used the sea as an avenue to search for wealth in the form of spices, minerals, and other natural resources. The search for natural resources and wealth resulted in the establishment of the maritime industry that would continue in some form or another until the present. The long history of the the maritime industry is dotted with both success and disputes. In the maritime industry, arbitration has served as a common tool for the settlement of disputes for several decades. In the past, the large amount of informal personal contact, the limited number of people, and the concentration of the shipping industry in New York led to an atmosphere conducive to the amicable resolution of disputes before 2 ̆ 2 dreaded lawyers 2 ̆ 2 could become involved. Presently, the shipping industry is no longer made up of a small number of people or concentrated in one state. This results in a loss of the close personal contact that facilitated arbitration in the past. These changes in the shipping industry led to the immediate consultation of lawyers as a necessity when problems arise, and the continued presence of lawyers through the resolution of those problems. Despite any changes, <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> remains a popular way to resolve maritime disputes that arise, in part because of the often lower costs involved and the ability to mold the process to the needs of the parties involved. <b>Maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> is most often the result of an arbitration clause in a contract, in which case, the clause controls. The clause may contain provisions pertaining to the site of arbitration, the procedures to be followed in arbitration, the makeup of the arbitral tribunal, and the remedies available. Part I of this Article discusses the availability of interim measures in maritime arbitrations. Part II of this Article examines the treatment of forum selection clauses under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. Part III of this Article focuses on the choice of law selection in maritime arbitrations. Part IV discusses damage awards in maritime arbitrations. Part V concludes that while many areas of <b>maritime</b> <b>arbitration</b> have evolved over time to facilitate maritime arbitrations, other areas have not. Punitive damage awards must become a recognized weapon in the arsenal of arbitral panels where applicable and, more importantly, the evaluation of the validity of foreign forum selection clauses must go to the fundamental fairness of the applicable law, not only to the costs involved...|$|E
