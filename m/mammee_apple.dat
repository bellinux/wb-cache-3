50|$|The <b>mammee</b> <b>apple</b> is a berry, {{though it}} is often misinterpreted to be a drupe. It is round or {{slightly}} irregular, with a brown or grey-brown 3 mm thick rind. In fact, the rind consists of the exocarp and mesocarp of the fruit, while the pulp is formed from the endocarp. The stem is thick and short. The <b>mammee</b> <b>apple</b> has more or less visible floral remnant at the apex.|$|E
50|$|Eau Creole is a liqueur {{from the}} {{distillation}} {{of the flowers}} of the <b>mammee</b> <b>apple</b> with spirits of wine.|$|E

50|$|The tree {{comes from}} {{tropical}} South America. In 1529, it was included by Oviedo in his Review of the Fruits of the New World. It was then introduced to various {{regions in the}} Old World: West Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, Zanzibar, Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In the United States, the species is uniquely found in Hawaii and Florida. In the latter state, <b>mammee</b> <b>apples</b> were probably introduced from the Bahamas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mammee</b> <b>Apple</b> - It {{is often}} used to make syrup-based {{preserves}} and desserts, although, when very ripe, it is also eaten raw. It is indigenous to America and was already acclimated to Puerto Rico at the time of Christopher Columbus' arrival.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the fruits}} of Peru's jungle is the camu camu, which {{contains}} 40 times more vitamin C than the kiwifruit. Non-native fruits such as mango and pineapple and star apple are also in abundance, {{as well as other}} jungle fruits like, <b>mammee</b> <b>apple,</b> cherimoya, guanabana, taperiva, copoazu, dry fruits like the aguaje and the hungurahui.|$|E
5000|$|Mammea americana, {{commonly}} known as mammee, <b>mammee</b> <b>apple,</b> mamey, mamey apple, Santo Domingo apricot, tropical apricot, or South American apricot, is an evergreen tree of the family Calophyllaceae, whose fruit is edible. It has also been classified as belonging to the family Guttiferae Juss. (1789), {{which would make it}} a relative of the mangosteen ...|$|E
50|$|The Lucayans grew {{root crops}} and hunted, fished and {{gathered}} wild foods. The staple crop of the Lucayans was manioc (cassava). The Spanish {{reported that the}} Tainos also grew sweet potatoes, cocoyams, arrowroot, leren, yampee, peanuts, beans and cucurbits, and the Lucayans probably took most, if not all, of those crops {{with them to the}} Bahamas. Maize was a recent introduction to the Greater Antilles when the Spanish arrived, and was only a minor component of the Taino and, presumably, Lucayan diets. The Lucayans may have grown papayas, pineapples, guava, <b>mammee</b> <b>apple,</b> guinep and tamarind fruit.|$|E
50|$|Successful topical {{treatments}} {{also include}} cryotherapy and electrodesiccation of the lesion. If formaldehyde, chloroform, or DDT are used topically, {{care should be}} taken when dealing with the resulting morbidity. The T. penetrans flea can also be suffocated using occlusive petrolatum, while Vaseline will kill the organism as well, most likely due to suffocation as the stigmatas would be covered. The gum of the <b>mammee</b> <b>apple</b> (Mammea americana), a fruit that also {{goes by the name}} Saint Domingo apricot, has also been used to kill the chigoe flea, though this has not been reported in the main T. penetrans literature.|$|E
5000|$|The Los Angeles Times {{reported}} in 1971 that Thomson {{was able to}} grow 96 separate types of fruit between his two orchards in Bonsall and Edgehill. Most of these fruits had not been widely grown in the United States before Thomson planted them on his properties. Thomson grew the first successful <b>Mammee</b> <b>apple</b> crop, {{also known as the}} South American apricot or the mamey, of note in California. He also ran the only longan orchard in the United States at the time. A friend of Thomson, Jim Neitzel, said that his Edgehill farm soon attracted the attention of other botanists and tropical fruit enthusiasts. [...] "His Edgehill property was the biggest feather in his cap. People would {{come from all over the}} state to check it out." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{old-growth forest}} on Mount Sage is noted to be [...] "untouched {{since the time}} of Columbus". Typical of rainforests, flora {{includes}} the [...] "stinking fish" [...] or bullet wood (Mimusops elengi), Caribbean and Honduras mahogany trees (Swietenia mahogoni, and S. macrophylla). Other flora found within the park are guavaberry, large patches of moss, epiphytes or air plants, elephant ear vine (philodendron), fig tree, white [...] "cedar" [...] (not actually a cedar but a flowering tree, Tabebuia heterophylla), a West Indian species of tree fern, manilkara, and mountain guava (Psidium amplexicaule). Groves of <b>mammee</b> <b>apple</b> (Mammea americana) and heliconia trees are also recorded along the entrance path of the park. Some of the ferns, flowers, and vines which grow in the park are not found elsewhere on Tortola.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} manioc cassava was the easily grown staple crop of the Maya {{and that}} maize was revered because it was prestigious and harder to grow. This proposal {{was based on the}} inability of maize to meet the nutritional needs of densely populated Maya areas. Manioc can meet those needs. Because tuberous manioc rarely survives in the archaeological record, evidence for this view has been lacking, although recent finds in volcanic ash at the southern Maya site of Joya de Cer√©n in El Salvador may be such evidence.Several different varieties of beans were grown, including pinto, red and black beans. The ancient Maya also relied on tree cropping for access to foods such as tomato, chili peppers, avocado, breadnut, guava, soursop, <b>mammee</b> <b>apple,</b> papaya, pineapple, pumpkin, sweet potato, and Xanthosoma. Chaya was cultivated for its green leaves. Chayote was cultivated for its fruit, and its tender green shoots were used as a vegetable. Various herbs were grown and used, including vanilla, epazote, achiote (and the annatto seed), Canella, Hoja santa (Piper auritum), avocado leaves, garlic vine, Mexican oregano, and allspice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sweet potato}} {{is native to}} America and was domesticated there at least 5,000 years ago. The much lower {{molecular}} diversity found in Peru and Ecuador. Only two varieties of sweet potato are commonly available {{for sale in the}} markets [...] But there are more varieties around the country. One has dry orange flesh and light tan skin and tastes sweet. The other has purple skin, is white and brown inside, and is only moderately sweet. Occasionally another variety, characterized by small tubers and dark skin, is available. Potatoes are available in a big variety. Peru has around more than 5000 varieties of potatoes, the biggest on the world. The two most common potatoes are a white flesh type and a more expensive yellow flesh type. The only commercially available native fruits native to the Andes region in general (Peru, Bolivia) are lucuma, camu camu, prickly pear, cape gooseberry, cocona, pacay (technically a legume but used as a fruit), guanabana, dragon fruit, pepino, papaya, ciruela, <b>mammee</b> <b>apple,</b> banana passionfruit, cherimoya, granadilla, moriche palm fruit, and tamarillo. Yacon, although an underground tuber, is also used as a fruit. None of the other native fruits are commercially available.|$|E
