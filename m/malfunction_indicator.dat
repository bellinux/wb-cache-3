5000|$|The {{oxygen sensor}} {{is the basis}} of the {{closed-loop}} control system on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with OBD II, a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O2 levels. The O2 levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements.

Simultaneously, all 1996 and later model year passenger cars, light- and medium-duty trucks sold in California will be equipped with an On-Board Diagnostic (OBDII) system. This system is designed to monitor critical emission related components and activate a <b>Malfunction</b> <b>Indicator</b> Light (MIL) when a failure or a drift in calibration is likely to cause emissions to exceed 1. 5 times the vehicle certification standards. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} ascertain what percentage of the emission benefits are attributable to either I&M or OBDII in order to assist regulators in making near term programmatic decisions.

40|$|California Air Resources Board {{emissions}} {{regulations for}} 2013 require that heavy duty diesel on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) systems light the <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamp if tailpipe nonmethane hydrocarbon levels are ever greater than 2. 0 times the legal limit, {{or if the}} catalyst in the catalyzed diesel particulate filter (CDPF) is no longer active with respect to NMHC. This study focused on the serial diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) to CDPF aftertreatment system found on Cummins ISB products and detecting when the CDPF is no longer catalytically active. Investigation into catalyst aging showed no statistically significant trends as a filter aged from degreened to effectively end of useful life. Light-off temperature shift {{was chosen as the}} method to be used to detect catalyst activity. An aged CDPF has a light-off temperature more than 50 °C higher than a degreened CDPF, but also loses its ability to light- off easily at low flowrates, despite crossing what would otherwise be considered its light-off temperature. Using light-off temperature shift as a diagnostic method on this system requires CDPF light-off independent of DOC light-off. Ultimately, the proposed diagnostic strategy 2 ̆ 7 s solution space is exceedingly small: ISB engine power levels below 43 hp. Testing at highway speed and load, idle, and in the OBD solution space never produced independent CDPF light-off; spatially nonuniform DOC bed temperature distributions always caused the DOC to light-off before the CDPF. Cool- down times to drop the DOC below its light-off temperature to attempt independent CDPF light-off are too long to allow this to remain a viable detection strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|New {{legislations}} {{are constantly}} arising in Europe that puts stringent {{restrictions on the}} emissions coming from heavy-duty vehicles. The latest one is the Euro VI that has tough limits on both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). To be {{able to cope with}} these tough limits, many developers of heavy-duty trucks have chosen to mount an after-treatment system after the engine containing several different catalysts. The emissions are monitored by an On-Board Diagnosis (OBD) system during operation, and if the emissions are too high a <b>Malfunction</b> <b>Indicator</b> (MI) lamp is lit and the truck needs to be serviced in a workshop. In the workshop the fault is investigated, which could be caused by several things, one of which may be a performance loss of one of the catalysts. This master thesis investigates different methods for testing the performance of two of these catalysts. The catalysts that were investigated was the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) that oxidizes hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen monoxide (NO), and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) that uses ammonia for the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx). A comprehensive literature study was made to get an insight in how the current system works {{and to be able to}} develop concepts for future workshop methods. From the literature study, three concepts were developed for each catalyst. These concepts were tested out on Scania’s 13 litre 6 -cylinder Euro VI engine with Scania’s Euro VI after-treatment system. The concepts are mainly consisting of three measuring principles that investigates the changes in temperature, NOx-conversion and ammonia storage. The tests resulted in that one concept per catalyst could be used to isolate and measure the performance. The performance of the DOC could be measured with the increase of temperature due to the exothermal reaction when HC is injected into the catalyst, called Measurement of HC-slip. To be able to measure the performance of the SCR, the changes in the maximum ammonia storage that the catalyst could achieve during an ammonia sweep was used, called Measurement of ammonia storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.
