40|$|Glatiramer acetate (GA), {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in Copaxone 1, is a complex mixture of polypeptides used {{for the treatment of}} relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Glatiramoids are related mixtures that may differ in some characteristics of the prototype molecule. Our aim is to describe the long-term toxicity studies with protiramer (TV- 5010), a new glatiramoid, in comparison with similar studies conducted with GA. The toxicity of twice-weekly subcutaneous injections of protiramer to Sprague-Dawley rats (twenty-six weeks) and cynomolgus monkeys (fifty-two weeks) was com-pared with similar studies done with daily subcutaneous injections of GA. Daily treatment with GA was safe and well tolerated, without systemic effects or death. Protiramer administration was not as well tolerated as GA and led to dose- and time-related mortalities, probably mediated through severe injection-site lesions both in rats and in <b>monkeys.</b> <b>Bridging</b> fibrosis in the liver and severe progressive nephropathy were seen in rats. A dose-related increase in eosinophils was observed in monkeys. The protiramer toxicity studies show that minor variations in the manufacturing of glatiramoids may lead to significant toxic effects. It is therefore essential that the safety of any new glatiramoid be studied in long-term preclinical studies before exposing humans...|$|R

Then, after a delay, a test object was presented. If the test object was the object associated with the sample during training (i. e., its target), they had to release a lever. <b>Monkeys</b> could <b>bridge</b> the delay by remembering the sample (a sensory-related code) and/or thinking ahead to the expected target (a prospective code). Examination of the monkeys’ behavior suggested that they were relying on a prospective code. During and shortly after sample presentation, neural activity in the lateral PF cortex primarily reflected the sample. Toward {{the end of the}} delay, however, PF activity began to reflect the anticipated target, which indicated a prospective code. These results provide further confirmation that PF cortex does not simply buffer incoming visual inputs, but instead selectively processes information relevant to current behavioral demands, even when this information must be recalled from long-term memory...|$|R

40|$|Research {{in recent}} decades has {{suggested}} {{the existence of a}} dedicated brain network devoted to the organization and execution of grasping, {{one of the most important}} and skilled movements of primates. Grasping an object requires the transformation of intrinsic object properties such as size, orientation, and shape into an appropriate motor scheme shaping the hand. Although electrophysiological recordings in the monkey model have proven invaluable for gaining insights into the neuronal substrate underlying this complex behavior, knowledge concerning the existence and organization of a similar system in the human brain is derived mainly from imaging studies. Here, we present for the first time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity while macaque monkeys performed reaching and grasping movements in a 3 tesla MR scanner. Grasping in the dark (compared with reaching) yielded significant activations in anterior intraparietal area and ventral premotor area F 5, in addition to area PFG in the rostral inferior parietal lobule, somatosensory areas (SI, SII, area 5), and the hand field of F 1. Whole-brain macaque fMRI motor studies will be instrumental in establishing possible homologies concerning grasping organization in the human and <b>monkey</b> brains, <b>bridging</b> the gap between human imaging and monkey electrophysiology. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Functional MR imaging in <b>monkeys</b> {{promises}} a <b>bridge</b> between brain research in humans {{and the large}} body of systems neuroscience work in animals. Prerequisite for successful interspecies-comparisons, however, is a profound understanding of the neural events underlying the hemodynamic responses. Combined physiology and neuroimaging experiments made {{the first step in}} this direction by examining directly the relationship of cell activity to the BOLD signal [1]. The tight coupling between regional neural activity and blood flow, however, suggests that perfusion-based MRI may improve even further the electrophysiological investigations of the neurovascular coupling, as perfusion imaging measures cerebral blood flow (CBF) directly at the capillary level. Moreover, CBF changes and interleaved-acquired BOLD data can be combined to compute changes in oxygen consumption rate. Obtaining functional CBF maps with high spatial resolution is challenging, because the CBF signal is intrinsically low and the signal-to-noise ratio is critical. Here we report the first high-resolution CBF maps that were obtained with voxel sizes as small as 0. 5 x 0. 5 x 3 mm 3 in the Macaca mulatta. High sensitivity was achieved by using a high magnetic field scanner and custom-made RF combination-coil designs. CBF maps and functional CBF data were acquired and compared with BOLD data in the macaque primary visual cortex...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) {{allows for}} a systems level {{assessment}} of the functional effect of drugs, which, while commonly understood at the synaptic level, are often poorly understood on larger scales. Currently, phMRI is most commonly employed in rodent studies (Marota et al. 2000, Febo et al. 2004) with some exceptions in anesthetized non-human primates (e. g. Jenkins et al. 2004). Since monkeys are genetically and neuro-anatomically more similar to humans, phMRI in <b>monkeys</b> offers a <b>bridge</b> between rodent and human neuropharmacological investigations. We applied a contrast-agent enhanced phMRI paradigm to study the effect of intravenous cocaine infusions on CBV changes throughout the brain of 4 awake behaving monkeys (GE-EPI, 1 mm isotropic voxels; 2000 ms TR). In the first experiment, animals performed a visual fixation task during six 30 -minute long fMRI runs. After 5 minutes 0. 1 mg/kg of cocaine was injected in each run. We simultaneously recorded eye position and pupil diameter during the scans. We used the pupil diameter as a regressor-of-interest in a first-level analysis. We then used these results in a very stringent second-level analysis across runs. At corrected level (FWE 0. 05) strong fMRI deactivations (decreased CBV) {{were present in the}} basal ganglia, somato-motor cortex and VTA, while no activations (increased CBV) could be observed. These results are in strong contrast to rat studies showing increased cocaine-induced fMRI activity (increased CBV) in these regions (Marota et al. 2000, Febo et al. 2004). As the second-level analysis is highly conservative, we also examined the fMRI activity at uncorrected level (UC 0. 001). At this lower threshold, we observed bilateral activations in orbito-frontal (area 12 o) and anterior cingulate cortex (24 b and 24 c). In a second experiment (n= 2), we assessed the dose-response curve using the same experimental protocol but injecting 0. 03 mg/kg, 0. 06 mg/kg, 0. 12 mg/kg, 0. 25 mg/kg, or 0. 5 mg/kg cocaine. All cocaine doses activated or deactivated similar regions as in experiment 1, yet the extent and level of activity increased with increasing cocaine doses. In addition, the degree of pupil dilation also proved to be dose-dependent. The present results show that awake monkey phMRI can be used to reliably determine regions modulated by cocaine and that these modulations vary in a dose-dependent manner. Intravenous cocaine injections induce changes in functional activity in the monkey which are, to a large extent, opposite in polarity compared to those observed in rat. These results reaffirm the importance of the monkey as a necessary model linking rodent and human pharmacological research. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} myth, dreams, and historical trauma within the genre of the Asian North American female bildungsroman. In an attempt to redefine the contested genre of the ethnic bildungsroman, this study analyzes three novels by Asian American and Asian Canadian female authors: Cecilia Manguerra Brainard 2 ̆ 7 s When the Rainbow Goddess Wept (1991), Joy Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan (1981), and Lan Cao 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Monkey</b> <b>Bridge</b> (1997). Each of these novels is an ethnic bildungsroman that highlights the identity formation of a female protagonist {{in the midst of}} historical trauma. This study focuses on the ways in which these texts resist the conventions of the European bildungsroman through the factors of myth, dreams, and historical trauma. While Philippine folklore is the vehicle through which protagonist Yvonne matures in Brainard 2 ̆ 7 s When the Rainbow Goddess Wept, dreams and childhood tales in Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan enable protagonist Naomi to develop and reconnect with her lost mother. Similarly, in Cao 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Monkey</b> <b>Bridge,</b> protagonist Mai uses the Vietnamese legend of the Trung sisters to develop a transnational identity and reconnect with her mother and motherland. In all three of these novels, myths and dreams function as alternative spaces of development that interrupt the immediate trauma of the texts. Myth, dreams, and trauma are thus integral to the project of redefining the Asian North American female bildungsroman...|$|E
40|$|To Vietnamese Americans, {{the past}} {{has much to do}} with the Vietnam War, a “failed war ” in the eyes of most Americans. However, whether the stories and {{experiences}} were told from the right or the left, they were, almost without exception, from an American perspective. What motivated Lan Cao to write <b>Monkey</b> <b>Bridge</b> was a desire to provide an alternative view of the Vietnam War and its consequences from a Vietnamese, or rather, a Vietnamese American perspective. This paper offers a case study by focusing on Cao’s critically acclaimed debut novel which appeared more than two decades after the Vietnam War ended. Part I characterizes the author as a 1. 5 generation Vietnamese American and highlights her attempt to negotiate personal and collective pasts via novel writing. Part II discusses the mother-daughter relationship in the novel and how each tried to make sense of what had led her to the situation she found herself in by way of their different narratives. Part III elaborates on the daughter’s role as a cultural translator and her strategy not only of survival, but also of success in the New World. Part IV further discusses how the mother and the daughter confront the past in their respective ways—not only to make sense of it, but also to reconcile themselves with it...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the memories of}} traumatic experiences held by major characters in two contemporary Vietnamese American novels: Lan Cao’s <b>Monkey</b> <b>Bridge</b> and Le Thi Diem Thuy’s The Gangster We Are All Looking For. Because the parents who experienced trauma during the Vietnam War refuse to share their haunting pasts with the coming-of-age narrators who are maturing in the United States, both narrators feel suffocated by a very palpable conspiracy of silence, and eventually they must find release from their parents’ traumatic and haunting pasts {{in order to create}} a new subjectivity for themselves in a new homeland—a subjectivity that characterizes the “ 1. 5 generation” Vietnamese American consciousness. Both narrators possess memories and experiences of childhood, very early in Vietnam and then later in the United States. This combination of influences significantly informs their self-perception and their on-going construction of personal identity. This personal identity must be forged out of a sense of uncertainty, disorientation, confusion, and alienation felt during childhood and adolescence spent with parents who themselves were making the painful transition from a heartbreaking war to its trying aftermath. The narrators’new identity, achieved at the end of both novels, suggests optimism for the development of both personal, or individual, and collective, or community, identity, which is taking shape at the cultural crossroads between Vietnam and America and the historical crossroads between war and postwar eras...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, {{scholarship}} across disciplines has employed the "ghostly" as critical lens {{for understanding the}} upheavals of modernity. The ghost stands metaphorically for the lasting trace {{of what has been}} erased, whether bodies or histories. The ghost always stands for something, rather than the ghost simply is [...] a conception in keeping with dominant Western rationalism. But such a reading practice threatens the very sort of violent erasure it means to redress, uncovering lost histories at the expense of non-Western and "minority" ways of knowing. What about the ghost as ghost? What about the array of non-rational knowledges out of which the ghostly frequently emerges? This project seeks to transform the application of the ghostly as scholarly lens, bringing to bear Foucault's notion of "popular" knowledges and drawing from Asian American studies and critical mixed race studies frameworks. Its timeline begins with the 1965 Immigration Act and traces across the 1970 s to 1990 s rise of multiculturalism and the 1980 s to 2000 s rise of the Multiracial Movement. For field of analysis, the project turns to Asian American literature and its rich evocations of the ghostly and compulsory rationalism, in particular Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior and China Men, Amy Tan's The Hundred Secret Senses, Nora Okja Keller's Comfort Woman, Lan Cao's <b>Monkey</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Heinz Insu Fenkl's Memories of My Ghost Brother, Shawna Yang Ryan's Water Ghosts, and Ruth Ozeki's A Tale for the Time Being. It outlines a new reading strategy, a new means of conceiving of both Asian American literature and existing "spectral" scholarship as cultural productions. It also addresses a dimension of American history and lived reality that scholarship to date has not only ignored but actively suppressed. And insofar as the reach of "spectral" scholarship extends well beyond Asian American communities and Asian American studies [...] across an interdisciplinary net of subjects, a cross-cultural set of histories [...] this project is a necessary corrective with a wide scope of consequence for scholarly practice more generally. What it offers is an alternative approach, an alternative vision, reaching for a progressive politics of the ghostly...|$|E
