40|$|Metastasis is {{the main}} cause of death from solid cancer. The {{dissemination}} of cancer cells from a primary tumour is a very complex process that involves many steps and cells must overcome many obstacles to colonize distant organs. The tumour microenvironment influences the mode and the dynamics of invasion of cancer cells. Cancer cells have the ability to adapt to distinct environmental conditions in order to stay motile. Invasive cancer cells form membrane protrusions called invadopodia that are able to degrade extracellular matrix. The formation of invadopodia by cancer cells is interconnected to the production of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). <b>Metastasizing</b> <b>tumour</b> cells use MMPs to break through extracellular matrix barriers and migrate in dense matrix. Both invadopodia formation and MMPs secretion is crucial for the degradation of the extracellular matrix. The most important is the membrane bound MMP- 14 (MT 1 -MMP) and soluble MMP- 2 and MMP- 9. The invasive structures of tumour cells and the proteolytic enzymes in 2 D environment is well described.

Significantly differentially expressed genes were retrieved from four reported microarray expression profiles comparing pN 0 and pN+ head-neck tumours, and one expression array identifying functionally hypermethylated genes. Additional metastasis-associated genes were included from the literature. Thus genes were selected that influence the development of nodal metastases and might be regulated by methylation. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) primers were designed and tested on 8 head-neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and technically validated on 10 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) OOSCC cases. Predictive value was assessed in a clinical series of 70 FFPE OOSCC with pathologically determined nodal status. Five out of 28 methylation markers (OCLN, CDKN 2 A, MGMT, MLH 1 and DAPK 1) were frequently differentially methylated in OOSCC. Of these, MGMT methylation was associated with pN 0 status (P = 0. 02) and with lower immunoexpression (P = 0. 02). DAPK 1 methylation was associated with pN+ status (P = 0. 008) but did not associate with protein expression. In conclusion, out of 28 candidate genes, two (7 %) showed a predictive value for the pN status. Both genes, DAPK 1 and MGMT, have predictive value for nodal metastasis in a clinical group of OOSCC. Therefore DNA methylation markers are capable of contributing to diagnosis and treatment selection in OOSCC.

Five distinct fractions (F 1 -F 5) were banded at densities 1 X 09, 1 X 13, 1 X 15, 1 X 17 and 1 X 21 at 25 degrees C, in addition to a pellet (F 6) obtained by centrifuging at 76, 000 g for 17 h. The fractions F 1 through F 5, all contained various concentrations of membranous structures, while the pellet (F 6) contained only amorphous materials as evidenced by electron microscopy. The F 3 fraction at the gradient 1 X 15 had the highest specific as well as total activity of the plasma membrane marker enzyme, with aggregates of the least contaminated plasma membranes in vesicular forms. This fraction also had the lowest specific activity for glucose- 6 -phosphatase (smooth ER marker) and for beta-D-glucuronidase (lysomal marker), and therefore was considered to be the "cleanest" plasma membrane fraction. When the activity of 4 additional plasma membrane marker enzymes, i. e., alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase I, nucleotide pyrophosphatase and alkaline ribonuclease was determined in the same F 3 fraction, their levels were significantly lower in every <b>metastasizing</b> <b>tumour</b> than in the non-metastasizing ones, with the enzyme activity decreasing in direct proportion to the metastasizing capacity.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Today all gall {{bladders}} {{that are}} removed are being routinely sent for histological examination regardless of suspicion for maligniancies or not. Gall bladder carcinoma (GBC) is a rare, but serious cancer type, {{mainly because of}} it’s lack of symptoms early in it’s progression. Most cancers of the gall bladder are often well progressed {{by the time of}} diagnosis. However, the amount of gall bladders that are being removed due to non-malignant conditions such as cholecystolithiasis far outweigh the number of carcinomas. The {{purpose of this study is}} if there’s any justification for routinely examining all gall bladders even though there’s no suspicion of malignancies and if it affect survival. Patients and methods: 3241 gall bladders were examined at Ullevål US and Ahus in the period from 2000 to 2007. 15 malignancies of the gall bladder were found. 2 of the patients with gall bladder carcinoma refused to participate in the study. Results: 5 GBC staged Tis were found, none T 1, one T 2, four T 3, three T 4. All the patients with Tis, the patient with T 2 and one of the patients with T 3 were alive 5 years after diagnosis was made. The remaining three with T 3 and the three with T 4 staged cancer all died within 5 years. The first suspicion of malignancy was made preoperatively in all but one of the patients with GBC staged T 2 -T 4. One of the T 4 cancers was first found during operation. The five GBC staged Tis was first found histologically. Conclusion/discussion: In this material, none of the patients benefitted from the routine examination of extirpated gall bladders. One of the problems is that this is a rare type of cancer and getting good estimates is hard. Other studies have found different distribution of the stages of cancer, but none have a big enough material to give clear cut conclusions. A study that had 117000 laparoscopic gall bladder operations and they were all examined afterwards, gave us a good estimate of how often this cancer is found first at histological examination. According to our numbers, the routine histological examination did not affect outcome in any patients. Following other studies, they don’t seem to have any significant effect. If we use the numbers from the huge european study, we would need to have to examine 1350 gall bladders in order to find one <b>metastasizing</b> <b>tumour.</b> The costs per finding varies between 200 000 NOK and 250 000 NOK, but the impact on survival is hard to assess due to the only study we found on this was fra 1981 - 1986. Overall, with modern diagnostics and awareness of this type of cancer, it would be safe to only send the gall bladders from patients fulfilling high risk criterias or when the surgeon suspects malignancy. The important part here is to be selective, but also have a low threshold seeing as histo-pathological examination is a fairly inexpensive procedure...|$|E

40|$|Summary Tumour cell adhesion, {{detachment}} and aggregation seem to play {{an important}} part in tumour invasion and metastasis, and numerous cell adhesion molecules are expressed by tumour cells. Several families of cell-cell adhesion molecules have been described, of which two groups are particularly well characterised, the cadherin family and the Ig superfamily member, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We investigated expression of these two adhesion molecule families in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and xenografts by immunoblotting. Nineteen tumours established from 15 patients with SCLC were examined. All tumours but one expressed both cadherin and NCAM. The tumours expressed one, two or rarely three cadherin bands, and different combinations of two major isoforms of NCAM with Mr'S of approximately 190, 000 and 135, 000. Polysialylation of NCAM, a feature characteristic of NCAM during embryonic development, which {{may play a role in}} connection with tumour invasion and metastasis, was found in 14 / 18 NCAM expressing SCLC tumours.

40|$|The {{invasion}} of lymphatic vessels by colorectal cancer (CRC) and its subsequent spread to draining lymph nodes {{is a key}} determinant of prognosis in this common and frequently fatal malignancy. Although tumoural lymphangiogenesis is assumed to contribute to this process, review of the current literature fails to support any notion of a simple correlation between lymphatic vessel density and CRC metastasis. Furthermore, attempts to correlate the expression of various lymphangiogenic growth factors, most notably VEGF-C and VEGF-D, with the lymphatic metastasis of CRC have provided contradictory results. Recent evidence from animal and human models of tumour metastasis suggests that complex functional and biochemical interactions between the microvasculature of tumours and other cell types within the tumour microenvironment may play {{a pivotal role in}} the behaviour of commonly <b>metastasizing</b> <b>tumours.</b> Indeed, previous insights into tumoural blood vessels have provided candidate markers of tumoural angiogenesis that are currently the subject of intense investigation as future therapeutic targets.

In particular, we also discuss some new and provocative insights into the properties of tumoural lymphatics suggesting that they have specific expression profiles distinct from those of normal lymphatic vessels and that appear to promote metastasis.

40|$|Summary. -This {{paper is}} aimed at {{investigating}} how metastatic tumour growth influenced the haemostatic system of the host. Blood platelet count, blood fibrinogen level, the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) were determined at various intervals during growth and metastasis of a murine fibrosarcoma (mFS 6) or one of its sublines with different metastatic capacity. Progressive thrombocytopenia and increase in fibrinogen level were observed during development of the tumour in all the animal groups studied, irrespective of the metastatic potential of the various sublines. No significant changes were observed in the PT or APTT values. These data support the concept that primary rather than metastatic growth influences the haemostatic system of tumour-bearing animals. NEOPLASTIC DISEASES are often accompanied by haemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic complications (Rasche & Dietrich, 1977; Donati & Poggi, 1980). The mechanism of the involvement of haemostatic factors in human neoplasia is, however, difficult to study, in view of the many interfering factors, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy which by themselves can modify the haemostatic system. Animal studies are therefore needed in this context. In a limited number of experimental tumours the host's haemostatic system has been followed during primary and metastatic growth. Among murine <b>metastasizing</b> <b>tumours,</b> the Lewis lung carcinoma (3 LL) and the JW sarcoma have been characterized from this viewpoint. Although they induced somewhat different types of coagulopathy in their recipients, both tumours were accompanied by marked thrombocytopenia and a gradual increase in blood fibrinogen level.

MAbs reacting with monocytes, but not tissue Mph, revealed a six-fold increase in monocytes in <b>metastasizing</b> C <b>tumours</b> compared to normal gut. The non-metastasizing B tumours could be divided into one group containing increased numbers of monocytes, and a second group comparable to control gut. T-cell numbers were increased in all tumour stages by an average 1. 4 -fold, which disguised the lack of consistent pattern in T-cell subset ratios in the tumour stromal tissue. However, in the tumour epithelium, there was a constant decrease in the Ts + c cell subset and a subsequent alteration in T-cell subset ratio in favour of Th + i cells. With the progression from Dukes' Stage B to C, there was an increase in the proportion of monocytes and T cells which were activated as detected by mAbs to the C 3 b receptor and IL- 2 receptor, respectively. These observations suggest that an immune response is in progress in these colorectal tumours and that it is most active in the <b>metastasizing</b> Dukes' C <b>tumours.</b> Whether this response is elicited by the tumour or other elements, whether it is detrimental to tumour growth, or whether it is actively assisting tumour growth and possibly dissemination, are matters of conjecture...|$|R
