50|$|Its roots can {{be ground}} into a fine powder {{which is used}} to protect stored grains. Methyl {{salicylate}} is a well-known plant stress signal which often has insect repellent properties. Methyl salicylate constitutes up to 90% of the volatile component of its roots, which is very uncommon in other grains or legume seeds. A mixture of methanol extract and methyl salicylate creates a very effective natural pesticide against weevils and other insects in stored grains. Studies done on grains such as corn and cowpea indicated that after 6 days of exposure to S. longipedunculata, the mortality rate of adult beetles was 100% in an enclosed jar. In addition, when S. longipedunculata powder was applied to grains already infested with weevils, the damage done to the grains was reduced by 65%. The beetles that are most likely to infest stored grains are Sitophilus zeamais (<b>Maize</b> <b>weevil),</b> Rhyzopertha dominica (Lesser grain borer), and Prostephanus truncatus (Larger grain borer). Studies suggest that the <b>Maize</b> <b>weevil</b> is able to detect the scent of methyl salicylate and tends to avoid it. It is a repellent for insects as well as a poison, which helps {{to reduce the number of}} female eggs in the grains. As this type of pesticide use is very efficient, it allows storage of the grains for at least 9 months. This discovery provides some small-scale farmers in Africa with a low cost, natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. In some developing countries, it is difficult for poor farmers to access good quality and affordable synthetic pesticides. In addition these can harm the environment if they are not properly implemented. Such indigenous practices require further validation.|$|E

As with broken and cracked kernels, mold damage is usually graded on a visual inspection basis, which can be subjective and have a large variation. Ng et al. used a machine vision method of evaluating mold damage by calculating the number of pixels in an image of grain included mold, and representing that as a fraction of the total surface area. Insect infestation, like that of the <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> can sometimes be easier to identify visually but difficult to quantify on a large scale.|$|E

40|$|The <b>maize</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitophilus zeamais, is one {{important}} pest of stored corn grain. It {{is difficult to}} control and causes large weight and nutritional losses to the grains. The discovery of the gene Opaque- 2 (O- 2) that enhances the protein quality with Lysine and Tryptophane opened new perspectives to use corn to feed monogastric animals and for human nutrition. However, the soft and farinaceous consistency of the endosperm in the O- 2 gene corn increased the susceptibility to <b>maize</b> <b>weevil.</b> To solve this problem the O- 2 gene was transferred to normal corn. This new corn was called Quality Protein Maize (QPM). The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate a selected group of corn genotypes for genetic resistance to <b>maize</b> <b>weevil.</b> A parameter named Index of Susceptibility (IS), which considers the progeny number in the F 1 generation and the time the insects take to mature from egg to adult was used to measure the susceptibility.

All six barrels were stored at 27 °C (81 °F) under non-hermetic conditions for 120 d, corresponding to approximately three weevil lifecycles. After 120 d, weevil population densities had increased to an average of 99 live weevils kg- 1 (45 live weevils lb- 1) in all six barrels. Three of the six barrels were subsequently hermetically sealed. After an additional 30 days (150 days since experiment start), the weevil population densities were zero in every hermetically sealed barrel (100 % mortality) and averaged 141 live weevils kg- 1 (64 Â live weevils lb- 1) in the non-hermetic barrels.

40|$|Individual traits vary among {{and within}} populations, and the co-occurrence of {{different}} endosymbiont species within a host may take place under varying endosymbiont loads in each individual host.

The <b>maize</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitophilus zeamais Motsch.

The impact of the lack of SZPE in <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> physiology is the impairment of nutrient acquisition and energy metabolism, while Wolbachia {{is an important factor in}} reproductive incompatibility.

In 2006 and 2007, aflatoxin contamination and insect damage were sampled before harvest in three 0. 4 -hectare corn fields using a grid sampling method. The feeding damage by each of ear/kernel-feeding insects (i. e., corn earworm/fall armyworm damage on the silk/cob, and discoloration of corn kernels by stink bugs), and <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> population were assessed at each grid point with five ears.

The bioassays also allowed the calculation of a concentration of insecticide {{that could be used to}} select for resistance in populations of unknown resistance. 12 field populations of the <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> were selected for resistance using this discriminating dose before being tested for the T 929 I allele using a taqman diagnostic assay. No individuals were found to carry the T 929 I allele, therefore suggesting it is no longer a problem in the field and this assay would not be a useful field tool. Two electrode voltage clamping (TEVC) on Xenopus oocytes expressing the T 929 V para VGSC mutation, found in the cat flea, showed that 1 µM permethrin was unable to illicit a tail current. Therefore this mutation conveys very high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, similar to that of the T 929 I mutation...|$|E
40|$|Maize, {{being an}} {{important}} agricultural crop {{and among the}} three most widely grown in the world, {{plays an important role}} in the livelihood of smallholder farmers contributing 34 - 36 % daily calorific intake in East Africa and 10 % in West Africa. In developing countries, population growth is expected to occur with increasing food demand. Conversely, maize experiences post-harvest losses (PHLS) especially from the <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitophilus zeamais), which if minimized, could help to reduce the number of hungry people in the world that is about 870 million people and majority (850 million people) being in developing countries. For the economies of smallholder farmers, better storage leads to fewer losses, more income, more grain available to seed, greater family stability, lower risks of family/country conflicts, improvement in political stability and quality of life. The different approaches which were studied to control the maize weevils included: evaluation of hermetic maize storage for smallholder farmers, effect of blending maize kernels with amaranth during storage on <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> mortality, and effect of storage containers physical disturbance on <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> mortality. The first study found 100 % <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> mortality for hermetically sealed containers and the oxygen levels inside them declined from 21 % to between 3 and 10 %. From the maize, maize-amaranth experiment, it was concluded that blending maize with amaranth during storage reduced <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> population growth by 46 % compared to storing maize alone. From the last experiment, we found out that physical disturbance resulted in 81 % weevil mortality. The overall conclusion is that there are effective low-cost ways to control maize weevils by hermetic storage, physical disturbance and blending maize with amaranth during storage. Hermetic storage is the best among the researched methods to effectively control the maize weevils, followed by physical disturbance and then maize-amaranth mixture. Possible future research can be to: * Investigate the possible causes and how to eliminate and/or minimize maize spoilage on barrel walls. This experiment will seek to minimize and/or eliminate molds that were observed and the aflatoxin detected from samples picked from barrel walls. * Hermetic storage should be investigated without letting the weevils to first go first through lifecycles to increase in population. This experiment will investigate if kernel spoilage occurs on barrel walls if hermetic sealing in done from the first day of storage. * Investigate how long it takes for a female <b>maize</b> <b>weevil</b> to bore through a kernel. This test will establish how frequently it is necessary to disturb the weevils. * Setting up the same maize-amaranth experiment (50 : 50 by volume) but having an extra layer of amaranth on top to investigate if this can help completely control the <b>maize</b> <b>weevil.</b> This extra layer will reduce and/or eliminate the maize kernels that were available during our experiment. * Due to observation of no spoilt kernels for maize blended with grain amaranth on barrel walls, more research should be done to quantify the observations. This experiment may lead to hermetic and maize-amaranth mixture methods being used together by smallholder farmers to eliminate and/or mimimize weevils while experiencing no mold maize in metallic storage containers. * Investigate the effect of physical disturbance using larger storage containers. Since farmers use larger storage containers compared to what we investigated in laboratory setting, it is necessary to find out what will happen in real life. * Implement and test the researched methods in a developing country. These tests will help determine if the proposed methods are feasible...|$|E

40|$|Essential oil {{of chinese}} {{medicinal}} herb, Evodia rutaecarpa unripe fruits {{was found to}} possess insecticidal activity against <b>maize</b> <b>weevils,</b> Sitophilus zeamais and red flour beetles Tribolium castaneum. The essential oil of E. rutaecarpa was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 38 components of the essential oil were identified. The principal compounds in E. rutaecarpa essential oil were β-myrcene (17. 7 %), (Z) -β-ocimene (14. 8 %), α-phellandrene (14. 7 %), γ-terpinene (6. 4 %), linalool (5. 7 %) and β-thujene (5. 1 %). Bioactivity-guided chromatographic separation of the essential oil on repeated silica gel columns led to isolate three volatile components (β-myrcene, β-ocimene and α-phellandrene) from the essential oil. α-Phellandrene was strongest fumigant against S. zeamais adults, T. castaneum adults and T. castaneum larvae with LC 50 values of 15. 61, 19. 78 and 47. 96 mg/L air, respectively. β-Myrcene and β-ocimene also possess fumigant activity against the two species of insects but weaker fumigant activity than the crude essential oil...|$|R
40|$|Maize {{grown by}} {{subsistence}} farmers is a staple food {{for millions of}} people around the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. Following harvest and shelling, maize is subject to storage losses caused by birds, rodents, fungi, and insects. The losses amount to millions of Mg per year of maize, which could be available with no additional inputs of land, seed, fertilizer and water. On-farm hermetic storage has the potential to substantially reduce these losses without the use of pesticides. This paper explains the basis of hermetic storage and presents the Iowa State University procedure for predicting the time required for 100 % mortality of adult <b>maize</b> <b>weevils</b> in hermetically-stored <b>maize,</b> shows field data verifying the prediction accuracy, and describes four systems being successfully used for hermetic maize storage on subsistence farms: Postcosecha galvanized steel silos, Purdue triple-bagging system, Grain Pro ultra hermetic bags, Recycled plastic food containers. Based on purchase price, the steel silo is the least cost system. The two bagging systems cost three to four times as much. The recycled oil container is the most costly, in spite of its low purchase price...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the chemical composition and insecticidal {{activity of the}} essential oil of the aerial parts of Ainsliaea fragrans against <b>maize</b> <b>weevils</b> (Sitophilus zeamais). Methods: The essential oil of A. fragrans aerial parts was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromaotography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Contact toxicity of the essential oil and its major constituents was determined by topical application against S. zeamais. Results: A total of 30 components of the essential oil were identified. The major constituents were myristicin (41. 3 %), elemicine (11. 9 %), cis-isosafrole (11. 5 %), borneol (9. 1 %) and caryophyllene (8. 8 %). The essential oil of A. fragrans exhibited contact toxicity against S. zeamais with LC 50 value of 50. 7 µg/adult.
