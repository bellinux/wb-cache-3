In March 2008, TriMet added {{additional}} capacity during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> commuting period. This was accomplished by extending three Red Line trains from the Beaverton Transit Center stop each <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> during peak ridership times.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E

5|$|Birchington-on-Sea {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Chatham Main Line which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. Other {{stations}} on this line include Broadstairs, Margate, Herne Bay, Faversham, Gillingham, Chatham, Rochester and Bromley South. Birchington is around 1hour and 40minutes from London by Mainline train. A National Express coach service also runs between London Victoria and Ramsgate via Birchington-on-Sea. A selection of early <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> trains run on weekdays to London's Cannon Street station and high speed services to St. Pancras International, primarily for business commuting.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They {{eat in the}} <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening,</b> rest in shade when hot {{and remain}} in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his Magdalen Scholarship he had a scholarship from Hampshire County Council worth £50 a year. After arriving he made a favourable impression on Sir Herbert Warren, the President of Magdalen College, who upgraded the exhibition to a Demyship of £80 a year and arranged for the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to give Denning a £30 a year scholarship. Despite military training in the early <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening,</b> Denning worked hard at his studies, and obtained a First in Mathematical Moderations, {{the first half of}} his mathematics degree, in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1993, the Joondalup railway line {{came into}} {{operation}} {{as part of}} the Northern Suburbs Transit System, resulting {{in the creation of the}} 449 and 457 services to replace the 387 service. The 449 operated only during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> rush-hour, while the 457 operated after-hours and at weekends. These services operated virtually unchanged until 6 November 2011, when the 347 was replaced with the present-day 387, and the 457 and weekday evening services were withdrawn. On 31 January 2016, the 449 was also withdrawn, leaving Hamersley without weekend bus services.|$|E

On Sundays he would attend both <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> church services, also leading a Bible study class for local Coloured boys, and during the week he was an assiduous attendee at evening prayer meetings. Within Victoria College, one of the strongest friendships he formed was with Professor JI Marais, the head of the Theology faculty.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} {{strictly}} regulated non-motorized pedicabs; it first permitted the bicycle-powered taxis in 1984, {{but there were}} no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008. Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions, and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets, downtown bridges, and on the Nicollet Mall, at any time except the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> rush hours. In October 2011, when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during rush hours (with new safety regulations), eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|There is {{generally}} an hourly service to Sheringham (8minutes) and to Norwich (55minutes), with more frequent services during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> peak travel times. On Sundays, trains run every twohours to Sheringham and Norwich. In 1997 a single daily through train {{to and from}} London Liverpool Street to Sheringham via Cromer was introduced; it was not heavily used and the service was consequently discontinued. All of these services are run by diesel multiple units Class 153, 156 or occasionally 170.|$|E

5|$|Platforms 6 and 7 are {{dedicated}} to the Heathrow Express. Flight information display screens for airline passengers are provided at the Heathrow Express ticket office near these platforms. Baggage check-in facilities for airline passengers were provided in 1999 in the Lawn but progressively replaced by retail units. An integrated timetable is offered between Paddington and Rosslare Europort in Ireland via the Stena Line ferry from Fishguard Harbour railway station with through ticketing to stations and a daily <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> service in both directions, changing at Newport, Cardiff or Swansea. This route has been in existence since 1906.|$|E
5|$|The largest bores occur {{around the}} times of the {{equinoxes}} but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days.

5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> rush hours, {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|E
5|$|From Seattle, SR520 crosses Lake Washington on the tolled Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is {{the longest}} {{floating}} bridge in the world. Tolls are collected electronically using the state's Good to Go pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and number of axles; the minimum Good to Go toll, , is $1.25 between midnight and 5a.m., and the maximum is $4.30 during the <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> peak periods. The freeway reaches {{the eastern end of}} Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a lidded park and next to a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point lid and bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor. SR520 continues along {{the north side of the}} Bel-Red industrial area and enters the Overlake area of Redmond.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an above-ground junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E
