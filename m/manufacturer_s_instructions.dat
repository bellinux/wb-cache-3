40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the surface roughness of a nanocomposite and a microhybrid composite after polishing the composites with different polishing systems. Key words: Polishing, surface roughness, microhybrid composite, nanocomposite, Sof-Lex XT, Spiral Wheels, Enhance, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Zircon-Brite, Dura-White stones, Mylar strips Methods: The composites {{used in this}} study were Filtek Supreme XTE (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) and Z 100 (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA). Thirty-five composite samples were made from each of the two composites. Uncured composite was placed into an aluminium ring mould, 10 mm X 2 mm. Both the upper and lower surfaces of the composite were covered with Mylar strips and glass plates, before the specimens were cured for 40 seconds from both sides. Samples were randomly divided into seven groups. The groups were: 1. Mylar polyester strip (control) 2. Sof-Lex XT finishing and polishing discs (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 3. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 4. Dura-White stones (Shofu Inc, Kyoto, Japan) 5. Intensiv UniglossCellbrush (Intensiv SA, Montagnola, Switzerland) 6. Enhance finishing and polishing system (Dentsply, Milford, USA) 7. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels combined with Zircon-Brite (Dental Ventures of America, Corona, USA) The polishing of the specimens was performed by a single operator according to <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> <b>instructions.</b> The mean surface roughness of each specimen was determined using a profilometer (Surftest SJ 210, Mitutoyo, Tokyo, Japan). Three readings were collected from each specimen. Data was statistically analysed using ANOVA. Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL JSM- 5800 LV, Tokyo, Japan) photos were taken of the representative samples. Results: Statistically significant differences in surface roughness were observed between the following groups: Z 100 and Filtek Supreme XTE with the polishing systems combined (p= 0. 005); Control group vs all the polishing systems; Sof-Lex XT finishing and polishing discs vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv Unigloss Cellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Dura-White stones vs Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system, Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001); Intensiv UniglossCellbrush vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p< 0. 0001); Enhance finishing and polishing system vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Filtek Supreme XTE displayed significantly better polishability and lower surface roughness values after polishing than Z 100. The composite samples cured against the Mylar polyester strip produced significantly smoother surface roughness values than all the polishing systems tested in this study. The following polishing systems led to the smoothest surfaces after polishing: Sof-lex Spiral Wheels in combination with Zircon-Brite, as well as the Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels and Sof-Lex finishing and polishing discs. These systems were significantly smoother than the Enhance system used in combination with Prisma Gloss polishing paste, and also the one-step polishing system Intensiv UniglossCellbrush. There was no statistically significant difference between Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels in combination with Zircon-Brite, the Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels and the Sof-Lex finishing and polishing discs.

40|$|A Bronquiolite Viral Aguda (BVA) é a {{principal}} infecção aguda do Trato Respiratório Inferior (TRI) em crianças menores de 12 meses de idade. Vários vírus estão associados à BVA, como vírus respiratório sincicial (VRS), parainfluenzavírus (PIV) 1 e 3, rinovírus, adenovírus (AdV), coronavírus, influenza (Flu), bocavírus e metapneumovírus humano (hMPV). O VRS é o agente mais prevalente na BVA, seguido por hMPV, principalmente em crianças menores de um ano. O hMPV parece ter uma distribuição sazonal que se sobrepõe à do RSV, sendo então possível a ocorrência de co-infecção. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a prevalência de hMPV em crianças menores de um ano com BVA assistidas no setor de emergência de um hospital público de referência pediátrica na cidade de Vitória, Espírito Santo. Foram obtidos aspirados de nasofaringe de 215 casos durante os meses de março a setembro de 2004 e de 2005. Amostras de 167 casos foram testadas para presença de VRS, PIV, AdV e Flu através de reação de imunofluorescência indireta (RIFI) utilizando o Respiratory panel 1 Viral Screening & Identification KitTM (Chemicon International). A presença de hMPV e VRS foi testada de 210 e de 198 casos, respectivamente, através de Reação em Cadeia pela Polimerase após Transcrição Reversa (RT-PCR) seguida por seminested PCR. O RNA viral foi extraído a partir de 250 &# 956;l dos espécimes respiratórios através da metodologia de TRIzol (Life Technologies®), de acordo com as instruções do fabricante, e submetido a ensaios de RT-PCR para hMPV e VRS, utilizando iniciadores específicos para o gene N do hMPV e para gene G do VRS na PCR e na semi-nested PCR, após síntese de cDNA com iniciadores randômico ou específicos, respectivamente. No grupo de 167 amostras testadas por RIFI, 2 (1, 2 %), 3 (1, 8 %), 4 (2, 4 %) e 107 (64, 5 %) dos pacientes foram positivos para AdV, PIV 1, PIV 3 e VRS, respectivamente. O hMPV e VRS foram detectados por semi-nested PCR em 13, 8 % (29 / 210) e em 67 % (133 / 198) dos casos, respectivamente. Em 8, 6 % (17 / 197) das amostras foram detectadas co-infecção de VRS e hMPV. Os resultados obtidos neste estudo mostram o hMPV como segundo agente mais freqüente em crianças menores de um ano com BVA, em conformidade com estudos prévios. Estudos posteriores esclarecerão o papel da co-infecção entre hMPV e VRS na gravidade da BVA. Além disso, análise filogenética das amostras positivas para hMPV e VRS permitirá identificar quais os genótipos circularam em nossa região no período em estudo. Acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB) {{is the major}} lower respiratory tract infection in children below 12 months of age. Several viruses are associated to AVB such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus (PIV) 1 and 3, rhinovirus, adenovirus (AdV), coronavirus, influenza virus (Flu), bocavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). RSV is the most prevalent agent of AVB, followed by hMPV, mostly in children {{less than one year}} old. The hMPV seems to have a seasonal distribution overlapping RSV, therefore dual infection might be possible. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the prevalence of hMPV in children below one year of age with AVB attended at an emergency room in a public reference pediatric hospital in the City of Vitória, Espírito Santo. Nasopharyngeal aspirated secretions were obtained from 215 cases during March to September 2004 and 2005. Samples of 167 cases were tested for RSV, PIV AdV and Flu by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with Respiratory panel 1 Viral Screening & Identification KitTM (Chemicon International). The hMPV and RSV were tested from 210 and of 198 cases, respectively, by Reverse Transcription - Polimerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) proceeded by hemi-nested PCR. Viral RNA was extracted from 250 &# 956;l of the respiratory specimens by TRIzol methodology (Life Technologies®), according to the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> <b>instructions.</b> PCR and hemi-nested PCR assays were achieved using specific primer sets for the hMPV nucleoprotein (N) gene and RSV major attachment glycoprotein (G) gene, after cDNA synthesis with random or specific primers, respectively. In a group of 167 samples tested by IFA, 2 (1, 2 %), 3 (1, 8 %), 4 (2, 4 %) and 107 (64, 5 %) patients were positive for AdV, PIV 1, PIV 3 and RSV, respectively. The hMPV and VRS were detected by hemi-nested PCR in 13, 8 % (29 / 210) and in 67 % (133 / 198) of the cases, respectively. hMPV and RSV coinfection occurred in 8, 6 % (17 / 197) of the samples. The results here obtained showed that hMPV was the second-most-frequent cause of AVB in children less than 1 year old, agreeing to previous studies. Further studies will clarify the role of hMPV and RSV dual infection in the severity and outcome of the AVB. In addition, phylogenetic analysis on hMPV and RSV-positive samples will disclose which genotypes have circulated in our geographic area in the period in study...|$|E
