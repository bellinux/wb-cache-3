25|$|The current {{town centre}} was {{originally}} designed by James Wyatt in 1780, in the Georgian architectural style. Its layout follows the medieval principles of urban design {{introduced by the}} Normans in the 13th century. A particular feature is the incorporation of the river into the composition, contained for two blocks by low stone walls producing, {{on each side of}} the river, tree lined promenades (The Mall) with several stone bridges over the river Carrow Beg. The layout further includes several tree lined streets, addressed by the narrow fronted commercial buildings typical of Irish towns, though with <b>many</b> <b>here</b> remaining of a singular refinement and charm. Some modern interventions, such as the Garda station, are less successful in maintaining the original continuity of the urban fabric.|$|E
