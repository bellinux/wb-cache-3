This <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> is important in the petrochemical industry as an intermediate in the production of styrene, the precursor to polystyrene, a common plastic material. In 2012, more than 99% of ethylbenzene produced was consumed in the production of styrene. Ethylbenzene is also used to make other chemicals, in fuel, and as a solvent in inks, rubber adhesives, varnishes, and paints. Ethylbenzene exposure can be determined by testing for the breakdown products in urine.|$|E

To this end, two strategies are followed; the first one aims at tailoring the pore size in order to selectively trap and discriminate benzene and toluene. The second is to decrease the pore polarity in order to eliminate the main interfering gas of the atmosphere, water vapor. The results of these strategies are reported in this paper. After describing the synthesis of silicon hybrid xerogels and thin films and the characterisation of their structural properties, we report the study of the local polarity of the pores, of the porosity and optical properties of the materials. These characterisation data will enable us to define the materials suited for hosting benzene and toluene...|$|E

Most analytes were traceable to a single input source in {{the upper part of the}} estuary, which is densely populated and highly industrialized. By contrast, the occurrence of MAHs resulted from contributions of a wide spectrum of sources. The CMAHs were less abundant in the water column, and were mainly detected as chlorobenzene and 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene.

Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with increasing numbers of methyl groups are systematically studied. SOA formation from pentamethylbenzene and hexamethylbenzene are reported for the first time. A decreasing SOA yield with increasing number of methyl groups is observed. Linear trends are found in both f 44 vs.   f 43 and O / C vs.  H / C for SOA from monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with zero to six methyl groups. An SOA oxidation state predictive method based on benzene is {{used to examine the}} effect of added methyl groups on aromatic oxidation under low-NO x conditions. Further, the impact of methyl group number on density and volatility of SOA from monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is explored. Finally, a mechanism for methyl group impact on SOA formation is suggested.

The effect of KCl was opposite to that of CoCl 2 and ZnCl 2. These chlorides were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) before and after pyrolysis. The XRD results indicated that the catalytic active sites of alkali or alkaline earth metal (AAEM) chlorides catalysts were the interactions between the AAEM species and oxygen-bearing anions. However, the catalytic activities of transition metal chlorides might be in their metallic state. In addition, the effects of CoCl 2 on the pyrolysis of raw lignite have also been investigated with a spout-entrained reactor. The results suggest that impregnating 15 % CoCl 2 to lignite can increase the yields of total volatile matters more than 2 -fold. The catalytic effect of CoCl 2 impregnated to zeolite is lower than that directly impregnated to lignite. However, catalytic pyrolysis of lignite with Co-zeolite should be feasible in an industrial setting because it is easy to separate and recycle.

Water samples {{were taken from the}} Channel, the Belgian Continental Shelf, the mouth of the Scheldt estuary and the Southern Bight, and were analysed by purge-and-trap and high-resolution gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. All data were produced by analyses deemed ‘in control’ by a rigorous quality assurance/quality control program provided by QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information for Marine Environmental Monitoring in Europe). Chloroform and trichloroethene were commonly detected at concentrations up to 1900 and 270  ng l - 1, respectively. The other CHCs were generally found below 5  ng l - 1, and rarely exceeded 10  ng l - 1. Concentrations of MAHs were at least one order of magnitude higher than those of the CHCs. The higher levels were attributed to anthropogenic emissions from oil-related activities in coastal areas. CMAHs, except chlorobenzene and 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, were hardly detected in North Sea waters. The levels of several CHCs and MAHs were shown to decrease compared to previous investigations in 1994 – 1995, probably as a result of on-going emission reduction efforts.

Besides method validation, emphasis was put on quality control and assessment during routine determination of VOCs in marine water samples. Analytical quality control charts were plotted for all VOCs and a standard addition test was performed, as proposed by the QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information in Marine Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Europe) working group. The analytical charts were incorporated in a working scheme containing guidelines to be applied during routine determinations, ensuring the long time reliability of the analytical method. Results yielded by the QUASIMEME interlaboratory exercise on organohalogen measurements in seawater are presented. The exercise was attended by seven out of eight laboratories who agreed to participate.

Many indigenous microbes metabolize alkanes, and alkane chemotaxis and accumulation in some strains have been identified. For the first time, we apply Raman microspectroscopy to identify such chemotaxis and bioaccumulation, and quantify the alkane concentrations via spectral alterations. Raman spectral alterations were only found for the alkane chemo-attractant bacteria Acinetobacter baylyi ADP 1, not for Pseudomonas fluorescence, which exhibits limited chemotaxis towards alkane. The significant alterations were attributed to the strong chemotactic ability of A. baylyi enhancing the capture and accumulation of alkane molecules on cell membranes or cellular internalization. Spectral fingerprints of A. baylyi significantly altered after 1 -h exposure to pure alkanes (dodecane or tetradecane) and alkane mixtures (mineral oil or crude oil), but not <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (MAHs) or polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs).

The potential competitors were chlorinated ethenes, <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and humic acids. The effect of a complex matrix was tested with landfill contaminated groundwater. Nonlinear Freundlich isotherms adequately described chloroethene sorption to ZVI. In the presence of the more hydrophobic PCE (5 mg L- 1), TCE sorption and degradation decreased by 33 % and 30 %, respectively, while TCE (10 mg L- 1) decreased PCE degradation by 30 %. In the presence of nonreactive hydrophobic hydrocarbons (i. e., benzene, toluene, and m-xylene at 100 mg L- 1), TCE and PCE sorption decreased by 73 % and 55 %, respectively. The presence of the hydrocarbons had no effect on TCE degradation and increased PCE reduction rates by 50 %, suggesting that the displacement of the chloroethenes from the sorption sites by the <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> enhanced the degradation rates.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUnleaded petrol {{contains}} {{significant amounts}} of <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX). Toxic responses following occupational exposure to unleaded petrol have been evaluated only in limited studies. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain whether (or not) exposure to unleaded petrol, under normal working conditions, is associated with any hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic response. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study in which 200 employees of Shiraz petrol stations with current exposure to unleaded petrol, as well as 200 unexposed employees, were investigated. Atmospheric concentrations of BTX were measured using standard methods. Additionally, urine and fasting blood samples were taken from individuals for urinalysis and routine biochemical tests of kidney and liver function. ResultsThe geometric means of airborne concentrations of BTX were found to be 0. 8  mg m− 3, 1. 4  mg m− 3, and 2. 8  mg m− 3, respectively. Additionally, means of direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea and plasma creatinine were significantly higher in exposed individuals than in unexposed employees. Conversely, serum albumin, total protein, and serum concentrations of calcium and sodium were significantly lower in petrol station workers than in their unexposed counterparts. ConclusionThe average exposure of petrol station workers to BTX did not exceed the current threshold limit values (TLVs) for these chemicals. However, evidence of subtle, subclinical and prepathologic early liver and kidney dysfunction was evident in exposed individuals...|$|R

A {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) analysis was performed to characterize the coals. It {{was found that the}} relative content of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) is not as sensitive to temperature as <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (MAHs), which increased with increasing the pyrolysis temperature. A decreasing trend of the content of acids/esters was observed for all three ranks of coals. However, the three coals exhibited quite different trends with the temperature in terms of the relative content of aliphatic hydrocarbons. MAHs and PAHs were predominant components in the tar from Liulin bituminous coal. The tars from Hailaer lignite and Fugu sub-bituminous coal were rich in phenolics, which can be detected at a low temperature of 400 degrees C. In contrast, the phenolics were much less in the tar from Liulin bituminous coal and can merely remarkably be detected at a higher temperature of 600 degrees C. The contents of phenolics and aliphatic hydrocarbons decreased with increasing the pressure for all three coals, and the contents of MAHs and PAHs showed inverse trends with the pressure. This could result from the enhanced reactions of cydizations of aliphatics and scissions of the C-OH bond in phenolics by elevated pressure. C- 19 alkane and p-cresol as model compounds of aliphatics and phenolics were pyrolyzed under high pressures to verify this point. For a larger particle size of Fugu sub-bituminous and Liulin bituminous coals, the contents of aliphatics decreased remarkably, while the contents of MAHs and PAHs were distinctly augmented. This could be attributed to the intraparticle secondary reactions.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{is presented to}} study the ring-cleavage process of benzene, toluene, and p-xylene (BTX). DOAS (differential optical absorption spectroscopy) {{was used for the}} simultaneous measurement of the respective ring-retaining products as well as glyoxal (a ring-cleavage product) in a series of experiments at the EUPHORE outdoor simulation chamber, Valencia/Spain. The good time resolution of the DOAS measurements (1 - 2 min) allowed the primary formation of glyoxal to be separated from any further contributions through additional pathways via reactions of stable intermediate compounds (secondary glyoxal formation). The ring-retaining products and glyoxal were identified as primary products. The primary glyoxal yield was found to be essentially identical to the overall yield of glyoxal formed over the time scale of the experiments. The negligible contribution from secondary glyoxal formation pathways was quantitatively understood for the experimental conditions of this study and was found to be representative for the troposphere. The yield of glyoxal was determined to be 35 % (10 % for benzene and about 5 % higher for toluene and p-xylene. For benzene, the yield of hexadienedial was estimated to be e 8 %. It is concluded that ring-cleavage pathways involving the bicycloalkyl radical are major pathways in the oxidation of <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> i. e., BTX. The branching ratio for the bicycloalkyl radical intermediate, proposed to form from the reaction of the aromatic-OH adduct with atmospheric oxygen, could be directly identified with the primary glyoxal yield for the benzene system and as a lower limit in the case of toluene and p-xylene. Implications for the chemical behavior of <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the atmosphere are discussed...|$|R

In addition, hotels {{have been set}} up near hot spring sites to attract people, including local citizens, to spend their spare time inside these so-called “spring hotels”. In our study, indoor air quality was investigated in four hot spring hotels in Guangdong province, China. Measured indoor pollutants included CO 2, CO, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). As the result show, high concentrations of carbon dioxide might be attributed to poor ventilation; and the variations of indoor PM 10, PM 2. 5 concentrations were related to occupants’ activities. Alpha-pinene and toluene were the most common VOC species in the hot spring hotels other than <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> like Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylenes (BTEX), which were at medium levels among the reported indoor pollutants. High cancer risk of benzene in the newly decorated rooms should be seriously taken into consideration in the future. Indoor to Outdoor air concentration ratios (I/O) for CO 2 and VOCs were higher than 1, indicating their strong indoor sources. Negative correlations were found between indoor CO 2 and all the other compounds, and VOCs were shown to be significantly correlated (p < 0. 01) to each other, including <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and mono-terpenes. For indoor and outdoor air compounds, correlation coefficients among all compounds did not show a significant correlation, which indicated that these pollutants had different sources. Principal components analysis by SPSS showed that indoor materials, inhabitants’ activities and respiration, cleaning products and outdoor sources were the main sources of indoor detected pollutants in hot spring hotels...|$|R

40|$|Designing {{automotive}} catalysts {{for effective}} control of NOx, HC and CO emissions under both lean and stoichiometric engine operation is a challenging task. The present work assesses the performance efficiency of a three-zone prototype catalytic convertor in reducing exhaust emissions from a gasoline engine, operating in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Spark Ignition (SI) mode under lean and stoichiometric conditions. The {{performance of the}} convertor for HC oxidation follows the order: lean HCCI > stoichiometric SI > stoichiometric HCCI. The study mainly focused on the quantitative analysis of C 1 –C 7 hydrocarbon compounds {{before and after the}} catalytic convertor. The results show that <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as toluene are present at higher concentrations in the exhaust under HCCI operation than in the SI case. On the other hand, benzene concentrations are higher in the SI exhaust. The most common exhaust products of the two engine operating modes are methane, ethylene, propylene, benzene, and toluene. The prototype catalytic convertor eliminates most of the hydrocarbon species in the exhaust under both combustion modes, especially with a lean mixture. Conversion efficiencies for the different hydrocarbon species over the catalyst were in the order of alkenes > alkanes > aromatics. Hydrogen was added upstream of the catalyst primarily to assess its ability to promote NOx reduction, however it was also found to influence the oxidation characteristics of the catalyst. During H 2 addition, the methane concentration was higher downstream of the catalyst...|$|R

This work focuses on 13 volatile organic compounds in marine waters and the marine atmosphere. During six campaigns in September 1994 -December 1995, simultaneous air and water sampling was carried out in both the southern North Sea area and the Scheldt Estuary. Mean water concentrations for individual compounds were in the 2. 2 - 72. 9 ppt range (n = 38), whereas atmospheric concentrations varied between 2. 3 and 854 pptv. Samples from the Scheldt Estuary proved to have elevated concentrations of chlorinated compounds. A number of water and air samples showed enhanced concentrations of C- 2 -substituted <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> which could not clearly be linked to anthropogenic activities. Back-trajectory calculations showed that a number of over sea atmospheric samples were affected by atmospheric transport from industrial sites, 250 - 300 km up wind. Fugacity modeling showed that the North Sea acts as a source to the atmosphere, not as a sink. Mean water to air mass transfer rates varied between 0. 6 - 52. 7 mu g m(- 2) day(- 1) for all VOCs. it was statistically shown that water to air exchange rates of tetrachloroethylene, benzene, and toluene were slowed when air masses from continental origin were at the marine sampling sites instead of air masses from remote non-continental origin...|$|R
40|$|Beijerinckia sp. strain B 1 {{is able to}} grow {{on either}} {{biphenyl}} or m-xylene as the sole source of carbon and is capable of cooxidizing many polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The catabolic pathways for biphenyl and m-xylene degradation are coinduced and share common downstream enzymatic reactions. The catabolic pathway for biphenyl degradation involves two meta-cleavage steps, one for 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl and a second for catechol. The catabolic pathway for m-xylene involves one m-cleavage step for 3 -methylcatechol. The genes for two meta-cleavage dioxygenases were cloned from Beijerinckia sp. strain B 1 on a single fragment of genomic DNA. The two genes are located approximately 5. 5 kb away from one another. Expression of each gene separately in Escherichia coli {{and analysis of the}} meta-cleavage dioxygenase produced showed that one enzyme was more specific for 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl while the second was more specific for catechol. The genes for the two meta-cleavage enzymes were thus labeled bphC and xylE for 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl 1, 2 -dioxygenase and catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase, respectively. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by enzyme activity staining showed that the two meta-cleavage dioxygenases could be easily separated from each other. Similar analyses of Beijerinckia sp. strain B 1 grown on succinate, biphenyl, or m-xylene indicate that both meta-cleavage enzymes are induced when cells are grown on either biphenyl or m-xylene. The nucleotide sequence was determined for both bphC and xylE. The two genes are transcribed in opposite directions, demonstrating that at least two operons must be involved in biphenyl degradation by Beijerinckia sp. strain B 1. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl 1, 2 -dioxygenase (BphC) falls into the class of meta-cleavage dioxygenases acting on dihydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and is somewhat distinct from the main group of meta-cleavage dioxygenases acting on 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl. Catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase (XyIE) falls into the class of meta-cleavage enzymes acting on dihydroxylated <b>monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> but shows little similarity to the canonical TOL plasmid-encoded catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) {{formation is}} {{of critical importance}} to public health and global climate. SOA formation from anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is influenced by NO, precursor molecular structure, oxidation conditions and other factors. This dissertation explores the impact of NO effect and molecular structure for two categories of VOCs at urban atmosphere relevant conditions by utilizing the state of art 90 m 3 UCR/CE-CERT chamber facilities. <b>Monocyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are the dominant anthropogenic SOA precursor in urban areas. The impact of instantaneous NOx source is demonstrated by data mining of m-xylene photooxidation experiments, developing of new reaction scenario and SAPRC model prediction. The relationship of SOA growth rate to NO 2 /NO ratio, instantaneous HC/NO, absolute NO concentration, peroxy radical reaction branching ratio and hydroxyl radical concentration are illustrated. It is found that NO at sub-ppb level enhances ·OH formation by increasing HO 2 · and RO 2 · and therefore promotes SOA formation. Further, innovative SOA composition analysis methods normalizing aerosol yield and chemical composition on an aromatic ring basis are developed and utilized to explore aerosol formation from oxidation of 17 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The yield normalization process demonstrates that the aromatic ring is a more significant driver of aerosol formation than alkyl substitute structure. More important, four oxygens per aromatic ring are observed in SOA chemical composition, regardless of the alkyl substitutes attached to the ring. The investigation on SOA formation from <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> provides new perspective on the complicated aromatic oxidation mechanisms. Glycol ethers, from consumer products, are newly identified as SOA precursors in this dissertation. The impact of molecular structure on SOA formation from glycol ethers and relative ethers is investigated. The presence and location of –OH {{are found to be}} an important structure in ether precursor to SOA formation. Products with cyclic structure are observed in both gas and particle phase during the oxidation of ethers containing –OH. Further, intermolecular cyclization pathway is considered to determine SOA formation during ether oxidation, especially under atmospherically relevant NOx conditions...|$|R
