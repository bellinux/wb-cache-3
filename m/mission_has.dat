5|$|A {{letter from}} Ælfwald to Boniface, {{the leader of}} the English {{continental}} <b>mission,</b> <b>has</b> survived. It was written in at some time between 742 and 749 {{and is one of the}} few surviving documents from the period that relate the ecclesiastical history of East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|India's first lunar mission, Chandrayaan I, orbited from 8 November 2008 until loss {{of contact}} on 27 August 2009, {{creating}} a high resolution chemical, mineralogical and photo-geological {{map of the}} lunar surface, and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil. The Indian Space Research Organisation planned to launch Chandrayaan II in 2013, which would have included a Russian robotic lunar rover. However, the failure of Russia's Fobos-Grunt <b>mission</b> <b>has</b> delayed this project.|$|E

50|$|All Apollo lunar <b>missions</b> <b>had</b> a third {{crew member}} who {{remained}} {{on board the}} Command Module. The last three <b>missions</b> <b>had</b> a rover for increased mobility.|$|R
2500|$|Smaller <b>missions</b> <b>had</b> two priests, whereas larger <b>missions</b> <b>had</b> more. Populations {{varied from}} 2,000 to 7,000. In the morning, [...] children's hymns were {{followed}} by Mass and breakfast, after which the workers went to their tasks.|$|R
5|$|ESA's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) {{has been}} {{selected}} as part of ESA's Cosmic Vision science program. It is expected to launch in 2022 and, {{after a series of}} flybys in the inner Solar System, arrive in 2030. In 2012, the European Space Agency's selected the JUpiter ICy moon Explorer (JUICE) as its first Large mission, replacing its contribution to EJSM, the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). The partnership for the Europa Jupiter System <b>Mission</b> <b>has</b> since ended, but NASA will continue to contribute the European mission with hardware and an instrument.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>mission</b> <b>has</b> a timed {{duration}} {{that the}} player must beat, with two tiers of time bonus. The player is rewarded with space credits {{dependent on the}} amount of cargo that survived the mission and how quickly they completed it. Reputation, displayed as stars, is rewarded based whether or not the player met cargo or time thresholds. Space credits are used between missions in order to purchase special abilities and bonuses for modules, while gaining reputation unlocks new modules.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the <b>mission</b> <b>has</b> helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|Launched {{from the}} EUROSEC Space Centre in Portugal in the {{spacecraft}} Phoenix, Ross and Kane spend {{the first half}} of their six-week round trip in stasis. Three weeks after launch, the astronauts are revived in the planet's orbit. Scans for the existence of extraterrestrial life are inconclusive, and Ross and Kane decide to make a surface landing. As the astronauts descend, an electrical storm damages their Dove lander shuttle, which crashes in a mountainous region near Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. When an air-sea rescue unit returns Ross and Kane, the latter critically injured, to the Space Centre, it appears that the Phoenix <b>mission</b> <b>has</b> returned to Earth.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Gangstas in Space was released. In three missions, players {{continue}} the Saints Row: The Third {{story in a}} new arc about the Gangstas in Space film referenced in the main story. In the game, the film about the Saints is being directed by the self-interested Hollywood director Andy Zhen and the player is acting the final scenes of the film alongside a female co-star making her debut. In the first level, the player fights the military to save a female alien and controls the turret on the getaway vehicle. In the second, the player is in a shootout in a linear map. The last <b>mission</b> <b>has</b> the player in an aircraft fighting other aircraft while the co-star uploads viruses to transmitters. At the time of review, the player could not revisit the old missions to earn missed achievements, but was later patched. Costumes and vehicles are unlocked upon completing the pack. The pack was released in North America on February 21, 2012, and in Europe the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroshima {{mission was}} {{followed}} by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a forecast of bad weather. This time, a Fat Man nuclear weapon was carried by B-29 Bockscar, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target. Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura, {{but by the time}} Bockscar arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yahata by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, Bockscar diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki <b>mission</b> <b>has</b> been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and had very little fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} founded by Aldo Benzi, who {{converted}} to Christianity after being healed from a pleurisy. Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former Mennonite farmer who became pastor of the churches in Saint-Dizier and in Joinville after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma <b>mission,</b> <b>has</b> directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often {{on the grounds of}} defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a sex scandal within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent.|$|E
