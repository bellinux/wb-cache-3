With this method, an environmental allocative efficiency measure can be defined analogously to the more commonly used economic allocative efficiency. Nutrient surplus in pig fattening, a typical balance indicator, is used to illustrate the concept in a two input one output case. The <b>materials</b> <b>balance</b> based efficiency analysis is elaborated using data envelopment analysis (DEA).

40|$|The {{study of}} {{comparing}} gas reservoir performance using two different methods, namely numerical simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> was conducted. The Songo Songo dry gas field in Tanzania {{was used for}} this study. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare results from the two methods with actual data obtained from the field and determine which one best fits the performance of dry gas reservoir. To accomplish the objective of this study, geology of the Songo Songo field was studied and physics and principles underlying gas reservoir simulation and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> were reviewed. These guided to set-up simulation procedures, designing flowchart for <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analysis and gathering relevant data. The geological formations and stratigraphy gave guidelines to reveal factors affecting the performance of the Songo Songo reservoir. From this study, it was determined that, reservoir simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> gave similar trends of the performance curves in the pR/Z plot. The analysis of variance at 95 % confidence level indicated that the probability of no significant difference between the results of the two methods was equal to 0. 927. It is early to specify that reservoir simulation or general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> gives better performance of the Songo Songo dry gas reservoir because the history of the field is short and the pressure support in reservoir simulation model and in general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> model is different. Both reservoir simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> models are advised for modelling the performance of Songo Songo dry gas reservoir.

40|$|Estimating {{original}} hydrocarbons {{in place}} (OHIP) in a reservoir is fundamentally important to estimating reserves and potential profitability. Quantifying the uncertainties in OHIP estimates can improve reservoir development and investment decision-making for individual reservoirs {{and can lead}} to improved portfolio performance. Two traditional methods for estimating OHIP are volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> methods. Probabilistic estimates of OHIP are commonly generated prior to significant production from a reservoir by combining volumetric analysis with Monte Carlo methods. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> is routinely used to analyze reservoir performance and estimate OHIP. Although <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> has uncertainties due to errors in pressure and other parameters, probabilistic estimates are seldom done. In this thesis I use a Bayesian formulation to integrate volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses and to quantify uncertainty in the combined OHIP estimates. Specifically, I apply Bayes?? rule to the Havlena and Odeh <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> equation to estimate original oil in place, N, and relative gas-cap size, m, for a gas-cap drive oil reservoir. The paper considers uncertainty and correlation in the volumetric estimates of N and m (reflected in the prior probability distribution), as well as uncertainty in the pressure data (reflected in the likelihood distribution). Approximation of the covariance of the posterior distribution allows quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of N and m resulting from the combined volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses. Several example applications to illustrate the value of this integrated approach are presented. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> data reduce the uncertainty in the volumetric estimate, and the volumetric data reduce the considerable non-uniqueness of the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> solution, resulting in more accurate OHIP estimates than from the separate analyses. One of the advantages over reservoir simulation is that, with the smaller number of parameters in this approach, we can easily sample the entire posterior distribution, resulting in more complete quantification of uncertainty. The approach can also detect underestimation of uncertainty in either volumetric data or <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> data, indicated by insufficient overlap of the prior and likelihood distributions. When this occurs, the volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses should be revisited and the uncertainties of each reevaluated...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Accurate <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> {{serve as}} {{essential}} tools for controlling, evaluating and optimising petrochemical processes. In natural gas processing plants, {{where there are}} only phase separation processes and no chemical reactions, accurate <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> are crucial for ensuring the optimal processing of the natural gas hydrocarbons. Due to random and gross errors, caused by faulty or miscalibrated instrumentation, wrong sampling methods and erroneous laboratory analyses, measured data are unreliable and unsuitable for <b>material</b> <b>balances.</b> In order to compensate for incorrect measured variables, data reconciliation is required, to satisfy {{the constraints of the}} <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> and minimise the residual error between the measured and the adjusted variables. Although many software packages exist that do data reconciliation, this work used Microsoft Excel to perform <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> reconciliation on Sasol's natural gas processing plant at Temane, because it is the most widely used engineering tool in the petrochemical industry. A literature study was done and mathematical techniques for the reconciliation of plant data, and statistical methods to verify the results, were obtained. Spreadsheets were created in Microsoft Excel to: process raw input data: derive correction coefficients from historic data; conduct steady-state testing; eliminate gross errors; reconcile the <b>material</b> <b>balance,</b> and verify the results via a sensitivity analysis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{stochastic}} formulation of the <b>materials</b> <b>balance</b> condition which imposes physical constraints on production technologies.

In contrast to previous approaches our model allows to estimate the physical limitations to production possibilities in the presence of statistical noise and depends on substantially weaker data requirements.

Both approaches involve some level of plant modeling.

Simulation results demonstrated that species <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> conservation of surface gas and stock tank oil pseudo-components can be violated by the BO PVT model, while still honoring overall <b>material</b> <b>balance.</b> The limitation stems from assumption inherent to the pseudo-component model, which requires the composition of every pseudo-component to remain the same regardless of pressure.

40|$|Environmental {{efficiency}} measures constructed {{using the}} <b>materials</b> <b>balance</b> principle have two important shortcomings: (1) the ambiguity {{in the treatment}} of immaterial inputs and the various types of energy and (2) the lack of universally accepted weights for various material inputs. These two limitations are primarily caused {{by the fact that the}} <b>materials</b> <b>balance</b> condition is strictly regulated by the law of mass/energy conservation and that mass/energy content cannot be a good physical common unit of various inputs. The use of cumulative exergy content overcomes these problems. The use of cumulative exergy content allows the inclusion of life cycle assessment; hence facilitates the analysis of the cumulative pollution and total affects on natural resources. The present study uses cumulative exergy content to construct new efficiency sustainable measures and decomposes them into technical efficiency and cumulative exergy allocative efficiency in agricultural production. Empirical applications on OECD agriculture yielded a number of important findings: (1) OECD has the potential to save 72. 3 % of cumulative exergy consumption and improvements can be achieved by being more technically efficient and choosing a better combination of inputs; (2) the sustainable efficiency varied enormously across countries; and (3) the efficiency levels in 2003 was lower than in 1990.
