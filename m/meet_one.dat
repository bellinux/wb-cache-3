5|$|Yogesh is {{successful}} {{and living in}} Chicago. He gets a text message from Jitu that his father (Anjan Srivastav) had a heart attack, and rushes to Mumbai. When he arrives, Yogesh learns that Jitu had lied to him about their father, but that Jitu owes a rich man 25 million rupees for gambling debts; if Yogesh does not marry on the 20th of the month, Jitu will go to jail. At first Yogesh is adamant he will not marry, but Jitu tells him that he also borrowed 15 million rupees from a mob boss; his parents are unaware of this. Yogesh is annoyed, but agrees to marry after the gangster threatens them. When Uncle Devu (Darshan Jariwala) posts an ad with Yogesh's photo, 176 girls reply. Yogesh decides that he will <b>meet</b> <b>one</b> girl from each zodiac sign. Meanwhile, Devu's wife asks Yogesh's father to hire a detective – she suspects that Devu is cheating on her. When Yogesh's father learns that the astrologer is also a detective, he hires him. The detective identifies Devu's mistress as a woman named Anila Kamdar.|$|E
5|$|Across the ocean, Alex, Nall, and Ramus enter Meribia, {{where they}} <b>meet</b> <b>one</b> {{of the legendary}} Four Heroes, Mel. Attempting to sell his diamond, Ramus is swindled by a jewel dealer who flees into the sewers. After {{reclaiming}} it, Ramus slyly bargains the owner's life for his entire shop, and leaves the group to pursue his dream of becoming rich. Alex and Nash depart {{for the city of}} Vane where they meet Mia, daughter of the city's ruler and Nash's love interest, who informs them of Ghaleon, head of the guild and former great hero who fought with Dyne years ago. Seemingly intrigued by Alex's quest, Ghaleon sends Alex on a mission to investigate the appearance of a false Dragonmaster in a faraway town. Upon arrival, Alex meets Jessica, daughter of Mel and aspiring priestess, who helps him locate the imposter before returning to Vane. Pleased with his success, Ghaleon accompanies Alex back to his hometown to meet Quark and discuss Alex's future, when he suddenly attacks, revealing himself as the Magic Emperor and seemingly kills Quark in a fit of rage. Citing the loss of his friend Dyne, who died protecting the Goddess, Ghaleon swears revenge on both she and her dragons and departs after kidnapping Luna. Distraught, Alex and Nall return to Meribia to find it under attack by a band of monsters under Ghaleon's command. Regrouping with Jessica, the group fights back a wave of invaders before witnessing Mel turn to stone from a dark spell of Xenobia, Ghaleon's top general. Wanting revenge, Jessica accompanies Alex to Vane, also under siege, and assists Nash and Mia with a similar invasion before they too join the group.|$|E

25|$|The {{mobilization}} of multiple sectors within China occurred over a 15-year period {{when there was}} a long series of educational workshops, conferences, collaborative projects, and networking between members at a number of levels of the government and administrative structural hierarchies.

Personal relationships were formed that facilitated the consideration and examination of previously unrecognised policy options for detection, prevention, and care. In a non-linear process, a consensus slowly evolved, identifying policy options.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the new tie with Ontario, {{the company plans to}} build a new 1200-MW direct current link between the Des Cantons substation at Windsor, Quebec in Quebec's Eastern Townships and Deerfield, New Hampshire, with an HVDC converter terminal built at Franklin, New Hampshire. The US segment of the US$1.1 billion line, would be built by Northern Pass Transmission LLC, a partnership between Northeast Utilities (75%) and NSTAR (25%). In order to go ahead, the project must receive regulatory approval in Quebec and the United States. The proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015. According to Jim Robb, a senior executive from Northeast Utilities, New England could <b>meet</b> <b>one</b> third of its Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative commitments with the hydropower coming through this new power line alone.|$|E
25|$|For {{competing}} species {{within the}} same community to coexist, they have to <b>meet</b> <b>one</b> fundamental requirement: the impact of competition from a species on itself must exceed its competitive impact on other species. In other words, intraspecific competition must exceed interspecific competition. For example, jackrabbits {{living in the same}} area compete for food and nesting grounds. Such competition {{within the same}} species is called intraspecific competition, which limits the growth of the species itself. Members from different species can also compete. For instance, jackrabbits and cottontail rabbits also compete for food and nesting grounds. Competition between different species is called interspecific competition, which limits the growth of other species. Stable coexistence occurs when any one species in the community limits its own growth more strongly than the growth of others.|$|E
25|$|North of {{downtown}} Cortland, I-81 makes a 90-degree {{turn to the}} north, matching a similar curve {{in the course of}} the nearby river. This track brings the freeway to the suburban village of Homer, which I-81 connects to via exit12. The trumpet interchange feeds into a long east–west ramp linking the highway to the parallel US11, NY41 and NY281, another parallel road farther west. NY41 leaves US11 in Homer, and I-81, US11, and NY281 proceed slightly northeastward across a low-lying, undeveloped area in an otherwise hilly region of Cortland County. Just south of the Onondaga County line, I-81 directly meets NY281 as it crosses from the western side of the freeway to the eastern edge. They <b>meet</b> <b>one</b> final time across the county line near the village of Tully, where NY281 ends as I-81 intersects NY80 and NY11A. The west branch of the Tioughnioga River also terminates here, flowing into Tully Lake at the county line.|$|E
