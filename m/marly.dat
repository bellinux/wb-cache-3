5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette <b>Marly</b> joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and <b>Marly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{of the type}} species of Knoetschkesuchus, K. langenbergensis, comes from a <b>marly</b> limestone bed (numbered as Bed 83, not Bed 93 as reported by some publications) containing recrystallized micritic intraclasts, located within the Langenberg Quarry in the Harz Mountains near Goslar, Lower Saxony, Germany. These deposits have been dated to the Upper Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic - specifically, to the regional equivalent of the Upper Kimmeridgian known as the Mittleres Kimmeridge, and belong to the Süntel Formation. Although well-preserved, fossils from this quarry were recovered generally by regular blasting operations in the quarry.|$|E
5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de <b>Marly,</b> in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, <b>Marlier</b> {{was charged}} with battery and {{disturbance}} of the peace, and sentenced to six days in jail. In 1913, {{on the corner of}} Friedrichstraße and Jägerstraße, <b>Marlier</b> was arrested for assault and battery. According to the police, <b>Marlier</b> had slapped the face of a woman waiting at a cab stand. When two drivers intervened, <b>Marlier</b> beat them both. A policeman named Brandt saw the disturbance and approached, whereupon <b>Marlier</b> attacked him. According to the police report, <b>Marlier</b> was taken to the police precinct. A wild scene ensued, the furious <b>Marlier</b> accosting everyone in sight. <b>Marlier</b> was sentenced to pay a 600 mark fine. Marlier's wife divorced him in 1922 because he beat her.|$|R
50|$|Ernst <b>Marlier</b> {{was the son}} of Philipp <b>Marlier,</b> {{a postal}} {{official}} (died 1902), and Mathilda <b>Marlier</b> (née Forkeln).

50|$|In 1903 <b>Marlier</b> {{settled in}} Berlin (Kurfürstenstrasse 173a, later Sternstrasse 22), where he founded {{multiple}} drug firms (Chemische Fabrik Dr. Schröder GmbH, Chemische Fabrik Dr. Hartmann GmbH, Chemische Fabrik Dr. Wagner und <b>Marlier,</b> and the coal wholesaler Julius <b>Marlier).</b> By 1907 <b>Marlier</b> was already {{having problems with}} police headquarters, which warned that Marlier’s preparations “did not have the properties ascribed to them in their sales information.” Among the pharmaceuticals <b>Marlier</b> sold were Antipositin, Antineurasthin, Renascin, Slankal, Levathin, Visnervin, Vitalito and Hämasol.|$|R
25|$|In 1684, Louis XIV {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a château in the proximity of an aqueduct built to bring water drawn from the Seine by the Machine de <b>Marly</b> to the Château de <b>Marly.</b> The king gave the building to Baron Arnold de Ville, the engineer of Liège who had conceived the hydraulic installation.

25|$|Following the French Revolution, two equestrian statues, made in 1745 by Nicolas and Guillaume Coustou, were {{transferred}} from the former royal palace at <b>Marly</b> and placed {{at the beginning of}} the boulevard and park. After the downfall of Napoleon and the restoration of the French monarchy, the trees had to be replanted, because the occupation armies of the Russians, British and Prussians during the Hundred Days had camped in the park and used the trees for firewood.|$|E
25|$|Events soon overtook Necker's complex {{scheme of}} {{giving in to}} the Communes on some points while holding firm on others. No longer {{interested}} in Necker's advice, Louis XVI, {{under the influence of}} the courtiers of his privy council, resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On June 19, he ordered the Salle des États, the hall where the National Assembly met, closed, and remained at <b>Marly</b> for several days while he prepared his address.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} contract of 25 February 1916 {{it had been}} stipulated that all four hundred units would be delivered that same year: the first hundred by 25 August and the last by 25 November, completing the full order in nine months. Because Schneider had no experience in tracked armoured fighting vehicle production and a true pilot model was lacking, this was highly optimistic. Also the Schneider company had expected {{to be able to}} employ the other major French arms producer, the Forges et Aciéries de la Marine et d'Homécourt, as a subcontractor but this rival proceeded to develop from the alternative prototype ordered by Mourret a heavier tank design, the Saint-Chamond. As a result, the first prototype could only be presented to the Ministry of Armament on 4 August. The Schneider subsidiary Société d'outillage mécanique et d'usinage d'artillerie or SOMUA at Saint Ouen near Paris was only on 5 September able to finish the first vehicle chassis, which would on 8 September be delivered at the training centre at <b>Marly.</b> The first Army tests were carried out on 12 September. On {{the original}} deadline of 25 November the total had risen to just eight vehicles; on 4 January 1917 thirty-two were present. To aggravate matters, these were training vehicles, not fitted with hardened armour but boiler plate.|$|E

500|$|... {{formations}} in {{the area}} date from the Triassic and early Jurassic periods, and have been named Zerqa and Kurnub formations. The rock formations are marine sediments, remnants of the prehistoric Tethys Sea, which used to cover the area running roughly east–west, halfway across the present Dead Sea. Along the Zarqa, we find crystalline limestone alternating with shale. The next layer is a 20-30 meter high layer of gypsum, argillaceous <b>marly</b> lime, shales and iron-rich stone and sandstone. This layer is rich in fossils. The Zarqa valley was an important passageway connecting the Eastern Desert with the Jordan Valley.|$|E
500|$|Schwarz [...] also {{assigned}} {{an additional}} species to Knoetschkesuchus, K. guimarotae, which was originally {{classified as a}} species of Theriosuchus. As reflected by the specific name, K. guimarotae originates from the lignite layers of the Guimarota quarry, located near Leiria, Portugal. There are two primary vertebrate-bearing lignite strata within the so-called Guimarota-strata, which are separated by <b>marly</b> limestone and respectively known as the [...] "Fundschichten" [...] and [...] "Ruafolge" [...] subunits; K. guimarotae is known from both of these layers. They have been assigned to the Alcobaça Formation, a subunit of the Abadia Formation, which has been dated to the Kimmeridgian {{on the basis of}} fossil ostracods.|$|E
500|$|The Panxian locality, {{from where}} these {{specimens}} originated, {{is part of}} Member II of the Anisian (Middle Triassic) Guanling Formation, which was initially thought to be 230 million years old, but has most recently been dated to 244 ± 1.3 million years old based on uranium-lead dating. [...] Predominant deposits at this locality are composed of grey to dark grey <b>marly</b> limestone, as well as cherty limestone containing dolomite and bentonite bands. Dinocephalosaurus was specifically found in layer 90 of the Panxian deposits, a thin limestone layer which is traditionally assigned to the Upper Reptile Horizon (layers 87-90).

500|$|After {{three years}} in production, the Vedettes were given new names and a new, {{elongated}} body, with a more ornate front end and large tailfins, making the cars even more American-looking than before. [...] This {{was part of a}} styling trend shown by most large European cars of that period, which were, to some extent, inspired by American styling, as tailfins appeared on Peugeots, Fiats, BMC models (Pinin Farina-styled), Fords and even Mercedes-Benz cars of that era. The engine was uprated to [...] (now called Aquillon 84) but the fiscal qualification of the car remained unchanged. [...] Using the new body, the Versailles was replaced by Simca Vedette Beaulieu and the Régence by the Chambord, while the estate retained the Vedette <b>Marly</b> name.|$|E
