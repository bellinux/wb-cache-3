40|$|The Maastricht Treaty on Political Union (TEU) {{confirmed}} {{the principle of}} subsidiarity by which the implementation of Union policies should be allocated to the most appropriate level of administration authority.

40|$|Whilst {{few would}} dispute the motivational power of {{recognising}} exceptional {{performance in the}} workplace, it is unusual for texts on reward management to feature a chapter focusing solely on employee recognition schemes, separate from the related constructs of non-financial reward and total reward. There exists a sense of ambiguity around the concept of employee recognition – its meaning, constitution and role – which {{is reflected in the}} lack of scholarly research or theory development in this area, compared to other components of the reward system. This chapter is intended to extend thinking and practice around employee recognition and its management through detailed and focused consideration of its distinctive characteristics and role within contemporary organisations. In so doing, the chapter aims to stimulate empirical research into this increasingly widespread but under-explored area of reward management. Research which shows the effects of recognition on employees’ engagement and well-being, motivation and performance is balanced against evidence that employee recognition may have unintended dysfunctional consequences. Whilst acknowledging the traditional theoretical foundation of needs-based motivation and reinforcement theory, there is a consideration of social exchange theory as an alternative lens through which to view the effects of recognition on individuals and organisations. The chapter concludes by offering practical advice on the effective design and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> for recognising employee performance...|$|E

This article represents a review of the burgeoning literature on medical educa-tion. The focus is on encouraging teachers {{to improve the quality of}} students ’ learning. The educational ration-ale for some of the major current developments is con-sidered. Change imposes significant challenges for teachers and students, although there are helpful exam-ples from the literature. The curriculum must be internal-ly consistent, based on well-defined educational princi-ples and effectively managed. Goals or outcomes – broadly defined – must be debated and determined so that they are clear to staff, students and the community. Several interrelated issues must be considered and re-solved – student selection, specification of content, iden-tification of core clinical skills and broader academic and professional behaviours. The most effective educational processes must be determined in order to support active learning. Problem-based learning is now well estab-lished and its underlying principles are discussed. As-sessment of students must encourage learning and en-sure that well-defined academic and professional skills are achieved. Programmes must be subject to evaluation so that the quality of the experiences of students, staff and patients is progressively improved. In order to devel-op effective skills in teaching and in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> teachers need to be supported by good staff development. Copyright © 2004 S.

40|$|M. Tech. Project and {{programme}} management have become important organisational developments in today’s business environment. The growth in projects across different sectors and industries, and their capability to enable organisations {{to cope with}} change {{in order to remain}} in business has emphasised the importance of project, programme and portfolio activities. Although project management has provided a means of achieving goals that could not be achieved in traditional ways, the single project model has failed to address issues that arise when multiple and related projects are undertaken within an organisation. Programme management has then provided a means through which organisations achieve almost everything they undertake. It has been perceived as the strategy implementation vehicle that links the overall strategy of the organisation with the portfolio of projects. While the use of programmes and {{programme management}} has grown in organisations, its capability to secure the investment of corporation has not been proven. Numerous failure stories with dramatic consequences for the corporation as a whole have been reported. With the pace of new regulations that require the appropriate and responsible management of company affairs, considering the huge investment that corporations place in programmes, it has become important to devise an efficient and effective mechanism of overseeing these investments. This research addresses the need to improve programme performance and ensure compliance with corporate policies. It focus on the governance side to determine how IT programmes can be governed while making sure that there is enough established control responsibility and accountability to ensure the achievement of the programme strategic objectives. This has been addressed by identifying corporate, information technology and project governance requirements that have implications for IT programme management. This had led to the consolidation of implications identified from the Sarbanes Oxley Act, Control Objective for Information and Related Technology and the Guide to Governance of Project Management in order to provide an integrated view of overseeing the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes.</b> The value of the research is that it has devised a conceptual framework for IT programme management governance that provides a means to ensure both programme performance and compliance to governance requirements that pertain to corporations. The value of the framework is that it contains governance requirements that ensure an efficient and effective decision-making and delivery management, focused on achieving programme goals in a consistent manner while addressing appropriate risks, issues and events that can impede the programme outcome...|$|E
40|$|MM - P&DMThe Civil Service {{inefficiency}} in {{the last}} two to three decades prompted governments and international development partners to put more emphasis on the reforms in an effort to improve accountability and transparency. Despite these efforts the civil service continue to be shrouded with practices that defy accountability and transparency and total disregard of economic and efficient use of public resources; and therefore ineffective in service delivery. The argument presented contends that the political and administrative deficiencies or shortfalls inherent within government have resulted in poor financial and administrative management of public resources. These have destroyed the professional and social fiber of political leaders and public officials to the extent that pubic demands are sidelined to pursue interests of certain individuals who hold positions of power. In the process <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> and the financial management are inefficient weakening accountability and transparency. Weak accountability and transparency mechanisms have been manifested in reports of inefficiency, corruption, waste and misuse of public resources and poor service delivery as reflected in AG’s reports, the media and parliamentary debates. There are also gaps in the auditing of annual accounts the Parliament and the Executive turned a blind eye on this, indicative of lack of commitment towards accountability and transparency. The research has revealed the following as challenges for effecting accountability and transparency mechanisms: Information flow on the activities of the executive from the ministries to Parliament is inadequate, inaccurate and not submitted on time. The information system within the ministries is weak as there is missing information and some not properly recorded making information necessary for accountability and transparency inadequate. This was a result of non-compliance with the financial rules and regulations and these {{compounded by the fact that}} the work was not properly supervised and well monitored. Noncompliance was also aggravated by the fact that the authorities gave directives for incurring certain expenditures which were in conflict with the stipulated rules and iii regulations and therefore weakening the system of information recording. Financial management system has loopholes which hinder information recording for transparency to be achieved. There were also weak internal controls which went unabated resulting in inadequate information on the use of public funds. Inherent skill deficit aggravated inefficiency hence weak accountability and transparency. OAG responsible for ensuring that Parliament gets information receives poor quality information due to inaccessibility and unavailability of some information making the information insufficient and inaccurate. This coupled with shortfalls within the office such as lack of independence impedes the office from obtaining the quality of staff and lacks other resources such as equipment and vehicles which are necessary for carrying out its mandate efficiently.
