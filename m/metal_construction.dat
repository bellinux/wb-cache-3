5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; <b>metal</b> <b>construction</b> is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{evaluation}} of efficacy of operative treatment {{with the use}} of screw and hybrid <b>metal</b> <b>constructions</b> in idiopathic scoliosis associated with severe spine deformities. Material and methods: The outcomes of treatment of 34 patients aged 15 to 27 years old with severe scoliosisoperated on using screw <b>metal</b> <b>constructions,</b> were reviewed. 22 patients operated on {{with the use of}} hybrid <b>metal</b> <b>constructions,</b> made a control group. The groups were compared by the following parameters: pre- and postoperative Cobb angle, deformity mobility according to traction test, total sagittal/frontal balance, CT apical vertebra rotation, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, the number of instrumented vertebrae, and correction failure at 24 -hr spondylograms. Results: Group A (screw spine fixation) demonstrated better outcomes compared to group B (combined spine fixation) in the following parameters. Postoperative correction was 48 % and 41 %;apical vertebra rotation decreased from 78 ° to 55 ° (30 %) and from 74 ° to 59 °(21 %);total sagittal/frontal balance decreased from 39 / 25 mmto 14 / 12 mm (64 / 52 %) and from 35 / 26 mm to 16 / 15 mm (55 / 43 %), correspondingly. These results suggest better trunk compensation and postoperative correction in a group of patients with screw fixation. Smaller values of correction failure of the main arc as well as insignificant increase of thoracic kyphosis in the postoperative period (24 months) 3. 8 %/ 4. 3 % in group A compared to 6. 2 %/ 7. 5 % in group B testify to greater reliability and stability of ‘all screw’ <b>metal</b> <b>constructions.</b> The number of fixed elements was on average one more in a group with combined fixation (13 and 14, correspondingly) ...|$|R
