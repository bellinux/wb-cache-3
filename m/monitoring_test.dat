40|$|A {{clinical}} evaluation of an automated quantitative PCR assay, the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test,</b> version 2. 0 (v 2. 0), {{was carried out}} to assess the performance of this test in comparison {{with that of the}} previous, manual version, the AMPLICOR HCV <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test,</b> and with that of nested PCR. Serial dilutions of serum samples infected with genotype 1 b, 2 a, or 3, as well as synthetic RNA transcripts and serum samples derived from 87 patients with chronic hepatitis C and infected with genotype 1 a, 1 b, 2 a, 2 b, 3 a, 3 b, 4, or 5, were analyzed to determine the ability of the system to efficiently quantify various hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes. These experiments showed that the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test,</b> v 2. 0, has mean intra-assay, interassay, and interoperator coefficients of variation that range from 22 to 34. 5 % and a 3 -logarithm dynamic range, which spans from 103 to 106 copies/ml. Compared to the previous, manual version of the test, the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test,</b> v 2. 0, showed an improved efficacy for all genotypes, especially genotypes 2, 3, and 4, whose estimated concentrations were on average 1 logarithm higher. When used to monitor patients under treatment, however, both versions showed the same patterns of viremia, indicating that the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test,</b> v 2. 0, and the AMPLICOR HCV <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test</b> were equally effective at detecting relative viremia changes in serial samples.

40|$|In recent years, the {{trade-off}} between quality {{and cost of}} power system components has {{become a matter of}} interest for many utilities. The widespread use of costly electricity networks either in residential or industrial areas has encouraged service providers to find a proper strategy that will minimize the overall life-cycle cost while keeping components in good working condition. The power transformer, which represents approximately 60 % of the overall cost of the network, is ranked {{as one of the most}} important and expensive components. However, the transformer's sudden failure puts the system in a serious or critical condition which in most cases causes catastrophic loss to both utilities and customers. Significant attention has been given to monitoring and diagnostic techniques that observe any abnormal behaviour, assess the transformer's condition, and therefore minimize the probability of unplanned outage. Yet, applying many various <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> is not always applicable due to the following factors: some tests require the unit to be taken out from service for testing, insufficient availability of man power, and significant cost of applying all the tests. Thus, there is a vital demand for an intelligent method of minimizing the number of <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> without losing much information about the transformer's actual condition. In this research, data mining techniques have been employed to evaluate the transformer's state through intelligent selection criteria that determines the optimal number of <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> in cost-effectiveness. Feature selection technique based on ranker search method has been used to rank the <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> (features) in a priority sequence from their individual evaluation, and to select the most inductive tests that provide the most information about the unit's condition. When the measured data from <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> is collected and prepared, a diagnostic technique is applied to assess the condition of the transformer. In this regard, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been utilized to perform this task due to its robust classification accuracy. SVM is first applied to the full number of tests, and then the number of <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> is reduced by one after each classification process using the feature selection algorithm. The selected number of <b>monitoring</b> <b>tests</b> has shown the best possible accuracy the classifier can reach over the whole number of tests. Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifier has been used in the classification process for results comparison purposes. This proposed work contributes towards finding an intelligent method of evaluating the transformer state as well as minimizing the number of tests without losing much information about the unit's actual condition. Therefore, this method facilitates deciding a wise course of action regarding the transformer: either maintain, repair, or replace...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA levels in female genital tract and peripheral blood samples were compared using two commercial amplification technologies: the Roche AMPLICOR HIV- 1 <b>MONITOR</b> <b>test</b> and either the Organon Teknika nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA-QT) assay or the NucliSens assay.

We found a discordance rate of approximately 18 % between the two technologies for the detection of HIV- 1 in either the genital tract or peripheral blood samples.
