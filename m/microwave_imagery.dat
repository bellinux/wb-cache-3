5|$|Katia tracked west-northwestward {{for several}} days, steered by an {{expansive}} mid-level ridge to the cyclone's north. The strong upper-level winds that were affecting the cyclone gradually slackened, {{allowing for the}} expansion of a central dense overcast, the formation of a large curved band in the southern semicircle, and development of a banding eye on <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery.</b> Satellite intensity estimates increased accordingly, prompting the NHC to upgrade Katia to hurricane intensity at 00:00UTC on September1, while the storm was situated about 1,350miles (2,175km) east of the Leeward Islands. Although conditions were forecast to remain conducive for further intensification, water vapor satellite and <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> indicated that mid-level dry air began eroding eyewall convection immediately after the storm's upgrade, and upper-level winds eventually became less favorable as Katia approached a sharp upper-level trough. As a result, the storm maintained its status as a minimal hurricane for almost three days, with only a partial eyewall or banding-eye feature appearing on satellite.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within an environment of low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery.</b> The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|Olaf {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave {{that left the}} coast of Africa on September 17. Over {{the next two weeks}} it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low-level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles (645km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, a tool that estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30mph (50km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35mph (45km/h). <b>Microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> also indicated that the center was near the associated convection.

5|$|The {{depression}} tracked west to west-northwest upon classification, steered by a mid-level ridge centered {{over the}} southwestern United States. Deep convection increased in coverage and intensity {{over the following}} hours, leading {{to an increase in}} satellite intensity estimates; at 0600UTC, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. Within an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Flossie gradually intensified over the next two days; a mid-level eye became observable in <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> and intermittently on visible satellite imagery by early on July27. At 1200UTC, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994mb (hPa; 29.35inHg). Thereafter, Flossie crossed the 140th meridian west into the central Pacific Ocean, where the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) assumed responsibility of the system. Unfavorable upper-level winds in association with an upper-level trough began to impede the system's organization around this time, and it began a slow weakening trend.|$|E
5|$|Tracking west-northwestward {{and then}} westward along the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Mekkhala was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on January 15, due to its slightly improved structure. Mekkhala quickly intensified {{on the next day}} due to improved conditions; the wind shear became in-phase with the storm's motion while the robust divergent outflow persisted. Therefore, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm at 06:00UTC on January16, and later that day the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon, when a central dense overcast has significantly deepened and totally obscured the LLCC. Later, a <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> revealed that Mekkhala formed a ragged eyewall structure. The system reached peak intensity at 00:00UTC on January 17 with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph), although operationally the JMA estimated typhoon-force winds of 130km/h (80mph).|$|E
5|$|As Rafael moved northward, it {{continued}} to intensify rapidly in spite of moderate wind shear.

By the afternoon hours of that same day, data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael {{was on the verge}} of a weakening trend, attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear. Though the system retained hurricane-force winds, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October17, a process it completed by 1800UTC that same day after interacting with a cold front; at the time of the transition, Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia. The remnants of the cyclone looped around a larger extratropical low, over the north-central Atlantic Ocean for several days, before resuming its eastward motion.

50|$|Enawo {{developed}} into a severe tropical storm at around 18:00 UTC on 4 March, for showing an impressive embedded centre pattern associated with extremely cold cloud tops. The JTWC indicated a system equivalent to Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson scale at the same time. Météo-France upgraded Enawo to a tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 5 March, after it resumed a west to west-southwest track steered by the mid-troposphere ridge south of Madagascar. Enawo formed a ragged eye soon thanks to favourable conditions of excellent outflow, weaker vertical wind shear, and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the strengthening phase was halted for a half of day owing to a possible eyewall replacement cycle. Enawo started to intensify again and developed a well-defined eye indicated by both of satellite and <b>microwave</b> <b>imageries,</b> prompting Météo-France upgrading the system to an intense tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC based on the structural improvements.

5|$|Though the {{low-level}} center dissipated {{later that}} afternoon, a well-defined mid-level center lingered. The National Hurricane Center initially assessed {{the remnants of}} Ophelia with a low chance of regeneration as deep convection fired {{in association with the}} low, but these odds were subsequently increased to a medium chance by the afternoon hours of September26. A new low-level circulation developed within the well-organized cloud mass, and the system was once again given a high chance of tropical cyclone formation that evening. Following an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance flight into the system, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ophelia at 1200UTC on September27, and was once again upgraded to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h) 18hours later. As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the subtropical ridge positioned across the central Atlantic, it began to curve northward and intensify once again. Deep convection blossomed atop the center late on September28, and <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> depicted the development of an eye. Upper-level outflow expanded in all four quadrants of the cyclone by the afternoon hours of September29, and satellite intensity estimates continued to rise, prompting the NHC to upgrade Ophelia to a Category1 hurricane by 1800UTC that day.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the newly upgraded Erick tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico. A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July5, with tight banding noted on satellite. In addition, <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> indicated the formative stages of an eyewall. Initially vertically decoupled, the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours. A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite, and Erick was upgraded to Category1 hurricane status at 0600UTC, located approximately 105mi (170km) west-southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983mb (hPa; 29.03inHg) at 1200UTC. Shortly thereafter, its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend. At 1800UTC on July7, Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated. Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July9 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur, leading to degeneration into a remnant low-pressure area at 0600UTC. The remnant vortex persisted for a few more hours, before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of October8, Otto began to {{accelerate}} to the northeast under the increasing influence of a vertically deep trough off the US East Coast.

By 1200UTC, Otto's winds had reached 75mph (120km/h) while a mid-level eyewall began to form, prompting the NHC to upgrade the storm to a Category 1 hurricane south of Bermuda. Further strengthening ensued as the newly formed hurricane proceeded over the warm waters of the central Atlantic; <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> revealed the eye, though obscured, was vertically well established, marking Otto's peak strength with estimated winds of 85mph (140km/h).|$|E
50|$|Under low {{vertical}} {{wind shear}} and excellent outflow, the JTWC indicated that Vongfong had intensified into a typhoon at 06:00 UTC on October 4, {{as well as}} the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm at noon. With an improved northeastward channel into a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell, the storm briefly formed a pinhole eye on October 5, and the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon approximately 330 km (205 mi) east of Guam at 09:00 UTC. However, an area of subsidence north of the system and moderate to strong vertical wind shear began to impact Vongfong’s development later. The typhoon continued struggling to develop further early on October 6, as the broken convective banding was wrapping into a re-consolidating low-level circulation center. In the second half of day, <b>microwave</b> <b>imageries</b> revealed that a thick eyewall structure had formed under a large central dense overcast, and a new but larger eye began to develop.

500|$|On August18, {{an area of}} {{showers and}} {{thunderstorms}} associated with a trough formed about [...] west-southwest of Guam. Over the following day, a low-level circulation developed within the trough. Tracking slowly northeastward into a region of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and favorable divergence, continued development was anticipated. Later on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system was anticipated to develop further. Hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the low as a tropical depression. The JTWC followed suit early on August20, designating the system as Tropical Depression 16W. Following the development of convective banding features along the southern side of the low, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the former assigning it the name Bolaven. By this time, the storm began turning northwestward {{in response to a}} subtropical ridge south of Japan. Later on August20, <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite depicted a weak eye-like feature.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, {{the storm was}} located in a favorable environment with sea surface temperatures near [...] and fairly weak wind shear. As such, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated the storm to reach minimal hurricane intensity. Due to weak steering currents, the depression drifted westbound. Initially there was no change in organization, but on August 22, the cloud patterns improved. Based on estimates from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Frank on 1200 UTC August 22. Although deep convection had weakened, the NHC re-assessed the intensity at 60mph (95km/h) later that day. However, high levels of northeasterly wind shear caused the system to weaken slightly the next day, and by early August 24, the NHC was no longer forecasting the storm to become a hurricane. Despite the shear, there was a burst of deep convection later that day and a gradual increase in organization. <b>Microwave</b> <b>imagery</b> at 0834 and 1714 UTC showed a closed ring of thunderstorm activity that resembled an eye and by early August 25, the cyclone was just below hurricane intensity.|$|E
500|$|Throughout July6, {{convection}} steadily consolidated as {{the system}} acquired a more northerly component to its track.

50|$|By September 27, {{the wave}} was {{producing}} sustained tropical storm-force winds {{as reported by}} the Hurricane Hunters, although the system lacked the closed circulation required for classification as a tropical cyclone. While the system was passing near Barbados, radar imagery in the Lesser Antilles indicated that the circulation was becoming better organized. Another Hurricane Hunters flight on September 28 confirmed that a closed circulation developed, recorded surface winds of 58 mph, and observed hurricane-force gusts at the plane's level. These data in conjunction with <b>microwave</b> satellite <b>imagery</b> indicate the system became a tropical cyclone—earning the designation Tropical Storm Matthew—by 12:00 UTC that day; at this time, the storm was centered 20 mi (30 km) west-northwest of Barbados.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} JMA {{indicated}} that Haima had intensified into a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on October 16, the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon because of improving banding; six hours later, the JMA also upgraded Haima to a typhoon, approximately 140 km (85 mi) northeast of Yap. Tracking west-northwestward along a subtropical ridge to the north, Haima began {{to form an}} eye. The typhoon entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility early on October 17 and received the name Lawin from PAGASA, shortly before it deepened further with a sharply-outlined eye. Later, an eyewall replacement cycle occurred, as <b>microwave</b> satellite <b>imagery</b> revealed a solid inner ring of deep convection with a secondary outer ring.|$|R
500|$|During {{the next}} six hours, Frank became much better {{organized}} with a large area of very deep convection near the center. Based on this, the NHC upgraded the system into a hurricane. Gradually intensifying, an eye became intermediately visible on infrared imagery and a persistent eye was visible via <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery.</b> On 1800 UTC, Frank reached its peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h) and 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg) while located [...] south of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. While at peak intensity, satellite imagery showed a small but distinct eye surrounded by a central dense overcast, or a large area of thunderstorm activity. Moving west-northwest, Frank began a weakening trend overnight as the eye became less defined. Continuing to weaken, Frank became less organized and its eye collapsed. On August 27, the NHC downgraded Frank into a tropical storm, with poorly organized convection located west of the center due to strong wind shear. As such, the agency predicted the storm to weaken into a tropical depression within the next 36 hours. Frank rapidly lost all thunderstorm activity because of cooler water, and the storms intensity was reduced to a swirl of clouds while it turned towards the north due to a mid-level trough. The cyclone weakened back into a tropical depression early on August28. Frank degenerated into a remnant low while located [...] southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The remnant low dissipated early on August29.|$|E
500|$|Located on {{the southwestern}} {{periphery}} of a subtropical ridge situated over southwestern Mexico, Flossie tracked generally west-southwestward after formation while intensifying. Upper-level outflow began {{to expand in}} all quadrants of the cyclone and spiral bands became prominent around the center on August9. An eyewall and associated mid-level eye-feature was observed on <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery,</b> but was obscured on conventional satellite imagery, that evening. Following a series of satellite intensity estimates {{and the presence of}} an eye on visible and infrared satellite imagery, Flossie was upgraded to a Category1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200UTC on August10. Despite forecasts of an increasingly unfavorable environment as the cyclone moved towards the Hawaiian Islands, Flossie continued to intensify. The hurricane unexpectedly began a period of rapid deepening during the overnight hours of August10, and by 0600UTC on August11, Flossie attained major hurricane intensity – a Category3 hurricane – with a quickly falling barometric pressure. Early morning satellite images revealed a [...] eye with cloud tops cooler than [...] surrounding the feature. Further intensification ensued as the storm entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC)'s area of responsibility that morning, and Flossie was upgraded to a Category4 hurricane by 1200UTC. Two hours later, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949mb (hPa; 28.02inHg), the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season.|$|E
500|$|At 1330UTC on December16, the Mauritius Meteorological Services {{designated}} {{the system as}} a moderate tropical storm, thus assigning it the name Amara.

During the subsequent hours, the storm began to slowly track west-southwest under the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge. Amara's circulation center consolidated and rainbands became more tightly wrapped around the center, at which time the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the system. Late on December17, Amara began to develop an eye, observable via <b>microwave</b> <b>imagery.</b> Based on the antecedent developments, Météo-France upgraded the system to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC the following day.

Situated in a location with low vertical wind shear and outspread outflow, Amara was forecast to continue strengthening, though {{at the same time the}} cyclone was expected to move very slowly due to its interaction with weak steering currents in between two subtropical ridges. Rapid intensification ensued throughout the latter hours of December18, coinciding with the development of a ragged eye feature within the tropical cyclone on infrared imagery. Météo-France upgraded Amara to intense tropical cyclone status at 0000UTC on December19. By this time the storm's central pressure had fallen to 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly after, however, Amara's once well-defined outflow pattern became suppressed, resulting in a slight weakening and a downgrade from intense tropical cyclone status just twelve hours later.|$|E

2500|$|Although dry air {{significantly}} reduced deep convection on 4 March, MFR upgraded Gafilo to a tropical cyclone {{because of a}} banding eye, when the system began to expand its clockwise circulation and track west-southwestwards. By dual outflow channels, Gafilo underwent rapid deepening and reached category 4 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on 5 March, as MFR also upgraded Gafilo to an intense tropical cyclone late on the same day. On 6 March, besides warm sea surface temperature above 29°C, the atypical third outflow channel from the west made conditions for the cyclone more favourable. Therefore, MFR upgraded Gafilo to a very intense tropical cyclone with a very well-defined circular and warm [...] diameter eye at 06Z, when it also reached category 5 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.

The storm peak intensity was 135mph (215km/h) and a peak pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg) while located [...] south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The peak intensity of Norbert is uncertain as aircraft-based wind speed observations were lower than estimates via Dvorak Technique. However, the cloud pattern became less impressive early on October 9, and was thus downgraded into a Category3 hurricane, with winds of 125mph (205km/h) as it moved. The eye began to erode and as such Norbert underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, where one eye is replaced by another.

[...] Banding features can be utilized to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center, using a ten degree logarithmic spiral. [...] Using the 85–92 GHz channels of polar-orbiting <b>microwave</b> satellite <b>imagery</b> can definitively locate the center within the CDO.|$|R
50|$|The central dense overcast, or CDO, of a {{tropical}} cyclone or strong subtropical cyclone {{is the large}} central area of thunderstorms surrounding its circulation center, caused by the formation of its eyewall. It can be round, angular, oval, or irregular in shape. This feature shows up in tropical cyclones of tropical storm or hurricane strength. How far the center is embedded within the CDO, and the temperature difference between the cloud tops within the CDO and the cyclone's eye, can help determine {{a tropical}} cyclone's intensity. Locating the center within the CDO {{can be a problem}} for strong tropical storms and with systems of minimal hurricane strength as its location can be obscured by the CDO's high cloud canopy. This center location problem can be resolved through the use of <b>microwave</b> satellite <b>imagery.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 27, a large {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Chuuk. On September 29, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical depression. On October 1, the system was upgraded into a tropical storm and named Maliksi. The large storm developed a mid-level circulation center, with <b>microwave</b> satellite <b>imagery</b> showing that the storm had become less organized during the morning hours of October 2 because it had become slightly elongated and on October 3, the JMA upgraded it to Severe Tropical Storm, and the storm's center soon passed over Iwo To. High wind shear and unfavorable conditions made it weaken as it started transitioning to an extratropical system. On October 4, it became fully extratropical, with wind shear from the southwest, which pushed most of the showers and thunderstorms northeast {{of the center of}} circulation.|$|R
