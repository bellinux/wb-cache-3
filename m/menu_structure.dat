Over the next several years TPG made several changes to the company that eventually brought the two sides to loggerheads that devolved into several lawsuits.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} topic of three-level <b>menu</b> <b>structures,</b> now commonly found in e-commerce web sites, by measuring the performance and preference effects of different menu location combinations. Two studies were conducted, each using 16 different participants. The first study compared combinations of left and top menu positions across three menu levels. The results indicated a benefit when the first (primary) menu level was located {{on the left side}} of the screen, and when second and third menu levels were grouped in the same plane, opposite from the primary menu. The second study included a comparison of right-side menus. The results confirmed the benefit of grouping the second and third menu levels in the same plane, and suggest the value of locating the primary menu level on the right side. Finally, users preferred primary menus that were located in the left or right planes rather than the top plane. The results have important implications for the design of multi-level web site <b>menu</b> <b>structures</b> and represent a first-step towards providing empirical-based guidelines to site designers...|$|R

The SPICE prototype system described here combines a spoken dialogue interface with a touch-screen display to allow for natural and efficient multimodal interaction in various usage scenarios.

40|$|Abstract- The {{spectrum}} analyser {{is a complex}} piece of instrumentation, which requires careful operator training to fully exploit its features.

A modern {{spectrum analyser}} thus offers the user an extensive array of functions and options, arranged in complex <b>menu</b> <b>structures.</b> A side-effect of this situation is that sometimes {{it may be difficult to}} retain a common conceptual view of the instrument operation, since a variety of factors and set-up parameters come into play. This paper proposes a theoretical analysis of spectrum analyser operation, with the aim of providing a conceptual framework that can be readily adapted to most practical situations...|$|R
