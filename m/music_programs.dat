40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} fourth-grade students’ extrinsic motivators for joining and continuing in a school instrumental <b>music</b> <b>program.</b> Three research questions were investigated: (a) What extrinsic motivators have influenced fourth-grade students’ initial interest and continuing participation in an instrumental <b>music</b> <b>program?</b> (b) What are the musical backgrounds of these students?
