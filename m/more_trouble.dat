5|$|At {{the heyday}} of Reformation in the Commonwealth, {{at the end of}} the 16th century, there were about one {{thousand}} Protestant congregations, nearly half of them Calvinist. Half a century later, only 50% of them had survived, with the burgher Lutheranism suffering lesser losses, the szlachta dominated Calvinism and Nontrinitarianism (Polish Brethren) the greatest. The closing of the Brethren Racovian Academy and a printing facility in Raków on charges of blasphemy in 1638 forewarned of <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> to come.|$|E
5|$|In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded {{through the}} streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station prior to its {{embarkation}} for the Middle East. The battalion's voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden. The ship made a stop at Perth, where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in <b>more</b> <b>trouble,</b> and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He {{was standing in the doorway}} of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have had}} great trouble {{determining}} the exact dispositions of the French fleet and even <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> assessing the casualties it {{suffered in the}} battle. During The Terror then raging in France, bureaucracy broke down and consequently records were patchy or non-existent. The French Navy was no exception and few ship's logs have survived, making an accurate order of battle difficult to discern. Those estimates which are available are often the work of British naval officers at the battle whose accounts frequently differ. Casualties too are almost impossible to establish exactly. French sources published after the battle give a figure of 3,000, but this number does not include those captured, which amounted to 3,500 alone. British estimates aboard captured ships alone are of 1,500 casualties and most historians agree that total French losses during the month-long campaign were around 7,000, {{as opposed to the}} British losses estimated at between 1,100 and 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{made his}} pit stop shortly thereafter, {{putting on the}} soft {{compound}} tyre, while Hamilton stayed out. In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. <b>More</b> <b>trouble</b> was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded. This incident sent the safety car out, bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} main Confederate army was marching through Pennsylvania, Lincoln {{was unable to}} give Meade more firepower. The vast {{majority}} of the 700,000 Federal soldiers (except for Grant's 70,000 near Vicksburg) were noncombatants, held static defensive posts that Lincoln feared to uncover, or like Rosecrans at Nashville, they were afraid to move. Urgently the President called for 100,000 civilian militiamen to turn out for the emergency; being unorganized, untrained, unequipped and poorly led, they were <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> than they were worth. When the battle began they broke and ran away.|$|E

25|$|A rematch between Vic Darchinyan and Nonito Donaire {{took place}} on 9 November 2013. The 37-year-old Darchinyan gave the 30-year-old Donaire a lot <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> than was expected, as this was {{intended}} to be an easy bounce-back fight for Donaire who was coming off his first loss in over a decade. Darchinyan fought a smarter fight and confused a sluggish Donaire for much of the first 8 rounds, but in the 9th round round was dropped and got up to be finished by TKO. At the time of the stoppage, Darchinyan was leading on the scorecards: 78-74, 78-74, and 76-76.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} so many {{seasoned}} troops from their Rhine and the Danube stations encouraged an assault across the lower Danube by the Carpi and other northern barbarians. However, Timesitheus, {{en route to the}} east through the Balkans, inflicted a serious defeat on the invaders in Thracia. He seems then to have followed the usual practice of Roman commanders after victories over barbarian peoples of obliging the defeated to provide contingents of troops. Such measures were intended not only to reinforce his army, but also to remove those restless young men who might have been disposed to make <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> in its absence.|$|E

The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15-day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it. Here {{it was found that the}} retinoid receptors which help transport vitamin A were of normal function.|$|E

25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|As for Die Walküre, {{the first}} act of this opera {{probably}} gave Wagner <b>more</b> <b>trouble</b> than any other act in the entire tetralogy. In his two prose sketches for it Wotan enters Hunding's house in his guise as Der Wanderer ("The Wanderer") and thrusts the sword into the ash tree, which Siegmund then withdraws only minutes later; the fully worked-out prose draft also brings Wotan onto the stage. It was only at a later stage {{in the evolution of}} the text that Wagner banished the Wanderer and his sword to the backstory which Sieglinde narrates to Siegmund. Now the sword is already embedded in the tree as the curtain goes up on Act 1 and Siegmund's withdrawal of it becomes a climactic piece of dramaturgy.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Valdemar {{learned about}} the abbot, monks, and nuns at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Michael's {{in the town of}} Schleswig, who had fallen into immoral {{behavior}} and had earned a reputation for drunkenness. Valdemar decided {{that the best way to}} reform the monks was to move them from the temptations in town, and establish a new convent, built in 1191, far enough away that the monks wouldn't cause <b>more</b> <b>trouble.</b> In 1192 the monks apparently were moved unwillingly to Güldenholm to begin the work on a new monastery. At some point, Güldenholm Abbey became Cistercian, with the monks working in the fields to earn their daily bread and meat. By 1193 Valdemar endowed Løgum Abbey with the tithe of Bjolderup (near Tinglev).|$|E
