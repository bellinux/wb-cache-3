5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept {{it in the same}} class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's <b>market</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E

500|$|While Kalidas primary {{language}} was Tamil, the film's actors spoke {{a variety of}} languages, including Tamil (Rajalakshmi), Telugu (Venkatesan) and Hindi (Prasad). Because Venkatesan's first language was Telugu, {{and he could not}} correctly pronounce Tamil words, his dialogue was in Telugu. According to Guy, Irani was initially unsure if the German sound recording equipment would record the Tamil language; to assuage his doubts, he had some actors speak and sing in Tamil, Venkatesan in Telugu, and, because the equipment had already recorded Hindi before, he had other actors speak Hindi; the equipment recorded each language clearly. Owing to the use of multiple languages, sources including Film News Anandan, Birgit Meyer, and Guy have refused to call Kalidas the first Tamil sound film; Guy instead called it India's first multilingual film. In the 2010 book Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology, Sowmya Dechamma states that Telugu dialogues were included in the film, apparently to [...] "increase its <b>market</b> <b>potential</b> in the two important language markets of southern India." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{provides}} {{a method to}} assess the <b>marketing</b> <b>potential</b> of communicating corporate social responsibility of (agricultural) supply chains. The willingness of small firms in agricultural supply chains to make available information about certain dimensions of CSR is measured and combined with the dimensions of CSR that are important for consumers. This will identify the CSR dimensions that are easiest to communicate and which are most needed by consumers. Moreover, small firms in agricultural supply chains are segmented {{based on the information}} they are willing to make available and consumers are segmented based on the CSR dimensions they consider to be important. The method is demonstrated for Dutch dairy supply chains but the method can easily be adapted to other (agricultural) supply chains. Transparency about the CSR dimension food safety has <b>marketing</b> <b>potential</b> for Dutch dairy supply chains and can be increased relatively simple. Transparency about the CSR dimension animal wellbeing also has good <b>marketing</b> <b>potential</b> but increasing the transparency about animal wellbeing is considered difficult. Transparency about the CSR dimensions environment, revenues and costs has little <b>marketing</b> <b>potential</b> for Dutch dairy supply chains. The existence of market segments with respect to needs for information about CSR shows that there are marketing opportunities for product differentiation because it is possible to match groups of farmers willing to provide information about CSR with market segments asking for information about CSR.
