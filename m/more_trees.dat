5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds <b>more</b> <b>trees,</b> and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E
5|$|Leaving behind six {{fatalities}} {{and forty}} more injuries, the tornado maintained its intensity {{as it moved}} into the Talladega National Forest. It downed {{a significant number of}} trees before moving into Bibb County north of Alabama State Highway 25. In Bibb County, the tornado continued moving northeastward through the Talladega National Forest at EF3 intensity, with thousands <b>more</b> <b>trees</b> being knocked down and partially debarked. Almost immediately after exiting the national forest, the tornado directly impacted the small community of Eoline along U.S. Highway 82, northwest of Brent and Centerville. Around one dozen mobile homes and single-family site-built homes were destroyed, while many more sustained anywhere from minor to major damage. Additionally, the Eoline Volunteer Fire Department and another business were destroyed. One fatality occurred in Eoline, in a vehicle near the fire department building, along with ten other injuries.|$|E

5|$|Northeast of Eoline, {{the tornado}} {{weakened}} to EF2 intensity, continuing to cause significant damage as it crossed County Road 9, Alabama State Highway 5, and County Road 26, south of West Blocton. Several mobile homes and site-built homes were either destroyed or sustained major damage. Along the path, thousands of trees were downed. The tornado continued to weaken {{as it moved}} {{to the east of}} West Blocton, continuing to knock down trees. <b>More</b> <b>trees</b> were downed as the tornado crossed the Cahaba River and lifted just northeast of Marvel at 6:55p.m. CDT (2355 UTC), not far from the Shelby County border.|$|E

25|$|As beetle populations {{increase}} or <b>more</b> <b>trees</b> become stressed because of drought or other causes, the population may quickly increase and spread. Healthy trees are then attacked, and huge areas of mature pine stands may be threatened or killed. Warm summers and mild winters {{play a role}} in both insect survival and the continuation and intensification of an outbreak. Adverse weather conditions (such as winter lows of -40°) can reduce the beetle populations and slow the spread, but the insects can recover quickly and resume their attack on otherwise healthy forests.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 he {{was invited}} to create a work for Documenta 7. He {{delivered}} a large pile of basalt stones. From above one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys's wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The Dia Art Foundation continues his project still and has planted <b>more</b> <b>trees</b> and paired them with basalt stones too.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of cultivating evergreens specifically to sell as Christmas trees {{dates back to}} 1901, when a 25,000tree Norway spruce farm was sown near Trenton, New Jersey. The commercial market for Christmas trees had started fifty years earlier when a farmer from the Catskill Mountains brought trees into New York City to sell. Despite these pioneering efforts, most people still obtained wild-grown Christmas trees from forests into the 1930s and 1940s. <b>More</b> <b>trees</b> were grown in plantations after World War II, and by the 1950s farmers were shearing and pruning trees to meet customer demands. The Christmas tree market burgeoned through the 1960s and 1970s, but from the late 1980s onward prices and the market for natural Christmas trees declined. In the early 21st century, nearly 98percent of all natural (non-artificial) Christmas trees sold worldwide were grown on tree farms.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1620s, English {{settlers}} {{from the}} Colony of Virginia began {{to trade with}} the Algonquians, in particular the Piscataway tribe of Southern Maryland. Because {{the northern part of}} the Chesapeake Bay area had <b>more</b> <b>trees,</b> there were also more beavers. The colonists from Virginia traded English cloth and metal tools in exchange for beaver pelts. This trade was supported by Lord Baltimore, who felt that more revenue could be gained from taxation of the fur trade than from tobacco farming. Lord Baltimore also wanted to maintain friendly relations with the native Algonquians in order to create a buffer from the Susquehannock, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe to the north that was hostile to the English presence. In exchange for cooperation with the English colonists, tribes on the Eastern Shore of the United States were given grants from English proprietors that protected their lands. The tribes paid for the grants by exchanging beaver belts.|$|E
25|$|This large rain-wrapped tornado {{touched down}} at 7:50p.m. CDT (0050 UTC) on May 31, {{southwest}} of Weldon Spring in St. Charles County, Missouri. It first produced EF1 damage as it downed trees, blew over empty trailers, and caused minor damage to construction equipment. It moved generally east-northeast into Weldon Spring Heights (on {{the south side}} of Weldon Spring) and caused roof, window, and solar panel damage to a few structures as well as downing <b>more</b> <b>trees</b> before crossing Interstate 64. The tornado continued moving east-northeast through densely populated residential areas of southern St. Charles County. Roofing was torn off of a middle school and blown , many houses suffered varying degrees of roof (from minor damage to removal of entire roof), wall (from minor damage to total collapse), and overall structural damage, and hundreds of trees were downed. Damage in this area ranged from EF1 to EF2. A shed was destroyed, a garage door was compromised and the roof was removed and blown away, another garage had a wall collapsed, and two more garages were completely destroyed. The tornado reached its maximum intensity to the east-northeast of Weldon Spring, west-southwest of St. Charles and Harvester, and south of St. Peters. Three adjacent frame homes at this location sustained total loss of their roofs and exterior walls, and this small pocket of damage was rated EF3. The tornado continued causing damage in residential areas further to the east and northeast, snapping many trees and causing roof and wall damage to many homes. A few homes had their roofs entirely ripped off, and damage along this portion of the path was rated EF1 to EF2. Crossing the Missouri River, the tornado moved into St. Louis County and Earth City, Bridgeton, and the northern side of Maryland Heights as it moved along Interstate 70 near its intersection with Interstate 270.|$|E

500|$|Castell Coch {{remained}} derelict; the antiquarian John Leland, visiting around 1536, {{described it}} as [...] "all in ruin, no big thing but high". The artist and illustrator Julius Caesar Ibbetson painted the castle in 1792, depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower, with a lime kiln in operation alongside the fortification. Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period.

Sheffield also has a very wide variety of habitat, comparing favourably with any city in the United Kingdom: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats.

500|$|Modifications {{were also}} {{made to the}} Neverwinter Nights 2 toolset with the {{intention}} of giving more options to module creators in the fan community and making it easier for players taking the role of the Dungeon Master.

[...] Over two dozen monsters were created for Mask of the Betrayer, such as new types of golem, dragons, and hagspawn. [...] New spell effects, character models, and environmental effects were also added; Saunders stated that the genasi models in particular had been a challenge for artists and he had originally opposed the inclusion of the new races because of this.|$|E
