[...] These numbers are still used by the National Park Service. [...] Historian David Wilson, however, {{points out that the}} large Loyalist size is attributed to reports by General MacDonald and Colonel Caswell. [...] MacDonald gave that figure to Caswell, and it represents a reasonable estimate of the number of men starting the march at Cross Creek. [...] Alexander Mclean, who was present at both Cross Creek and the battle, reported that only 800 Loyalists were present at the battle, as did Governor Martin. [...] The Patriot forces were also underreported since Caswell apparently casually grouped the ranger forces of John Ashe as part of Lillington's company in his report.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{went on to}} sue Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury James FitzGerald for libel on {{the grounds}} that he had been defamed in FitzGerald's letter to Governor of New Zealand George Grey while seeking Campbell's removal from office.

Campbell initially won the case but the verdict was overturned on appeal on the basis that FitzGerald's letter to the Governor was privileged, that Campbell had not proven that FitzGerald acted in malice, and that Campbell had <b>misstated</b> <b>the</b> alleged libel.|$|E

The representative agent, moreover, is normatively unrepresentative: although each agent dislikes information, the "representative" agent is indifferent.

5000|$|Along {{with the}} work of several other historians, Johnson’s River of Dark Dreams has {{recently}} drawn critical attention from economic historians, who have used empirical errors found in the work to suggest that the “New History of Capitalism” has paid insufficient attention to neo-classical economics.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} a domestic producer evading taxes and duties by <b>misstating</b> <b>the</b> price of an imported intermediate good. In a qualitative response model it is shown that goverment's revenue maximizing behavior implies a detection function which depends positively on the amount of misdeclaration. As a consequence there exists, for every combination of (linear) import tariff and (linear) income tax, a unique declared price of the imported good which maximizes the expected (true, but not declared) profit. Whether under- or overdeclaration is optimal depends on the relative magnitudes of tax and tariff rates, whereas the amount of misdeclaration is determined by the specification of the detection function and the form of punishment...|$|R
