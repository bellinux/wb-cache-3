More than 8,600 of the division's troops deployed during this operation. On 19 September 1994, the 1st Brigade conducted the Army's first air assault from aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport. This was the largest Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Reactivated {{again in}} 1985, the {{division}} was designated the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) to historically tie {{it to the}} World War II division and to also better describe its modern disposition.

The 1st Brigade consisted of three organic battalions: 1–32nd Infantry, 1–87th Infantry, and 2–22nd Infantry.

5|$|An army {{commanded}} by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The allies decided to divide their forces into two armies: a <b>multinational</b> <b>force</b> {{that included a}} single Brazilian division, and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. Against the wishes of Honório Hermeto, Caxias chose Manuel Marques de Sousa (later Count of Porto Alegre) to lead the former force. Caxias met and befriended Marques de Sousa, who had served under his command in the War of the Ragamuffins, during his trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839. The Brazilian division, led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom, thus ending the war. Caxias spent 17 January aboard the frigate Dom Afonso alongside John Pascoe Grenfell, taking stock of the port area of Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, selecting {{the best place to}} launch an amphibious attack. His plan was aborted once the news of the victory at Caseros arrived. As a reward {{for his role in the}} victory, Caxias was promoted to lieutenant general on 3 March, and raised to marquis on 26 June.|$|E

5|$|The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900. Arriving in Tientsin, the Australians {{provided}} 300 men to an 8,000-strong <b>multinational</b> <b>force</b> {{tasked with}} capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived {{too late to}} take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at Pao-ting Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found asylum after Peking was captured by western forces. The Victorians joined a force of 7,500 men on a ten-day march to the fort, once again only to find that it had already surrendered. The Victorians then garrisoned Tientsin and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in Peking. HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey, transport, and courier duties in the Gulf of Chihli, before departing in November. The naval brigades remained during the winter, unhappily performing policing and guard duties, as well as working as railwaymen and fire-fighters. They left China in March 1901, having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order. Six Australians died from sickness and injury, but none were killed as a result of enemy action.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 Italian {{forces were}} {{deployed}} to Lebanon (then racked by the Lebanese Civil War) together with American and French troops as the <b>Multinational</b> <b>Force</b> in Lebanon.

40|$|National Security AffairsDuring {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{remarkable}} increase in attention paid to <b>multinational</b> military <b>forces.</b> The idea of UN standing <b>multinational</b> maritime <b>forces</b> has emerged as a potentially important contributor to international peace, order and stability. The assignment of national contingents to such a force on a standing basis seems desirable, but so far there has been no international consensus on the establishment such as this force. This thesis proposes that a UN Standing <b>Multinational</b> Maritime <b>Force</b> can be an important contributor to international security. Establishing a UN standing <b>Multinational</b> Maritime <b>Force</b> raises a central question: is it possible to establish a UN standing <b>multinational</b> maritime <b>force?</b> What are the problems and constraints of such force in the UN context? The point of this thesis {{is that there is a}} dilemma between realities and ideals, so that the establishment of a UN Standing <b>Multinational</b> Maritime <b>Force</b> seems to be a dream foreseeable only in the distant future. This thesis highlights the political constraints and problems that complicate the creation of a standing <b>multinational</b> maritime <b>force</b> in terms of UN naval missions and supporting tasks. Consequently, this thesis attempts to demonstrate that to establish a standing <b>multinational</b> maritime <b>force</b> within the UN organization is impossible unless these constraints and problems are solved.
