After a normal approach the nose landing-gear fractured as it was lowered onto the runway, due {{to the presence of}} a fatigue-crack in the upper internal bore of the landing-gear <b>main</b> <b>fitting.</b> It was found that the crack had formed as a result of poor surface finish during manufacture, and the incomplete embodiment of a manufacturer's service bulletin, which the landing-gear maintenance records showed as being implemented at its last overhaul in June 2006.

(FLG) {{is interested in}} further developing their composite product family. Therefore it set out an assignment {{for the development of}} a conceptual design of a composite <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> of a cantilever type nose landing gear. This assignment has been conducted at FLG from the 23 rd of March 2015 to the 22 nd of January 2016. The <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> of the nose landing gear of the NH- 90 helicopter has been chosen as reference design. Through the use of analytical and numerical methods and tools, a conceptual design is developed which shows the technical feasibility of a composite <b>main</b> <b>fitting.</b> It was furthermore shown that a small size and highly specialized <b>main</b> <b>fitting,</b> as found on the NH- 90, does not result in a feasible business case. The weight savings are limited in comparison to its metal equivalent, and the manufacturing costs of the components are high. It is shown that the business case becomes more feasible for large main fittings, as found on medium to large commercial aircraft. Larger and thus heavier composite components are proven to be more cost-efficient. A case study has shown that the design is scalable with relative ease. It is thus recommended to investigate the potential of such large main fittings. This research has provided insight in future opportunities for the composite product family and has given FLG an outline of the conditions in which a composite <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> could achieve a feasible business case.

40|$|The <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> {{subassembly}} of main {{landing gear}} of an aircraft {{was sent to the}} laboratory for analyzing the mechanism and cause of failure. The subassembly was found broken at up-locking position. A part of the bearing was also found fractured and lost. Fractographic examination confirmed that the failure was by overload such as sudden impact. From gross fractographic features, it appears that in the sequence of failure, the plunger got fractured first resulting in fracturing of the bearing. Simultaneously, the hollow forged member made of Al-alloy got cracked along the forging-parting line with subsequent fracture.

We also show that our algorithm can be used for face recognition in low-resolutions where the conventional fitting algorithms fail. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In present work a new {{theoretical}} approach {{based on the}} modified three-element Eyring-Halsey mechanical model {{was used for the}} derivation of an equation, which describes the thermally-induced recovery of preloaded covalently crosslinked polymer. This approach takes into account the influence of crystallizable polymer network as well as of entangled slipped molecular chains. Modeling of the temperature dependences of shape-memory (SM) recovery strain and SM recovery rate detected at constant heating rate has been performed for three types of polyethylene with sufficiently different crystallinity and crosslink density at programming strain of 100 %. The results of modeling agree well with the experimental data. The values of material parameters determined by fitting correspond satisfactorily to the estimations existing in literature. It is shown that the contribution of the entangled slipped molecules to the total stored SM strain increases with increasing degree of branching and crosslink density. The physical sense of <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> parameters and their dependences on the material constants such as crystallinity are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} case study which attempts to implement a passive Ultra High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (UHF RFID) system on aircraft landing gear (LG) to permit component configuration management. It is shown that a monostatic RFID system with two reader antennas, one on the LG <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> {{and one in the}} wing bay allows up to 64 kbits of data to be associated with each LG component. A 7 dB system margin allows data on each LG component to be updated wirelessly and will also enable a passive UHF RFID-based LG health and usage monitoring system when tags with required sensors become available. Results from an electromagnetic simulation show that when a metal is illuminated by a nearby antenna the E-field distribution close to its surface is stronger than in free space. To explore if the stronger E-field can be used to enhance the performance of a conventional passive tag, a 5 cm × 6 mm × 3. 02 m aluminium bar has been selected as the tagging object and connected to the reader via an RF feed. It is shown that a conventional metal tag which has a maximum free space range of 1. 3 m when mounted on a metal plate can be detected up to 30 m along the aluminium bar from the RF feed. When orientated with the long axis normal to the metal surface a conventional passive tag with a dipole antenna can efficiently harvest the E- field and can be read at least 50 m away from the antenna feed. The proposed use of metal objects as a nearfield antenna is well suited to some applications, but in others a significant wireless path is still required. In such a case, a semi-passive tag can be used. It is demonstrated that a semi-passive tag only requires 14. 4 to be read over 42 m in a bistatic RFID system. Such a power consumption can be easily achieved by most energy harvesting techniques. It is demonstrated that a solar-powered semi-passive tag can be read at a range of 22 m, but its performance is still limited by multipath effects. A distributed antenna system (DAS) can be used to overcome these effects by using frequency and phase hopping techniques. It is demonstrated that 50 solar-powered semi-passive tags can be read with no missed detections over a 10 m × 20 m office area with 4 dB system margin...|$|E

Based on this, methods are easy to perform, non-destructive and fast, which {{make it possible to}} estimate this leaf area with precision, thus having high degree of importance, due to enable the observation and evaluation of plant growth in field conditions during the entire cycle. In this present work, the objective was to estimate the leaf area of five genotypes of sunflower in function of the linear measures taken from limbo, and the number of leaves per plant. The experiment was conducted at the experimental area of the Federal University Border South in the period from October 2015 to February 2016. The areas of the limbos, the leaf were determined by direct method and were measured from the length along the <b>main</b> <b>fitting</b> and the width perpendicular to the insertion of limbo in the petiole. For the total area, in addition to the direct method, has been used a destructive method in which the sheets were cut into disks, obtaining regressions for the genotypes and concluded that the best model is the one that uses the product of the linear dimensions, but the models that use only the width are satisfactory in addition to reducing the working time. A área foliar é considerada um critério indicativo de produtividade. Com base nisso, existem métodos de fácil execução, não destrutivos e rápidos, que possibilitam estimar essa área foliar com precisão, assim possuindo alto grau de importância, devido possibilitar a observação e a avaliação do crescimento das plantas em condições de campo durante todo ciclo.

We estimate spectral types and luminosity classes of the stars comprising the astrometric reference frame from R ≈ 2, 000 spectra, VJHK photometry, and reduced proper motions. From these we derive estimates of absolute parallaxes and introduce them into our model as observations with error. We constrain the three cluster members to have a 1 σ dispersion in distance less than 6. 4 pc, and find an average πabs = 7. 43 ± 0. 17 ± 0. 20 milliseconds of arc, where the second error is systematic due to member placement within the cluster. This parallax corresponds to a distance of 134. 6 ± 3. 1 pc or a distance modulus of (m − M) = 5. 65 ± 0. 05 for these three Pleiads, presuming a central location. This result agrees with three other independent determinations of the Pleiades distance. Presuming that the cluster depth systematic error can be significantly reduced because of the random placement of these many members within the cluster, these four independent measures yield a best-estimate Pleiades distance of πabs = 7. 49 ± 0. 07 milliseconds of arc, corresponding to a distance of 133. 5 ± 1. 2 pc or a distance modulus of (m − M) = 5. 63 ± 0. 02.
