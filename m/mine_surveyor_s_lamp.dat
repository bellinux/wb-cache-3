40|$|Abstract. Smart Laboratory is an {{automation}} system {{to facilitate the}} control of the electronic appliances located in a laboratory. In the present study, we developed a Smart Laboratory system using Raspberry Pi 2, in which the lamps and air-conditioning (AC) are as its object. To control lights is to use relay 12 VDC derived by GPIO of Raspberry Pi 2, while the AC control using a programming library LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control) is installed in the Raspberry Pi 2. To work the system in this study is based on the time delay control is based on two types of connection, i. e., Wi-Fi (1 st scenario) and PLC adapter (2 nd scenario). The results showed that the average time delay is obtained for the 1 st scenario of AC 1 = 1. 09 s, AC 2 = 0. 93 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 1 = 1. 152 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 2 = 1. 402 s, while in the 2 nd scenario of the AC button 1 = 1. 34 s, AC 2 = 1. 81 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 1 = 1. 28 <b>s,</b> <b>Lamp</b> 2 = 1. 483 s. The better performance is shown when the connection uses Wi-Fi adapter. Keywords: Raspberry Pi 2, Smart Home, Smart Laboratory, Delay, LIR...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the request to research government rules and regulations that are relative to Mine Survey and could impact on global mining companies in different countries in Africa, a framework has been established to assist and support many companies working in these countries. The framework guides investigations in determining the legal risks to the Company in general and Mine Surveying in particular. Legally appointed personnel fall directly under this risk profile. Furthermore, the primary activities and overlying acts and regulations form workable matrices to address all areas of compliance and risk within the Mine Surveying areas of responsibility. The framework {{takes into account the}} supporting activities which operate within the acts and regulations. These departments are generally not directly accountable to the legislation, but form part of the mining value chain and depend on Mine Surveying results and service. It is therefore appropriate that the investigation into the international component of the framework was conducted as well. The links to international codes and practices were established with special reference to Mine Surveying association and participation. The mining process was researched in its entirety. It was found that there are numerous government departments and associated laws prescribing compliance for <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveyors.</b> The framework describes the various levels of work so that all risk to people, property and equipment is tabled and applicable working standards and guidelines are put in place to mitigate such risk. A uniform standard can guide all <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveyors</b> in establishing the Survey Manual. This manual of standards drives levels of accuracy and therefore training and development of the individual <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveyor.</b> The major finding was that Mine Survey cannot be researched alone as it interfaces with several other mining departments, legal structures and possible international codes. This research has reported on the Ghanaian portion of a global mining company. The Company’s business units in other countries have been benchmarked as well. South African based mining companies have strong Mine Survey structures, while in countries such as Canada and Australia, Mine Surveying is a sub section of Engineering.
