5|$|Ancient Slavs {{developed}} {{a method of}} obtaining red dye from the larvae of the Polish cochineal.

5|$|Calshot Castle {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII.

5|$|Gravesend Blockhouse {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII.

5|$|In 1603 James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} {{the crown of}} England, bringing a period of peace between the two countries. The royal court left for London, {{and as a result}} – with the exceptions of occasional visits – building work on royal castles north of the border largely ceased. Some castles continued to have <b>modest</b> military utility into the eighteenth century. The royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie, Blackness and Ruthven Castle, continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built up until the 1640s. After the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that, while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more <b>modest</b> castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt.|$|E
