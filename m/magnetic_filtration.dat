50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet. Automatic transmissions in vehicles frequently have a magnet in the fluid pan to sequester magnetic particles and prolong the life of the media-type fluid filter. Some companies are manufacturing magnets that attach to the outside of an oil filter or magnetic drain plugs -- first invented and offered for cars and motorcycles in the mid-1930s -- to aid in capturing these metallic particles, though there is ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of such devices.|$|E
50|$|The raw materials, {{primarily}} {{wood waste}} from regional sawmills, are {{delivered to the}} factory. The wood waste is fed into pits to undergo <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> to remove any metallic parts. The wood waste is then ground into fine particles and whisked with hot air to remove any moisture. The wood particles are later processed through a large furnace with multiple hearths (called a retort) in a controlled-oxygen atmosphere. The particles are stacked in batches in a kiln that chars the wood without burning in a controlled-oxygen atmosphere. The wood is progressively charred as it drops from one hearth to the next. The charred wood particles are combined with the other ingredients, press formed into pillow-shaped briquettes and dried out before being packaged to be sold.|$|E

The aim of this thesis is an in-depth analysis of the magnetic separation of pollutants from water {{by means of a}} continuous-flow magnetic filter subjected to a field gradient produced by permanent magnets. This technique has the potential to improve times and efficiencies of both urban wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. It might also substitute industrial wastewater treatments. This technique combines a physico-chemical phase of adsorption and a <b>magnetic</b> phase of <b>filtration,</b> having the potential to bond magnetite with any conventional adsorbent powder.

40|$|This {{study used}} 454 pyrosequencing, Illumina {{high-throughput}} sequencing and metagenomic analysis to investigate bacterial pathogens {{and their potential}} virulence in a sewage treatment plant (STP) applying both conventional and advanced treatment processes. Pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing consistently demonstrated that Arcobacter genus occupied over 43. 42 % of total abundance of potential pathogens in the STP. At species level, potential pathogens Arcobacter butzleri, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumonia dominated in raw sewage, which was also confirmed by quantitative real time PCR. Illumina sequencing also revealed prevalence of various types of pathogenicity islands and virulence proteins in the STP. Most of the potential pathogens and virulence factors were eliminated in the STP, and the removal efficiency mainly depended on oxidation ditch. Compared with sand <b>filtration,</b> <b>magnetic</b> resin seemed to have higher removals {{in most of the}} potential pathogens and virulence factors. However, presence of the residual A. butzleri in the final effluent still deserves more concerns. The findings indicate that sewage acts as an important source of environmental pathogens, but STPs can effectively control their spread in the environment. Joint use of the high-throughput sequencing technologies is considered a reliable method for deep and comprehensive overview of environmental bacterial virulence...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of my thesis is to measure magnetic field gradient decay in an MR tomograph, process {{and evaluate the}} data measured and analyse the issue. The theoretical section focuses on {{the reasons for the}} gradient distortion which has a negative impact on NMR measuring techniques and it also describes options to eliminate the negative effects, focusing mainly on pre-emphasis filtration.

40|$|Low-template {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) samples are {{commonly}} found within forensic biological evidence. Low amounts of DNA become {{increasingly difficult to}} analyze as the allelic peaks become less distinguishable from instrumental noise. Forensic laboratories currently try to increase allele signal intensity through additional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles or enhancing capillary electrophoresis injection times or potentials. Purification of the post-PCR product may also be conducted as PCR reagents can compete with DNA fragments during electrokinetic injection. Though these strategies have proven useful, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio, low-template samples continue to exhibit allele drop-out due to the stochastic variation induced by the forensic DNA laboratory process. Further complicating analysis {{is the fact that}} low-template DNA samples are often exhausted as the full amount is needed for analysis. Thus, PCR can be considered a destructive technique. Since allele drop-out is hypothesized {{to be the result of}} 1) insufficient levels of amplicons and 2) sampling effects, it is desirable to obtain the original DNA template after amplification for future analysis. This would minimize the impact of 1) above. Thus, a novel method which isolates genomic DNA after PCR amplification has been developed. Amplification products were produced using biotinylated primers and cleaned from the solution with streptavidin-coated <b>magnetic</b> beads. <b>Filtration</b> was then used to remove remaining PCR reagents and primers. The result is a recovered sample containing the original genomic DNA. Re-amplification was then performed showing the method is successful. Although the method is capable of re-amplifying isolated DNA after PCR, there are points within the procedure that need to be optimized. For example, significant amounts of DNA are lost during the cleaning process and there is a high retention of the original amplified product. This study describes the optimization steps taken to reduce DNA loss, specifically through the filtration step. When method optimization is complete, low-template DNA samples could be analyzed recursively without being destroyed during PCR...|$|R

Good quality coating is important to reduce cost and concurrently achieve customer satisfaction. A systematic approach and applications of the basics and advanced management tools and techniques are used {{to improve the quality}} of the coated body. One of the proposed approach is to utilise the PDCA-cycle to reduce the defects on the electrodeposited body. In this study, the bits defect on the electrodeposited automobile bodies is investigated. Within the multilayer coating on bodies, the iron filing leads to the bits defect that appears on the electrodeposited coating surface. The iron filings arised from the metal assembly process carried out in the bodyshop, remained on the body during the painting process in paint shop. The defected surface can be removed through the process of sanding which is high in cost and requires extensive production time. Therefore, the best method to prevent the bits defects is by removing or reducing the iron filing through <b>filtration,</b> <b>magnetic</b> separation and surface adjustment process.

In addition, the use of magnetic fields has given positive results in various areas of science and life. So, the present thesis is devoted to the research of influence of magnetic field on performances of nanofiltration. In the literature part of the thesis a short description of membrane process and mechanism of reorientation of nanoparticals in magnetic field is presented.

40|$|Dye {{pollution}} in wastewater is a severe environmental problem because treating water containing dyes using conventional physical, chemical, and biological treatments is difficult. A conventional process {{is used to}} adsorb dyes and filter wastewater. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> is an emerging technology. In this study, magnetic Pycnoporus sanguineus-loaded alginate composite beads were employed to remove a dye solution. A white rot fungus, P. sanguineus, immobilized in alginate beads were used as a biosorbent to remove the dye solution. An alginate polymer could protect P. sanguineus in acidic environments. Superparamagnetic nanomaterials, iron oxide nanoparticles, were combined with alginate gels to form magnetic alginate composites.

40|$|According to the World Health Organization, nearly 3. 2 {{billion people}} {{are at risk of}} malaria. The most deadliest form of human malaria is caused by the {{pathogen}} Plasmodium falciparum, which has claimed over 400, 000 lives worldwide in 20151. Even when optimally treated with drug and donor blood therapies, severe malaria has a high mortality rate. The parasites target a patient’s red blood cells and convert them into paramagnetic units before eventually rupturing the host cell, further spreading the infection. Combination drug therapies using quinine and artemisinin derivatives are common but are either expensive or have associated toxicities from mis-dosing. Moreover, antimalarial drugs are becoming increasingly ineffective against the growing number of drug-resistant malaria strains. Combination drug and blood exchange therapies are often implemented to flush out malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBC) but consume a great quantity of donor blood, carry a high risk of transmitting other blood-borne diseases, and have no agreed upon advantage or disadvantage among clinicians. Due to the relative disadvantages of other treatment methods, small scale high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) devices, used in a variety of biological applications, may be another treatment option to consider. mPharesis (“magnetic apheresis”) is a proposed low-cost, disposable <b>magnetic</b> blood <b>filtration</b> device which continually removes iRBCs from a patient’s whole blood by capitalizing on the iRBC’s unique magnetic properties. The proposed treatment-scale system will provide emergency care with parameters similar to continuous hemofiltration systems in terms of blood flow rates (up to approximately 500 mL min- 1), vascular access, and treatment times (up to about 3 hours). A novel medium-scale high gradient magnetic separation device is detailed here. The device consists of a disposable photo-etched embedded wire array and acrylic layered housing on an external permanent magnet set. The magnetic force and flow field design were computationally optimized. In-vitro feasibility experiments were conducted at several flow rates and physiological hematocrits (Hct) using a blood mixture composed of healthy RBCs and a non-pathogenic paramagnetic blood analog called methemoglobin RBCs (metRBCs). The device was able to selectively remove paramagnetic RBCs without excessive loss of healthy RBCs. Simplified experiments were performed with 30 % Hct with 20 % metRBCs. At steady state, the concentration of metRBCs was reduced by 27. 0 ± 2. 2 % in a single pass at a flow rate of 77 μL min- 1 as compared to 1. 6 ± 0. 7 % in control experiments without a magnet present. The experimental paramagnetic RBC removal rate was over 380 times greater than similar published HGMS devices. These successful results were applied to a theoretical transport model. The model was designed to compare the parasite removal and Hct level changes between combination drug and exchange transfusion (ET) therapy versus treatment-scale mPharesis-drug therapy. When the mPharesis flow rate was set to typical continuous dialysis rates, treatment times and donor blood volumes were reduced for all 10 cases. Calculated treatment times were all less than 60 % of the reported ET-drug treatments, with times ranging from 47 to 71 minutes. The mPharesis-drug treatment was calculated to need between 4 % and 53 % less donor blood than the reported ET-drug treatments. Between 775 and 1772 mL of packed donor RBCs (3 to 6 units of whole blood) were estimated for the mPharesis-drug treatments, versus the average 5 to 20 units used during ET 2. Treatment reference charts were generated to provide time and donor blood volume estimates for a range of patient sizes and disease severities. Based on the maximum flow rate of 500 mL min- 1, a treatment-scale mPharesis system was estimated to be the size of three stacked briefcases, which is a feasible size for deployment in a clinical setting. Finally, the design, fabrication, and microscopic visualization of a simple, benchtop-fabricated continuous HGMS device was detailed. This proof-of-concept microfluidic device was implemented to test the effect of hematocrit and flow rate on the separation of mixtures of metRBCs (heat-treated and un-heated) and transparent ghost RBCs. An automated image processing protocol provided feasible cell concentration profiles for each flow and rheological condition with a 6. 5 to 9. 7 % lower sum than manual counting for three samples. For the no magnet conditions, the average near-magnet concentration of paramagnetic RBCs at the outlet (within 10 % of 130 μm channel height adjacent to the wire array) was between 1. 3 and 2. 4 times greater than the average {{of the rest of the}} flow field (degree of separation, DOS). The most effective separation was found to occur at the lowest flow rate 0. 4 μL min- 1 and with the 0. 5 % Hct metRBC sample with DOS= 26. The addition of 30 % ghost RBCs reduced the efficiency for all flow rates, with DOS= 7. 4 for best flow rate of 0. 4 μL min- 1. Heat treatment did not significantly affect separation with DOS= 7. 3, likely due to the low impact of the relatively low concentration of metRBCs (0. 5 %). The mesoscale fabrication and design process, clearance model, cell counting algorithm, and HGMS fabrication protocol and microscopy study described in this thesis provides a useful framework for future HGMS optimization and the further development of a clinical treatment system for severe malaria patients with often limited treatment options...|$|R

40|$|Ferromagnetic fluid {{is a kind}} of {{polyphase}} liquid, {{which is}} a stable colloid system of sufficiently small mono-domain magnetic particles covered by a film of surfactant and dispersed in a base liquid. Ferrofluids can be prepared in various base liquids such as water, hydrocarbons, mercury, etc., according to them utilisation. The basic properties of ferrofluids, i. e. the high magnetic polarisation of saturation and zero remanence predestine their application in various industrial branches including mineral processing and wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment by the application of ferrofluids under magnetic field resides in the action of the field on the ferrofluid added to the oil substance. Strongly magnetically polarisable fluids enable to increase the magnetic susceptibility of oil substances to suitable level for their removal from water by a magnetic way. It was observed that the oil drop with the weight of 3. 10 - 3 g and the ferrofluid concentration of 3 % starts to move {{in the direction of the}} magnetic intensity growth at the minimal value of 105 A. m- 1. It means that ordinary permanent magnet with the magnetic induction of 0. 1 T causes the movement of the oil drops with a relatively small admixture of ferrofluid on the water level. This knowledge is very important for the design of <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> device which will be able to separate oil substances from water. Modification of magnetic properties of weakly magnetic materials by ferrofluids was also carried out in the case of <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> of water contaminated by fine grains of copper concentrate created by chalcopyrite. After admixing the ferrofluid into the suspension the recovery of mineral to the magnetic filter product ranges from 75 % to 98 % depending on the kind of ferrofluid and pH values. It was observed that in the case of water-based ferrofluid the recovery decreases with the increasing of pH value. But, on the other hand the increasing of pH value under the application of kerosene-based ferrofluid results in the increasing recovery. According to the obtained recovery values, ferrofluids can be consider a good agent for the magnetic susceptibility modification. The magnetic sorbents consisting of magnetite seed covered by the film of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 were applied in the treatment of water polluted by copper ions. The magnetic sorbent was added in the solution during intensive mixing in the amount of 25 g per Litre of contaminated water.

To establish {{the sequence of events}} responsible for the forma-tion of these enzyme{ontaining gels, rates for the reactions of N-acryloxy-succinimide and N-acetoxysuccinimide with oxygen-, nitrogen-, ffid sulfur-containing nucleophiles were determined. These data suggest hat the rate of acylation of lysine e-amino groups by l/-hydroxysuccinimide-active sters is such that acylation and polyacrylamide gel formation are concurrent in the experiment procedures used. The yield of active, covalently-immobilized enzyme obtained by this procedure depends critically on active ester concen-tration and pH. To facilitate separation of these enzyme-containing gels from suspension, a ferrofluid- a surfactant-stabilized magnetite colloid- has been entrapped in them. The resulting magnetic gels can be manipulated using either conventional <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> and containment techniques, or more effective high-gradient procedures. Suspension polymerization can be used to produce spherical magnetic beads. The choice of suspending medium (a thixotropic carbon tetrachloride-n-heptane-silanized fumed silica mixture) and surface active agent (lecithin) are crucial to the success of this polymeri-zation procedure...|$|E
40|$|Herein, {{we report}} {{the first example}} of a supramolecular carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) -based magnetic depolluting agent for divalent metal ion (M 2 +) removal from aqueous solutions. In particular, magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (m-MWCNTs) coated with poly(vinylpyridine) (PVPy) self-aggregate in aqueous solutions that contain divalent metal ions (such as Zn 2 +, Cu 2 + and Pb 2 +) to form tight insoluble bundles in which the M 2 + ions remain trapped through pyridyl-M 2 +-pyridyl interactions. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> ultimately affords the efficient separation of the depolluted solution from the precipitated M 2 +-CNT agglomerates. Upon acid treatment, the supramolecular threads could be disassembled to afford the free CNT-polymer hybrid, thus allowing recycling of the depolluting agent. All materials and complexation/decomplexation steps were thoroughly characterised by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM, respectively). The quantification of the M 2 + residual concentrations in water was evaluated by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), which showed that, depending on the metal cation, this material can remove up to 99 % of the contaminant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to gain understanding of the interaction between <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> systems and ferrous contaminants in hydraulic fluid. Hydraulic systems are a critical part of most agricultural equipment, and contaminants in hydraulic fluid can have detrimental effects on machinery. Previous research has shown that Magnetic Array Filtration was able to increase the rate of contaminant removal in hydraulic systems. In this project, further testing was done to confirm the impact of the Magnetic Array Filtration collar on particle removal rate. In addition, a transparent polycarbonate filter casing was designed and built using the filter media from a Donaldson filter, which allowed a visual image of particle collection to be produced. A transparent linear filter was also designed to use for potential testing in high-flow applications. The physics involved with the magnetic array and the ferrous particles was also modeled for both of the designed filters. The results from these tests showed that the application of the Magnetic Array Filtration collar did increase the contaminant removal rate and the ferrous particles did accumulate within the magnetic field applied to the filter...|$|E

The optimal conditions of the high-gradient <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> providing the effective cleaning of the aqueous media simultaneously from ferro-, para- and diamagnetic particles have been substantiated. The technical requirements to the high-gradient magnetic filters on the constant magnets have been substantiated on base of the data about phase and dispersion composition of the corrosion products in the energetical and transport NPP. The high-gradient magnetic filter (HGMF) with magnetic system on base of the constant magnets of the rare-earth elements (HGMF-CM) has been developed and created.

Comprehensive microscopic (transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy) and spectroscopic (Raman, 57 Fe Mossbauer, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction) characterizations reveal the efficient confinement of magnetically-active Fe phases (α-Fe and Fe 3 C), while compositional evaluations through XPS, thermogravimetric analysis and gel electrophoresis confirm that mAb immobilization onto Fe@MWCNTs occurs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), confocal microscopy imaging and western blotting confirm the targeting action toward EGFR-overexpressing cell lines (EGFR+). In vitro <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> experiments demonstrate that a selective removal of EGFR+ cells from a mixed population of healthy cell lines could be obtained in very short times (≈ 10 min). Cytotoxicity evaluations by classic cell staining procedures after application of an electromagnetic radiation inducing magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), show a selective suppression of the EGFR+ cell line. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations of the hybrid mAb/Fe@MWCNTs conjugates nicely show how {{the presence of the}} CNT framework does not sterically affect the conformational properties of the two antigen binding regions, further supporting the biochemical findings...|$|E
40|$|In this presentation, {{a summary}} of {{research}} conducted {{in the area of}} electroseparations at the Chemical Technology Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory is presented. Fields-driven processes, including (1) phase equilibria modification by electric fields and (2) magnetically seeded separations, as well as transport-enhancement processes by electric fields,including (1) surface area generation and (2) electroconvection, are discussed. It is shown that electric fields can change the concentration of the vapor phase during the distillation of a binary mixture, which may have applications in separations by distillation that consume significant amounts of energy. It is also shown that addition of colloidal seed particles of high magnetic susceptibility to a suspension of non-magnetic particles and subsequent flocculation between seed and non-magnetic particles form paramagnetic flocs that can be removed by high- gradient <b>magnetic</b> <b>filtration.</b> Inverse electrostatic spraying, which is the spraying of a non-conductive fluid (such as air) into a conductive fluid (such as water), is introduced and compared with normal electrostatic spraying, which is the spraying of conductive fluid into a non-conductive fluid. Applications of normal electrostatic spraying, including the development of a bioreactor for oil desulfurization, and inverse electrostatic spraying, including ozonation of an aqueous system, are discussed. It is also shown that electroconvection, caused by electric fields,may result in simultaneous pumping, spraying, and mixing of fluids. In summary,new phenomena caused by electric fields are introduced and their potential applications in electroseparations are discussed...|$|E

Particle sizes and number concentrations were determined by an optical particle spectrometer and {{were found to be}} largely in the submicrometre range. Dust loadability increased greatly when a magnetic field was applied and showed no deterioration inJilter performance, even though the matrix had captured 10 times its own volume of dust. Particle penetrations of I per cent and less were achieved for submicrometre particles down to an optically measurable 0. 24 pm diameter.

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} for predicting {{the behavior of a}} magnetic filter. A magnetic filter mainly consists of a non-magnetic casing filled with ferromagnetic wire nets. The filter unit is introduced into a magnetic field to magnetize the wires. The strong magnetic field gradients {{in the vicinity of the}} wires give rise to a magnetic force which attracts particles with a sufficient magnetic quality in the direction of the wire surface. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>filtration</b> was applied for the separation of heavy metal precipitates. Due to the insufficient magnetic quality of the heavy metal hydroxides a flocculation process with magnetite particles has to be performed to make magnetite-bearing agglomerates which are easily magnetically separable. The fundamental equation describing the filter breakthrough results from the macroscopic conservation equation and the rate equation. The two filter constants incorporated can be predicted with single wire models which describes the particle attachment process inside the filter. To verify the models a test facility was developed which allowed the visual observation of the attachment of particles to a single wire by microscope. The particle tracks and the attachment zones around a magnetized single wire were measured by an image analyzing system. Thus, the results of theoretical calculation could be checked directly against experimental findings. The calculations were based upon two essential innovations: A new solution of the equation of particle motion at creeping flow conditions and a new expression describing the connection between the floc susceptibility and the floc size. In addition to the study of particle motion at single wires filter experiments were performed. With the filter constants resulting from the improved single wire models the calculation of the filter breakthrough was possible. (orig.)
