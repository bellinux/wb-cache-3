5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E
25|$|A third {{proposed}} {{reason was}} that this was the first election where electronic counting of papers had taken place. Many blamed e-counting for the increase in rejected papers, in part because the new machine counting did not go smoothly, with many counts abandoned during the early hours of Friday morning before all results had been counted. The main company concerned was DRS Ltd. Nevertheless, nearly all invalid ballots would have been spoiled no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were counted. However, the last minute redesign of ballot papers that was blamed for the high number of rejections in two electoral regions was done to make electronic voting easier.|$|E
25|$|Spawning {{patterns}} in forage fish are highly predictable. Some fisheries use {{knowledge of these}} patterns to harvest the forage species as they come together to spawn, removing the fish before they have actually spawned. Fishing during spawning periods or at other times when forage fish amass in large numbers {{can also be a}} blow to predators. Many predators, such as whales, tuna and sharks, have evolved to migrate long distances to specific sites for feeding and breeding. Their survival hinges on their finding these forage schools at their feeding grounds. The great ocean predators find that, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are adapted for speed, size, endurance or stealth, they are on the losing side when faced with the machinery of contemporary industrial fishing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{angle of}} the cube, /2, is the basis element that is {{discarded}} in the formula for the Dehn invariant, so the Dehn invariant of the cube is zero.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the most {{significant}} abortion rights case before the Supreme Court since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain [...] "admitting privileges" [...] at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions [...] "facially" [...] from the law at issue — that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> might be applied in any practical situation. According the Supreme Court the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures.|$|E
2500|$|While most camp inmates simply {{answered}} [...] "yes" [...] to both questions, {{several thousand}} — 17 {{percent of the}} total respondents, 20 percent of the Nisei — gave negative or qualified replies out of confusion, fear or anger at the wording and implications of the questionnaire. In regard to Question 27, many worried that expressing a willingness to serve would be equated with volunteering for combat, while others felt insulted at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them and their families. An affirmative answer to Question 28 brought up other issues. Some believed that renouncing their loyalty to Japan would suggest that they had at some point been loyal to Japan and disloyal to the United States. Many believed they were to be deported to Japan no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> answered; they feared an explicit disavowal of the Emperor would become known and make such resettlement extremely difficult.|$|E
