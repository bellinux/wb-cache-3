5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R.

This established a link between matrix <b>models</b> <b>and</b> M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand.

40|$|Practitioners {{of the art}} {{and science}} of pharmacometrics {{are well aware of}} the {{considerable}} effort required to successfully complete <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation activities for drug development programs.

This effort, coupled with the failure to explicitly design development programs around <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation, will continue to be an important obstacle, to the successful transition to model-based drug development. Challenges with timely data availability, high data discard rates, delays in completing <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation activities, and resistance of development teams to the use of <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation in decision making are all symptoms of an immature process capability for performing <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation...|$|R
