25|$|There {{are some}} {{versions}} of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not shave themselves and only <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.|$|E
25|$|Glory {{holes are}} {{especially}} associated with gay male culture, and anal or oral sex, {{but may also}} be used by bisexual or heterosexual men, or by <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not identify as gay, bisexual, or heterosexual.

25|$|In many societies, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not act in this {{traditional}} masculine way are ostracized {{by their peers}} and considered effeminate. In studies, young males from Cambodia, Mexico, Peru and South Africa, reported that they have participated in incidents where girls were coerced into sex (such as gang rapes) and that they did so {{as a way to}} prove their masculinity to their friends, or under peer pressure and fear that they would be rejected if they didn't participate in the assault.|$|E

25|$|A young Faroese {{person is}} {{normally}} handed down {{a set of}} children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are confirmed at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage.

500|$|Female {{smoking is}} a taboo in North Korea and is {{considered}} even more disgraceful than heavy drinking. Women are said to [...] "react with shock if you joke that maybe they secretly smoke in bathrooms". Smoking by older women, above the age of 45 to 50 is more tolerated, particularly in rural areas. In comparison, for men smoking is considered such an important social activity that <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not smoke can become outsiders at workplaces.|$|E
500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some {{who are unable to}} penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.|$|E

Bell argued that in order to understand adult sexual behavior it is necessary to understand early sexual feelings, which involve [...] "romantic attachments", with <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not see themselves as [...] "typically masculine" [...] being more likely to experience such attachments toward other men. Bell argued that falling in love is a more important criterion of sexual orientation than sexual behavior, and that it can be understood as [...] "the anticipation of self-completion through merger with the love object" [...] and a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] through the [...] "integration of the masculine and feminine components of ourselves through the psychological incorporation of the greater preponderance of masculine or feminine characteristics one supposes are possessed by the object of our romantic feelings." [...] Bell suggested that early romantic and subsequent erotic attachments tend to be focused on people [...] "perceived as essentially different".|$|E
500|$|Sheng nu (剩女; shèngnǚ; common translation: [...] "leftover women" [...] or [...] "leftover ladies") is a {{derogatory}} term made popular by the All-China Women's Federation that classifies {{women who}} remain unmarried {{in their late}} twenties and beyond. The term is most prominently used in China, including a state sponsored directive and program, but {{has been used to}} describe women across Asia, India, and North America. The term has gone on to become widely used in the mainstream media and {{has been the subject of}} several televisions series, magazine and newspaper articles, and book publications focusing on both the good and bad aspects of the term and surrounding culture. [...] Xu Xiaomin of The China Daily described the sheng nus as [...] "a social force to be reckoned with" [...] while others have argued the term should be taken as a positive to mean [...] "successful women". The slang term, 3S or 3S Women, meaning [...] "single, seventies (1970s), and stuck" [...] has also been used in place of sheng nu. The equivalent term for men, guang gun (光棍) meaning bare branches, is used to refer to <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not marry and thus do not add 'branches' to the family tree. Similarly, shengnan (剩男) or [...] "leftover men" [...] has also been used.|$|E

2500|$|For many <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> {{not wear}} suits for work, {{particularly}} in Western society, {{wearing a suit}} is reserved for special occasions, such as weddings, funerals, court appearances, and other more formal social events.

The combination of a tie, belt and vest can be tight and restrictive compared to contemporary casual wear, especially when these are purchased at minimal cost and quality for rare occasions, rather than being made to be worn comfortably. This tendency became prevalent enough that the Christian Science Monitor reported that a suit combined with a necktie and slacks was [...] "a design that guarantees that its wearer will be uncomfortable." ...|$|E
