Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin.

5|$|TBI {{is present}} in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The {{greatest}} number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24. Because TBI {{is more common in}} young people, its costs to society are high due to the loss of productive years to death and disability. The age groups <b>most</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80, and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65. The incidence of fall-related TBI in First-World countries is increasing as the population ages; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether combined assessment of autonomic tone plus cardiac electrical substrate identifies <b>most</b> patients <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of serious events after myocardial infarction (MI) and to compare assessment at 2 to 4 weeks versus 10 to 14 weeks after MI. BackgroundMethods to identify <b>most</b> patients <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of serious events after MI are required. MethodsPatients (n = 322) with an ejection fraction (EF) < 0. 50 in the initial week after MI were followed up for a median of 47 months. Serial assessment of autonomic tone, including heart rate turbulence (HRT), electrical substrate, including T-wave alternans (TWA), and EF was performed, interpreted blinded, and categorized using pre-specified cut-points where available. The primary outcome was cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest. All-cause mortality and fatal or nonfatal cardiac arrest were secondary outcomes. ResultsMean EF significantly increased over the initial 8 weeks after MI. Testing 2 to 4 weeks after MI did not reliably identify patients <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> whereas testing <b>at</b> 10 to 14 weeks did. The 20 % of patients with impaired HRT, abnormal exercise TWA, and an EF < 0. 50 beyond 8 weeks post-MI had a 5. 2 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 4 to 11. 3, p < 0. 001) higher adjusted risk of the primary outcome. This combination identified 52 % of those <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> with good positive (23 %; 95 % CI 17 % to 26 %) and negative (95 %; 95 % CI 93 % to 97 %) accuracy. Similar results were observed for the secondary outcomes. ConclusionsImpaired HRT, abnormal TWA, and an EF < 0. 50 beyond 8 weeks after MI reliably identify patients <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of serious events.

5|$|Wolves kill dogs on occasion, {{with some}} wolf populations relying on dogs as an {{important}} food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered {{a major problem in}} Scandinavia and Wisconsin. The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers, with older animals being <b>most</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are <b>most</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E

40|$|International audienceProductivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a {{methodology}} {{for evaluating the}} vulnerability of a stock based on its biological productivity and susceptibility to fishing. In this study, we evaluated the vulnerability of 60 stocks of tuna, billfishes and other teleosts caught by the tuna longline fleets operating in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean using a semi-quantitative PSA. We (a) evaluated {{the vulnerability of the}} species in the study areas; (b) compared the vulnerability of target and non-target species and oceans; (c) analyzed the sensitivity of data entry; and (d) compared the results of the PSA to other fully quantitative assessment methods. Istiophoridae exhibited the highest scores for vulnerability. The top 10 species <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> were: Atlantic Istiophorus albicans; Indian Ocean Istiompax indica; Atlantic Makaira nigricans and Thunnus alalunga; Indian Ocean Xiphias gladius; Atlantic T. albacares, Gempylus serpens, Ranzania laevis and X. gladius; and Indian Ocean T. alalunga. All species considered <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> were targeted or were commercialized bycatch, except for the Atlantic G. serpens and R. laevis which were discarded, and may be considered as a false positive. Those species and others <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> should be prioritized for further assessment and/or data collection. <b>Most</b> species <b>at</b> moderate <b>risk</b> were bycatch species kept for sale. Conversely, species classified <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> were mostly discarded. Overall, species <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> were overfished and/or subjected to overfishing. Moreover, all species considered to be within extinction risk (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable) were in the high-risk category. The good concordance between approaches corroborates the results of our analysis. PSA is not a replacement for traditional stock assessments, where a stock is assessed at regular intervals to provide management advice. It is of importance, however, where there is uncertaintyabout catches and life history parameters, since it can identify species <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> and where management action and data collection is required, e. g. for many species <b>at</b> high and <b>most</b> <b>at</b> moderate <b>risk</b> in the South Atlantic and Indian oceans...|$|R
