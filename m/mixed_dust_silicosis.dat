40|$|A 43 -year-old {{man with}} a long history of dyspnea which had {{progressively}} worsened over the preceding month is presented. He had worked in an antimony mine for 3 years. Radiologically, there were diffuse reticulonodular shadowing opacities in both lung parenchymas. Histopathologic examination of the open-lung biopsy specimen revealed alveolar spaces filled with dust-laden macrophages and amorphous proteinaceous semifluid, the latter being immunoreactive for Human Surfactant Apoprotein A, associated with marked interstitial accumulation of the similar-looking macrophages along the bronchovascular bundles and mild interstitial fibrosis. Silicotic nodules or <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> fibrosis were not seen.

40|$|AbstractWe {{estimate}} the aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) and heating rate profiles of <b>mixed</b> East Asian <b>dust</b> plumes {{in the solar}} wavelength region ranging from 0. 25 to 4. 0  μm using the Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) code. Vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficients and single-scattering albedos (SSA) were derived from measurements with a multi-wavelength Raman lidar system. The data are used as input parameters for our radiative transfer calculations. We considered four cases of radiative forcing in SBDART: 1. dust, 2. pollution, 3. <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> plume {{and the use of}} vertical profiles of SSA, and 4. <b>mixed</b> <b>dust</b> plumes and the use of column-averaged values of SSA. In our sensitivity study we examined the influence of SSA and aerosol layer height on our results. The ADRF at the surface and in the atmosphere shows a small dependence on the specific shape of the aerosol extinction vertical profile and its light-absorption property for all four cases. In contrast, {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA), the ADRF is largely affected by the vertical distribution of the aerosols extinction. This effect increases if the light-absorption capacity (decrease of SSA) of the aerosols increases. We find different radiative effects in situations in which two layers of aerosols had different light-absorption properties. The largest difference was observed at the TOA for an absorbing aerosol layer at high altitude in which we considered in one case the vertical profile of SSA and in another case the column-averaged SSA only. The ADRF at the TOA increases when the light-absorbing aerosol layer is located above 3  km altitude. The differences between height-resolved SSA, which can be obtained from lidar data, and total layer-mean SSA indicates that the use of a layer-mean SSA can be rather misleading as it can induce a large error in the calculation of the ADRF at the TOA, which in turn may cause errors in the vertical profiles of heating rates...|$|R
