500|$|Out of the {{starting}} gate, Secretariat and Sham raced evenly {{through the first}} turn. Through a half-mile, the two were even. Entering the backstretch and approaching three-quarters of a mile, Secretariat began to distance himself as Sham began to fade, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued to extend his advantage {{for the rest of}} the race, finishing 31 lengths over the second-place finisher, Twice a Prince. Twice a Prince started slowly and moved along the rail until reaching second position, passing Sham and outpacing My Gallant. Track announcer Chic Anderson described Secretariat's move from the backstretch with the famous call, [...] "Secretariat is widening now. He is <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> a tremendous machine!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ray's {{work has}} been {{described}} as full of humanism and universality, and of a deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity. The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa said, [...] "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon." [...] But his detractors find his films glacially slow, <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "majestic snail." [...] Some find his humanism simple-minded, and his work anti-modern; they criticize him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works of Ray's contemporaries, such as Jean-Luc Godard. As Stanley Kauffman wrote, some critics believe that Ray assumes that viewers [...] "can be interested in a film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives." [...] Ray said he could do nothing about the slow pace. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray's films were not slow, [...] "His work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river".|$|E
500|$|Santos {{called the}} {{character}} designs memorable, {{and found it}} refreshing that the anime featured an overweight person {{as one of its}} main characters. He noted that the backgrounds, while making use of muted and grayish tones, still had enough color to be visually appealing. One area he was disappointed with was how the series often makes use of [...] "talking head" [...] shots with little animation and low framerates. He found the music to set the mood well, but also that [...] "nothing particularly stands out". Silverman thought that the series' visuals were uneven for the first half, having some [...] "nice visual flair" [...] at some points, such as a black-and-white scene in episode 11, and some fan-service shots that she found ill-fitting. For the second half, she found the visuals and audio design to have improved, with a focus on visual themes such as clasped hands, and the use of highly detailed and more realistic art during stressful moments in the story. Foote enjoyed the visual presentation of Akihabara, which he described as [...] "lifeless but ever <b>moving,</b> <b>like</b> sand in the desert wind"; he called it evocative of morning street scenes in the directors' earlier work Serial Experiments Lain (1998), and proof that they had not lost their touch since then. Drew thought the visuals were of high quality throughout the series, and that they were a good, albeit less detailed, representation of the art style used in the Steins;Gate game.|$|E

500|$|In 1870, President Grant gave Conkling {{control over}} New York patronage, {{including}} the Customs House at the Port of New York. [...] Having become friendly with Murphy over their shared love of horses during summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, in July of that year, Grant appointed {{him to the}} Collector's position. [...] Murphy's reputation as a war profiteer and his association with Tammany Hall made him unacceptable to many of his own party, but Conkling convinced the Senate to confirm him. [...] The Collector was responsible for hiring hundreds of workers to collect the tariffs due at the United States' busiest port. Typically, these jobs were dispensed to adherents of the political machine responsible for appointing the Collector. Employees were required to make political contributions (known as [...] "assessments") back to the machine, which made the job a highly coveted political plum. [...] Murphy's unpopularity only increased as he replaced workers loyal to Senator Reuben Fenton's faction of the Republican party with those loyal to Conkling's. Eventually, the pressure to replace Murphy grew too great, and Grant asked for his resignation in December 1871. [...] Grant offered the position to John Augustus Griswold and William Orton, each of whom declined and recommended Arthur. Grant then nominated Arthur, with the New York Times commenting, [...] "his name very seldom rises {{to the surface of}} metropolitan life and yet <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> a mighty undercurrent this man during the last 10 years has done more to mold the course of the Republican Party in this state than any other one man in the country." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Tripods was {{described}} by Spielberg as [...] "graceful," [...] with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing {{a tribute to the}} original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself. The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the [...] "contradiction" [...] of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a [...] "terrestrial buoyance", in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> [...] "scary ballet dancers". [...] Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three – the Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each. Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering [...] "Steven {{wanted to make sure that}} these creatures were 150 feet tall", as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs, and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, [...] "this was going to be a horror movie for kids". So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. Digital [...] birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that [...] "you don't know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away." ...|$|E

2500|$|The hymn {{uses the}} term vātaraśana (वातरशन) which means [...] "girdled with wind". Some {{scholars}} have interpreted this to mean [...] "sky-clad, naked monk" [...] and therefore a synonym for Digambara (a Jainism sect). However, other scholars state that this could not be the correct interpretation because it is inconsistent with the words that immediately follow, [...] "wearing soil-hued garments". The context likely means that the poet is describing the [...] "munis" [...] as <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> the wind, their garments pressed by the wind. According to Olivelle, {{it is unlikely that}} the vātaraśana implies a class within the Vedic context.|$|E
2500|$|Pangolins {{have also}} been {{reported}} to roll away from danger by self-powered methods. Witnessed by a lion researcher [...] in the Serengeti in Africa, a group of lions surrounded a pangolin, but could not get purchase on it when it rolled into a ball, and so the lions sat around it waiting and dozing. Surrounded by lions, it would unroll itself slightly and give itself a push to roll some distance, until by doing this multiple times it could get {{far enough away from}} the lions to be safe. <b>Moving</b> <b>like</b> this would allow a pangolin to cover distance while still remaining in a protective armoured ball.|$|E

2500|$|Originally a cavalryman, Richthofen {{transferred}} to the Air Service in 1915, {{becoming one of the}} first members of Jasta (fighter squadron) 2 in 1916. He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, and during 1917 became leader of Jasta 11 and then the larger unit Jagdgeschwader (fighter wing) 1, better known as [...] "The Flying Circus" [...] or [...] "Richthofen's Circus" [...] because of the bright colours of its aircraft, and perhaps also {{because of the way the}} unit was transferred from one area of allied air activity to another - <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> a travelling circus, and frequently setting up in tents on improvised airfields. By 1918, Richthofen was regarded as a national hero in Germany, and respected by his enemies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} his efforts to promote the music of Charles Gounod in England, the {{composer}} disliked Chorley intensely. [...] When Gounod lived in England during the early 1870s, he wrote a satirical character piece for piano that {{was intended to be}} a parody of Chorley's personality. [...] It greatly amused Gounod's English patron, Georgina Weldon, who described Chorley as having a [...] "thin, sour, high-pitched sopranish voice" [...] and <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "stuffed red-haired monkey." [...] Gounod intended to publish the piece with a dedication to Chorley, but the latter died before this was possible. [...] Weldon then invented a new program for the piece, which was re-titled Funeral March of a Marionette. [...] It became popular as a concert piece, and in the 1950s, its opening phrases became well known as the theme music for the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} batches of Rubik's Cubes were {{released}} in May 1980, initial sales were modest, but Ideal began a television advertising {{campaign in the}} middle of the year which it supplemented with newspaper adverts. At the end of 1980 Rubik's Cube won a German Game of the Year special award, and won similar awards for best toy in the UK, France, and the US. By 1981 Rubik's Cube had become a craze, and it is estimated that in the period from 1980 to 1983 around 200 million Rubik's Cubes were sold worldwide. In March 1981 the first speedcubing championship organised by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich, and a Rubik's Cube was depicted on the front cover of Scientific American that same month. In June 1981 The Washington Post reported that the Rubik's Cube is [...] "a puzzle that's <b>moving</b> <b>like</b> fast food right now ... this year's Hoola Hoop or Bongo Board", and by September 1981 New Scientist noted that the cube had [...] "captivated the attention of children of ages from 7 to 70 all over the world this summer." ...|$|E
