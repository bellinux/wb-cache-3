Once Rohan became Prince he outlawed the slaying of dragons, but the warrior spirit of the Desertborn lived on in him and in the Desert people.

Ostvel was a strong, caring man, and he didn't try to make her use gifts she'd never wanted. Though Andry was furious, Alasen married Ostvel.

40|$|Association rule mining (ARM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and well researched area in data mining. Indirect association rule, a part of ARM, provides a different perspective in identifying the most useful infrequent patterns. Specifically, it refers to the property of high dependencies between two items that are rarely appeared together but indirectly occurred through another items. Besides generating nontrivial information, it also can implicitly reveal a new fact of relationship which cannot be directly determined using the typical interestingness measures. Therefore, in this paper we applied our novel algorithm called Mining Lease Association Rule (<b>MILAR)</b> and our measure called Critical Relative Support (CRS) to mine the indirect least association rule from the students' examination datasets. The experimental results show that the numbers of extracted indirect association rules are reduced when the threshold value of CRS is increased. This number is also lesser than the least association rule. In addition of decreasing the number of uninteresting rules, the obtained information also can be used by educators as a basis to improve their teaching and learning strategies in the future...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study investigates the oxidation-enhanced diffusion of phosphorus in silicon in both heavily doped boron and arsenic backgrounds at 900 and 1100 ~ This {{data can be}} modeled using the interstitial charge state levels to control the equilibrium concentration {{as a function of}} doping. The interstitials are assumed to be composed of only positive, negative, and neutral interstitial defects. The same values for the charge states are used to model previously published investigations of boron oxidation-enhanced diffusion under extrinsic isoeoncentration conditions. This indicates that these effects are not strongly dependent on the value of the fractional interstitialey, since two different dopants exhibit s <b>milar</b> behavior. Understanding oxidation enhanced iffusion is impor-tant for modern process fabrication technology. The use of the lightly doped drain (LDD) MOS devices for channel lengths below 2 izm is critical for reliability concerns.

40|$|The {{similarity}} of odor qualities by substituting the cis-type {{carbon-carbon double bond}} (cis -C=C-) for a thioether moiety (-S-) {{has been reported in}} some published papers. However, the degrees of the odor similarities were not reported. One of the objectives {{of this study is to}} measure the odor similarities by substituting the cis -C=C- for-S-. Another purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular features that contribute to the odor similarity in such cases. We employed the following two methods : 1) olfactory evaluations to measure the actual odor perception of the participants, and 2) computer chemistry to calculate the molecular features of the odorous compounds. As a result, it was confirmed that the odor quality did not significantly change in some cases though it was not a general trend when the cis -C=C- moiety was substituted for -S-. Similarities in the odors were mainly explained by the similarities in both the structural and electrostatic features based on the computational calculations. When the structural and electronic features were similar in two compounds, they are expected to produce si <b>milar</b> odors...|$|E

In particular, {{it is part of}} a polycistronic operon coding for transmembrane redox proteins 4, suggesting a different physiological function from that performed by TpI-c 3. The thermodynamic parameters of the haems and of an acid-base centre in the TplI-c 3 were determined by using the NMR and visible spectroscopies and by fitting the data to a five centres thermodynamic model 6. The thermodynamic features are correlated with the redox-linked structural differences reported in the literature 3 : positive cooperativity between the haems is not observed. The redox-Bohr effect is strongly associated with haem II instead of haem I as in the case for all of the TpI-c 3 s 5 ' 6.

40|$|Animals cop ing with operant {{conditioning}} tasks often show behav iors {{that are not}} recorded by keys, levers and si <b>milar</b> response transducers, Nevertheless, these adjunctive behav iors should not be disposed of by classifying them as inc idental. Often they {{are found to be}} at least parti ally inl~uenced by the ex perimentally programmed contingencies, and under certain conditions they can in turn influence conditi oned behav iors. Here we describe the occurrence and characteri stics of two such behaviors, stimulus grasping in operantl y key-pecking pigeons and intra-de lay stereotypies in a delayed matching-to-sample task with budgerigars. It is argued that for a proper account of these behaviors it is necessary to refer to a behavioral systems approach that appeals to longer ranging ontogenetic and phylogenetic hi stories than is usually cons idered in the psychological literature. The gaping towards on-key stimuli by pigeons is attributed to the hypothes is that operantly conditioned key-pecks probably relate to a grasp-pecking response that is normally executed towards non-edible ite ms covering food. The intra-delay behaviors shown by the budgerigars are assumed to have originated from stress- induced displacement responses that adventitiously came under the influence of diffe rentia l reinforcement contingencies.

This post hoc analysis of data from a randomised, doubleblind single-dose study of 84 children with PNE aged 6 - 12 years explored gender differences in sensitivity to desmopressin in children. Following water loading to suppress endogenous AVP, placebo or desmopres-sin 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 or 480 μg was administered when urinary production reached > 0. 13 mL/min/kg. The endpoints of urinary osmolality and duration of urinary-concentrating action (DOA) (above three thresholds: 125, 200 and 400 mOsm/kg) were analysed to compare efficacy in boys and girls, in each treatment group. The DOA and urinary osmolality were similar in both genders in the desmopressin 120 - 480 μg groups. Boys receiving desmopressin ODT 30 - 60 μg tended to increased urinary osmolality and experienced 1 - 2 hours longer DOA than girls. The same pattern of higher values in boys compared with girls was seen for all measures of urinary osmolality. Conclusion : In a limited sample of pre-pubertal children the antidiuretic response to desmopressin was largely similar between genders, in contrast to findings in adults. </p...|$|E
