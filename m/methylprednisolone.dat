5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as <b>methylprednisolone,</b> is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous <b>methylprednisolone</b> (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E

25|$|Attacks {{are treated}} with short courses of high dosage {{intravenous}} corticosteroids such as <b>methylprednisolone</b> IV.|$|E
25|$|For {{management}} of clinically active Graves' disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score >2) {{with at least}} mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, usually administered {{in the form of}} pulse intravenous <b>methylprednisolone.</b> Studies have consistently shown that pulse intravenous <b>methylprednisolone</b> is superior to oral glucocorticoids both in terms of efficacy and decreased side effects for managing Graves' orbitopathy.|$|E
25|$|In adrenal {{insufficiency}} and Addison's disease, dexamethasone is prescribed {{when the patient}} does not respond well to prednisone or <b>methylprednisolone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{pulmonary}} haemorrhage, {{high doses}} of cyclophosphamide with pulsed <b>methylprednisolone</b> may be used, or alternatively CYC, steroids, and plasma exchange.|$|E
25|$|No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} {{have been conducted}} on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as <b>methylprednisolone</b> or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with <b>methylprednisolone</b> have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of {{less than three weeks}} duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 16 {{children}} with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose <b>methylprednisolone,</b> one severe case that {{failed to respond to}} steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy- were treated with combined high-dose <b>methylprednisolone</b> and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered. A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids. A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor. This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} usually {{consists of}} the administration of corticosteroids, a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count and whether there is active bleeding: in urgent situations, infusions of dexamethasone or <b>methylprednisolone</b> may be used, while oral prednisone or prednisolone may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential side-effects that include osteoporosis, diabetes and cataracts.|$|E
25|$|Whether BBB {{dysfunction}} is {{the cause}} or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could {{also play a role}} in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called CD166), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is CXCL12, which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of CXCL13 under <b>methylprednisolone</b> therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|When eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is related}} to an illness such as cancer or parasitic infection, treatment of the underlying cause is effective in resolving the lung disease. When due to AEP or CEP, however, treatment with corticosteroids results in a rapid, dramatic resolution of symptoms {{over the course of}} one or two days. Either intravenous <b>methylprednisolone</b> or oral prednisone are most commonly used. In AEP, treatment is usually continued for a month after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four weeks total). In CEP, treatment is usually continued for three months after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four months total). Inhaled steroids such as fluticasone have been used effectively when discontinuation of oral prednisone has resulted in relapse.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or <b>methylprednisolone</b> 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
500|$|Swelling {{can cause}} further {{damage to the}} spinal cord by {{reducing}} the blood supply and causing ischemia, which can give rise to an ischemic cascade with a release of toxins that damages neurons. [...] Thus treatment is often geared toward limiting this secondary injury. [...] People are sometimes treated with drugs to reduce swelling. The corticosteroid drug <b>methylprednisolone</b> is commonly used within eight hours of the injury, but its use is controversial because of side effects. Studies have shown high dose <b>methylprednisolone</b> may improve outcomes if given within 6 hours of injury. However, the improvement shown by clinical trials has been inconclusive, and comes {{at the cost of}} increased risk of serious infection or sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia. Thus organizations that set clinical guidelines have increasingly stopped recommending <b>methylprednisolone</b> in the treatment of acute SCI.|$|E
500|$|Administration of {{high doses}} of {{intravenous}} corticosteroids, such as <b>methylprednisolone,</b> is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered {{over a period of}} three to five days, and has a well-established efficacy in promoting a faster recovery from disability after an attack. There is however insufficient evidence to indicate any significant impact on long-term disability of corticosteroid treatments. Steroids administered orally have a similar effectiveness and safety profile at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment. [...] Consequences of severe attacks which do not respond to corticosteroids might be treated by plasmapheresis.|$|E

2500|$|MS {{patients}} are also {{known to be}} CD46 defective, and this leads to Interleukin-10 (IL-10) deficiency, being this involved in the inflammatory reactions. Levels of IL-2, IL-10, and GM-CSF are lower in MS females than normal. IL6 is higher instead. These findings {{do not apply to}} men. This IL-10 interleukin could be related to the mechanism of action of <b>methylprednisolone,</b> together with CCL2. Interleukin IL-12 is also known to be associated with relapses, but this is unlikely {{to be related to the}} response to steroids ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, E. rostratum was {{responsible}} for the nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis in the U.S caused by contaminated corticosteroid injections from the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Massachusetts. As of October 23, 2013, there were 751 total infected individuals with 64 total deaths. Three hundred and twenty-five individuals presented with spinal or paraspinal infections, 233 of whom had meningitis and the balance presented with paraspinal or peripheral joint infections. In this incident, E.rostratum became highly virulent in the host after inoculation of the fungus into the spine. The preservative-free <b>methylprednisolone</b> acetate (MPA) injection caused limited immunological responsiveness at the site of inoculation, allowed the fungus to be vasculotropic thus resulting in a necrotizing fatal disease of the Central nervous system (CNS). [...] Post-mortem histological analysis also revealed that E. rostratum was angioinvasive, eliciting an inflammatory response with neutrophil predominance.|$|E
2500|$|Paramedics in many jurisdictions {{administer}} {{a variety}} of emergency medications; the individual medications vary widely, based on physician (medical director) direction and local law. These drugs may include Adenocard (Adenosine), which stops and resets a heart that is beating too rapidly, and Atropine, which speeds a heartbeat that is too slow. [...] The list may include sympathomimetics like dopamine for severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiogenic shock. Diabetics often benefit {{from the fact that}} paramedics are able to give D50W (Dextrose 50%) to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They can treat crisis and anxiety conditions. Some advanced paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Versed, Ativan, or Etomidate, and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and <b>methylprednisolone</b> is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, ketorolac. [...] This list is not representative of all jurisdictions, and EMS jurisdictions may vary greatly in what is permitted. Some jurisdictions may not permit administration of certain classes of drugs, or may use drugs other than the ones listed for the same purposes. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly.|$|E

However, aside from <b>methylprednisolone,</b> {{none of these}} developments have reached even limited use in the clinical care of human spinal cord injury in the US. <b>Methylprednisolone</b> can be given shortly after the injury but evidence for harmful side effects outweighs that for a benefit.
