30|$|Lee and Jeong [10] {{proposed}} a partially distributed certificate management {{system that can}} handle mobility of nodes. It minimizes routing loads and enhances expandability of network by allowing participating nodes to authenticate each other without being interrupted by joining the cluster. In their <b>model,</b> <b>certificate</b> creation time slightly rose {{as the number of}} bits increased. But, the pace of increase was much slower than that obtained from the use of existing certificate-based authentication protocol. In addition, the proposed model offered a steady delivery time in the certificate creation phase despite the increase in packet size. The efficiency and security can be therefore maintained in the network. It was also found that the efficiency of the network was not influenced by changes in the number of nodes (k) because partial certificates are consistently generated by coalition of existing member nodes without being interfered by nodes joining the cluster. Since the node requesting partially distributed certificates performs the whole process involving certificate creation, unnecessary system overhead can be eliminated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{implement}} both {{the efficiency and}} security in the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) network, we design a trusted small world overlay P 2 P network with the role based and reputation based access control policies, denoted as SW-R 2 P. The SW-R 2 P system integrates the small world topology with zero knowledge identification and Bayesian trust model. The zero knowledge identification is utilized to securely cluster all the peers into several groups without transferring any related information. The peer groups are then linked together to construct a trusted small world network based on the probabilities calculated by the Bayesian trust model. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the SW-R 2 P system achieves the performance with increased success rate in the resources lookup, strengthened robustness under the overwhelming traffic loadings, reduced reputation errors caused by the malicious peers and enhanced peer satisfaction rate for different trust metrics. In conclusion, the SW-R 2 P system collectively exploits the advantages of small world, zero knowledge identification and Bayesian trust model, therefore implementing a scalable, secure and efficient P 2 P network.

40|$|A {{localized}} trust {{management scheme}} for ad hoc networks Abstract — Wireless ad hoc networks are generating much interest, both in research {{literature and the}} telecommunication industry. The attractiveness of these networks {{lies in the fact}} that unlike other wireless networks, ad hoc networks are selfcontaining: the hosts constituting the networks can communicate with each other without reliance on centralized or specialized entities such as base stations. As these networks become more prominent, the need for adequate security mechanisms is increasingly apparent. Trust management is essential to the security framework of any network. In most traditional networks–both wired and wireless– centralized entities play pivotal roles in trust management. There are no centralized entities in ad hoc networks. This unique feature of ad hoc networks add many challenges in addressing this fundamental security issue: trust management. In this paper we present a trust management scheme that is based on the more reliable and structured hierarchical trust model. Our scheme is robust against malicious accusation exploits; it addresses explicit revocation of certificates without any input from centralized authorities, and it does so in such a way that the window of opportunity whereby revoked certificates can be accepted as valid, is practically eliminated.

40|$|One of {{the hardest}} tasks of a public key {{infrastructure}} (PKI) is to manage revocation. New communication paradigms push the revocation system to the limit and an accurate resource assessment is necessary before implementing a particular revocation distribution system. In this context, a precise <b>modeling</b> of <b>certificate</b> revocation is necessary. In this article, we analyze empirical data from real CAs to develop an accurate and rigorous <b>model</b> for <b>certificate</b> revocation. One of the key findings of our analysis is that the certificate revocation process is statistically self-similar. The proposed model {{is based on an}} autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) process. Then, using this model, we show how to build a synthetic revocation generator {{that can be used in}} simulations for resource assessment.

40|$|Certificate {{verification}} in PKI is {{a complex}} and time consuming process. In the classical PKI methodology, {{in order to obtain}} a public key and to accept a certificate as valid, a verifier needs to extract a certificate path from the PKI and to verify the certificates on this path recursively. Levi proposed a nested <b>certificate</b> <b>model</b> vvith the aim to simplify and speed up certificate verification. Such a nested certificate-based PKI significantly improves certificate verification, but it also requires a large {{increase in the number of}} issued certificates, which makes this model impractical for real life deployment. In order to solve this drawback of nested PKI, while retaining its speed in certificate verification, we propose in this paper the innovative concept of a compressed nested certificate, which is a significantly modified version of the nested <b>certificate</b> <b>model.</b> Compressed nested <b>certificate</b> PKI deploys compressed nested certificates which speed up and simplify certificate verification while keeping certificate load to a minimum, thus providing implementers the option of integrating it into the existing PKI model or building it separately as an independent model. <br /...|$|R

40|$|After {{years of}} {{swelling}} prison populations, the reentry into society {{of people with}} criminal convictions has become a central criminal justice issue. Scholars, advocates, judges, and lawmakers have repeatedly emphasized that, even after prison, punishment continues from severe civil penalties that are imposed by federal and state statutes on anyone with a conviction. To alleviate {{the impact of these}} punishments, they have increasingly endorsed state legislation that creates certificates of rehabilitation. Seven states offer these post- conviction certificates, and six others proposed such legislation in 2011. Many look to New York’s statute as the best model because it is the oldest and most robust. Yet no article has examined New York’s experience with Certificates of Rehabilitation. This Article draws lessons from the fifty-year history of New York’s Certificates of Rehabilitation to describe features of an ideal administrative mechanism that removes statutory barriers to reentry. I argue that a <b>model</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Rehabilitation statute will have a strong enforcement mechanism and clear directives for administering authorities. Successful implementation also requires committed administrative leadership and an effective means for making certificates accessible to the population they serve.

40|$|One of {{the main}} aims of {{certificate}} based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is to provide authentication in distributed systems.

PKI has been used to describe authentication in various types of applications ranging from e-commerce and web services applications to large scale systems such as Grid computing. This paper presents a formal approach for <b>modeling</b> <b>certificate</b> based PKI authentication. The approach makes use of two complementary models: one is state-based, described in Z, and the other is event-based, expressed in the Process Algebra of Hoare’s Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). The former will be used to capture the state of PKI key components used in the authentication process, the relationships between them, and model “back-end” operations on these components. Whereas the latter, CSP, will be used to model behavior, and in particular, “front-end” interactions and communications. Only when this authentication mechanism is properly formulated, reasoning about its correctness, vulnerabilities and usability can be scrutinized and possibly aided by automation...|$|R
40|$|We study {{certificates}} in {{static data}} structures. In the cell-probe <b>model,</b> <b>certificates</b> are the cell probes which can uniquely identify {{the answer to}} the query. As a natural notion of nondeterministic cell probes, lower bounds for certificates in data structures immediately imply deterministic cell-probe lower bounds. In spite of this extra power brought by nondeterminism, we prove that two widely used tools for cell-probe lower bounds: richness lemma of Miltersen et al. and direct-sum richness lemma of Patrascu and Thorup, both hold for certificates in data structures with even better parameters. Applying these lemmas and adopting existing reductions, we obtain certificate lower bounds for a variety of static data structure problems. These certificate lower bounds are at least as good as the highest known cell-probe lower bounds for the respective problems. In particular, for approximate near neighbor (ANN) problem in Hamming distance, our lower bound improves the state of the art. When the space is strictly linear, our lower bound for ANN in d-dimensional Hamming space becomes t=Omega(d), which along with the recent breakthrough for polynomial evaluation of Larsen, are the only two t=Omega(d) lower bounds ever proved for any problems in the cell-probe model.

40|$|International audienceIn modern {{information}} service architectures, security {{is one of}} the most critical criteria. Almost every standard on information security is concerned with internal control of an organization, and particularly with authentication. If an RP (relying party) has valuable information assets, and requires a high level to authentication for accepting access to the valuable assets, then a strong mechanism is required. Here, we focus on a trust <b>model</b> of <b>certificate</b> authentication. Conventionally, a trust <b>model</b> of <b>certificates</b> is defined as a validation of chains of certificates. However, today, this trust model does not function well because of complexity of paths and of requirement of security levels. In this paper, we propose "dynamic path validation," together with another trust model of PKI for controlling this situation. First, we propose Policy Authority. Policy Authority assigns a level of compliance (LoC) to CAs in its domain. LoC is evaluated in terms of a common criteria of Policy Authority. Moreover, it controls the path building with considerations of LoC. Therefore, we can flexibly evaluate levels of CP/CPS's in one server. In a typical bridge model, we need as many bridge CAs as the number of required levels of CP/CPS's. In our framework, instead, we can do the same task in a single server, by which we can save the cost of maintaining lists of trust anchors of multiple levels...|$|R

50|$|In the X.509 trust <b>model,</b> a <b>certificate</b> {{authority}} (CA) {{is responsible}} for signing certificates. These certificates act as an introduction between two parties, which means that a CA acts as a trusted third party. A CA processes requests from people or organizations requesting certificates (called subscribers), verifies the information, and potentially signs an end-entity certificate based on that information. To perform this role effectively, a CA needs to have one or more broadly trusted root certificates or intermediate certificates and the corresponding private keys. CAs may achieve this broad trust by having their root certificates included in popular software, or by obtaining a cross-signature from another CA delegating trust. Other CAs are trusted within a relatively small community, like a business, and are distributed by other mechanisms like Windows Group Policy.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Compare the {{discrimination}} of risk-adjustment models for primary cesarean delivery derived from medical record data and birth certificate data and {{determine if the}} two types of models yield similar hospital profiles of risk-adjusted cesarean delivery rates. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: The study involved 29, 234 women without prior cesarean delivery admitted for labor and delivery in 1993 - 95 to 20 hospitals in northeast Ohio for whom data abstracted from patient medical records and data from birth certificates could be linked. STUDY DESIGN: Three pairs of multivariate models of the risk of cesarean delivery were developed using (1) the full complement of variables in medical records or birth certificates; (2) variables that were common to the two sources; and (3) variables for which agreement between the two data sources was high. Using each of the six models, predicted rates of cesarean delivery were determined for each hospital. Hospitals were classified as outliers if observed and predicted rates of cesarean delivery differed (p <. 05). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Discrimination of the full medical record and birth <b>certificate</b> <b>models</b> was higher (p <. 001) than {{the discrimination}} of the more limited common and reliable variable models. Based on the full medical record model, six hospitals were classified as statistical (p <. 01) outliers (three high and three low). In contrast, the full birth <b>certificate</b> <b>model</b> identified five low and four high outliers, and classifications differed for seven of the 20 hospitals. Even so, the correlation between adjusted hospital rates was substantial (r =. 71). Interestingly, correlations between the full medical record model and the more limited common (r =. 84) and reliable (r =. 88) variable birth <b>certificate</b> <b>models</b> were higher, and differences in classification of hospital outlier status were fewer. CONCLUSION: Birth certificates can be used to develop cesarean delivery risk-adjustment models that have excellent discrimination. However, using the full complement of birth certificate variables may lead to biased hospital comparisons. In contrast, limiting models to data elements with known reliability may yield rankings that are more similar to rankings based on medical record data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{signatures}} replace handwritten signatures {{in electronic}} processes. In this context, non-repudiation {{is one of}} the most desired properties – yet in practice it cannot be provided by the signature schemes themselves. Therefore, additional mechanisms in the underlying public key infrastructure are required. In this work, we present a formal treatment of that issue. We extend the formal model for public key infrastructures by Maurer introducing transitions to make it dynamic. We use the extended model to evaluate the relationship between non-repudiation and revocation and prove that backdated revocation always destroys the non-repudiation property. We prove that forward secure signatures can be used to maintain non-repudiation, rendering the costly use of timestamping – as required by all existing solutions – superfluous. We also show how to realize this in practice, introducing a new index reporting protocol. Moreover, we show how this protocol can be used to support detection of malicious key usage, thereby improving the overall security of electronic signing. Besides, the index reporting protocol allows for a convenient realization of pay per use <b>models</b> for <b>certificate</b> pricing. ...|$|R
