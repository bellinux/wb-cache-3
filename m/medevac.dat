5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, the brigade {{deployed}} {{for the first}} time to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. As the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, <b>medevac</b> missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Merlin's first {{operational}} deployment {{was to the}} Balkans {{region in}} 2003. RAF Merlins were first deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Telic in 2004, supporting coalition forces and were operated as the main <b>medevac</b> asset in southern Iraq; both Flight Lieutenant Kev Harris and Flight Lieutenant Michelle Goodman were awarded the DFC during this period. Merlins routinely operated around Basra until Britain's withdrawal in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|The United States Marine Corps began crew {{training}} for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The Osprey's other operator, the U.S. Air Force, fielded their version of the tiltrotor in 2009. Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and <b>medevac</b> operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Kuwait.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a <b>medevac</b> unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that he believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Harpole {{was born}} in Deer Lodge, Montana in 1950, and raised in Denver, Colorado. After {{finishing}} high school, he joined the U.S. Army in 1968. From 1969-1971, he served served two tours of duty in the Vietnam War as a crew chief on a <b>medevac</b> helicopter. During his time in Vietnam, he received an Army Commendation Medal and nineteen Army Air Medals. After finishing his service, he enrolled in the University of New Mexico in 1971, where he was involved with Kappa Alpha. He graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the Anderson School of Management in 1976.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2016, Stars and Stripes {{reported}} that the 10th Combat Aviation Brigade will deploy 1,750 soldiers to eastern Europe in March 2017, in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve - as part of NATO efforts to reassure Eastern Europe {{in the face of}} an assertive Russia in response to Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014.

5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his wound in a <b>medevac</b> helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most primal urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn on {{each other in a}} homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember the moment he was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E
5|$|Military {{ambulances}} {{have historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles ambulances based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc ambulances, and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may be painted in appropriate colours, depending on the operational requirements (i.e. camouflage for field use, white for United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air ambulances, since they are extremely useful for <b>MEDEVAC.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a <b>medevac</b> was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Paul Allen pledged {{at least}} $100million toward {{the fight to}} end the Ebola virus {{epidemic}} in West Africa, making him the largest private donor in the Ebola crisis. He also created a website called TackleEbola.org {{as a way to}} spread awareness as well as serve as a way donors can fund projects in need. The site additionally highlights organizations working to stop Ebola that Allen supports such as International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières, Partners in Health, UNICEF and World Food Program USA. On April 21, 2015, Allen brought together key leaders in the Ebola fight at the Ebola Innovation Summit in San Francisco. The summit aimed to share key learnings and reinforce the need for continued action and support to bring the number of Ebola cases down to zero. As part of his ongoing commitment to end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Paul Allen Foundation partnered with the United States Department of State and MRIGlobal to develop a new first of its kind <b>medevac</b> biocontainment units. These units will be used by the U.S. State Department to help safely evacuate healthcare workers who might fall ill to infectious diseases such as Ebola.|$|E

Raul Taboada was also severely wounded, and Capt. Lefebvre passed command of D Company to SSgt. George Gonzales (who, unknown to Lefebvre, {{had also been}} wounded). While medical evacuation helicopters (<b>medevacs)</b> were supposed to transport the battalion's growing casualties, only two were evacuated by <b>medevacs</b> before the pilots called off their mission under intense fire from the NVA. Casualties were loaded onto the assault Hueys (lifting the battalion's forces to X-Ray), whose pilots carried load after load of wounded from the battlefield. 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry's intelligence officer Capt. Tom Metsker (who had been wounded) was fatally hit when helping Capt. Lefebvre aboard a Huey.|$|R

25|$|During the 2011 winter-over season, {{station manager}} Renee-Nicole Douceur {{experienced}} a stroke on August 27, resulting in {{loss of vision}} and cognitive function. Because the Amundsen–Scott base lacks diagnostic medical equipment such as an MRI or CT scan machine, station doctors were unable to fully evaluate {{the damage done by}} the stroke or the chance of recurrence. Physicians on site recommended a <b>medevac</b> flight as soon as possible for Douceur, but offsite doctors hired by Raytheon Polar Services (the company contracted to run the base) and the National Science Foundation disagreed with the severity of the situation. The National Science Foundation, which is the final authority on all flights and assumes all financial responsibility for the flights, denied the request for <b>medevac,</b> saying the weather was still too hazardous. Plans were made to evacuate Douceur on the first flight available. Douceur and her niece, believing Douceur's condition to be grave and believing an earlier <b>medevac</b> flight possible, contacted Senator Jeanne Shaheen for assistance; as the NSF continued to state Douceur's condition did not qualify for a <b>medevac</b> attempt and conditions at the base would not permit an earlier flight, Douceur and her supporters brought the situation to media attention.|$|E
50|$|Heliports {{are common}} {{features}} at hospitals where they serve to facilitate Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) and <b>MEDEVACs</b> for transferring patients {{into and out}} of hospital facilities. Some large trauma centers have multiple heliports while most small hospitals have just one. Heliports allow hospitals to accept patients that may be flown in from remote accident sites where there are no local hospitals or facilities capable of providing the level of emergency care required.|$|R
25|$|CCPs {{often work}} in fixed and rotary wing {{aircraft}} {{when the weather}} permits and staff are available, but systems such as the Toronto EMS Critical Care Transport Program work in land ambulances. ORNGE Transport operates both land and aircraft in Ontario. In British Columbia, CCP's work primarily in aircraft with a dedicated Critical Care Transport crew in Trail for long-distance transfers and a regular CCP street crew stationed in South Vancouver that often also performs <b>medevacs,</b> when necessary.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the AN/TPQ-10 was {{replaced}} by the more sophisticated AN/TPB-1D, which, after extensive service in Operation Desert Storm, was removed from service due to the growing technological sophistication of onboard navigation and weapons delivery systems in modern fixed and rotary wing aircraft. During Operation Desert Storm the DASC was operational for 984 hours. They controlled 4948 fixed wing missions and 839 rotary wing missions. During this time they received 375 immediate joint tactical air requests (JTARs), 114 immediate assault support requests (ASRs) and 153 immediate <b>medevacs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth {{teleconsultation}} {{system is}} designed to connect health providers in the Navy Medicine East Region to specialists at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. Methods: A review {{of the first year}} of the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system was performed. Data on each teleconsultation were extracted from the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system database and analyzed. Results: From June 2014 to May 2015 there have been 585 teleconsultations. Providers stationed on 36 ships/submarines and at 28 remote military treatment facilities have utilized the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system. Over 280 specialists in 34 different specialties were consulted. The median time to first response from a specialist was 6 [*]h and 8 min, with 75 % of all consults being addressed within 24 [*]h. Eighteen <b>medevacs</b> were recommended. Thirty-nine potential <b>medevacs</b> were prevented, and 100 potential civilian network deferrals were prevented, resulting in an estimated savings of over US$ 580, 000. Discussion: Based on the 1 -year metrics, Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth has provided improved access and quality of care to service members and their families throughout the Navy Medicine East Region. It has helped avoid over US$ 580, 000 in unnecessary cost burden. Further review at the 2 -year time interval will demonstrate the continued growth and effectiveness of the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system...|$|R
