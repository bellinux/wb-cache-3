25|$|In 1973, Glitter {{appeared}} at the London Palladium. It was a sell-out concert. In the same year his performance at the Rainbow Theatre was recorded and released as a live album, Remember <b>Me</b> <b>This</b> <b>Way.</b> Glitter undertook a world tour, performing in Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand. He continued to tour until 1976, and his temporary retirement from music.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Remember <b>Me</b> <b>This</b> <b>Way,</b> the {{documentary}} filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued {{for the first}} time on DVD. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, The Remixes and Live in Concert (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, The Best of Gary Glitter. In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as iTunes and eMusic.|$|E

60|$|VALIANT. No. They {{also told}} <b>me</b> that <b>this</b> <b>way</b> {{was full of}} deceivers, and of persons that laid wait there to turn good men out of the path.|$|R
2500|$|The final track, [...] "Can't Handle the Truth", {{was written}} by JoJo while {{production}} was handled by Boi-1da. Originally, the song was recorded for her third album but was used on the mixtape instead. When describing the song JoJo states [...] "It's about cheating and basically blaming it on the guy. Saying like 'You are responsible for my infidelity because you made <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> and you can't handle it because you're such a fucking idiot.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so; but I had {{guessed the}} truth, and I wished to know. God showed <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> {{how to do}} it, and how {{to let you know}} as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --All {{the leading}} provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow <b>me...</b> <b>This</b> <b>way...</b> Please, sir...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{is it to}} be Captain Aylmer? What have I {{done that}} you should use <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way?</b> It was not I who,--who,--made you unhappy at Aylmer Park." ...|$|R
60|$|VALIANT. No. They {{also told}} <b>me</b> that <b>this</b> <b>way</b> {{was full of}} deceivers,[290] and of persons that laid in wait there to turn good men out of the path.|$|R
6000|$|... "John," [...] {{said his}} mother, drawing her chair {{somewhat}} {{away from the}} table, [...] "if you flurry <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> you will drive {{me out of the}} room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The bells began ringing {{because she}} and he were expected, and my {{thoughts}} naturally dragged <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> Thank Heaven the battery leaves Markton {{in a few}} days, and then the precious place will know me no more!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say to {{him that}} I will be {{returning}} shortly--which must be true. Come, then. You may serve <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> The other way you will but have to endure ultimate arrest, and so leave Bianca at their mercy, which is precisely what they seek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{very nice}} of you fellows to treat <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> after all that has happened," [...] said the young cadet. [...] "Of course I'll do my full share of the work. When I was with Bill and Gabe they always {{wanted me to do}} everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then at {{last she}} spoke. [...] "I {{did not think that}} you would have treated <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> Captain Aylmer! I did not expect that you would insult me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot {{rode out}} upon {{the bridge and}} he called to those armed men: [...] "Can you tell <b>me</b> whether <b>this</b> <b>way</b> leads to the castle of Sir Mellegrans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you will}} expose <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> {{knowing that you}} make the {{marriage}} impossible--knowing that you doom my daughter to shame and misery {{for the rest of}} her life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, you're {{not going}} to catch <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way!</b> Don't forget, Porton. I'll see you later," [...] and thus speaking, Link Merwell turned and started away on a swift walk. Then, as Dave went after him, he broke into a run, and {{reaching}} the roadway, dived into the woods beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, so help me!" [...] Danny cried with abrupt conviction. [...] "I'll {{beat you}} {{to death in the}} ring, my boy--you monkeyin' with <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> Make out the articles, Kelly. Winner take all. Play it up in the sportin' columns. Tell 'em it's a grudge fight. I'll show this fresh kid a few." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harris, uneasily, [...] "you sure got-- Say, I {{certainly}} got {{to hand it}} to you, Father Appleby." [...] Like a big, blubbery, smear-faced school-boy he complained, [...] "Gee! I don't think it's fair, {{making a}} goat of <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> when I came to do you a service and take you home and all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What am I to do {{when you}} press <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way?</b> Remember that I do not tell you {{anything}} of my own knowledge. It is only what I think." ...|$|R
5000|$|Action: You {{can help}} <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> {{specific}} <b>way.</b> Will you help me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can talk}} to <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> urge <b>me</b> to be ambitious, and yet confess that you could give {{yourself}} {{to one of those}} drones of whom you speak with such scorn." ...|$|R
60|$|You always treated <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> but {{the time}} for it is past. I won't stand for your {{superior}} goodness any more. You really impressed me with {{it for a long}} time, and you made me walk small. But I know better now. A pretty game you've been playing--you, who are like any other woman. Well, you know where you were last night. So do I.|$|E
60|$|FROM {{that moment}} when I insulted old Mrs. Verrall I became representative, I {{was a man who}} stood for all the disinherited of the world. I had no hope of pride or {{pleasure}} left in me, I was raging rebellion against God and mankind. There were no more vague intentions swaying <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> and that; I was perfectly clear now upon what I meant to do. I would make my protest and die.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, we've got to {{remember}} she's sick, and I shall need a little sympathy myself if she keeps on at <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> I believe I'll tell her about my liver next time, and see how she likes it. Look here, Miss Claxon! Couldn't we get her off {{to some of those}} German watering places that are good for her complaints? I believe it would be the best thing for her--not to mention me." ...|$|E
60|$|Inveterate {{distrust}} {{in every}} sentence! If {{any other woman}} had treated <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> I should have put her letter into the fire, and should not have stirred from my comfortable house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] said I, {{touching}} my sombrero {{to him as}} I {{stood at}} the wheel one day, [...] "It's very hard to carry <b>me</b> off <b>this</b> <b>way</b> to purgatory. I shipped to go elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I say so? What was {{the good}} of {{bringing}} <b>me</b> all <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> when, if you'd only believed me, you might have saved me the trouble. Ain't I {{to be paid for}} that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{another to}} Amritzar,' said Kim, {{who had no}} notion of {{spending}} Mahbub Ali's money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa. 'The price is so much. The small money in return is just so much. I know {{the ways of the}} te-rain ... Never did yogi need chela as thou dost,' he went on merrily to the bewildered lama. 'They would have flung thee out at Mian Mir but for <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> <b>way!</b> Come!' He returned the money, keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket as his commission--the immemorial commission of Asia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Hawk dear, I couldn't even if--just now, I {{do want to}} say it, but I want to be fair. I am terribly {{happy to}} be in the house of Hawk's arms. I'm not afraid in it, even out here on the dark dunes--which Aunt Emma wouldn't--somehow--approve! But I do want to be fair to you, and I'm afraid I'm not, when I let you love <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> I don't want to hurt you. Ever. Perhaps it's egotistical of me, but I'm afraid you would be hurt if I let you kiss me and then {{afterward}} I decided I didn't love you at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, without saying," [...] she smiled. [...] "You are {{the only}} man, besides Dick, that has ever kissed <b>me</b> <b>this...</b> <b>way,</b> and that I have kissed this way. But I can't make up my mind. The triangle, as you call it, must be solved for me. I can't solve it myself. I compare the two of you, weigh you, measure you. I {{remember}} Dick and all our past years. And I consult my heart for you. And I don't know. I don't know. You are a great man, my great lover. But Dick is a greater man than you. You-- you are more clay, more--I grope to describe you--more human, I fancy. And that is why I love you more... or at least I think perhaps I do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. Mulbridge," [...] she said, [...] "I {{will not}} bear this any longer. I must know the worst--you {{have no right}} to treat <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> Tell <b>me</b> now--tell me instantly: will she live?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I need {{a clever}} detective myself," [...] he announced, confidentially. [...] "I'm anxious to {{discover}} what enemy is persecuting <b>me</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> Would it--er--be {{impossible for me to}} employ you to--er--look after my interests?" ...|$|R
60|$|STRAKER. I see. Just to {{encourage}} <b>me</b> to come <b>this</b> <b>way</b> again. Well, I'll think about it.|$|R
