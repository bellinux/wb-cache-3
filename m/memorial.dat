5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was {{the first}} <b>memorial</b> to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was {{unveiled}} on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) {{was found to have}} insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's Tyne Cot <b>Memorial</b> to the Missing. Other memorials followed: the Helles <b>Memorial</b> in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval <b>Memorial</b> on the Somme and the Arras <b>Memorial</b> designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra <b>Memorial</b> in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the Neuve-Chapelle <b>Memorial</b> for the forces of India, the Vimy <b>Memorial</b> by Canada, the Villers-Bretonneux <b>Memorial</b> by Australia, the Delville Wood <b>Memorial</b> by South Africa and the Beaumont-Hamel <b>Memorial</b> by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval <b>Memorial</b> in 1932, though the Vimy <b>Memorial</b> would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux <b>Memorial</b> until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{roadside}} <b>memorials</b> were personal <b>memorials,</b> {{but there}} is a modern trend toward public <b>memorials</b> of increasingly large size. Typically little or no effort is made to make the <b>memorials</b> accommodate the natural beauty of the landscape and many roadside <b>memorials,</b> over time, lack proper maintenance.|$|R
5|$|World War I <b>memorials</b> {{commemorate the}} events and the {{casualties}} of World War I. These war <b>memorials</b> include civic <b>memorials,</b> larger national monuments, war cemeteries, private <b>memorials</b> {{and a range of}} utilitarian designs such as halls and parks, dedicated to remembering those involved in the conflict. Huge numbers of <b>memorials</b> were built in the 1920s and 1930s, with around 176,000 erected in France alone. This was a new social phenomenon and marked a major cultural shift in how nations commemorated conflicts. Interest in World War I and its <b>memorials</b> faded after World War II, and did not increase again until the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the renovation of many existing <b>memorials</b> and the opening of new sites. Visitor numbers at many <b>memorials</b> increased significantly, while major national and civic <b>memorials</b> continue to be used for annual ceremonies remembering the war.|$|R

50|$|By 1986, {{there were}} 110 {{national}} monuments, <b>memorials,</b> and statues in Washington, D.C., and its immediate environs. The pressure {{to build more}} <b>memorials</b> on the National Mall was extremely heavy, with roughly 15 new proposals being introduced in each session of Congress. Approximately 25 additional <b>memorials</b> had been seriously proposed but lacked a congressional sponsor to introduced authorizing legislation in Congress. The sheer number of <b>memorials</b> being proposed {{was not the only}} problems. The <b>memorials</b> were increasingly large, and often included extensive exhibits that threatened to turn <b>memorials</b> into miniature museums.|$|R

5|$|Various {{different}} {{mechanisms for}} commissioning {{the construction of}} war <b>memorials</b> emerged during the inter-war period. In most of the nations involved in the conflict, the <b>memorials</b> erected in towns and cities were usually commissioned by local community leaders and other civic groups, with relatively little or no central state involvement. Some national organisations emerged, including the British War <b>Memorials</b> Committee and the Canadian War <b>Memorials</b> Fund, but these focused on narrow, limited projects, {{rather than trying to}} coordinate a national response. The local processes and committees could result in multiple <b>memorials</b> being created for the same community or event: the site of Verdun was commemorated by three different <b>memorials,</b> for example, while some British towns saw rival <b>memorials</b> created by competing groups in the community.|$|R
