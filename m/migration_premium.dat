The empirical results sustain the appropriateness of the estimation technique and show that there is a significant pay gap between migrants and nonmigrants; migrants seem to be positively selected and the <b>migration</b> <b>premium</b> is downward biased through OLS estimates. The endogeneity of migration shows up both as a negative intercept effect and as a positive slope effect, the second being larger then the first: bad knowledge of the local labor market and financial constraints lead migrants to accept a low basic wage but, due to relevant returns to their characteristics, they finally obtain an higher wage then the others. internal relocation, endogeneity, pay gap, <b>migration</b> <b>premium.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Given the <b>migration</b> <b>premium</b> {{previously}} {{identified in}} an impact evaluation approach, this paper asks {{the question of}} why migration is not more prominent, given such high premium associated with it. Using long-term household panel data drawn from rural Tanzania, Kagera for the period 1991 - 2004, this study aims to answer this question by exploring the contribution of education in the <b>migration</b> <b>premium.</b> By separating migrants into those that moved out of original villages but remained within Kagera and those who left the region, this study finds that, in consumption, the return on investment in education is higher at both destinations. However, whilst the higher return on education fully explains the gains associated with migration within Kagera, it only partly explains those of external migration. These findings suggest that welfare opportunities are higher at the destination and that an individual's limited investment in education {{plays a major role in}} preventing short-distance migration from becoming a significant source of raising welfare, which is not the case for long-distance migration. While education plays a role, it appears that other mechanisms may prohibit rural agents from exploiting the arbitrage opportunity when they migrate to the destination at a great distance from the source.

The vast majority of the migration that we observe is undertaken without documents. In contrast to Lacuesta (2006), we find that labor market performance in Mexico is positively related to one’s accumulated migration experience in the United States. Self-selection of high-skilled individuals into migration does not drive this result. We also investigate the possible mechanisms by which migration experience might improve earnings in Mexico.

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse the labour market {{performance}} of Romanian and Bulgarian return migrants and whether it really pays off to return home. We looked at the employment dynamics of returnees {{from the perspective of}} employment and occupational status switches to capture the effects of the work experience abroad on the upgrade in the home labour market. After predicting the wages and measuring the wage premium upon return, we apply an endogenous switching ordered probit model to estimate simultaneously the decision to migrate temporarily and the determinants of an upgrading of labour market performance upon return. The labor market performance of return migrants is analysed by using the 2005 World Bank Surveys in Bulgaria and Romania. The main conclusion is that the interdependence in the decision-making between return migration and labour market participation requires counting them simultaneously. While, the labour market participation upon return are strongly determined by the intentions of a permanent return and the expectation of return premiums for the skills and experience acquired abroad, the permanent intentions of return are determined by the experience abroad, the family ties and by intentions of other household members to migrate. return <b>migration,</b> wage <b>premium,</b> occupational upgrading...|$|R
3000|$|We {{therefore}} do {{two additional}} exercises. First, we exploit {{the fact that}} the hukou system has two components. One is the agricultural and non-agricultural division (or rural vs. urban), and the other is the specific location in which a hukou is registered. We introduce urban migrants into the analysis as a new reference group for rural migrants, as they have an urban hukou but are not registered in the location in which they are working. We find that urban migrants, on average, earn more than both urban residents and rural migrants. Since urban migrants differ from urban residents only in migrant status, we interpret any unexplained components of the decomposition as a <b>premium</b> associated with <b>migration.</b> This <b>premium</b> can also be interpreted as compensation for the loss of hukou-related benefits. This is consistent with the fact that urban migrants give up various benefits associated with a local hukou registration, which must be compensated for when they migrate.

30|$|Finally, the {{empirical}} literature provides mixed {{evidence on the}} economic performance of return migrants. Our model provides rationales for this phenomenon, and may explain cases of negative selection of return migrants.

In our model, there is first a potential negative selection at the first stage of migration since, as explained above, migrants who have relatively low and risky benefits from migration are the most likely to remit, and therefore are likely to receive support. Second, because of transaction costs, the more migrants remit, the more they are ready to concede low wages in the origin country. Furthermore, the low prospect, high risk migrants are the most likely to remit and are therefore the most susceptible to return and earn low wages.|$|E
40|$|With an {{increasing}} flow of low-skilled workers from developing economies to developed ones, migration {{is an issue}} of major interest. The Roy (1951) self-selection model has been suggested to explain migrant identity, a crucial factor in this context. But empirical work in this area has been subject to different and conflicting interpretations (e. g., studies in the Borjas (2007) volume). This paper revisits the issue, using a unique data set on Palestinian workers, which offers the possibility to directly study the predictions of the model. The data used encompass both migrants and stayers, sampled in a consistent way within a single micro survey. The results offer a nuanced view of migrant self-selection. Estimation results on observables show that migrants are less skilled than stayers. Specifically, a substantial <b>migration</b> <b>premium</b> lures migrant workers, while very low returns to skills in the foreign economy deter skilled workers, leading to negative self-selection. At the same time, on unobservables, migrants are found to be positively self-selected. The results on both dimensions are {{explained by the fact that}} migrants come from a relatively poor economy and are offered work in low-skill occupational tasks in a relatively rich economy...|$|E
40|$|Why do low-skilled workers {{choose to}} work in a foreign economy and what determines their wages? The Paper empirically {{implements}} the Roy self-selection model to study this question. It does so using a unique dataset on Palestinian workers working locally and in the Israeli economy. The data permit examination of both migrants and non-migrants on a comparable basis and are used to construct the relevant wage equations. The results show that key determinants of self-selection are a substantial <b>migration</b> <b>premium,</b> which lures migrant workers, and very low returns to observable skills in the foreign economy, which deter skilled workers. While the literature has found negative self-selection elsewhere, direct estimation of the relevant second moments - crucial for the determination of self selection - shows that the same findings can be re-interpreted. In particular, we find positive self-selection, leading to a reduction in wage inequality and to worker assignment such that wages are equalized across workers employed in the source and in the host economies. Correcting for selection bias demonstrates that estimates of skill premia for migrants - an important issue in the immigration literature - are upwardly biased if selection is not accounted for. migrant workers; migration premium; selection bias; self-selection; skill premia; wage inequality...|$|E

Also, by observing the actual wages of these groups in Romania, US, Austria and Spain we can measure the average and the skills-specific premium for migrating and for returning.

Thus, fewer people migrate to other districts and other locations in the West Bank. 14 This may be a reflection of lower wage gap between rural and non-rural areas, or that movement restrictions are the reason.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} effects of migration by providing evidence on the returns to working experience from western Europe in eastern European labour markets. In particular, using the 2003 Youth Central and Eastern Eurobarometer dataset, we test the hypothesis that there are differential returns to foreign as opposed to domestic work experience. Our analysis combines the Mincer wage equation framework and the Roy model of migration. The latter suggests that migration responds to net expected benefits. Hence, return migration is endogenous with respect to differential returns to foreign working experience. To allow for selectivity on observable or unobservable characteristics, we estimate an endogenous switching model in two steps. This procedure combines probit estimates of propensities to work and to acquire foreign work expericence respectively, and OLS estimates of earnings equations for stayers and movers, with the inclusion of nonselection hazards obtained in the first step. The expected wage increase is the difference between post-return migrants' wages and wages under similar conditions in the absence of migration. For any individual, only one of these measures can be observed. We impute the respective counterfactuals from the separate wage regressions. Our analysis shows that movers and stayers are rewarded for different human capital characteristics. We find an average earnings premium for foreign work experience of around 30 %. This can be seen as partial evidence for international skill diffusion temporary migrants may upgrade their skills by learning on the job in countries with higher technological development, and subsequently bring human capital to their source country, thus adding to know-how diffusion and the catching-up of their economy. We perform additional empirical analyses to support this interpretation we show that the premium found for return migration does not primarily reward the language proficiencies of returning migrants, and we further provide indicative evidence that no earnings premium is obtained for work-related stays abroad in other central and eastern European transition countries.

In this paper we have used a unique household dataset spanning more than 3 decades from rural India to derive what may be broadly classified as the triggers of income mobility. We believe and wish to show that location and outcome of location place a crucial role in determining the magnitude of income mobility. Given that in low income countries migration is a significant cause for income mobility, we show that its magnitude is influenced by the relationship between income premium (benefits accruing to the household due to location) and migration. There is thus a three way relationship between income <b>premium,</b> <b>migration</b> and income mobility. We find that increases in household income premium will reduce the likely hood of a given household (members of that household migrating). Consequently we are more likely to observe a reduction in overall income mobility. A policy implication of this finding is that if development is not uniform across the economic space.

40|$|In this dissertation, I rely on {{self-reported}} {{objective and}} subjective data to study processes related to acquiring new opportunities and exercising choice in transition and post-transition countries, i. e., the economies in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, which recently underwent or {{are still going}} through transitions to democracy and market economy. The departure point is the proposition that at the macro level, transition consists of marketization and democratization processes but at the individual level, transition generated a process of acquiring autonomy, i. e., taking charge of one's own life and making personal choices instead of relying on the government. Frustration and disillusionment may accompany this process, as it is often a difficult transformation involving uncertainty and volatility, sacrifices, and changing time use, norms, or reference groups. This dissertation consists of three separate but related essays. Specifically, Chapter 1 taps into the relationship between capabilities and subjective well-being. Chapter 2 directly builds on that by exploring the well-being consequences of the pursuit of new opportunities through migration. Finally, Chapter 3 investigates the life satisfaction effects of joining the European Union, which was a process that provided citizens in transition economies with new rights and opportunities. The research questions in these three essays relate to broader inquires about the well-being implications {{of the process of}} learning {{to be in charge of}} one's own life. A fundamental, yet not well-understood determinant of human well-being is the capacity to exercise choice and live a fulfilling life. Chapter 1 explores how actual and perceived manifestations of this capacity relate to subjective well-being dimensions. The chapter furnishes evidence that in transition economies and other world regions, capabilities and subjective well-being are related and both objective and subjective capabilities are more important for life evaluations than for emotional states. Capabilities are also generally less important for the happiest respondents. We further demonstrate that the same set of capabilities and means has a slightly different relative importance for different well-being dimensions across different regions. We also show novel evidence related to the least well-understood subjective well-being dimension: eudaimonic happiness, which relates to having meaning and purpose in life. Finally, our results demonstrate that while employment arrangements contribute to happiness overall, they are also associated with stress and anger. The second chapter uses Gallup World Poll data, statistical matching, and difference-in-differences to assess the effects of migration on the well-being of migrants from transition economies living in advanced countries. In addition to increasing household income, migration enhances subjective well-being. While all migrants realize income gains, there is a substantial well-being <b>migration</b> <b>premium</b> for the unhappiest movers. Moreover, by voting with their feet, migrants not only exercise choice but also enhance their perceived opportunities, including satisfaction with freedom and standard of living. Based on the results, migration can be seen as a development mechanism as it enhances migrants' means, well-being, and capabilities. The third chapter provides novel evidence about the perceived well-being effects of EU accession in the ten post-communist countries which joined the European Union between 2004 and 2007 (EU- 10). Using difference-in-differences, the main finding is that EU accession had no immediate influence on the perceived well-being of Bulgarians and Romanians (EU- 2) in 2007 but was positively related to life satisfaction in 2008 - 2009, with some variation by socio-demographic groups. In addition, there were EU-related well-being gains in most of the EU- 8 countries, which were experienced shortly after joining. Taken at face value, the results suggest that EU membership has immediate perceived well-being effects in the more advanced transition members and is associated with well-being gains only after a lag in the less advanced ex-communist members. From a policy perspective, these results are relevant to countries aspiring to EU membership such as the Western Balkans and the Ukraine. The chapter also suggests that the increased control of corruption and EU aid were associated with higher life satisfaction in Bulgaria and Romania, although a greater share of EU imports had the opposite influence. In the EU- 8, better governance, economic growth, and EU imports had a positive influence on life satisfaction, while the control of corruption had a marginally significant negative association. This dissertation's results have several policy implications. First, given that public policy has a role in assisting those lacking choice and freedoms by providing them with equal opportunities, the results in Chapter 1 may ultimately have importance in that arena. The findings suggest that the same set of opportunities and means may have a different meaning and value in different contexts or among different cohorts. Therefore, policies aiming to enhance opportunities may have a differential impact on subjective well-being across groups. For example, if policymakers aim to enhance subjective well-being, they may choose to invest in objective capabilities and means (such as income, employment, and education). Alternatively, for normative reasons, decision-makers may choose to equalize capabilities of all kinds for all citizens despite the differential weights that different put on them and the differential impact on subjective well-being. Second, immigrant well-being is not only a pivotal part of each nation's well-being but immigrant dissatisfaction may also be symptomatic of deeper social problems such as social exclusion and discrimination. While policy debates and the extant literature tend to focus on the distributional consequences of immigrants on natives in the destination countries, Chapter 2 finds that migration has positive effects on the incomes, subjective well-being, and perceived opportunities of migrants from transition economies living in advanced countries, implying that migration can be a development mechanism enhancing individual well-being. Yet, arguably migration is not a comprehensive development strategy as it does not solve deeply-rooted social problems such as corruption, poor economic policies, and market and government failures in the sending countries. Third, Chapter 3 's findings are relevant to policymakers in the Western Balkans and the Eastern Partnership countries, which aspire to EU membership. Like Bulgaria and Romania, these candidate countries are less advanced and less prepared for membership than accession countries in previous enlargements. Therefore, if accepted into the EU, citizens in these countries will likely experience the subjective well-being gains after a lag. The results also have implications for the EU's enlargement and integration policies...|$|E

For example reducing <b>migration</b> raises the <b>premium</b> on migrant labor in the destination countries, while lowering the relative return to capital. The first effect makes for higher real income, consumption, and remittances for migrants of both types. For native populations in high income countries, the negative capital income effect dominates the wage effect of reduced competition from migrants. It is perhaps ironic that reducing labor competition is more beneficial to migrants, who lack the capital income and thereby gain absolutely from rising relative wages. Of course one of the primary demand drivers for migrants is the desire to profit from using capital resources more fully within high income economies. In OECD economies, pension schemes guarantee that a significant part of these profits accrue indirectly to native workers. Taken together, these results strongly support the argument that migration has beneficial growth effects on global real economic activity, improving the efficiency of international resource allocation for the benefit of both sending and receiving countries. However, these reassuring aggregate results mask more complex interactions in domestic labor markets, and there will inevitably be both winners and losers from the ensuing structural adjustments. Having said this, the existence of substantial aggregate gains, particularly new fiscal resources for the public sector, suggests the prospect of adjustment assistance to offset adverse impacts. ...|$|R
