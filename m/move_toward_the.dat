5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the white {{settlers}} caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> area of the disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward. Stephenson and his men rose before dawn on June 18 and started following {{the trail of the}} band of Sauk who had stolen the horses. The militia marched through pounding rain before they finally caught up with the Sauk.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} {{a constructive}} reform program during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness to <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E
40|$|Utilizing starch-gel electrophoresis, 12 {{discrete}} peroxidases {{were identified}} in purified extracts of the dwarf tomato shoot (Lycopersicon esculentum). Nine of <b>the</b> peroxidases <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> anode while 3 <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cathode. In addition, a continuous peroxidase smear was separated from the above 12 peroxidases.

5|$|In early September 1862, Colonel Lightburn {{became aware}} of rebel cavalry led by Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, which invaded Ohio. After a brief {{incursion}} into Ohio, Jenkins positioned his cavalry at Barboursville, which blocked one of Lightburn's possible routes {{to the safety of}} the Ohio River. Jenkins also prepared to <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Kanawha River and Charleston—which could block all of Lightburn's retreat routes to Ohio. Lightburn also received news that the Confederate General William W. Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.) Lightburn faced the possibility of confronting an army (Loring) that he thought was much larger than his while having no easy way to retreat because of Jenkins.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 {{came as a surprise}} to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 3 was a result of growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion {{of the body of}} water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Arabian Peninsula. However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Operation Tractable {{began at}} 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command struck German {{positions}} along the front. As with Totalize, {{many of the}} bombers mistakenly dropped their bombs short of their targets, causing 400 Polish and Canadian casualties. Covered by a smoke screen laid down by their artillery, two Canadian divisions moved forwards. Although their line of sight was reduced, German units still managed to inflict severe casualties on the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, which included its Armoured Brigade commander Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division moved south toward Falaise. Throughout the day, continual attacks by the Canadian 4th and Polish 1st Armoured Divisions managed to force a crossing of the Laison River. Limited access to the crossing points over the Dives River allowed counterattacks by the German 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The town of Potigny fell to Polish forces in the late afternoon. By {{the end of the}} first day, elements of the Canadian 3rd and 4th Divisions had reached Point 159, directly north of Falaise, although they had been unable to break into the town. To bolster his offensive, Simonds ordered the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division to <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front, with the hope that this reinforcement would be sufficient to enable his divisions to capture the town.|$|E

Lithuanian Hetman Michał Pac's refusal to fight under Sobieski's orders forced Sobieski to abandon his intended <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Danube.

25|$|During aggregation, {{starvation}} initiates {{the creation}} of a biochemical machinery that includes glycoproteins and adenylyl cyclase. The glycoproteins allow for cell-cell adhesion, and adenylyl cyclase creates cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP is secreted by the amoebae to attract neighboring cells to a central location. As they <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> signal, they bump into each other and stick together by the use of glycoprotein adhesion molecules.|$|E
25|$|In the MENA region, {{however, the}} United States {{did little to}} rupture {{relations}} with authoritarian regimes and largely avoided paying significant attention to human rights and democratization. Indeed, at times the United States found itself opposed to democratic governance in the MENA region when it conflicted with American interests – participating in the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953, for example, due to oil interests and alleged fear of any leftist <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Soviets.|$|E

25|$|Affine scaling {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{interior}} point methods to be developed. It was developed in the Soviet Union in the mid-1960s, but didn't receive much attention until the discovery of Karmarkar's algorithm, after which affine scaling was reinvented multiple times and presented as a simplified version of Karmarkar's. Affine scaling amounts to doing gradient descent steps within the feasible region, while rescaling the problem to make sure the steps <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> optimum faster.|$|E
25|$|All of this careful {{settling}} of the yerba {{ensures that}} each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles {{will then be}} as distant {{as possible from the}} filtering end of the straw. With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> straw, but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out.

25|$|Between {{two phases}} in {{equilibrium}} {{there is a}} narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase.
