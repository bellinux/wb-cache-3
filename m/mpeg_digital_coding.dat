We show that evolutionary programming of <b>digital</b> <b>codes</b> is a valid model for the evolution of nucleotide codes by random change within the boundaries of mutation protection, not for evolution by unbounded random change. Our mutation protection perspective enhances the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of <b>digital</b> and nucleotide <b>codes</b> and its limitations, and reveals a paradox between the necessity of dysfunctioning mutation protection for evolution and its disadvantage for survival. Our mutation protection perspective suggests new directions for research into mutational robustness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{posits that}} the cosmic <b>digital</b> <b>code</b> {{as the law}} of all {{physical}} laws contains two mutually exclusive values: attachment space attaching to object and detachment space detaching from object. However, the cosmic physical system could not start with mutually exclusive attachment space and detachment space {{at the same time}} in the beginning. The way out of this impasse is that the complete cosmic system consists of both the cosmic physical system and the unphysical cosmic <b>digital</b> <b>code.</b> The unphysical cosmic <b>digital</b> <b>code</b> allows the coexistence of attachment space and detachment space at the same time. The cosmic <b>digital</b> <b>code</b> behaves as gene in organism, and the cosmic physical system behaves as organ. Under different conditions and times, different spaces in the cosmic <b>digital</b> <b>code</b> are activated to generate different spaces in the cosmic physical systems with different physical laws for different universes in the multivese. All universes start from the primitive multiverse, which only has attachment space attaching to 10 D string without the four force fields. During the big bang in our universe, detachment space emerged to detach particle from its four force fields. Such detachment, however, cannot be completely and permanently detached, because particle still attaches to its force fields. The result is hybrid space, combining both attachment space and detachment space in coherent state, such as particle and its force fields. Hybrid space is the space for wavefunction whose probability density is proportional to attachment space, and inversely proportional to detachment space. The collapse of wavefunction in decoherent state is the separation of attachment space and detachment space in such way that attachment space attaches to particle, and detachment space separately detaches from all probability density.

40|$|Analog error {{correction}} codes, by relaxing the source {{space and the}} codeword space from discrete fields to continuous fields, present a generalization of <b>digital</b> <b>codes.</b> While linear codes are sufficient for <b>digital</b> <b>codes,</b> they are not for analog codes, and hence nonlinear mappings must be employed to fully harness the power of analog codes. This paper demonstrates new ways of building effective (nonlinear) analog codes from a special class of nonlinear, fast-diverging functions known as the chaotic functions. It is shown that the "butterfly effect" of the chaotic functions matches elegantly with the distance expansion condition required for {{error correction}}, and that the useful idea in <b>digital</b> turbo <b>codes</b> can be exploited to construct efficient turbo-like chaotic analog codes. Simulations show that the new analog codes can perform on par with, or better than, their digital counter-parts when transmitting analog sources.
