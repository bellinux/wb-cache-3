40|$|Laser shaping was {{introduced}} to maskless projection soft lithography by using digital micro-mirror device (DMD). The predesigned intensity pattern was imprinted onto the DMD and the input laser beam with a Gaussian or quasi-Gaussian distribution will carry the pattern on DMD to etch the resin. It provides a method of precise control of laser beam shapes and photon-induced curing behavior of resin. This technology provides an accurate micro-fabrication of microstructures used for micro-systems. As a virtual <b>mask</b> <b>generator</b> and a binary-amplitude spatial light modulator, DMD {{is equivalent to the}} masks in the conventional exposure system. As the virtual masks and shaped laser beam can be achieved flexibly, it is a good method of precision soft lithography for 2 D/ 3 D microstructures. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis treats design, manufacture, {{evaluation}} and applications of computer-generated surface relief holograms - kinoforms. These diffractive, phase-only, planar optical components {{are characterized by}} high efficiency, design flexibility, light weight and small size. They can further be reproduced at low cost. These properties make kinoforms particularly well suited for integration with diode lasers, optical fibers and micro-electronic circuits. Given its desired diffraction properties, the kinoform phase structure is computer-calculated using iterative Fourier-transform algorithms. Initially the kinoforms were realized photolithographically, using a computer-controlled grey-scale laser <b>mask</b> <b>generator</b> of our own design. Later, due to the excellent lateral accuracy and resolution, we turned to direct-writing electron-beam lithography (EBL). A problem with that technique is scattering of exposing electrons, which reduces the resolution (the proximity effect). A method was devised to determine the electron point-spread function by measuring the optical diffraction from EBL-manufactured test structures. With the gained information the negative influence of the proximity effect could be reduced by properly modifying the electron exposure doses. With repeated development of the exposed kinoforms optimum relief depths were reached. Manufacture of high-performing array illuminators was demonstrated. Resist kinoforms were further used in successful Nd:YAG-laser micro-machining experiments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceImage {{interleaving}} {{has proven}} to be an effective solution to provide the robustness of image communication systems when resource limitations make reliable protocols unsuitable (e. g., in wireless camera sensor networks); however, the search for optimal interleaving patterns is scarcely tackled in the literature. In 2008, Rombaut et al. presented an interesting approach introducing a packetization <b>mask</b> <b>generator</b> based in Simulated Annealing (SA), including a cost function, which allows assessing the suitability of a packetization pattern, avoiding extensive simulations. In this work, we present a complementary study about the non-trivial problem of generating optimal packetization patterns. We propose a genetic algorithm, {{as an alternative to the}} cited work, adopting the mentioned cost function, then comparing it to the SA approach and a torus automorphism interleaver. In addition, we engage the validation of the cost function and provide results attempting to conclude about its implication in the quality of reconstructed images. Several scenarios based on visual sensor networks applications were tested in a computer application. Results in terms of the selected cost function and image quality metric PSNR show that our algorithm presents similar results to the other approaches. Finally, we discuss the obtained results and comment about open research challenges...|$|E

50|$|Unlike sound masking {{in offices}} or hospitals, it is {{necessary}} to consider that sophisticated listeners may have technology to recover speech buried in masking sound. To inhibit such devices, {{it may be necessary to}} provide layered audio protection; several different signals are mixed together. Non-stationary random noise should be the first layer; it provides more protection than standard sound <b>masking</b> <b>generators.</b> Music may be used as the second layer; it is buried below the random noise so it is actually inaudible to room occupants. A voice babble generator or actual speech samples may be used as a third layer. The fourth layer, the actual voices to protect, should be sufficiently buried.|$|R
50|$|In early systems, digital <b>masking</b> <b>generators</b> had {{noticeable}} {{short term}} levels changes; the cycle time was so short {{that the same}} sound was created repetitively. As a result, some specifications required temporal uniformity in the short term. This problem was bypassed with the requirement for use of analog generators that created truly random sound. The problem has been designed away so almost all <b>masking</b> <b>generators</b> now create a digital signal {{that can only be}} interpreted by a listener as random. Now, masking sound in the short term has a constant level. The same is not true for longer periods. The privacy needs of occupants vary throughout the workday and the only variable that can accommodate this is sound masking. During hours with high activity levels, the person would need more masking to maintain his or her privacy. At low activity levels, such as early evening hours, the person would like {{to be aware of the}} presence of others; the need for community partially outweighs the need for privacy, so masking levels need to be lower. If the building has roving security personnel after working hours, there is no need for privacy and the sound masking level should be minimized. Successful systems have a clock and a control function that will continually vary the masking level in small increments over twenty four hours and for each day of the week. There are two types. One in which the level variations are programmed in advance and one in which the actual activity sound levels are measured and the masking level is set automatically to create the needed privacy. See the programmed level control and the adaptive function listed above. Unsuccessful systems had an ON-OFF clock-controlled switch which is not recommended.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{stereolithography}} {{process is}} based on the photopolymerization through a dynamic <b>mask</b> <b>generator</b> of successive layers of photocurable resin, allowing the manufactory of accurate micro objects with high aspect ratio and curved surfaces. In the present work the stereolithography technique is applied to produce nanocomposite bioactive scaffolds from Computer Assisted Design (CAD) files. Methods. Porous scaffolds are designed with computer software and built with a composite poly(D, L-lactide) /nano hydroxyapatite based resin. Triply-periodic minimal surfaces are shown to be a more versatile source of biomorphic scaffold designs and scaffolds with Double Gyroid architecture are realized and characterized from morphological, mechanical and biological point of view. Results. The structures show excellent reproduction of the design and good mechanical properties. Human marrow mesenchimal cells (hMSC) are seeded onto porous PDLLA composites for 3 weeks and cultured in osteogenic medium. Presence of nano-hap seems to increase the mechanical properties without affecting the morphology of the structures. The composite Double Gyroid scaffolds exhibit good biocompatibility and confirm that nano-hap enhances the scaffold bioactive and osteoconductive potential. Conclusion. The presented technology and materials enable an accurate preparation of tissue engineering composite scaffolds with a large freedom of design, and really complex internal architectures. Results indicate that the scaffolds fulfill the basic requirements of bone tissue engineering scaffold, and have the potential to be applied in orthopedic surgery...|$|E
40|$|Stereolithography is a rapid {{prototyping}} technology with a hundred-micron-scale resolution {{based on the}} process of curing a photopolymer by the interaction of one photon of light with a photoinitiator and/or a photosensitizer. It is a surface based technique where the structure is constructed layer-by-layer. In Mask image Projection approach, the entire cross section is cured by using a Dynamic <b>Mask</b> <b>Generator.</b> The aim of this thesis was the construction of a Mask Projection Microstereolithography (MPµSL) 3 D printer, whose operation is similar to the one mentioned before, but its goal is to print samples with a 5 μm resolution. A Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) from a commercial projector was used as Dynamic Pattern Generator, the one will create the desired image on the resin once the UV light from a LED has polymerized it. Moreover, an elevator device, formed by a stepper motor and a linear guide, was used to enable the spread of fresh resin {{on the top of the}} already polymerized layer, so it is possible to start the light-induced solidification process of the next. Once the machine was built, produced samples were analyzed with an electronic (SEM) and an optic microscope to optimize its functioning. With those analysis, it was possible to measure the horizontal resolution of the 3 D-printer (4. 41 〖μm〗^ 2), while corroborating its correct operation. One of the most important lines of work would be the development of a device that allows a precise measurement of the distance between the platform and the resin vat, since at this moment this process is done intuitively and in case of using resins with a low depth of penetration, it is a very complicated tas...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two basic}} areas of {{interest}} for diffractive optics. In the first, the property of wavefront division is exploited for achieving optical fanout, analogous to the more familiar electrical fanout of electronic circuitry. The basic {{problem here is that}} when using a simple uniform diffraction grating the energy input is divided unevenly among the output beams. The other area of interest is the use of diffractive elements to replace or supplement standard refractive elements such as lenses. Again, local grating variations can be used to control the amount of bending imparted to optical rays, and the efficiency of the diffractive element will depend on how closely the element can be matched to the design requirements. In general, production restrictions limit how closely the element approaches the design, and for the common case of photolithographic production, a series of binary masks is required to achieve high efficiency. The actual design process is much more involved than in the case of elements for optical fanout, as the desired phase of the optical wavefront over some reference plane must be specified and the phase alteration to be introduced at each point by the diffraction element must be known. This generally requires the utilization of a standard optical design program. Two approaches are possible. In the first approach, the diffractive element is treated as a special type of lens and the ordinary optical design equations are used. Optical design programs tend to follow a second approach, namely, using the equations of optical interference derived from holographic theory and then allowing the introduction of phase front corrections in the form of polynomial equations. By using either of these two methods, diffractive elements can be used not only to compensate for distortions such as chromatic or spherical aberration, but also to perform the work of a variety of other optical elements such as null correctors, beam shapers, etc. The main focus of the project described in this report is how the design information from the lens design program is incorporated into the photolithographic process. It is shown that the MANN program, a photolithographic <b>mask</b> <b>generator,</b> fills the need for a link between lens design programs and mask generation controllers. The generated masks can be used to expose a resist-coated substrate which is etched and then must be re-coated, re-exposed, and re-etched for making copies, just as in the electronics industry...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTrue {{random number}} {{generators}} (TRNGs) are ubiquitous in data security {{as one of}} basic cryptographic primitives.

As such, they must have good statistical properties, be unpredictable and robust against attacks. This paper presents a contactless and local active attack on ring oscillators (ROs) based TRNGs using electromagnetic fields. Experiments show that in a TRNG featuring fifty ROs, {{the impact of a}} local electromagnetic emanation on the ROs is so strong, {{that it is possible to}} lock them on the injected signal and thus to control the monobit bias of the TRNG output even when low power electromagnetic fields are exploited.

40|$|Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) {{codes are}} one of the block coding {{techniques}} that can approach the Shannon’s limit within a fraction of a decibel for high block lengths. In many digital communication systems these codes have strong competitors of turbo codes for error control. LDPC codes performance depends on the excellent design of parity check matrix and many diverse research methods have been used by different study groups to evaluate the performance. In this research work finite fields construction method is used and diverse techniques like masking, dispersion and array dispersion for the construction of parity check matrix H. These constructed codes are then simulated to make the performance evaluation. The key interest of this research work was to inspect the performance of LDPC codes based on finite fields. A comprehensive masking technique was also an objective of this research work. Simulation was done for different rates using additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In MATLAB a library of different functions was created to perform the task for base matrix construction, dispersion, <b>masking,</b> <b>generator</b> matrix construction etc. Results give an idea that even at BER of 10 - 6 these short length LDPC codes performed much better and have no error floor.

40|$|A compactly {{supported}} scaling function {{can come}} from a refinement equation with infinitely many nonzero coefficients (an infinite mask).

Any finite combination of the shifts of a refinable function will have such a mask, and will be refinable. We also study compactly supported solutions of vector refinement equations with infinite masks. Our characterization is based on the two-scale similarity transform which plays an essential role in the investigation of multiple wavelets.

40|$|Modern Rapid Prototyping (RP) {{technology}} has been available {{for more than a}} decade and has aided in shortening product development times and costs in the manufacturing sector. Stereolithography (SL), the most mature of RP technology, has primarily been used to build small to medium sized parts although there are largescale applications i. e. the automotive industry that uses “mammoth SLA”. Recent developments in SL have been aimed at increasing the speed of the additive process of most SL apparatus (SLA). Developments include the chemistry of photopolymer resins, integral-curing processes as opposed to vector-by-vector processes, and what is now called microstereolithography. Integral curing has been made possible by the advent of dynamic <b>masking</b> <b>generators</b> such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and digital micromirror devices (DMDs). Much of the theory for this new layering process has been applied to the micro-scale and awaits application for medium to large sized parts. The Limaye Model was applied to a microstereolithography apparatus (µSLA) and used as a process planning method for curing dimensionally accurate micro parts. Examination of the results of this mathematical model shows an irradiance map simulating the irradiances on the resin surface. The light is expected to attenuate from the central axis according to a measured irradiance curve. Improvements can be made to the Limaye Model to make it applicable for the process planning of medium to large parts. It is the aim of this research to present an improved mathematical model of the Limaye Model, so that a given irradiance map will produce an evenly distributed irradiance and account for errors in the optical imaging system. It is hoped that the field of exposure of 200 mm x 270 mm or larger will be achieved...|$|R

The electron beam size and print pixel size are variable between 60 nm and 120 nm, allowing a tradeoff between resolution and write time. Raster scan printing optimizes throughput by transferring precisely {{the amount of}} data to the mask {{that is consistent with}} the chosen resolution.

A simulation tool is used to model the MEBES eXara ™ system writing strategy, which uses four writing passes, interstitial print grids, offset scans, and eight dose levels per pass. It is found that Raster Graybeam produces aerial image quality equivalent to the convolution of the input pattern data with a Gaussian point spread function.

40|$|Disclosure Control is the {{discipline}} {{concerned with the}} modification of data containing confidential information about individual entities, such as persons, households, businesses, etc. {{in order to prevent}} third parties working with these data from recognizing entities in the data and thereby disclosing information about these entities. In very broad terms, disclosure risk is the risk that a given form of disclosure will occur if a masked microdataset is released. Microdata represents a series of records, each record containing information on an individual unit. Several microdata disclosure control frameworks exist in literature but they focus on specific disclosure problems. Our proposed framework attempts to define the microdata disclosure control problem more generally. In this paper we describe the architecture of a software system called AMMG (Automatic <b>Masked</b> Microdata <b>Generator).</b> The system will generate masked microdata with low disclosure risk and information loss. A general framework for microdata disclosure control is proposed for this system. Also, existing disclosure risk measures are extended by this research. Variables in the microdata are classified at two-levels, one specified by the data owner and the other indicating the knowledge states of potential data intruders. These classifications form the basis for organizing disclosure risk scenarios. The disclosure risk measure presented in this paper is validated in our illustrations...|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} complexity of the designs, {{there is a great}} necessity for automatic layout tools which produce results similar in optimality to those produced by manual design methods. The continuous progress in VLSI technology presents new challenges in developing efficient algorithms for the layout of logic cells. The feasibility of developing an automatic <b>mask</b> layout <b>generator</b> for switching trees from its symbolic counterpart is explored in this thesis. The symbolic layout is generated from a Switching Tree Layout Synthesizer which is then translated to the mask shapes. Each element in the symbolic layout represents an instance in the mask layout. The mapping of symbolic to mask layout is not constrained to just one solution. Depending on the overall structure of the design, necessary steps such as changing the transistor orientation and contact position and layout compaction for a particular section, are performed to obtain optimized and efficient layout. Two switching tree layout styles, DMS and IMS, are presented here which are dependent on the height and the width of the logic cell. A one-dimensional functional cell generator is also proposed in this thesis. Two algorithms to minimize the height and the width of the functional cell are studied and implemented based on graph theory. It is shown that the switching tree layouts are much more area efficient than that of one dimensional functional cells. Other advantages of the switching tree over other layout methods are also mentioned. Simulations are carried out to justify the heavily pipelining capacity of the switching trees.
