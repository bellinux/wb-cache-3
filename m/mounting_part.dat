30|$|The probe {{with the}} {{arrangement}} of the three ultrasound arrays on the seam bond is shown in Fig.  1 on the right. The gap between the ends of the two leading wedges of array A and B is determined to be 3.5  mm, whereby array C is predominantly obscured by arrays A and B. An arc phased array C is not possible because of the different radii of the seam loop within one <b>mounting</b> <b>part.</b> Water is continuously fed between the seam and the leading wedges as a couplant. Any fluctuations in the thickness of the seam bond pack size in the y direction (see Fig.  1) are to be compensated by the water layer or the articulated joint of the ultrasonic test system, which has a plier-like design.|$|E

30|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey performed in 2014 by Japan’s Care Work Foundation concluded that not enough {{people are working}} in the field of physical therapy and similar occupations [1, 2]. To address this issue, efforts are underway to develop training equipment to support and assist therapists. The existing rehabilitation equipment [3] is often operated using a serial link mechanism. It tends to accumulate errors as the number of joints increases; hence, the serial link makes it difficult to provide multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) of movement to a joint, which limits its use in joints, such as wrist joints that require a high DOF of movement. To address these issues, efforts are underway to develop rehabilitation training devices that use parallel link mechanisms. The existing training devices that use parallel links [4, 5] utilize a pneumatic cylinder as an actuator, which can be difficult to position and is noisy because of the use of a pump. This study hopes to improve the ease of operation of the device by adopting a linear servomotor. Accordingly, we develop a wearable rehabilitation device using parallel link mechanism that uses a servomotor [6]. We target the wrist joint because it is a major focus of rehabilitation, and the complexity of its range of motion is clear. In previous studies [6], the mounting position tended to be slightly misaligned because the measuring and training devices were separate, it causes a decrease in training effect. In this study, we improve the equipment by integrating the measuring and training devices, reducing the weight of the <b>mounting</b> <b>part,</b> and expanding the range of motion. We first describe a motion experiment targeted at assumed rehabilitation training for wrist joint circumduction movements using the developed device, and then address the effectiveness of the device based on a discussion of the experiment.|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} on {{sorting out the}} wood logs in {{traditional}} wood industry was that the process should be done manually. Hence, it required an automated system to perform sorting process with a higher precision level. The purpose {{of this research was}} to create a simulation of automated wood log sorting process based on specified length and thickness.  The sorting system consisted of AT 89 C 51 microcontroller system, keypad (in order to enter the required value of length and thickness), LCD (in order to display the result of sorting process), conveyor belt, two pairs of light sensor (consisting of photodiode and LED, each), and three DC motors which were driven by five relay circuits.  At the beginning of sorting process, an operator was to type the selection range (i. e. the minimum and maximum value of required length and thickness) via the keypad provided. The wood log mounted on conveyor belt would be measured by light sensors to determine the value of length and thickness. Based on the values, AT 89 C 51 microcontroller system would then compare them to the selection range. If the log being sorted out fulfilled the requirements, it would be directed to "Accepted" compartment, or else to "Rejected" one.  From the test performed, it was concluded that the length measurement was more precise for short logs.  While the error rate was much higher for thin logs on thickness measurement. The process of sorting out and counting the wood logs was performed successfully.  The system could use the narrowing mechanism at the <b>mounting</b> <b>part</b> of conveyor belt and better supporting ace on thickness sensor, in order to minimize the error rate on length and thickness measurement, respectively. In addition, the system could be developed to measure the volume of an object, providing that the object being measured was having a square or full-circle cross-sectional area...|$|E

This approach enhances, among other things, {{the possibility of}} a systematic investigation of different influences on the loads caused by track irregularities. The simulation model which is used within this thesis is based on an elastic multibody system (EMBS) of a bogie. The solution and therefore also the load assumption is carried out in the frequency domain. For the load assumption several frequency response functions (FRF) are calculated which represent the system behavior. Finally based on the system excitation in combination with the system response, the load for certain system outputs can be calculated. Furthermore, by the variation of different parameters the impact of the track associated excitation on the load of the <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> can be investigated more structured...|$|R
