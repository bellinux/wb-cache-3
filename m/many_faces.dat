5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has <b>Many</b> <b>Faces</b> seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E

25|$|Enigma {{followed}} MCMXC a.D. with {{a series}} of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi! (1996), which blended together the Gregorian chants reminiscent from the first album and the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album The Screen Behind the Mirror (2000) started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with Voyageur (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and A Posteriori (2006), a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to Voyageur than the earlier releases. Seven Lives <b>Many</b> <b>Faces</b> (2008) followed and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was released on November 2016.|$|E

Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money, accepting leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid, deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance at its worst, a lack of objectivity and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov {{wrote that}} readers would have various reactions to The One I Love: {{he felt that}} some would regard it as [...] "charming" [...] and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp's minor works, he stated that it was [...] "unusual" [...] for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi's art, as prior {{to the time of}} his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that [...] "insecurity and self-doubt" [...] served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly one that she felt [...] "justifies having an interest in whatever your boyfriend likes," [...] and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and [...] "quickly become redundant." [...] In , Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one's self in [...] relationships, but felt that it appeared [...] "almost anti-feminist in execution," [...] as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, or Man of <b>Many</b> <b>Faces</b> as better examples of Clamp's romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga's appeal, and made for a [...] "laborious" [...] reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a [...] "romantic" [...] reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were [...] "incredibly sweet and touching" [...] and were best read a few stories at a time. According to Cooper, The One I Love would appeal to fans of Clamp or shōjo, manga targeted towards girls.|$|E
