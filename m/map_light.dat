25|$|On the inside, this {{generation}} had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors {{as well as}} a tilt steering wheel. The power door lock was located in the center console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this year only went to 85mph (140km/h) in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control was standard in {{this generation}}. Toyota also included the retractable <b>map</b> <b>light</b> as standard. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with cassette. The optional cassette stereo featured a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band graphic equalizer. The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather was an option on L-types of this year, but P-types were limited to standard striped cloth.|$|E
25|$|AMC also {{produced}} a one-off Sportabout for Gucci's personal use. The car was {{powered by a}} 5-litre V8 engine and had a three-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured leather was door panels, cargo area {{as well as the}} front and rear centre arm rests. The doors and custom-designed bucket seats received red and green striped inserts. The instrument panel was given a centrally located, pull-out writing desk, graced with a scribbler and a sterling silver bamboo pen. A <b>map</b> <b>light</b> {{at the end of a}} flexible arm extended from the right side of the desk, the left carried a vanity mirror, also on a flex stem. The back of the front seats popped open.

The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters—all decorated with red and green enamel stripes.|$|E
2500|$|With the Impala {{no longer}} being produced, a new base Caprice four-door model was {{introduced}} (similar to the previous Impala). Still available was a four-door sedan, coupe and eight-passenger station wagon, while a new Brougham four-door sedan joined the model line-up. Brougham models featured a 55/45 front seat with armrest, and a new [...] "pillow design" [...] with velour fabrics. Broughams featured woodgrain appliqué on its dash fascia, a dome <b>map</b> <b>light,</b> front-door courtesy lights and 20oz carpeting. Power window controls for all models moved from the door panel to the armrest for improved ergonomics.|$|E
50|$|The game {{uses the}} Earth-4 engine, {{which uses a}} T&L {{rendering}} module supporting pixel shading and bone calculation direct to ones graphics card. Bump <b>mapping,</b> <b>lighting</b> effects and detailed units are also present.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, all Chrysler {{cars were}} redesigned. On the Windsor, {{standard}} equipment included a cigarette <b>lighter,</b> <b>map</b> <b>lights,</b> and new for 1961, a safety padded dash. 1961 {{was the last}} year of the Windsor in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The last {{version of}} the GC WRX was {{introduced}} on September 1999. There is {{no change in the}} mechanical specifications. Added features are newly designed alloy wheels, color-coded mirrors and door handles, remote central locking, intermittent wipers with a timer and <b>map</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Detail {{improvements}} {{continued to}} be made throughout {{the life of the}} Mark IV, and included reclining seats with [...] "chequered brushed nylon centre panels" [...] and head restraints, introduced for domestic market cars early in 1977 along with a new set of column stalk operated minor controls (as fitted already in the TR7) replacing the old dashboard mounted knobs and switches. [...] Also added for the model's final years were a wood dash, hazard flashers and an electric screen washer, in place of the previous manual pump operated ones. Options such as the hard top, tonneau cover, <b>map</b> <b>light</b> and overdrive {{continued to be}} popular, but wire wheels ceased to be available.|$|E
2500|$|Again, in 1963, the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile 98 had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase. A new body style was the Custom Sports Coupe hardtop. It {{was the only}} body style with the 345 horsepower Starfire engine. The 4-door 6-window hardtop was renamed the Luxury Sedan (often condensed to L/S). The convention of naming all hardtops Holidays would not again return until 1965. Standard equipment included die-cast grille, deep pile carpeting, 21-gallon fuel tank, full-flow oil filter, foam seat cushions, foot-operated parking brake, two-speed windshield wipers, special molding package, Deluxe steering wheel, <b>map</b> <b>light,</b> heavy duty air cleaner, courtesy lights, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, special rocker panel moldings, self-regulating electric clock, dual rear seat cigarette lighters and special headliner.

2500|$|The 1969 98 {{conventional}} front engine/rear drive car {{remained the}} top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. It {{was the largest}} Oldsmobile product offered and now had a [...] wheelbase. Six body styles were now available with a hardtop version of the Luxury Sedan added to the lineup. New to the 98 series were a recessed padded instrument panel, anti-theft lock within the steering column, rear view mirror <b>map</b> <b>light,</b> mini-buckle seat belts, and deeply padded head restraints. Standard equipment included: power brakes, self-regulating electric clock, full carpeting, courtesy lamps, paint stripes, power seat adjuster, seat belts and shoulder harnasses, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, power windows, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, custom sport seat, foam padded front seat, and wheel discs (hub caps). Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. The 98's standard engine was still the Rocket 455 which required premium leaded gas. All 98s were made in Lansing and had the code letter M.|$|E
5000|$|Shading {{languages}} used in offline rendering produce maximum image quality. Material {{properties are}} totally abstracted, little programming skill and no hardware knowledge is required. These kind of shaders are often developed by artists {{to get the}} right [...] "look", just as texture <b>mapping,</b> <b>lighting</b> and other facets of their work.|$|R
40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>maps</b> {{have long}} been a popular {{technique}} for visually rich real-time rendering in games. They typically contain smooth color gradients which current low bit rate texture compression techniques, such as DXT 1 and ETC 2, do not handle well. The application writer must therefore choose between doubling the bit rate by choosing a codec such as BC 7, or accept the compression artifacts, neither of which is desirable. The situation is aggravated by the recent popularity of radiosity normal <b>maps,</b> where three <b>light</b> <b>maps</b> plus a normal map are used for each surface. We present a new texture compression algorithm targeting smoothly varying textures, such as the <b>light</b> <b>maps</b> used in radiosity normal <b>mapping.</b> On high-resolution <b>light</b> <b>map</b> data from real games, the proposed method shows quality improvements of 0. 7 dB in PSNR over ETC 2, and 2. 8 dB over DXT 1, for the same bit rate. As a side effect, our codec can also compress many standard images (not <b>light</b> <b>maps)</b> with better quality than DXT 1 /ETC 2...|$|R

50|$|In 1837, Surveyor General Colonel William Light mapped a {{plan for}} the City of Adelaide. The design {{incorporated}} a central square to function as Adelaide's focal point and provide open space for recreational activities. On his first <b>map,</b> <b>Light</b> called the precinct 'The Great Square'. It was eventually named in honour of Princess Victoria, then heir to the throne of England.|$|E
50|$|A GLX pack, option code A16, {{was offered}} on the CM Valiant sedan.

40|$|The {{results of}} the present study suggest that dark-haloed impact craters are {{indicative}} of excavated mafic materials, originally emplaced as volcanic units, but subsequently buried by impact ejecta deposits from large craters and basins.
