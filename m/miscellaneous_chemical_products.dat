The medium and large industries manufacturing chemicals and chemical products are Pfizer, Lubrizol India Ltd., Polyolefins Industries Ltd., NOCIL, Herdillia Chemicals Ltd., BASF (India) Ltd., Star Chemicals, INDOFIL INDUSTRIES LIMITED, and Phoenix Chemical Works. The chemical industries are also found {{in other parts of the}} district like Wagle Industrial Estate, Pokhran Road, Ambarnath and Dombivli. The cotton and non-cotton power looms are mainly located at Bhiwandi, Thane and Kalyan. Traditionally, Bhiwandi is famous for its handlooms. But the deteriorating markets for the handlooms compelled the weavers to replace their handlooms by powerlooms. Fisheries constitute an important industry in Thane district. It is carried out in sea as well as in creeks and estuaries on the western coast. Marine fishery predominates over inland fishery in the district and provides employment to about 75% of the persons engaged in the fishing industry. Fishing in sea is carried out along the coast stretching over about 110km. The important fishing centres in the district are Dahanu, Pokharan-Uchheli, Nawapur, Murabe, Satpute, Datiware, Arnala, Vasai and Uran. Food processing industries like grain mill products, Bakery products, Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery, Salt, ice, slaughtering, preparation and preservation of meat, dairy products, canning and preservation of fruits and vegetables, canning, preserving and processing of fish are developed in the district. Raptakos, Brett and Co., Pfizer Ltd., Cadbury Fry (India) Ltd. which produce modified milk food and high protein food are some of the large and medium companies in the district. Wood products like plywood and veneer, wooden boxes, barrels, bamboo, cane baskets, bobbins, industrial fixtures, cork & cork products are also manufactured in the district. The Tarapur Atomic Power Station which has ushered an era of utilisation of nuclear energy for electricity generation is also situated in the district. The finance is being provided by various public sector and private sector Banks and Financial Institutions in the district.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> from {{the construction industry}} which are {{being used by the}} company Bostads AB Mimer (Mimer), owned by the municipality Västerås in Sweden. The company owns apartments and houses around the city. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to do a simplified risk assessment of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> from a health and  environmental point. The report also gives suggestions of substitutional products. The thesis work consists of a literature study, an analysis of how other companies within the housing sector are working with <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> and a case study, in addition to the simplified risk assessment. The case study contains a selection of Mimer's <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> In order to succeed with the simplified risk assessment, the <b>chemical</b> <b>product’s</b> risks and hazards has been identified through safety data sheets (SDS). Different aspects have been taken into account in the simplified risk assessment. The selection of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> were made after existence frequency and legislative product labeling. The report's results gave 16 selected <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> that are risk assessed. Of the 16 <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> eight products have a high risk score from a heath point. Suggestions of less hazardous <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are given to nine <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> The essay's conclusions are that some of the selected <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are hazardous to the health and the environment, due to their chemical substances. The staff at Mimer's has a high frequency of use of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> in general.

Estimating the total natural gas consumption of industrial <b>products</b> and <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> by accumulating the natural gas consumption of a unit product was not only intricate but also very {{likely to have a}} large error. Thus, in this study we estimate natural gas consumption of chemical industry and industrial fuel according to the natural gas consumption of per unit GDP. The concrete operation is that calculating natural gas consumption intensity of industrial fuels by the ratio of the calendar year production of general industrial products to the corresponding natural gas consumption, and calculating natural gas consumption intensity of <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> by the ratio of the calendar year production of <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> to the corresponding natural gas consumption.|$|R

The {{chemical}} industries worldwide {{are passing}} through a very particular moment of re-adaptation due {{to the implementation of}} an European regulation called, Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). In Brazil, the Brazilian Chemical Industry needs urgently a specific guide of <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> stability. The main purpose of this work is to present a proposal of a guide of stability for <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> based on the reference guides of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).
