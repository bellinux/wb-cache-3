40|$|The use of {{the smart}} grid for {{developing}} intelligent applications is a current trend of great importance. One advantage lies {{in the possibility of}} direct monitoring of all devices connected to the electrical network in order to prevent possible malfunctions. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for an automatic detection of the malfunctioning of low-intelligence consumer electrical devices. <b>Malfunctioning</b> <b>means</b> any deviation of a household device from its normal operating schedule. The method is based on a comparison technique, consisting in the correlation between the current power signature of a device and an ideal signature (the standard signature provided by the manufacturer). The first step of this method is to achieve a simplified form of power signature which keeps all the original features. Further, the signal is segmented based on the data provided by an event detection algorithm (values of the first derivatives) and each resulting component is approximated using a regression function. The final step consists of an analysis based on the correlation between the computed regression coefficients and the coefficients of the standard signal. Following this analysis all the differences are classified as a malfunctioning of the analyzed device...|$|R

40|$|Background—The use of {{percutaneous}} lead extraction {{techniques in}} a patient with extracardiac or protruding atrial leads could have disastrous consequences. Traditionally, the management of these patients has included a median sternotomy. We describe a minimally invasive technique that involves a transatrial, retrograde laser lead extraction using a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach. Methods and Results—Between January 2004 and June 2009, 14 patients with severed leads at the clavicle and extracardiac leads or lead-caused erosions of the atrial wall were identified through chest radiograph and CT scan. There were 9 men and 5 women aged 19 to 91 years (mean age, 69. 7120. 67 years). Ten devices were pacemakers, and 4 were defibrillators. Indications for extraction were 12 infections and 2 <b>malfunctions.</b> <b>Mean</b> ejection fraction was 4217. 67 % (range, 10 % to 65 %). Time of implanted leads was 93. 6951. 88 months (range, 33 to 213 months). Laser sheaths size were 12 F (7. 1 %), 14 F (85. 7 %), and 16 F (7. 1 %). A right-side thoracoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. A retrograde laser sheath maneuver was performed, freeing the lead from any adhesions. The lead was removed and the incision closed. One patient experienced a pleural effusion. There was no mortality, and all patients were alive and well at 1 -month follow-up. Conclusions—Transatrial, retrograde laser lead extraction is a safe and effective procedure. This procedure may provide an excellent alternative to open sternotomy.

40|$|Abstract In modern {{manufacturing}} environments {{waste is}} an issue of great importance. Specifically the research in this thesis looks at issues in establishing the initial steps to gain a generic process monitoring system that ensures that grinding is both optimised but not the determent where costly <b>malfunctions</b> <b>mean</b> the scrapping and re-melting of expensive quality intensive materials. The research conducted in this thesis investigates the process of cutting, ploughing and rubbing during single grit scratch tests. These investigations meant the correlation between physical material removal phenomenon and the emitted material dislocations gained from acoustic emission extraction. The initial work looked at different aerospace materials and the distinction of cutting, ploughing and rubbing during single grit radial scratch tests. This initial work provided novel results not seen in this area before and paved the way for more robust results in investigating the same phenomena during horizontal single grit scratch tests. This work provided more robust classification of cutting, ploughing and rubbing and transferred directly to grinding pass cuts from 1 um and 0. 1 mm depth cuts respectively. In using robust classifiers such as the Neural Network and novel classifiers such as non-linear data paradigms, Fuzzy-c clustering with Genetic Algorithm optimisation, cutting, ploughing and rubbing phenomenon was investigated. These investigations showed that more cutting occurs when there is moreinteraction between grit and workpiece based on the increase depth of cut. Other thesis results investigated a generic classifier using Genetic Programming to classify multiple anomaly phenomena. This work can be bridged together with the unit event grit classification work...|$|R

This work is justified with the complex systems {{by the need}} of controlling and maintaining in dynamical way the global system performances in order to optimise the enterprise strategies. The added value of our methodology is to formalise the maintenance aid models from a priori knowledge both on the system functioning and <b>malfunctioning</b> by <b>means</b> of Bayesian Networks. The networks are built on adaptability principles and integrate uncertainties on the relationships between causes and effects. The feasibility of this methodology is tested in a manufacturing context with the maintenance aids on a lathe machine...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to present a new logic of {{technical}} malfunction. The need for this logic is motivated by a simple-sounding philosophical question: Is a malfunctioning corkscrew, which fails to uncork bottles, nonetheless a corkscrew? Or in general terms, is a malfunctioning F, which fails to do what Fs do, nonetheless an F? We argue that ‘malfunctioning’ denotes the modifier Malfunctioning rather than a property, and that the answer depends on whether Malfunctioning is subsective or privative. If subsective, a malfunctioning F is an F; if privative, a malfunctioning F is not an F. An intensional logic is required to raise and answer the question, because modifiers operate directly on properties and not on sets or individuals. This new logic provides the formal tools to reason about technical <b>malfunction</b> by <b>means</b> of a logical analysis of the sentence “a is a malfunctioning F”. Web of Science 101358154...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{previously}} reported that unstimulated peritoneal macrophages and LPS stimulated Kupffer cell-rich nonparenchymal liver cells (NPC) can inhibit protein synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes. Hepatocyte function was similarly altered by supernatants from LPS-triggered NPC. Secretory products of macrophages and Kupffer cells (monokines) are possible mediators {{in this model}} of cell-mediated modulation of hepatocyte function. In this article, supernatants from NPC capable of altering hepatocyte protein synthesis were found to contain significant amounts of one monokine, interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). The kinetics of the generation {{of the ability to}} inhibit protein synthesis and the appearance of IL- 1 activity were roughly parallel for the first 24 hours. Exposure of hepatocytes to NPC supernatant and commercially available highly purified IL- 1 resulted in similar response patterns with regard to onset of inhibition and progression of suppression after removal. Certain discrepancies cast doubt, however, on the likelihood that IL- 1 is the mediator in this model of cell-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte protein synthesis. Commercial human IL- 1 preparations did not always suppress protein synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, IL- 1 activity was stable for several days but hepatocyte inhibition was lost. Unstimulated peritoneal macrophage supernatants containing IL- 1 activity could not inhibit protein synthesis in hepatocytes. The evidence supports the idea that appropriately stimulated cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage (including Kupffer cells that lie in direct apposition to hepatocytes) could mediate hepatocyte <b>malfunction</b> by <b>means</b> of secreted monokines similar to, but not necessarily identical to, IL- 1...|$|R

40|$|Major {{watersheds}} in North Carolina including {{portions of}} the Cape Fear, Neuse, and the Tar-Pamlico Rivers are impaired because of elevated phosphorus (P) loading from point and non-point sources of pollution. Studies conducted in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina have indicated that onsite wastewater systems (OWS) may be a major contributor of nutrients to groundwater and surface water. However, {{there is a lack}} of published research regarding OWS nutrient contributions to water resources in Piedmont settings, where the soils are much different than in coastal plain regions. Most of North Carolina's population lives in the piedmont region, and a high percentage of piedmont residents utilize OWS, therefore it is important we have an understanding of how OWS function with regards to nutrient treatment. East Carolina University in cooperation with the NC Department of Health and Human Services, and Durham County Department of Public Health was engaged in a study to gather that information. The study included 5 sites in the central piedmont region of North Carolina where over 30 piezometers were installed to monitor groundwater adjacent to and downgradient from OWS. Data indicated that ground water phosphate (PO 4 -P) concentrations were low (typically [less than] 0. 01 mg/L) adjacent to the conventional style drainfields that have greater than 1 m depth to groundwater. However, the surfacing overflow from <b>malfunctioning</b> OWS (<b>mean</b> 0. 37 mg/L) and the discharge from sand filter systems (mean 1. 08 mg/L), both contained elevated concentrations of phosphate. Consequently, surface discharge sand filters systems were contributing higher concentrations of PO 4 -P to surface waters than conventional style OWS. This study will provide important information regarding the management of OWS that are contributing to phosphate loading to nutrient sensitive watersheds in the Piedmont of North Carolina...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{improvements}} in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) and the striking decrease in acute rejection {{lead us to}} focus on the effects of long-term immunosuppression. AIM OF THIS STUDY: Evaluation of a policy of steroid withdrawal and tailored immunosuppression in pancreas-kidney patients treated in a single center. METHODS: review of the clinical charts in 9 SPK recipients (male/female = 5 / 4, median age 41 years, median follow-up 42 months), by the same operator, under supervision of the two usual caregivers. Therapeutic protocols. Induction phase: all patients received mycophenolate mophetil (starting dose: 2 grams), tacrolimus and steroids, 8 received Simulect, 1 received thymoglobulins. Maintenance therapy was slowly reduced, with the goal of steroid withdrawal. RESULTS: The therapeutic adjustments were mainly determined by two almost opposing elements: 1. Rapid adjustments in the case of side-effects (gastrointestinal problems, infections and neoplasia); 2. Slow tapering off in the case of good organ function. On the other hand, a switch to cyclosporine A and to rapamycine was considered in the case of chronic organ <b>malfunction.</b> By these <b>means,</b> over a median of 42 months follow-up, steroid withdrawal was slowly obtained in 6 / 9 patients (at a median time of 25 months). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of this small-scale study, a tailored immunosuppressive policy allows at least some "positively selected" patients to reach the "dream" of steroid withdrawal after SPK...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} identify the most frequently occurring human factors contributing to maintenance-related failures within a petroleum industry organization. Commonality between failures will assist in understanding reliability in maintenance processes, thereby preventing accidents in high-hazard domains. Background: Methods exist for understanding the human factors contributing to accidents. Their application in a maintenance context mainly has been advanced in aviation and nuclear power. Maintenance in the petroleum industry provides a different context for investigating the role that human factors play in influencing outcomes. It is therefore worth investigating the contributing human factors to improve our understanding of both human factors in reliability and the factors specific to this domain. Method: Detailed analyses were conducted of maintenance- related failures (N = 38) in a petroleum company using structured interviews with maintenance technicians. The interview structure {{was based on the}} Human Factor Investigation Tool (HFIT), which in turn was based on Rasmussen’s model of human <b>malfunction.</b> Results: A <b>mean</b> of 9. 5 factors per incident was identified across the cases investigated. The three most frequent human factors contributing to the maintenance failures were found to be assumption (79 % of cases), design and maintenance (71 %), and communication (66 %). Conclusion: HFIT proved to be a useful instrument for identifying the pattern of human factors that recurred most frequently in maintenance-related failures. Application: The high frequency of failures attributed to assumptions and communication demonstrated the importance of problem-solving abilities and organizational communication in a domain where maintenance personnel have a high degree of autonomy and a wide geographical distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{patients}} with {{end-stage renal disease}} use a central venous catheter for hemodialysis access. A large majority of these catheters malfunction within one year of insertion, with up to two-thirds due to thrombosis. The optimal solution for locking the catheter between hemodialysis sessions, to decrease the risk of thrombosis and catheter malfunction, is unknown. The Prevention of Catheter Lumen Occlusion with rt-PA versus Heparin (PreCLOT) study will determine if use of weekly rt-PA, compared to regular heparin, as a catheter locking solution, will decrease the risk of catheter malfunction. Methods/Design The study population will consist of patients requiring chronic hemodialysis thrice weekly who are dialyzed with a newly inserted permanent dual-lumen central venous catheter. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive rt-PA 1 mg per lumen once per week, with heparin 5, 000 units per ml as a catheter locking solution for the remaining two sessions. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive heparin 5, 000 units per ml as a catheter locking solution after each dialysis session. The study treatment period will be six months, with 340 patients to be recruited from 14 sites across Canada. The primary outcome will be catheter <b>malfunction,</b> based on <b>mean</b> blood flow parameters while on hemodialysis, with a secondary outcome of catheter-related bacteremia. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken to assess the cost of maintaining a catheter using rt-PA as a locking solution, {{compared to the use}} of heparin. Discussion Results from this study will determine if use of weekly rt-PA, compared to heparin, will decrease catheter malfunction, as well as assess the cost-effectiveness of these locking solutions. </p...|$|R

This chapter deals with the most commonly used natural polymers for regenerative medicine. It also presents some examples of commercially available natural-origin materials. Natural polymers are widely used due to their similarities with the extracellular matrix (ECM), the variety of physico-chemical properties, the generally high biological performance and the cell or enzyme-controlled degrad-ability. These characteristics classify the natural-origin polymers {{as one of the most}} attractive materials to be used in the tissue engineering field and drug delivery application. The fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine aim to promote the regeneration of tissues or replacing failing or <b>malfunctioning</b> organs, by <b>means</b> of combining a scaffold/support material, adequate cells and bioactive molecules.

40|$|There is {{a serious}} concern {{as to whether the}} Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) will provide imagery up until the launch of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), which is {{expected}} in December 2012. The concern is due to fuel shortages and sporadic satellite and sensor problems. The Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) scan-line corrector (SLC) <b>malfunction</b> in 2003 <b>means</b> that ETM+ imagery contains strips of missing data. Consequently there is concern that the highest quality Landsat imagery may not be available for monitoring for the years 2011 and 2012. Natural resource monitoring agencies, therefore, are faced with the serious challenge of determining a suitable alternative to Landsat- 5 TM imagery should the need arise. While literature exists on possible alternatives, {{there is a lack of}} studies that provide guidelines to monitoring agencies on the issues to be explored when considering an alternative data source. We undertook a study that identified Landsat- 7 ETM+, SPOT 4 HRVIR, SPOT 5 HRG, and IRS-P 6 LISS-III as the most suitable alternatives for monitoring vegetation cover in Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) in eastern Australia. None of the sensors were found to be ideal candidates due to a combination of one or more of lower radiometric quality, increased data volumes, additional processing requirements, and higher purchasing costs. We found that the low cost and ease of access to Landsat- 7 ETM+ made it a technically and economically viable option for annual monitoring of woody vegetation extent and change in eastern Australia. However, Landsat- 7 ETM+ may not be an option in many areas of the world due to high cloud coverage. We used the experiences gained through this work to recommend a process that natural resource management agencies can use to explore the issues related to selecting an alternative to Landsat- 5 TM for land cover monitoring...|$|R
