40|$|The authors {{examine the}} {{modifications}} of the Belgian refugee law, introduced on 6 May 1993. Those modifications follow the annulment {{of the so-called}} double 5 % rule by the Court of Arbitration. That rule required that refugees from certain countries submit proof of a well-founded fear of persecution before their request for refugee status could even be considered admissible. That rule comprises two notions, namely, that of the <b>manifestly</b> <b>unfounded</b> <b>claim</b> and the safe country of origin. Annulled because it introduced a discrimination between refugees according to their country of origin, the rule has now been extended to all refugees by the new law. Beyond the question of discrimination, the authors also look at the rule's compatibility with the Geneva Convention, especially given its extensive application. They recall that, according to {{the logic of the}} system of the Geneva Convention, without access to the territory of an asylum State, there is no access to the procedure of recognition of the quality of refugee, and therefore no possible protection...|$|E

These applications include in particular complaints about petty offenses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{addresses}} {{conditions that}} divide the Danish Foreign Office’s identification of <b>manifestly</b> <b>unfounded</b> asylum seekers from the Danish Refugee Council’s (DRC) authority to veto and prevent such designation. <b>Manifestly</b> <b>unfounded</b> asylum seekers are identified by a procedure in the Danish asylum system called “åbenbart grundløs-proceduren”. This procedure allows the Danish Foreign Office to give asylum seekers non-appealable rejections. Methodologically and theoretically the thesis {{is based on}} sociology of law, focusing on the application of law amongst the caseworkers from the two above-mentioned organizations. The overall assumption is that the answer must be clarified by investigating internal as well as external structures’ affect on the law. Empirically the thesis is based on 18 asylum cases processed by the two organizations’ caseworkers and on 4 interviews with two representatives from the organizations. The empirical data is gathered and analyzed using a grounded theory research process: sampling, coding, and categorization the data. Combined, two theses based on legal theory and one thesis based on perceptions of sociology of law form a theoretical {{point of departure for}} analyzing the results of the research process. It is concluded that the Foreign Office and DRC agree on the current law for the assessment of identifying <b>manifestly</b> <b>unfounded</b> asylum seekers. What separates them is their perception of the legal criteria. Formal as well as informal legal norms are given priority in the caseworkers’ application of the law, the thesis draws attention especially to one condition. The fact that the caseworkers represent different organizations is essential considering their approach to the law, as well as to their identification of the asylum seeker’s motive. In a final perspective on the results of this thesis a number of legal, political considerations are brought forth...|$|R
50|$|An {{application}} {{that has been}} rejected as <b>manifestly</b> <b>unfounded</b> has a barrier effect {{as long as the}} rejection is justified by Section 30 (3.1-6) AsylVfG, since with regard to Section 10 (3) Act on the Residence (AufenthG) prior to leaving the federal territory no residence title can be granted. An exception is granted when an unsuccessful asylum seeker is otherwise entitled to a residence permit. One common example is when an asylum seeker joins a German family (Section 28 (1) AufenthG).|$|R

5000|$|Another motif is {{the play}} on the words nothing and noting, which in Shakespeare's day were near-homophones. Taken literally, the title implies that a great fuss ("much ado") is made of {{something}} which is insignificant ("nothing"), such as the <b>unfounded</b> <b>claims</b> of Hero's infidelity and the <b>unfounded</b> <b>claims</b> that Benedick and Beatrice are in love with one another. The title could also be understood as Much Ado About Noting. Much of the action is in interest in and critique of others, written messages, spying, and eavesdropping. This is mentioned several times, particularly concerning [...] "seeming," [...] "fashion," [...] and outward impressions. Nothing is a double entendre; [...] "an O-thing" [...] (or [...] "n othing" [...] or [...] "no thing") was Elizabethan slang for [...] "vagina", evidently derived from the pun of a woman having [...] "nothing" [...] between her legs.|$|R

[...] These cases were dismissed as <b>manifestly</b> <b>unfounded.</b> Again, the Court referred to the traditional concept of marriage which Article 12 was founded in. [...] The Court acknowledged that a number of Contracting States had extended marriage to same sex couples but went on to say [...] "this reflected their own vision of the role of marriage in their societies and did not flow from an interpretation of the fundamental right as laid down by the Contracting States in the Convention in 1950."
