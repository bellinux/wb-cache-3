40|$|This article {{highlights}} how single migrant women (SMW) {{from rural}} northern Ghana generate livelihoods through {{the adoption of}} both market and non-market based strategies by extending and then prioritising moral obligations to community members beyond their immediate households {{instead of focusing on}} <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> The setting is the Old Fadama market in Accra, Ghana. Communities of old and new SMW build a “moral community economy” through, amongst others, engaging in reciprocal labour, gift giving, childcare and food sharing. Our study reveals the importance of this moral community economy to SMW's livelihood generation and how it is sustained through social relations amongst women, in which also generation, ethnicity and regional background, play crucial roles. SMW give support to and receive benefits from the community through moral obligations and ethnic commitment. The analysis of these strategies contributes {{to the understanding of the}} intersections of household, livelihood strategies, gender and markets in urban settings...|$|E

The matrix rates describe the evolution of multidimensional capital and they are sensitive to both quantitative changes of individual elements and flows between them.

40|$|Ladies and Gentlemen, in its {{publicity}} {{campaign to}} attract {{a large number of}} visitors to the forthcoming Olympic Games here in this city, our host this year, Greece, has adopted the slogan “Where there is noble Competition, there is Victory”. The slogan comes, as many of you will know, from Aristotle, one of the greatest thinkers in our history – unfortunately often wrongly interpreted and put into practice in the sense of “Where there is ruthless Competition, there is Victory“. Many recent political, banking and managerial scandals, in both {{the old and the new}} worlds, bear witness to this enormous misunderstanding of Aristotle’s message. As against this, it is gratifying that responsible politicians and academics, such as Johannes Rau, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, whose successor is being elected today, and the Swiss Professor Ulrich Thielemann, are increasingly calling for a new economic ethic; for an ethic concerning a more prudent management of our natural resources and our environment, for an ethic concerning a fair balance between productivity and quality of life, between the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> and the optimisation of profits, and finally for an ethic concerning the balance between the interests of commercial undertakings and the interests of society as a whole...|$|E
40|$|In {{deregulated}} electricity markets, hydropower portfolio {{design has}} become an essential task for producers. The previous research on hydropower portfolio optimisation focused mainly on the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> but did {{not take into account}} riverine ecosystem protection. Although profit maximisation is the major objective for producers in deregulated markets, protection of riverine ecosystems must be incorporated into the process of hydropower portfolio optimisation, especially against a background of increasing attention to environmental protection and stronger opposition to hydropower generation. This research seeks mainly to remind hydropower producers of the requirement of river protection when they design portfolios and help shift portfolio optimisation from economically oriented to ecologically friendly. We establish a framework to determine the optimal portfolio for a hydropower reservoir, accounting for both economic benefits and ecological needs. In this framework, the degree of natural flow regime alteration is adopted as a constraint on hydropower generation to protect riverine ecosystems, and the maximisation of mean annual revenue is set as the optimisation objective. The electricity volumes assigned in different electricity submarkets are optimised by the noisy genetic algorithm. The proposed framework is applied to China's Wangkuai Reservoir to test its effectiveness. The results show that the new framework could help to design eco-friendly portfolios that can ensure a planned profit and reduce alteration of the natural flow regime...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{representations}} {{of women in}} advertisements featured in South African Cosmopolitan magazine published in 2004 so as to critically analyse the stereotypes of women it presents, the institutional mechanisms behind this {{and its implications for}} gender ‘constructions’. By using a random cluster sample, 60 advertisements found in Cosmopolitan were analysed to examine the stereotypical portrayals of women within its imagery. In addition, survey questionnaires were distributed amongst female students to determine whether exposure to advertisements featured in Cosmopolitan magazines moulds their thoughts with regard to South African women today, as well as to analyse their attitudinal change before and after exposure to a number of advertisements. It was found that even though the majority of respondents claimed {{to be aware of the}} stereotypical representations of women found in the advertisements, and did not believe that these portrayals were a true reflection of South African women, various aspects of their lives continue to be affected by these representations in a number of ways. The findings of this study indicate that the trend found in previous studies – that stereotypical images of women prevail in the media – is evident in South Africa too. It was established that the ideologies of both patriarchy and capitalism work together in supporting the pervasiveness of negative, disempowering portrayals of women in Cosmopolitan advertisements. Stereotypical imagery of women serve as the site at which the ideologies of capitalism and patriarchy fuse, drawing on a common, shared notion of the objectified female to further their goals of <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> and male dominance respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{internal}} {{views from}} UK businesses expect the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> {{and delivery of}} value for the customer; the external view expects realistic profits and provision of employment. However, this view is changing, with customers increasingly demanding products and services that also demonstrate environmental responsibility and minimise climate impacts. Although the cause-effect relationship between business operations, negative environmental impacts and climate change is well established there is now an enhanced appreciation that environmental challenges are systemic, interlinked and cannot be addressed in isolation. Despite the proliferation of ‘low cost’ or ‘no cost’ technological and behavioural opportunities, businesses struggle to realise opportunities that address these interlinked challenges, demonstrate environmental responsibility and minimise climate impacts, as they are embedded in economic systems in which improvement equals investment. Environmental improvement interventions have become synonymous with cost consumption rather than cost saving; frequently at odds with corporate financial strategies. In an attempt to change this view, support the mitigation of climate change through the reduction of environmental impacts and develop successful employment-ready graduates skilled in effective environmental improvement techniques, an innovative Environmental Strategy Module engaging postgraduate students in environmental management strategy design is taught at Coventry University. This offers students a more financially accessible approach to environmental improvement: a self-funding environmental management strategy created through the Environmental Value for Money Framework. This paper presents a conceptual study of the Environmental Value for Money Framework and its engagement of students as future employees in creating self-funded, economically viable environmental management strategies.

For this reason the research on assessing the work of the library can re-define the limits and its possibilities concerning information, learning and teaching. This paper presents the methodology that was followed for the evaluation of services of Panteion Library University and its outcomes. Final aim of the research was the improvement of library’s services, the mapping out of directions for the allocation of its sources and secure the constructive changes for more efficient action and moreover the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> of its users. This aim was realised via the investigation of effectiveness of services of library and the recording, analysis and examination of perceptions, opinions, and representations of the users about the library, but also further needs, demands and their expectations. The method that was used was focus group method across the categories of undergraduate students, graduate students, library staff and University professors. In addition, questionnaires were designed to collect data concerning the perceived quality and quantity of the library’s local and electronic services (as they are estimated by the users). The first questionnaire, distributed in the area of library, was answered by 300 users and combined measures of awareness of the library services available, services satisfaction, ease of use of access systems, evaluation of library staff, satisfaction of library environment and rules and the general satisfaction survey. A second questionnaire was completed online by 180 users during their navigation to the available electronic resources of the library, referred to the awareness of the electronic resources, the frequency and ease of such an activity, as soon as the efficacy of obtaining information.

40|$|Sustainable {{growth and}} {{responsibility}} for {{the economy and the}} environment are postulates rarely associated with the term “financial market”. Financial markets are identified with the ruthless <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> at acceptable risk, rather than with socially responsible conduct.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{political}} economy of mining laws and regulation in Namibia from 1884 to 1986. Mining laws and regulations have {{played an important role in}} the exploitation of Namibia's mineral resources since the colonial period. They have also played an important role in the exploitations by foreign mining companies of Namibia's mineral resources. The study shows how this process has evolved. Chapter I discusses the link between colonialism and exploitation. It also shows the special interest of the colonial administration in mineral development. The formal and substantive rules governing the acquisition of mineral rights are discussed in detail in Chapter II. An important element in the exploitation of Namibia's mineral resources is the international market. Chapter III examines the marketing of Namibia's minerals. It shows that the colonial administration is unable and unwilling to exercise control in this area. Special attention is paid to the marketing of diamonds as it illustrates very well the dominant position of the mining companies. Marketing of minerals is closely linked with taxation. This is examined in Chapter IV. The chapter reveals that the inadequacies of the legislation enables mining companies to achieve their objective, <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> without corresponding benefits to Namibia. The exploitation of Namibia's mineral resources has a direct effect on the environment. Chapter V shows that the spread of multinational mining companies and their operations have a direct effect on the environment, health and safety of mine employees and the community in surrounding areas. It also shows that mining laws and regulations are inadequate to cope with this problem. South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia since the termination of the mandate in 1966 has important legal consequences. The legal status of the mining concessions granted by South Africa before and after the termination of the mandate are examined in Chapter VI in the light of the United Nations action in this respect. In order to clarify the options for independent Namibia, Chapter VII discusses the experience of other developing countries in mineral development and their relationship with multinational companies. In Chapter VII, we recommend that mining laws and regulations of an independent Namibia should reflect the needs of the Namibian population...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing is an {{important}} business tool in the modern world. In the modern era of globalisation, it provides management {{with the opportunity to}} manipulate prices, pursuing the business objective of <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> This in turn allows for increased distribution to the shareholders. From a profit maximisation perspective, this concept is certainly tenable. However, businesses need to pay due consideration to the taxation implications of transfer pricing. While allowing for effective repatriation of profits from a high or low tax jurisdiction to a low or no tax jurisdiction, businesses need to be duly consider the taxation consequences if the revenue authorities establish that the tax base of their country is being depleted by such repatriations. In certain jurisdictions, the statutory powers allows for reconstruction with the existence of a mere suspicion of unacceptable price manipulation. Unlike New Zealand, the statutory framework imposes onerous obligations on the Commissioner to challenge the transfer prices by establishing that the adopted transfer pricing method is not comparable to arms length transactions. Largely, transfer pricing involves a degree of price manipulation between a parent and a subsidiary. Against this background, multi-nationals need to balance this against the social obligations of the citizens of the country. The central issue behind almost all transfer pricing disputes between multinationals and revenue authorities is whether the prices charged is consistent with that of independent and un-associated parties. In saying this, it has to be recognised that certain transactions may have little to no comparable transactions, which constraints the search to substantiate the basis for the pricing. To make this concept workable, the transfer pricing rules in most jurisdictions operate on the basis of treating the parent and the subsidiary as separate entities. While this concept is theoretically sound, practically {{it is very difficult to}} “artificially” make the distinction for cross border transactions. Against this practical constraint, multinationals and revenue authorities reliance on commercial databases to corroborate the transfer prices certainly poses more questions. Effectively, the requirement to keep the transfer prices at arms length is discharged through utilisation of a database, designed for purposes other than transfer pricing...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Most {{employers}} {{agree that}} the effectiveness and success of their organisations depend on the effective utilisation of their human resources. Ill health in the workplace {{is a threat to}} optimal productivity, reduced absenteeism, provision of sustainable employee benefits, a motivated workforce, staff retention and <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> Burnout and engagement are therefore important fields of investigation in the industrial psychology field. The aim of this study was to: test a model of work-related well-being; develop and evaluate a resilience intervention programme for a large financial services institution in South Africa. Article 1 used a cross-sectional survey design. The participants were predominantly in the administrative, call centre and IT divisions (N = 192). Article 2 was the development of a resilience model, which was based on the integration of thinking from an extensive literature review by the researcher. Article 3 used an experimental design, with a control group (n= 51) and an experimental group («= 55). Information was collected in a longitudinal research. The research method {{for each of the three}} articles of this study consisted of a brief literature review and an empirical study. The measuring instruments used in this study were the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), Job Demands-Resources Scale (JD-RS), Health subscales, Organisational Commitment subscales, the ASSET questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R) and a biographical questionnaire. In both article 1 and article 3, descriptive statistics were computed to describe the data; as were Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients to specify the relationship between the variables. In article 1, multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predicted by the independent variables. In article 3, paired-samples f-tests were used to determine the difference in results for year 1 and year 2. Article 1 showed the central role that low optimism plays in contributing to burnout, and high optimism plays in work engagement. Interestingly, high social support was linked to increased cynicism, whilst low social support contributed to dedication. Burnout contributed to both physical and psychological ill health. Dedication and low cynicism contributed to affective commitment, whilst engagement and low cynicism contributed to behavioural commitment. Article 2 was the development of a multidimensional, proactive coping approach which consistently strives to develop and enhance the individual's resilience coping reservoir pools (mental, spiritual, socio-emotional and physical) leading to improved resilience, wellness and quality of life. Each reservoir pool has activities that enhance the fitness of the individual, namely physical (rest and relaxation, exercise and nutrition), mental (stimuli, reflection and empowering thinking), spiritual (coat of arms, pay it forward and gratitude), socio-emotional (breaking destructive relationships and nurturing relationships, responsibility). Article 3 's results showed that the resilience intervention resulted in a statistically significant difference decrease in psychological ill health. Recommendations for future research were made.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} market-oriented strategic decision-making {{by farmers}} in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) farm development paths of dairy farmers in Slovenia, Poland and Lithuania were analysed. The influence of internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats, and farmer goals on strategic choices and performance were explored. Principal component, hierarchical cluster and {{regression analyses were}} performed to test the conceptual framework. Seven strategic groups emerged with specific development paths, that is, Wait and see, Movers, Chain integrators, Specializers and Diversifiers. The latter two split into cooperative and independent groups. <b>Maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> and sustainable farming ranked highest as farming goals. Availability of land and labour were weaknesses for all strategic groups in all countries. External opportunities and threats varied between countries {{and to a lesser}} degree between strategic groups. The Wait and see and Cooperating diversifier groups gave less optimistic scores than other strategic groups. The attitudes of CEE farmers towards the market and future Common Agricultural Policy remain more negative than those of a group of Western European farmers. The results of this study confirm that internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats, together with farmers’ goals and strategies influence farmer performance, but independently of each other. Strategies {{do not appear to be}} a mediating variable between the internal and external environment of the farm and the performance of the farm. Policy makers, companies and extension workers should take the heterogeneity in strategic development into account when dealing with these and similar groups of farms...|$|R
40|$|Workshop DIn 1999 the Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} the county should {{introduce}} so-called ”quality contracts” for public transport in the county. The main idea {{of this type of}} contract is that decisions on the level of service (routes and frequencies) are left to the operators while the fares are subject to regulation by the county. A basic ingredient of such contracts should be a remuneration scheme linked to the level of service. The purpose of the remuneration is to internalise the impacts on consumers’ surplus caused by changes in the level of service. This impact is inadequately captured by the changes in fare revenue. Theory gives some guidance with respect to the principle of proper remuneration. A model was calibrated {{for each of the three}} main bus operators in Hordaland and used to estimate the rates of remuneration that would induce the operator to provide an optimum level of service based on <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> Modelling indicated that the remuneration schemes should consist for fixed rates per revenue kilometre and vehicle hour of revenue service for basic services and additional peak services respectively. Due to substantial deviation between fare and marginal cost for peak passengers, two operators should also have a remuneration per peak passengers. Modelling also showed that the sum of fare revenue and remuneration per km, hour and peak passenger would imply excessive profits and that the contracts therefor should include the deduction of a fixed amount. This is a novel and promising approach to contracting for public transport services. The heavy reliance on modelling means that the stakeholders must have confidence in the model and the results produced. In year 2000, contracts were implemented in the County of Hordaland based on these principles and results from modelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} development of Electricity Storage Systems (ESS) technologies {{has made them}} interesting choices in the utility scale electricity market. Renewable sources intermittency, load management and power quality are the major purposes of ESS investment in grids. Their primary goal is to technically find the best solution for those problems, while the economic profits pass through that. However, in the increasingly competitive market environments, ESS would possibly {{be able to be}} operated simply to maximise profits for the investor, without aiming in a specific technical problem solution. In that sense, ESS follow the simple guideline oftrading wholesale electricity; purchasing cheap and selling expensive electricity. Another characteristic of today's electricity markets is that the load pattern becomes more erratic, having higher peaks and the load factor ofthe generation and grid falls. Utilities use Demand-Side Management (DSM) to control the demand. One of the features of this control is the peak shaving and shifting of load to off-peak hours. This research optimises the operation ofESS; it identifies the best combination ofcharging and discharging operations (duration and timing within a management period) aiming in <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits,</b> in two options of management periods; one-day and three-day. Three very important elements of the analysis is the extent in which the profitability ofESS is affected by the existence ofDSM programmes in the market, whether the ESS can be granted with emissions allowances and up to which installed capacity of ESS in the electricity network the profits are positive. For this purpose, a dynamic optimisation model has been built, which incorporates a deterministic model as a real case of application with specific values of parameters. The dynamic modelling assesses the point where the investments in power capacity of ESS show their maximum achieved profits per installed MW, in combinations of four main options: DSM, NoDSM, 24 h and 72 h management period. The deterministic model aims at the optimisation ofthe allocation ofthe charge and discharge operations, simulating a real situation with specific data and parameters. The results show that DSM programmes can have substantial impacts on net revenues and profits achieved by ESS, but not such, on variable costs and revenues. Profitability falls and amongst the storage technologies tested, only those with high electrical round trip efficiency and low replacement costs can be viable investment options. So, the extent of DSM application in the market can influence storage profitability in a variable way. High capital costs and low efficiencies are the first factors to work prohibitively, alongside with DSM, to the profitability ofESS. Investigation of extending the management period from one to three days, has given higher net revenues with relatively smaller increase of discharged electricity. The indirect emissions d'le to the charging operation of the ESS depend on the primary source of energy used to generate the electricity which was stored and therefore, the ESS cannot be granted of emissions allowances in the way they are considered in this research. However, if there are bilateral trading agreements between renewable energy generators and the operators of the ESS, then the avoided emissions of ESS would be positive and the profitability would grow from the participation in the ETS. In the case that the regulations could recognise some economic benefits for ESS (like they do for renewable sources) they could stand more easily and quickly in the competitive electricity market. Funding opportunities for covering the capital cost and special rates for selling electricity to the network and for providing ancillary services can be some of them.

40|$|Female labour {{migrants}} in West Africa including Ghana {{have been}} widely perceived as followers of male relatives. Since the late 1990 s, the increasing movement of young women to cities in the region has drawn attention to this phenomenon and this study discovered females as actors in the migration process.   Women have been moving from the rural North to the urban South, especially to Accra, {{to live in the}} city’s slums. Their migrations are not associational; these journeys are now independently pursued by women with aspirations to realise their ideals of a better life. Female migrations make up a growing share of migrant labour streams within Ghana. Among the migrants who arrive in Accra every day there is an increasing number of single young women as well as divorced women and neglected as wives from the North of Ghana. Economic explanations do not fully account for such moves, because men and women perform different productive and reproductive roles within the northern households. The varying degrees of gender and intra-household inequality and the women’s anticipation of life changes after migration spur the motivations and aspirations behind the journeys.   This study on single migrant women (SMW) was conducted in two sites. The first site was in four districts in the Northern Region with its capital Tamale. The Dagomba are the pre­dominant ethnic group here. They practise subsistence farming {{and most of them are}} Muslims. The second study site was the Old Fadama (OF) market in Accra. By tracking the migrant women from the North to OF, the study connected the spaces of area of origin and area of destination in the migration process. A mixed-methods approach was applied in data collection, combining qualitative methods such as focus group discussion, case study and life history with a survey in the OF market. While in the past the restrictions on women’s sexuality and autonomy prevented women from migrating alone, now northern households provide an incentive for young women to migrate. The women cited a gain in autonomy and freedom as the most important motivation for their move. In the household of their fathers or future husbands in the North, their autonomy is constrained. However, through their earnings in Accra, the women prepare themselves for an expensive religious marriage ceremony, invest in housing or education and also buy modern goods. Young migrant women from the rural Dagomba communities primarily engage in accumulating goods for their dowry, whereas older women accumulate capital for investment in their children’s education. The older women who have no plans anymore of returning to the North to marry, especially those who are successful in Accra and have achieved the status of ‘market mummies’, seek enjoyment in the present but also use their wealth to secure construction of rooms of their own in the North. The women save money, assemble housewares and send remittances with their own independent income. In Accra, most young women engage in petty trading. In the OF market in Accra these single migrant women from the North generate livelihoods through the adoption of both market and non-market based strategies by extending and prioritising moral obligations to community members beyond their immediate households, instead of just focusing on <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> Communities of old and young market women have built a ‘moral community economy’ through, among others, engaging in reciprocal labour, gift giving, and childcare and food sharing. This contributes positively to household food security and social well-being among the market women and migrant settlers in the OF community. SMW’s livelihood generation is sustained through social relations among women, in which also age, ethnicity and regional background play crucial roles. SMW give support to and receive benefits from the community through moral obligations and ethnic commitment. The analysis of these strategies contributes to the understanding of the intersections of household, livelihood strategies, gender and markets in urban settings. In Accra, these women not only need to find income earning activities, they also have to reinvent themselves as consumers because of the abundant and varied consumption options in Accra as compared to the North. Through consumption of food, hairdos and leisure activities, they shape their new urban identities. However, through consumption they also try to secure the desired next phase in their life course. Despite earning very modest amounts of money with activities such as hawking or food vending, SMW save for their future and adapt their consumption to enable such savings. They save in money and in kind, buying items to set up their own hearths in the North for the preparation of meals, an iconic married woman’s activity, and to be able to enter a preferred, i. e. religious, marriage. They also spend money on dressing, styling their hairdos and looking good in order to attract suitable marriage candidates. Alternatively, the successful older women in the market place invest in conspicuous consumption to enact their informal position of ‘market mummies’, women who are well established and suitable mentors to more recent arrivals. The women shape their own life courses through consumption. The consumption practices SMW engage in are crucial for understanding the dynamics of single migrant women’s agency. After migration, SMW are more likely to exert influence on the timing of their marriage and the choice of the partner. In the place of origin there are transformations of the gendered subjectivities women experience after having produced livelihoods away from home. The investigation of the reintegration experience of SMW who return to their place of origin revealed the everyday experience of returned migrant women within their households in rural northern Ghana. The study found the household to be an ‘arena of everyday life’; the word arena indicates dynamics and even struggle. These are visible in the provision for daily needs, and also in the income generating activities the women try to initiate to exercise their agency in generating livelihood. In this household arena, we recognized the gender dynamics around decision-making on livelihood generation as key to under­standing the reintegration experience of returned migrant women. The analysis drew on feminist geographers’ insights of gender as process situated in a specific place. Critical attention was paid to how gender and household are co-constituted, to shed light on the multiple and contradictory ways in which gender, livelihood, and household are constructed.   Applying the lens of gender as situated process enabled capturing the significance of everyday micro transformations, resulting in a framework that wove together the domains of gender, household and livelihood. Contingent formations of intra-household dynamics revealed variations in the ways subjection and activation are enacted. The boundaries of women’s triple shifts (household work, farming, income generation) are not fixed but are constantly negotiated. On an everyday basis women have to juggle multiple subjectivities, such as being wives, daughters-in-law, mothers and petty commodity producers and traders. They do the work their husbands and senior women require them to do in order to secure their marriage, which is considered a lifelong security in this specific context, but they try to set limits to this work. The general conclusion this study highlights is that the young women in the North successfully negotiate to realize their aspirations to migrate and, upon return, both subject themselves to the domestic and patriarchal order and contest it by using the means and skills they acquired to improve their bargaining position. This causes cracks in the prevailing order, which suggest the malleability of the patriarchal system. The observed processes underpin the relevance of conceptualising migration as an intrinsic factor in broader processes of development and social transformation.  ...|$|E

In this paper, public transport fare and headway are jointly optimised using an activity-based simulation framework. Unlike traditional analytical models that find single optimal values for headway, fare and other optimisation variables, we obtain a range of values for the optimal fare and headway, due to the randomness in user behaviour that is inherent to an agent-based approach. Waiting times and implications of an active bus capacity constraint are obtained on an agent-byagent basis. The <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> operator <b>profit</b> or social welfare result in different combinations of the most likely optimal headway and fare. We show that the gap between welfare and profit optimal solutions is smaller when users can adjust their departure time according to their activities, timetabling and convenience of the public transport service...|$|R
40|$|The doublesash butterflyfish, Chaetodon marleyi, {{indigenous}} to South Africa, is popular amongst marine aquarists. To {{provide a basis}} for the management of the species and assess its suitability for aquaculture, aspects of its biology were investigated. Specimens were collected between February 1996 and November 1997 from localities along the eastern Cape coastline of South Africa and from specimens in the RUSI fish collection. The dentition of C. marleyi is typical of non-coraline, benthic invertebrate feeding chaetodontids. The teeth are long, inwardly hooked and spatulate which allow easy grasping and manipulation of the prey. Stomach content analysis showed that the species fed predominantly on the tentacles of terebellid polychaetes with other polychaetes, crustaceans, hydro ids and ascideans contributing to the remainder of the diet. Juveniles had a larger volume of terebellid tentacles compared to adults which preyed more upon other polychaetes. The proximate composition (64. 25 % protein, 4. 76 % fat, 4. 84 % carbohydrate and 24. 3 kJ/g total energy content) of the terebellid tentacles was determined suggesting a high energetic requirement of the fish or <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> feeding <b>profit</b> rates...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews UK employer's {{provision}} of lifelong learning. It opens with {{an overview of}} the concept of the learning organisation and the barriers that {{stand in the way of}} its adoption, arguing that relatively few UK organisations have or are about to becoming learning organisations. It then examines the record on providing lifelong learning to its adult workforce, which suggests that certain groups of workers (part-timers, older workers, those in low status jobs, those working in SMEs, and the less well qualified) are at risk of receiving very little non-task specific training. The paper then highlights the dwindling role, which policy makers are according to employers in the strategies for lifelong learning. The structural factors that explain this picture are outlined, including firms' product market strategies, the impact of the structure of the domestic market, the persistence of routinised forms of work organisation and job design, and the pressure for the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> short-term <b>profits.</b> The paper concludes with a plea for a different style and type of policy approach to lifelong learning, that engages with these issues and which addresses the often-limited demand for higher levels of skill in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|M. A. (Marketing Communication) In {{this study}} {{it is argued}} that the {{consumer}} has evolved and grown into a force that is no longer passive, taking the actions of its brands for granted. They ask questions, challenge and are inherently active, a state of being that is accelerated, facilitated and aided by the Internet and social media. This active stakeholder concept is operationally defined as the pressure exerted by informed consumers to hold brands and organisations responsible and accountable for the well-being of society and the environment, beyond the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit,</b> and to expect such entities to be responsive to and in dialogue with consumers as stakeholders of brands and organisations. It is questioned, at the same time, to what extent South African brand leaders have stayed current and informed with regard to this new breed of active consumer stakeholder, and whether Corporate Social Responsibility practices are not often used as a smokescreen to ‘greenwash’ actions. The study aimed to address the research problem by linking the key concepts of corporate social responsibility, stakeholder theory, normative stakeholder theory, corporate social responsiveness, stakeholder activism, stakeholder communication and accountability in an attempt to ascertain to what extent the active consumer stakeholder concept has taken root in strategic communication activities of 50 brand leaders in the country, and to develop a measuring instrument for brands to evaluate to what extent they are attuned to the active consumer stakeholder concept. The research methodology made use of reliability tests and cluster analyses, themes were established based on an extensive literature review. Ultimately, the tool was comprised of a series of Likert-type questions, a ranking question and three open-ended questions which added depth to the other elements of the tool. The findings indicate a lack of congruence, within the sphere of South African brand leaders, with regards to the notion of the active consumer stakeholder. However, they also suggest an assimilation, and move to congruence, through a connection between the nuances that exist {{at both ends of the}} stakeholder continuum i. e. shareholder theory and stakeholder theory.

At the first step, and because the control input is the torque (or the linear force) delivered by the generator, we start by limiting mechanically the nominal velocity. For that purpose, we introduce a new quantity based on short-term wave analysis, namely the maximum expected relative velocity. It may be evaluated when both the wave energy converter is controlled or not. Using long-term wave analysis, based on a known local wave climate, we can constraint the maximum relative velocity that the system have to handle. It appears {{that because of the}} constraint applied on the torque, it has to be chosen when no loading is applied. Once it have been chosen, we can then determine the generator nominal power rating based on a time-domain analysis. In this context we use two simple criteria (i) one based on the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> the produced electrical energy, (ii) the second on the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> the annual <b>profit.</b> From numerical investigation, it appears that it exists a point which make a compromise between these two antinomic criteria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{biorefinery}} concept {{as a way}} to approach the problem for integrated municipal solid waste management. The design of an urban biorefinery, integrating the plastics and paper recycling processes, was performed using a superstructure optimisation approach. The objective function was the <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> before-tax <b>profit.</b> The approach was applied to a case study in Bangkok for the design of an urban biorefinery processing 500, 000 t/y of waste. Three scenarios were analysed: (1) considering recycling and technology-specific targets, (2) considering supply of local demands and (3) similar to 1 but without incentives for waste-to-energy facilities. The biorefinery approach allowed balancing deficits and surpluses from the various processes, making the whole plant profitable. Scenario 2 showed that more resources can be circulated within the system if policies focus on targets for satisfaction of local demands. Under scenario 3, the biorefinery offers economic advantage over stand-alone processes such as AD with CHP or incineration and also promotes the recycling of resources. Therefore, urban waste biorefining has the emerging property of enabling resource looping and can potentially increase resource efficiency in urban environments. This property does prevent destruction of valuable materials, that otherwise go to energy production, and favours their recovery and circularity within the local system...|$|R
40|$|Simplistic {{economic}} objectives such as <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> producer <b>profits</b> are <b>of</b> little {{relevance in}} generating information {{to assist in}} the management of natural resources beyond the individual firm level. To provide data and information to support decision-making in natural resource management, it is necessary {{to take into account the}} views of various stakeholder groups and the multiple objectives of each group, through the use of some form of multicriteria analysis (MCA). Important decisions arise in the choice of stakeholder, since this will influence the management advice generated. Many groups and individuals can be affected by resource management decisions, but it would be impractical to attempt to identify the objectives and estimate their importance for each group. Also, questions arise concerning whether or not to include government agencies (which represent the broader community) and researchers as stakeholders. A further issue concerns choosing representative samples of stakeholder groups, from which to obtain preference data. Discussions with modellers and a reading of the literature would suggest that the choice of stakeholder groups and representatives is conducted haphazardly and is perhaps biased, and that a more systematic approach is needed. This article explores the above issues with reference to a number of multicriteria analyses, including local studies. (C) 2000 United Nations. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Good udder {{health is}} not only {{important}} for the dairy farmer but, because of increasing interest of consumers in the way dairy products are produced, also for the dairy production chain as a whole. An important role of veterinarians is in advising on production diseases such as mastitis. A large part of this advice is given around the planning of management to maintain or improve the udder health status of a farm. Mastitis is a costly disease, due to losses (a reduction of output due to mastitis) and expenditure (additional inputs to reduce the level of mastitis). Worldwide, published estimates of the economic losses of clinical mastitis range from € 61 to € 97 per cow on a farm, with large differences between farms, e. g. in The Netherlands, losses due to clinical and subclinical mastitis varied between € 17 and € 198 per cow per year. Moreover, farmers tended to underestimate these costs. This indicates that for {{a large proportion of}} farms there are many avoidable losses. In order to provide good support to farmers' decision-making, it is important to describe the mastitis setting {{not only in terms of}} disease, e. g. incidence of clinical mastitis, but also in monetary terms; and to make good decisions, it is necessary to provide the dairy farmer with information on the additional expenditure and reduced losses associated with alternative decisions. Six out of 18 preventive measures were shown to have a positive nett benefit, viz blanket use of dry-cow therapy, keeping cows standing after milking, back-flushing of the milk cluster after milking a cow with clinical mastitis, application of a treatment protocol, washing dirty udders, and the use of milkers' gloves. For those measures that included a large amount of routine labour or investment, the reduced losses did not outweigh the additional expenditure. The advisor cannot expect that measures that are cost-effective are always implemented. Reasons for this are the objectives of the dairy farmer can be other than <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit,</b> resources to improve the mastitis situation compete with other fields of management, risk involved with the decision, economic behaviour of the dairy farmer, and valuation of the cost factors by the dairy farmer. For all decision-makers this means that, although financial incentives do have an effect on the management of mastitis, it is not always sufficient to show the economic benefits of improved management to induce an improvement of management of mastitis...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{deregulation}} in energy markets {{there is an}} increased need for asset management tools. The essence of asset management is having the decision-support for finding an optimum between financial performance, operational performance, and risk exposure. Decisions must be made about operating and maintaining infrastructure assets. Hence, {{the primary goal of}} an asset management tool is informed decision-making, rather than the pure focus on technical performance. A central component in achieving these requirements is the calculation of production costs, taking into account plant depreciation and degradation resulting from this production. This paper describes a decision support system that is based on the optimization of an objective function that includes terms for revenues from energy sales, production costs and plant ageing. Plant ageing is based on lifecycle models that are directly load dependent. The optimization results in a trade-off between <b>maximisation</b> <b>of</b> immediate <b>profits</b> and minimisation <b>of</b> lifetime consumption. The earnings can be achieved by selling energy, or even fuel or emission credits (CO 2, SO 2, NOx). The Lifecycle Optimizer, presented in this paper, addresses the influence of a given operating mode on the ageing process of the power plant and includes this in the economic optimization. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Mixed Logical Dynamic (MLD) approach are used to solve the posed optimization problem...|$|R
