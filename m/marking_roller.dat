40|$|In {{open channel}} flows, the {{transition}} from a rapid to fluvial flow motion is called a hydraulic jump. A related flow motion is a compression wave in a channel, such as a tidal bore or surge. A key feature of hydraulic jumps and breaking bores is the rapid spatial and temporal deformations of the free surface of the roller region, in response to the interactions between entrained air bubbles and turbulent structures. The flow structure in the roller remains a great research challenge due to large quantities of entrained air, bubble–turbulence interactions and the coupling between turbulent properties and free-surface deformations. Breaking bores and hydraulic jumps with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller</b> present a number of similar features that are discussed herein. Recent results have shown that the roller is a highly unsteady turbulent region, with both the roller toe and free surface constantly fluctuating with time and space, although the roller shape is quasi-two-dimensional on average. Downstream of the roller toe, air bubbles and vorticity are diffused in the shear zone at different rates. The double diffusive convection process leads to a complex interplay between instantaneous free-surface deformations, velocity fluctuations and interfacial processes including breakup and coalescence...|$|R
40|$|In an open channel, {{a change}} from a {{supercritical}} to subcritical flow is a strong dissipative process called a hydraulic jump. Herein some new measurements of free-surface fluctuations of the impingement perimeter and integral turbulent time and length scales in the roller are presented {{with a focus on}} turbulence in hydraulic jumps with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> The observations highlighted the fluctuating nature of the impingement perimeter in terms of both longitudinal and transverse locations. The results showed further the close link between the production and detachment of large eddies in jump shear layer, and the longitudinal fluctuations of the jump toe. They highlighted the importance of the impingement perimeter as the origin of the developing shear layer and a source of vorticity. The air–water flow measurements emphasised the intense flow aeration. The turbulent velocity distributions presented a shape similar to a wall jet solution with a marked shear layer downstream of the impingement point. The integral turbulent length scale distributions exhibited a monotonic increase with increasing vertical elevation within 0. 2 < Lz/d 1 < 0. 8 in the shear layer, where Lz is the integral turbulent length scale and d 1 the inflow depth, while the integral turbulent time scales were about two orders of magnitude smaller than the period of impingement position longitudinal oscillations...|$|R

40|$|A {{positive}} surge {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the depth. Positive surges are commonly observed in man-made channels while some estuaries may be subjected to a positive surge process called tidal bore during flood tides. The {{aim of this study}} is to detail the hydrodynamic and turbulence characteristics of tidal bores that were rarely studied under controlled flow conditions. New experiments were conducted with positive surges in a large channel (L = 12 m, W = 0. 5 m). Detailed turbulence measurements were performed with high-temporal resolution (50 Hz) using side-looking acoustic Doppler velocimetry and non-intrusive free-surface measurement devices. The experiments were designed to study a range of positive surges with a minimum number of dependant variables. Most tests were conducted with a horizontal bed slope, a constant flow rate (Q = 0. 040 m 3 /s) and uncontrolled flow conditions. The only dependant variable was the downstream gate opening after closure. Two main types of positive surge were observed. For surge Froude numbers Fr less than 1. 7, the bore was an undular surge. For Fr 1. 7), a weak (breaking) surge was observed and the surge front had a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> Detailed turbulent measurements were conducted in the initial flow at one location. Instantaneous velocity measurements beneath surges showed a marked effect of the surge passage. Streamwise velocities were characterised by a rapid flow deceleration at all vertical elevations, and some flow reversal were measured next to the bed in the weak surge flow. Large fluctuations of transverse velocities were recorded beneath the surges. Turbulent stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data. The results showed large normal and tangential Reynolds stresses beneath the surge front. A comparison between undular and weak surge data suggested two main mechanisms of bed scour and scalar transport. In weak surge flows, the data showed some rapid flow separation beneath the surge front. In undular surges, maximum Reynolds stresses were observed beneath and just before each wave crest. Experimental results were compared with data sets obtained in stationary hydraulic jumps and in tidal bores. The latter field measurements and observations emphasised very-strong turbulence levels behind bore fronts that might be underestimated in small-size laboratory channels and in bore experiments propagating in stationary fluid. Overall the present study demonstrated the uniqueness of positive surges and some key differences with hydraulic jumps flows...|$|R
40|$|A {{tidal bore}} is {{a surge of}} waters {{propagating}} upstream in an estuary as the tidal flow turns to rising and the flood tide propagates into a funnel-shaped system. Large tidal bores have a <b>marked</b> breaking <b>roller.</b> The sounds generated by breaking tidal bores were herein investigated in the field (Qiantang River) and in laboratory. The sound pressure record showed two dominant periods, with some similarity with an earlier study [Chanson (2009). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 125 (6), 3561 – 3568]. The two distinct phases were the incoming tidal bore when the sound amplitude increased with the approaching bore, and {{the passage of the}} tidal bore in front of the microphone when loud and powerful noises were heard. The dominant frequency ranged from 57 to 131 [*]Hz in the Qiantang River bore. A comparison between laboratory and prototype tidal bores illustrated both common features and differences. The low pitch sound of the breaking bore had a dominant frequency close to the collective oscillations of bubble clouds, which could be modeled with a bubble cloud model using a transverse dimension of the bore roller. The findings suggest that this model might be over simplistic {{in the case of a}} powerful breaking bore, like that of the Qiantang River...|$|R
40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the {{indentation}} <b>marks</b> on the <b>rollers</b> and the cracks on the bearing cup were resulted during {{the impact of the}} aircraft on the port main wheel. These were caused instantaneously and not over a period of time. On the other hand, the damages seen on the roller elements of the bearing were progressive in nature and were caused over a period of time. The rollers of the bearing had failed by flaking, a form of fatigue failure. Analysis shows that the most probable reason for the premature flaking in the bearing could be excessive axial load. The failure pattern and the aircraft behaviour during take-off roll strongly support this conclusion. However, the possibility of excessive axial load on the port main wheel needs to be examined...|$|R
40|$|Polyglutamine (polyQ) {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} incurable neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease, that are characterized by an expanded glutamine repeat. Their underlying cause is protein misfolding, which leads to aggregation and cell death. Chaperone proteins such as Hsp 70 {{have been shown to}} suppress the pathogenicity of polyQ disease. We constructed a Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) animal model that expresses both fluorescent-tagged polyQ constructs and human Hsp 70 <b>marked</b> with a <b>roller</b> phenotype. Many worm assays for polyQ toxicity, however, are not compatible with rollers. So, by adapting behavioral assays I developed polyQ toxicity assays compatible with roller worms. I demonstrated that Hsp 70 mitigates polyQ toxicity while having no effect on inclusion bodies (plaques), a hallmark of this disease. This supports the hypothesis that polyQ toxicity is related to some as yet undefined aggregation state...|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} surge {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the depth. It is the unsteady flow analogy of the stationary hydraulic jump and a geophysical application is the tidal bore. The inception and development of a positive surge are commonly predicted using the method of characteristics and the Saint-Venant equations. Herein new experimental investigations were conducted in a large rectangular channel (12 m long, 0. 5 m wide) and detailed unsteady velocity measurements were performed with a high temporal and spatial resolution (200 Hz, sampling volume: 6 x 6 x 1. 5 mm 3). The experiments encompassed undular (non-breaking) and breaking bores in a horizontal slope with both smooth and rough invert conditions. A further series of experiments was conducted with a decelerating bore progressing upstream against an adverse steep slope. The undular (non-breaking) bore was observed for surge Froude number Fr less than 1. 5. For Fr 1. 5, a breaking bore was observed with a <b>marked</b> <b>roller.</b> Detailed instantaneous velocity measurements showed a marked effect of the surge front passage. The turbulent Reynolds stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data using the technique of KOCH and CHANSON (2005). The results highlighted large normal and tangential stresses beneath the surge front. A comparison between undular (non-breaking) and breaking surge data suggested some basic differences. In a weak surge, some transient flow recirculation was recorded next to the bed. In an undular (non-breaking) bore, large velocity fluctuations and Reynolds stresses were recorded beneath the first wave crest and the secondary waves, implying a long-lasting effect after the bore front passage. A systematic comparison was conducted to {{study the effects of}} bed roughness. The boundary friction contributed to some wave attenuation and dispersion, and the free-surface data showed some agreement with the wave dispersion theory for gravity waves. The instantaneous velocity data indicated a marked effect of the rough screens on the turbulent velocity field. Large turbulent velocity fluctuations were observed. In an undular bore, the time-variations of the longitudinal velocity exhibited a lesser oscillating pattern than on a smooth bed especially close to the bed (z/do < 0. 2). In a breaking surge, a relatively longer transient recirculation was observed next to the invert. In a decelerating surge, the turbulent velocity field presented flow properties that were closer to those of a stationary hydraulic jump than of a fully-developed bore. Yet there were subtle differences between decelerating surges and steady hydraulic jumps. The turbulent stress data demonstrated intense turbulent mixing beneath the bore front and in the ensuing flow including beneath the secondary waves and whelps. The experimental findings were consistent with field observations and anecdotic evidences. These showed in particular the significant impact of small tidal bores and of non-breaking undular surges. Positive surges and tidal bores do have indeed some significant effect on natural and eco-systems.
