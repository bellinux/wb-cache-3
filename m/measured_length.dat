25|$|Notice {{that the}} smaller the ruler, the longer the {{resulting}} coastline. It might be supposed that these values would converge to a finite number representing the true length of the coastline. However, Richardson demonstrated {{that this is not}} the case: the <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> of coastlines, and other natural features, increases without limit as the unit of measurement is made smaller. This is known nowadays as the Richardson effect.|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} idea of [...] "fractured" [...] dimensions has a {{long history}} in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by Benoit Mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self-similarity in which he discussed fractional dimensions. In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick. There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.|$|E

2500|$|The Principal Triangulation of Great Britain was {{initiated}} by the Board of Ordnance in 1791 and carried out {{under the direction of}} William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby. The field work was completed in 1853, just as Clark joined the Board. The methods of analysis had been planned in outline by William Yolland, his predecessor {{at the head of the}} Trigonometric Section, but it fell to Clarke to finalize the methods and carry them through to completion. This he achieved in the four years from 1854 to 1858: the report was published as [...] but it is entirely Clarke's work. The basic data was the collection of angle bearings taken from each of the 289 stations towards a number of other stations, typically from three to ten in number. The multiple observations were first subjected to a least squares error analysis to extract the most likely angles and then the triangles formed by the corrected bearings were adjusted simultaneously, again by least squares methods, to find the most likely geometry for the whole mesh. This was an immense undertaking which involved the solution of 920 equations without the aid of matrix methods or digital computers. The only available computers were the living personnel of the Trigonometric Section, twenty one of them. Once the triangles had been fixed it was then possible to calculate all the sides of the mesh in terms of the length of either of the bases, one by Lough Foyle in Ireland and the other on Salisbury plain. The accuracy of the survey was such that when the length of the Lough Foyle base was calculated through the triangulation mesh from the Salisbury base the error was only 5 inches when compared with its <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> (of 41,640.887 feet or about 8 miles). The final step was to use the distances and angles to work out the latitude and longitude of each triangulation point on the Airy ellipsoid.|$|E

5000|$|The paper {{examines}} the coastline paradox: the property that the <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> {{of a stretch}} of coastline depends {{on the scale of}} measurement. Empirical evidence suggests that the smaller the increment of measurement, the longer the <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> becomes. If one were to measure a stretch of coastline with a yardstick, one would get a shorter result than if the same stretch were measured with a one-foot (30.48 cm) ruler. This is because one would be laying the ruler along a more curvilinear route than that followed by the yardstick. The empirical evidence suggests a rule which, if extrapolated, shows that the measure length increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases towards zero.|$|E
50|$|Cadomin Cave {{has been}} known since the early 1900s when prospectors opened up the Coal Branch district, but it was almost {{certainly}} known to native peoples before then. The first cave survey was conducted in 1959 prior {{to the formation of}} Canada's caving clubs, and produced an accurate map of the passages of the upper series as far as the Mess Hall, the cave's principal chamber. In 1977 and 1978 a long-rumored lower series of passages was discovered and surveyed by members of the Alberta Speleological Society, significantly increasing the cave's <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> to 1704m and its depth to 171m.
