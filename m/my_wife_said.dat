Joan, <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>said</b> you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E

6000|$|I {{went into}} the bath-room to see if I was right, and I was. I shut off the dining-room and stopped the buzzing, {{and came back to}} bed. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I really cannot say. I know <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> always <b>said</b> I {{had a bad}} {{heart and}} worse head; but what she meant, upon my honour I never could understand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl cast a bewildered {{glance at}} <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> who <b>said,</b> [...] "You needn't pay any {{attention}} to him, Miss Gage. He has an idea that he is making a joke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You allow {{yourself}} a liberty of expression, sir, {{because you are}} <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> father," [...] <b>said</b> Trevelyan, [...] "which you would not dare to take in other circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, yes," [...] {{and after}} a moment, a very painful moment, in which I think we all tried to imagine {{something}} that would delay the real business, Mrs. Hasketh began again.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "That {{was very}} wicked, and I have scolded him for {{thinking}} {{of such a}} thing." [...] She had, indeed, forgotten that she had {{put it in my}} head, and made me wholly responsible for it.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was about}} three weeks since I had begun to set my trap when I was awakened in the night by a sudden noise. I sat up in bed, and as I did so <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to me sleepily,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's--oh--that's <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> wedding-dress," [...] <b>said</b> James, {{unfolding}} {{and shaking}} out a rich satin; [...] "and here's her shawl," [...] drawing out an embroidered box, scented with sandal-wood.|$|R
6000|$|... “Begad, madam, you {{are grown}} {{too old for}} a pinafore now; and I hold that ’tis for me to judge what company <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> shall see,” <b>said</b> <b>my</b> lord, {{slapping}} the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{again will}} this be a restful home for you or for me," [...] I {{declared}} to my daughter. [...] "Its shadow is now an enemy, its isolation a menace." [...] To <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I <b>said,</b> [...] "Let us {{go back to the}} city where the highest type of medical science {{is at the end of}} the telephone wire." ...|$|R
6000|$|When we {{told the}} good man that he could stay all night, he was {{extremely}} obliged to us, {{and went to bed}} quite early. After we had fastened the house and had gone to our room, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to me, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Puddicombe {{saw that}} it was so. Mr. Puddicombe is not all the world to me by any means, but {{he is a man of}} common sense. I will be frank with you. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> that it could not be so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, it isn't all. When I {{got home}} last night <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Miss Adelaide took a holiday this mornen," [...] says she (my wife, that is); [...] "walked over to Nether Mynton, met the comen man, and got married!" [...] says she.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mary Ellen,' I said, 'I {{asked you}} to be <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and you <b>said</b> as good as yes. That's done for good. Wherever you are, I am; as I shall answer to my God.' ...|$|R

5000|$|... "In 1988, I {{had been}} a pro bowler for eight years and didn't have a title. I quit my job and decided if I {{was ever going to}} be a pro, I had to do it now. I missed a cut and came home whining. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> Kelly <b>said,</b> 'well, you quit your job; you’d better go out and bowl better.’" ...|$|R
6000|$|After some civilities so {{obviously}} perfunctory that I admired {{the force of}} mind in the women who uttered them, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mrs. Hasketh, we have come on an errand that I know will cause you pain, and I needn't say that we haven't come willingly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Sigtryg Ranaldsson, now King of Waterford. And <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'If {{there be}} treachery or faint-heartedness, {{remember}} this,--that Hereward Leofricsson slew the Ogre, and Hannibal of Gweek likewise, and brought me safe to thee. And, therefore, if thou provest false to him, niddering thou art; and no niddering is spouse of mine.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> {{she thought}} it must be {{something}} of that nature or order when we saw her come in to breakfast. I mean to say," [...] said Archie, reasoning closely, [...] "woman can't come into breakfast here and be rehearsing in New York at the same time. Why did she administer the raspberry, old friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, last night. He {{was in the}} barn, and {{he jumped}} out at <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and <b>said</b> {{he was going to}} blow the fort to pieces!

6000|$|The conversation, {{which might}} {{be said to have}} flagged from the beginning, stopped {{altogether}} at this point, and though I was prompted by several looks from my wife to urge it forward, I could think of nothing to do so with, and we sat without speaking till we heard the stir of skirts on the stairs in the hall outside, and then <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ah, that is Mrs. Hasketh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope you're well, sir," [...] he resumed: [...] "most {{important}} for you to have your health now you're going-to"--and, feeling for the delicate way to put it, he involuntarily winked--"to become a family man. We saw it in the paper. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to me the other morning at breakfast: 'Bob, here's a Mr. Richard Paramor Shelton goin' to be married. Is that any relative of your Mr. Shelton?' 'My dear,' I said to her, 'it's the very man!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to me--(Dan! not {{too much}}, {{not too much}} on that tray at a time; better go twice)--my wife said to me as she posted up the books: she says, 'Miss Day must have been affronted this summer during that hot muggy weather that spolit so much for us; for depend upon't,' she says, 'she've been trying John Grimmett unknown to us: see her account else.' 'Tis little, of course, {{at the best of}} times, being only for one, but now 'tis next kin to nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Here, now, thought I to myself, the cat {{leaps out}} of the bag. I {{looked at him with}} a calm glance, under which he seemed {{somewhat}} uneasy. More than ever now I suspected a plot. I remembered what <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> had <b>said</b> about abiding by the decision of Mr. Scribe. In a bland way, I resolved to buy up the decision of Mr. Scribe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't I {{think it}} would have been better to have done nothing, than to have tried to form <b>my</b> little <b>wife's</b> mind?' <b>said</b> I, {{laughing}} at myself. 'Is that the question? Yes, indeed, I do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Psha—there {{shall be}} no {{question}} of <b>my</b> <b>wife’s</b> honour,” <b>said</b> <b>my</b> lord; “we can quarrel on plenty of grounds beside. If I live, that villain will be punished; if I fall, my family will be only the better: there will only be a spendthrift the less to keep in the world: and Frank has better teaching than his father. My mind is made up, Harry Esmond, and whatever the event is I am easy about it. I leave <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and you as guardians to the children.” ...|$|R
60|$|It was grievous, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> {{to see the}} {{discouraged}} shade {{which passed}} over her thin, tremulous features when this certainty forced itself upon her. It is hard, when sinking in the waves, to see the frail bush at which the hand clutches uprooted; hard, when alone in the crowded thoroughfare of travel, to have one's last bank-note declared a counterfeit. I knew I should {{not be able to}} see her face, under the shade of this disappointment; and so, coward that I was, I turned this trouble, where I have turned so many others, upon my wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "This will be whisky," [...] {{the little}} {{pawnbroker}} announced: [...] "three bottles. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> 'Surely, Elshander, ye'll find whisky where ye're gaun.' 'No doubt I will,' said I, 'but I'm not very confident of its quality; and it's a far step.' My itinerary, Mr. Dalmahoy, was planned from Greenock to the Kyles of Bute and back, and thence coastwise to Saltcoats {{and the land}} of Burns. I told her, if she had anything to communicate, to address her letter {{to the care of}} the postmaster, Ayr--ha, ha!" [...] He broke off and gazed reproachfully into Dalmahoy's impassive face. [...] "Ayr--air," [...] he explained: [...] "a little play upon words." ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR SIR:--Your {{note about}} the little {{paragraph}} in the Republican was received yesterday, since which time I have been too unwell to notice it. I had not supposed you wrote or approved it. The whole originated in mistake. You know by the conversation with me that I thought {{the establishment of the}} paper unfortunate, but I always expected to throw no obstacle in its way, and to patronize it to the extent of taking and paying for one copy. When the paper was brought to my house, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to me, [...] "Now {{are you going to take}} another worthless little paper?" [...] I said to her evasively, [...] "I have not directed the paper to be left." [...] From this, in my absence, she sent the message to the carrier. This is the whole story.|$|E
