5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular <b>mesh.</b> <b>In</b> the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

After revisiting the equation of motion for incompressible flow, the functions, with suitable constraints, are used with the finite element method (FEM) to solve the incompressible Stokes equation. 1...|$|R

500|$|Development of {{the game}} began in January 1998, {{spanning}} two years with manpower that steadily increased from 20 to 50 at peak development phase. The storyline conceived for the game follows Ashley Riot's origins as a dedicated government agent prior to being the titular [...] "vagrant" [...] who is [...] "involved in many incidents" [...] after the events in Leá Monde. Inspiration for the plot is derived from Hollywood [...] "classic and blockbuster" [...] films as well as European and Asian films. The gameplay was conceived to cater to hardcore gamers who do not [...] "ask for hints and read through strategy guides". However, Matsuno revealed that over half {{of the game}}'s story was cut due to capacity and development time constraints. Memory issues was considered the most challenging aspect of the game development, with the team forced to adjust the game's interface, texture mapping and polygon <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> maps, as well as removing gaming elements such as AI-controlled supporting non-player characters that would have joined Ashley {{in the middle of the}} game.|$|E

For Jade Empire, he focused on using Chinese instruments and Taiko drums. When writing a video game score, Wall prefers a collaborative approach with the game designers to creating the music, as he feels that the [...] "tug back and forth of ideas" [...] makes the music stronger. He notes, however, that he has to be flexible, and willing to create his own vision for the music.

Wall stated that he was primarily interested in scoring games that are [...] "interesting", and that his main concern was creating something original. Although he has worked with live orchestras and synthetic orchestras, Wall recommends that game developers use a live one, despite the expense, as he feels they add a much more dynamic sound to the music and allow the composer more freedom than synthesizer samples.

2500|$|The {{process of}} {{mechanical}} filtration removes particulate {{material from the}} water column. This particulate matter may include uneaten food, feces or plant or algal debris. Mechanical filtration is typically achieved by passing water through materials which act as a sieve, physically trapping the particulate matter.

[...] All removal of solid wastes involve filtering water through some form of <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> a process known as mechanical filtration. [...] The solid wastes are first collected, and then must be physically removed from the aquarium system. [...] Mechanical filtration is ultimately ineffective if the solid wastes are not removed from the filter, and are allowed to decay and dissolve in the water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{finite volume}} method {{is a method}} for {{representing}} and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations. Similar to the finite difference method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. [...] "Finite volume" [...] refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a <b>mesh.</b> <b>In</b> the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Another advantage of the finite volume method {{is that it is}} easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes. The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages.|$|E

2500|$|The Principal Triangulation of Great Britain was {{initiated}} by the Board of Ordnance in 1791 and carried out {{under the direction of}} William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby. The field work was completed in 1853, just as Clark joined the Board. The methods of analysis had been planned in outline by William Yolland, his predecessor {{at the head of the}} Trigonometric Section, but it fell to Clarke to finalize the methods and carry them through to completion. This he achieved in the four years from 1854 to 1858: the report was published as [...] but it is entirely Clarke's work. The basic data was the collection of angle bearings taken from each of the 289 stations towards a number of other stations, typically from three to ten in number. The multiple observations were first subjected to a least squares error analysis to extract the most likely angles and then the triangles formed by the corrected bearings were adjusted simultaneously, again by least squares methods, to find the most likely geometry for the whole mesh. This was an immense undertaking which involved the solution of 920 equations without the aid of matrix methods or digital computers. The only available computers were the living personnel of the Trigonometric Section, twenty one of them. Once the triangles had been fixed it was then possible to calculate all the sides of the <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> terms of the length of either of the bases, one by Lough Foyle in Ireland and the other on Salisbury plain. The accuracy of the survey was such that when the length of the Lough Foyle base was calculated through the triangulation mesh from the Salisbury base the error was only 5 inches when compared with its measured length (of 41,640.887 feet or about 8 miles). The final step was to use the distances and angles to work out the latitude and longitude of each triangulation point on the Airy ellipsoid.|$|E
