25|$|Captain Patrick Lawson {{purchased}} Modeste, had her lengthened and superbly fitted out, and renamed her Locko. Lawson {{had been}} captain of Lord Holland when, {{on his return}} to Britain in 1779, a crew member had denounced him for smuggling. Lawson lost his goods, and his command, which he had purchased from Lord Hollands previous captain, Fasham Naire. Lawson enlisted Robert Williams, who had been principal <b>managing</b> <b>owner</b> of Lord Holland on Lawson's voyage, to become principal managing director of Locko.|$|E

She crossed the Second Bar on 24 January 1826, and reached St Helena on 19 April. By 29 May she was at Halifax, Nova Scotia. She returned to her mooring in Britain on 13 August.|$|E
25|$|Arklow, Ireland has a {{long history}} of ship-owning. According to local tradition, it extends back to the export of tin and copper by the Phoenicians. The fleet was locally owned, managed, {{mastered}} and manned. Each ship was an individual enterprise, each divided into 64 shares. A captain would probably have a 25% interest in his ship: that is 16 shares. The owner listed in documents was the <b>managing</b> <b>owner,</b> not necessarily the beneficial owner. The Arklow shipowners cooperated: they established their own mutual insurance company. A century ago, ownership became concentrated. In 1966 Tyrrell and Hall formed an umbrella company to operate their ships: Arklow Shipping. By November 2011 they had a modern fleet of about 45 ships.|$|E

60|$|He {{indicated}} the canoe and was satisfied when Mrs. Cartwright agreed, since {{he refused to}} wear spectacles and own his sight was going. Although Clara was generous, he could not use her money, and, indeed, {{did not mean to}} do so, but he was extravagant and his <b>managing</b> <b>owner's</b> post was not secure.

60|$|Yet, in a sense, Cartwright {{was not an}} adventurer, {{although}} his ventures in finance and shipping were numerous. He sprang from an old Liverpool family whose prosperity diminished when steamers replaced sailing ships. His father had waited long before he resigned himself to the change, but was not altogether too late, and Cartwright was now <b>managing</b> <b>owner</b> of the Independent Freighters Line. The company's business had brought him to Montreal, {{and when it was}} transacted he had taken Mrs. Cartwright and her family to the hotel by the Ontario lake.|$|E
60|$|The <b>managing</b> <b>owner</b> of the Independent Freighters needed cleverness, {{since the}} company was small and often embarrassed for money. For the most part, it ran its ships in {{opposition}} to the regular liners. When the Conference forced up freights Cartwright quietly canvassed the merchants and offered to carry their goods at something under the standard rate, if the shippers would engage to fill up his boat. As a rule, secrecy was important, but sometimes, when cargo was scarce, Cartwright let his plans be known and allowed the Conference to buy him off. Although his skill in the delicate negotiations was marked, the company paid small dividends and he had enemies among the shareholders. Now, however, he was satisfied. Oreana had sailed for Montreal, loaded to the limit the law allowed, and he had booked her return cargo before the Conference knew he was cutting rates.|$|E

60|$|Neglecting a few {{exceptional}} older corporations which, indeed, {{in their}} essence are not usurious, but of unlimited liability, the shareholding body appeared first, {{in its present}} character, in the seventeenth century, and came to its full development in the mid-nineteenth. Was its appearance then due only to the attainment of a certain necessary degree of public credit, or was it correlated with any other force? It seems in accordance with facts to relate it to another force, the development of mechanism, so far as certain representative aspects go. Hitherto the only borrower had been the farmer, then the exploring trader had found a world too wide for purely individual effort, and then suddenly the craftsmen of all sorts and the carriers discovered the need of the new, great, wholesale, initially expensive appliances that invention was offering them. It was the development of mechanism that created the great bulk of modern shareholding, it took its present shape distinctively only {{with the appearance of}} the railways. The hitherto necessary but subordinate craftsman and merchant classes were to have new weapons, new powers, they were to develop to a new importance, to a preponderance even in the social body. But before they could attain these weapons, before this new and novel wealth could be set up, it had to pay its footing in an apportioned world, it had to buy its right to disturb the established social order. The dividend of the shareholder was the tribute the new enterprise had to pay the old wealth. The share was the manumission money of machinery. And essentially the shareholder represents and will continue to represent the responsible <b>managing</b> <b>owner</b> of a former state of affairs in process of supersession.|$|E
