5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the <b>microtome</b> was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
25|$|The dry {{specimen}} {{is usually}} {{mounted on a}} specimen stub using an adhesive such as epoxy resin or electrically conductive double-sided adhesive tape, and sputter-coated with gold or gold/palladium alloy before examination in the microscope. Samples may be sectioned (with a <b>microtome)</b> if information about the organism's internal ultrastructure is to be exposed for imaging.|$|E
25|$|EDTA finds many {{specialized}} uses in the biomedical laboratories, {{such as in}} veterinary ophthalmology as an anticollagenase {{to prevent}} the worsening of corneal ulcers in animals. In tissue culture EDTA {{is used as a}} chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells, preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension, or detaching adherent cells for passaging. In histopathology, EDTA {{can be used as a}} decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a <b>microtome</b> once the tissue sample is demineralised.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{there are}} {{multiple}} types of vibrating <b>microtomes</b> for use by laboratories and industry labs around the world. The following {{is a list of}} the most commonly used vibratomes, and their advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
50|$|Leica vibratomes are {{the most}} {{expensive}} vibrating <b>microtomes</b> available, placing them in the high-cost category of laboratory instruments. Vibratome machines also weigh about 20-25 kg, making them heavy to move so a designated area of sectioning in the lab is required.|$|R
2500|$|The {{extent of}} {{adsorption}} at a liquid interface can be evaluated using the surface tension concentration {{data and the}} Gibbs adsorption equation. [...] The <b>microtome</b> blade method is {{used to determine the}} weight and molal concentration of an interface. [...] The method involves attaining a one square meter portion of air-liquid interface of binary solutions using a <b>microtome</b> blade.|$|E
2500|$|Freeze-fracture or freeze-etch – a {{preparation}} method particularly useful for examining lipid membranes and their incorporated proteins in [...] "face on" [...] view. The fresh tissue or cell suspension is frozen rapidly (cryofixation), then fractured by breaking or {{by using a}} <b>microtome</b> while maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature. The cold fractured surface (sometimes [...] "etched" [...] by increasing the temperature to about −100°C for several minutes to let some ice sublime) is then shadowed with evaporated platinum or gold at an average angle of 45° in a high vacuum evaporator. A second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile [...] "pre-shadowed" [...] metal replica of the fracture surface is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, hypochlorite solution or SDS detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.|$|E

5000|$|The firm took {{yet another}} name in 1876, [...] "Bausch and Lomb Optical Company," [...] and began {{manufacturing}} microscopes. Later that year they {{exhibited at the}} Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company also produced photographic lenses (1883), spectacle lenses (1889), <b>microtomes</b> (1890), binoculars and telescopes (1893). The firm was incorporated as [...] "Bausch and Lomb Optical Company, Inc.," [...] in 1908, the year Bausch's long-time partner died.|$|R
30|$|Portions of the testis {{from all}} animals were sliced and {{dehydrated}} {{with a range}} of concentrations (70 %, 80 %, 90 % and absolute) of alcohol and then cleared with xylene (twice) before embedding in paraffin. The embedded tissue blocks were section with Shandon AS 325 rotary <b>microtomes</b> into approximately 5  μm thick section and slides were prepared with the sections. The tissues were stained with Ehrlich’s haematoxylin and eosin blue.|$|R
50|$|For {{the cutting}} of frozen samples, many rotary <b>microtomes</b> {{can be adapted}} to cut in a liquid-nitrogen chamber, in a {{so-called}} cryomicrotome setup. The reduced temperature allows the hardness of the sample to be increased, such as by undergoing a glass transition, which allows the preparation of semi-thin samples. However the sample temperature and the knife temperature must be controlled in order to optimise the resultant sample thickness.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} working upon a ribbon of <b>microtome</b> {{sections}} of the developing salamander, {{and he came to}} see what she had made of them. She stood up and he sat down at the microscope, and for a time he was busy scrutinizing one section after another. She looked down at him and saw that the sunlight was gleaming from his cheeks, and that all over his cheeks was a fine golden down of delicate hairs. And at the sight something leaped within her.|$|E
6000|$|He hesitated, {{and walked}} away from her toward the house. Her eyes {{followed}} him. The curve of his shoulders, the very angle of his feet, expressed relief at her apparent obedience. [...] "Thank goodness!" [...] said that retreating aspect, [...] "that's said and over. Vee's all right. There's nothing happened at all!" [...] She didn't mean, he concluded, to give him any more trouble ever, and {{he was free to}} begin a fresh chromatic novel--he had just finished the Blue Lagoon, which he thought very beautiful and tender and absolutely irrelevant to Morningside Park--or work in peace at his <b>microtome</b> without bothering about her in the least.|$|E
60|$|His lecture over, Professor Ainslie Grey paid a {{visit to}} his laboratory, where he {{adjusted}} several scientific instruments, made a note as to the progress of three separate infusions of bacteria, cut half-a-dozen sections with a <b>microtome,</b> and finally resolved the difficulties of seven different gentlemen, who were pursuing researches in as many separate lines of inquiry. Having thus conscientiously and methodically completed the routine of his duties, he returned to his carriage and ordered the coachman to drive him to The Lindens. His face as he drove was cold and impassive, but he drew his fingers from time to time down his prominent chin with a jerky, twitchy movement.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{majority}} of <b>microtomes</b> are a knife-block design with a changeable knife, a specimen holder and an advancement mechanism. In most devices the cutting of the sample begins by moving the sample over the knife, where the advancement mechanism automatically moves forward such that the next cut for a chosen thickness can be made. The section thickness is controlled by an adjustment mechanism, allowing for precise control.|$|R

50|$|Laboratory {{workers are}} at risk for {{repetitive}} motion injuries during routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting, working at microscopes, operating <b>microtomes,</b> using cell counters and keyboarding at computer workstations. Repetitive motion injuries develop over time and occur when muscles and joints are stressed, tendons are inflamed, nerves are pinched and the flow of blood is restricted. Standing and working in awkward positions in front of laboratory hoods/biological safety cabinets can also present ergonomic problems.|$|R
60|$|Presently, faint {{through the}} closed windows came {{the sound of}} the Oratory clock {{striking}} the hour of eleven. The clicking of the <b>microtome</b> ceased, and the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his hands into his pockets, and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre door. He stood listening for a moment, and then his eye fell on the little volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled, opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer ceased, there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the lecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of voices speaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which began to open, and stood ajar, as some indistinctly heard question arrested the new-comer.|$|E
60|$|Day {{after day}} for a {{measured}} hour in the lecture-theatre, with elaborate power and patience, Russell pieced together difficulty and suggestion, instance and counter-instance, in the elaborate construction of the family tree of life. And then the students went into the long laboratory and followed out these facts in almost living tissue with microscope and scalpel, probe and <b>microtome,</b> and the utmost of their skill and care, making {{now and then a}} raid into the compact museum of illustration next door, in which specimens and models and directions stood in disciplined ranks, {{under the direction of the}} demonstrator Capes. There was a couple of blackboards at each end of the aisle of tables, and at these Capes, with quick and nervous speech that contrasted vividly with Russell's slow, definitive articulation, directed the dissection and made illuminating comments on the structures under examination. Then he would come along the laboratory, sitting down by each student in turn, checking the work and discussing its difficulties, and answering questions arising out of Russell's lecture.|$|E
60|$|And {{especially}} to the Admiral and the Doctor were this closer intimacy and companionship of value. Each had a void in his life, as every man must have who with unexhausted strength {{steps out of the}} great race, but each by his society might help to fill up that of his neighbor. It is true that they had not much in common, but that is sometimes an aid rather than a bar to friendship. Each had been an enthusiast in his profession, and had retained all his interest in it. The Doctor still read from cover to cover his Lancet and his Medical Journal, attended all professional gatherings, worked himself into an alternate state of exaltation and depression over the results of the election of officers, and reserved for himself a den of his own, in which before rows of little round bottles full of glycerine, Canadian balsam, and staining agents, he still cut sections with a <b>microtome,</b> and peeped through his long, brass, old-fashioned microscope at the arcana of nature. With his typical face, clean shaven on lip and chin, with a firm mouth, a strong jaw, a steady eye, and two little white fluffs of whiskers, he could never be taken for anything but what he was, a high-class British medical consultant of the age of fifty, or perhaps just a year or two older.|$|E
50|$|In 1876, Ernst Gundlach {{joined the}} company and the company began {{manufacturing}} microscopes. Later that year, the Bausch & Lomb Optical Company won a distinction at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company also produced photographic lenses (1883), spectacle lenses (1889), <b>microtomes</b> (1890), binoculars and telescopes (1893). From 1892 in cooperation with Zeiss in Germany, the company produced optical lenses. In this manner, {{at the end of the}} 19th century, the product range included eyeglasses, microscopes and binoculars, as well as projectors, camera lenses and camera diaphragms.|$|R

60|$|Outside the {{laboratory}} windows was a watery-grey fog, {{and within a}} close warmth and the yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps that stood two to each table down its narrow length. On each table stood a couple of glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels, frogs, and guinea-pigs upon which the students had been working, and {{down the side of}} the room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing bleached dissections in spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed anatomical drawings in white-wood frames and overhanging a row of cubical lockers. All the doors of {{the laboratory}} were panelled with blackboard, and on these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous day's work. The laboratory was empty, save for the demonstrator, who sat near the preparation-room door, and silent, save for a low, continuous murmur and the clicking of the rocker <b>microtome</b> at which he was working. But scattered about the room were traces of numerous students: hand-bags, polished boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing covered by newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of News from Nowhere, a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These things had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the closed door, the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering.|$|E
60|$|I am {{naturally}} {{preoccupied with}} the Mind of that Civilized State we seek to make; because my work lies in this department. But while the writer, the publisher and printer, the bookseller and librarian, and teacher and preacher must chiefly direct himself to developing this great organized mind and intention in the world, other sorts of men will be concerned with parallel aspects of the Socialist synthesis. The medical worker or the medical investigator will be building up {{the body of a}} new generation, the Body of the Civilized State, and he will be doing all he can not simply as an individual, but as a citizen, to organize his services of cure and prevention, of hygiene and selection. And the specialized man of science--he will be concerned with his own special synthesis, the Knowledge of the Civilized State, whether he measure crystals or stain <b>microtome</b> sections or count stars. A great and growing multitude of men will be working out the Apparatus of the Civilized State; the students of transit and housing, the engineers in their incessantly increasing variety, the miners and geologists estimating the world's resources in metals and minerals, the mechanical inventors perpetually economizing force. The scientific agriculturist, again, will be studying the food supply of the world as a whole, and how it may be increased and distributed and economized. And to the student of law comes the task of rephrasing his intricate and often quite beautiful science in relation to the new social assumptions we have laid down. All these and a hundred other aspects are integral to the wide project of Constructive Socialism as it shapes itself now.|$|E
60|$|The {{demonstrator}} turned, {{walked slowly}} back past the <b>microtome,</b> {{and left the}} laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or stood in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated America in the matter years ago--mixed socially, too, for {{the prestige of the}} College is high, and its scholarships, free of any age limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch universities. The class numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in the theatre questioning the professor, copying the black-board diagrams before they were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the day's teaching. Of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman, wearing spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of the window at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking, plain-faced schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other a pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a well-fitting brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn, the eye specialist. The others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a dwarfed, spectacled figure, with a hunchback, sat on a bent wood stool; two others, one a short, dark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired, reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning side by side against the slate sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger share of the conversation.|$|E
50|$|Sectioning with Campden vibratomes {{have been}} {{reported}} for over 30 years. The most recent models include the 7000smz-2, the 5100mz, and the 5100mz-Plus.

The 7000smz-2 model {{is equivalent to the}} Compresstome VF-300-0Z and the Leica 1200S. Keeping tissues cool during the cutting process can be done with passive cooling such as using ice or buffer solution slush. Campden vibratomes weight about 15 kg and cost more than Compresstome vibratomes but less than Leica <b>microtomes.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{founding}} of the National Health Service following the culmination of the second world war, MSE was retained by them to develop hospital <b>Microtomes,</b> which until then had not been manufactured in the UK. In the early 1950s, the newly formed Atomic Energy Authority approached MSE requesting them to manufacture a range of centrifuges for use in their research. At the time there was strong competition from Hettich, Heraeus and Eppendorf, based in Europe and Beckman Coulter in the USA. Following the change of focus from machine tool manufacture to centrifuges, the acronym MSE was changed to Measuring and Scientific Equipment.|$|R

50|$|A sledge <b>microtome</b> is {{a device}} where {{the sample is}} placed into a fixed holder (shuttle), which then moves {{backwards}} and forwards across a knife. Modern sled microtomes have the sled placed upon a linear bearing, a design that allows the <b>microtome</b> to readily cut many coarse sections. By adjusting the angles between the sample and the <b>microtome</b> knife, the pressure applied to the sample during the cut can be reduced. Typical applications for this design of <b>microtome</b> are of the preparation of large samples, such as those embedded in paraffin for biological preparations. Typical cut thickness achievable on a sledge <b>microtome</b> is between 1 and 60 µm.|$|E

50|$|After {{elementary}} school, Paul {{attended the}} time-honored secondary school Maria-Magdalenen-Gymnasium in Breslau, {{where he met}} Albert Neisser, who later became a professional colleague. As a schoolboy (inspired by his cousin Karl Weigert who owned {{one of the first}} <b>microtomes),</b> he became fascinated by the process of staining microscopic tissue substances. He retained that interest during his subsequent medical studies at the universities of Breslau, Strasbourg, Freiburg im Breisgau and Leipzig. After obtaining his doctorate in 1882, he worked at the Charité in Berlin as an assistant medical director under Theodor Frerichs, the founder of experimental clinical medicine, focusing on histology, hematology and color chemistry (dyes).|$|R

The following year, with referrals from Constantin Ion Parhon, he became chairman of the anatomy department at the University of Iași medical faculty. Soon after his appointment, with {{the outbreak of the}} Second Balkan War, he was mobilized in the Romanian Land Forces medical service. He barely escaped with his life when his automobile fell off the pontoon bridge at Nikopol. Upon his return, he busied himself with organizing his Iași department, supplying the microscopes, <b>microtomes,</b> thermostats, magazine collections and a projector for the faculty. Meanwhile, during this period, he was involved in scientific publication, sitting on the editorial board of Spitalul, writing for Romania Medicală and, in 1911, helping found the Paris-based Annales de Biologie.|$|R
40|$|As {{early as}} 1820 {{and for several}} decades {{thereafter}} the early observers of the cytomatrix worked mostly with the light microscope and very simple equipment. It was not uncommon for the investigator simply to crush a cell between two slides and watch the results. The sole motivation for these studies, as far as I can judge, was the satisfaction of curiosity, for there were no grants. Such observations are valuable to us today, especially those accompanied by imaginative interpretations. Studies on the cytomatrix fall roughly into three periods, the early, middle, and recent. The early period, which was mostly descriptive, was the longest and filled the yearsbetween 1820 and 1910.
