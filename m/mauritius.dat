5|$|Many {{endemic species}} of <b>Mauritius</b> became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, <b>Mauritius</b> was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the <b>Mauritius</b> blue pigeon, the <b>Mauritius</b> owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the <b>Mauritius</b> night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed <b>Mauritius</b> giant tortoise, the domed <b>Mauritius</b> giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{population}} census of 2011, there are 43 Jews in <b>Mauritius.</b> The current community is unrelated to the 1940s fugitives. The first Bar Mitzvah in <b>Mauritius</b> since World War II took place in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion were lost after {{the arrival of}} humans, so that the {{ecosystems}} of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands were entirely covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. On <b>Mauritius,</b> the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the <b>Mauritius</b> blue pigeon, the <b>Mauritius</b> owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the <b>Mauritius</b> night heron. On Réunion, it lived alongside the Réunion ibis, the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon.|$|E
5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the <b>Mauritius</b> kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Martins on <b>Mauritius</b> may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on <b>Mauritius,</b> although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion and P.b.madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba Island {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The martin is found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of <b>Mauritius.</b> It also occurs on inland cliffs on <b>Mauritius.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} no further British {{operations}} in the region, the <b>Mauritius</b> campaign was not quite over. When news of the victory at Grand Port had reached France, there was pressure to resupply and reinforce the victorious squadron under Hamelin and a small squadron commanded by Commodore François Roquebert was ordered to sail for Isle de France. This squadron included three frigates: Renommée, Clorinde and Néréide and carried extensive stores to repair and rearm Hamelin's frigates. The journey from France to the Indian Ocean was a long one, {{and it was not}} until February 1811 that Roquebert's squadron arrived at <b>Mauritius.</b> Discovering that the island was in British hands, Roquebert attempted to return to France but was chased by the frigates stationed on <b>Mauritius</b> and captured at the Action of 20 May 1811. Only Clorinde escaped the British pursuit.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{occur in}} sub-Saharan Africa. The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion and P. b. madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The martin is found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of <b>Mauritius.</b> It also occurs on inland cliffs on <b>Mauritius.</b> P. b. borbonica is resident on <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion, although there are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory, with the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland outside the breeding season. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. Some of these records may be due to vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Hollanda was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone in <b>Mauritius</b> in 19years. It formed on February6, 1994, in the central Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere. The cyclone moved southwestward for much of its duration, striking <b>Mauritius</b> on February10 at peak intensity with winds of 155km/h (100mph). It later passed just southeast of Réunion before turning {{to the south and}} weakening. The cyclone became extratropical on February14 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Judaism {{is a minor}} {{religion}} in <b>Mauritius.</b> The first Jews arrived from Haifa, British Palestine (now Israel), in the 1940s because they were denied entry to Palestine by the British Government. There currently are about 150 Jews in total in <b>Mauritius.</b> There is a synagogue in Curepipe, and a Jewish cemetery in Bambous.|$|E
5|$|No predators or parasites are {{recorded}} for Brazza's martin, but Mascarene martins will mob the <b>Mauritius</b> kestrel, {{suggesting that it}} {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Mascarene martins may host a variety of parasites. On <b>Mauritius</b> they may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the Mascarene martin on <b>Mauritius,</b> although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen.

5|$|On October 19, the <b>Mauritius</b> Meteorological Services (MMS) {{released}} {{their summer}} 201516 outlook. An average season, with around seven to nine cyclones forming, was expected. MMS {{also indicated that}} the equatorial region {{to the north of}} <b>Mauritius,</b> east of Agaléga and west of Diego Garcia, could be significantly conducive for cyclone formation.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} the Mascarene grey parakeet found on <b>Mauritius</b> were first {{described}} in 1973 as belonging to a smaller relative of the broad-billed parrot in the genus Lophopsittacus. Apart from their size, the bones were {{very similar to those}} of other Mascarene parrots. The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey parrots on <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus Psittacula.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tamatave (sometimes {{called the}} Battle of Madagascar or the Action of 20 May 1811) was fought off Tamatave in Madagascar between British and French frigate squadrons during the Napoleonic Wars. The action {{was the final}} {{engagement}} of the <b>Mauritius</b> campaign of 1809–1811, and it saw {{the destruction of the}} last French attempt to reinforce their garrison on <b>Mauritius.</b> Although the news had not reached Europe by February 1811 when the reinforcement squadron left Brest, <b>Mauritius</b> had been captured in December 1810 by a British invasion fleet, the French defences hampered by the lack of the supplies and troops carried aboard the frigate squadron under the command of Commodore François Roquebert in Renommée. Roquebert's heavily laden ships reached <b>Mauritius</b> on 6 May and discovered that the island was in British hands the following day, narrowly escaping a trap laid by a squadron of British frigates ordered to hunt and destroy them.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone {{affected}} {{the country of}} <b>Mauritius</b> on February 25. Power was knocked out to 70% of the island's population, and some light infrastructure damage was also reported. Food crops were also affected. Despite warnings to remain inside, several people ventured outside during the storm. Gamede killed two on <b>Mauritius,</b> including one who drowned in high waves.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{is used as}} a mascot {{for many}} kinds of products, {{especially}} in <b>Mauritius.</b> It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of <b>Mauritius,</b> {{is used as a}} watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west <b>Mauritius.</b> This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern <b>Mauritius.</b> Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of <b>Mauritius</b> where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of <b>Mauritius.</b> Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>Mauritius</b> had {{previously}} been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the Dutch sailors who visited <b>Mauritius</b> from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of <b>Mauritius</b> has survived. The others were likely all made extinct {{by a combination of}} excessive hunting and deforestation.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to <b>Mauritius</b> on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in <b>Mauritius</b> early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Dumas {{features}} the campaign from a French perspective in his 1843 novel Georges. The 1977 novel The <b>Mauritius</b> Command by Patrick O'Brian closely follows the British campaign with Rowley {{replaced by the}} fictional Jack Aubrey.|$|E
5|$|As Hondo {{began to}} regenerate, <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion were placed under {{a state of}} alert. Residents in Réunion were advised to stay up to date with the latest {{warnings}} on the storm, not go hiking in the mountains, ensure their disaster kit is fully stocked, {{stay away from the}} shore, and know the locations of the nearest shelters. Initially, residents in Madagascar feared that Hondo would make landfall in the country after being struck by Cyclone Ivan on February16. However, the storm turn towards the southwest, away from Madagascar. On February23 ex-Hondo tracked just offshore <b>Mauritius</b> before passing directly over Réunion, just short of moderate tropical storm status. Sustained winds of 50km/h (31mph) with gusts up to 76km/h (47mph) were recorded on <b>Mauritius</b> while sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts up to 99km/h (61mph) were recorded on Réunion. The highest rainfall total was recorded at Takamaka, totaling to 750mm (29.5in). Up to 760,000 people were affected on Réunion and overall damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the storm}} {{affected}} Réunion, Bejisa passed west of Tromelin Island, producing winds of 80km/h (49mph). The storm also produced heavy rainfall on <b>Mauritius.</b> Rainfall and gusty winds also affected portions of Madagascar. Later, Bejisa produced high waves {{along the coast}} of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Clotilda {{affected}} <b>Mauritius</b> on February 13 and 14, with {{winds of}} up to , heavy rain and high seas. This resulted in several homes being flooded and about 5% of the island's sugar crop being damaged.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fantala first {{threatened}} Agaléga, {{part of the}} Outer Islands of <b>Mauritius.</b> Government officials forced all 72residents on the South Island {{to evacuate}} to the North Island, and strongly advised fishermen to avoid sailing.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Manou passed {{just north}} of Saint Brandon. There, {{sustained}} winds reached 74mph (46mph), with gusts to 109km/h (68mph). On <b>Mauritius,</b> the storm produced gusty winds {{across much of the}} island, peaking at 107km/h (67mph).|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the <b>Mauritius</b> {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on <b>Mauritius</b> caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Mauritius,</b> a {{total of}} 200people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters due to the cyclone. The island was under a Cyclone Warning Class III for 36hours, {{and for a few}} more hours it was under a Cyclone Warning Class IV, the latter meaning wind gusts of 120km/h (75mph) were reported or expected. Prior to the storm affecting the area, officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban. Due to the threat of the storm, several flights in and out of <b>Mauritius,</b> Réunion, and Rodrigues were canceled. Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, a special mobile force was {{dispatched}} by officials to assist in relief operations. Red Cross distribution centers were set up on <b>Mauritius</b> and served food and clothing to more than 500 by January 25. Despite the severity of damage, government officials declined to appeal for international aid. Although no requests for aid were made, the Government of Norway provided US$10,000 worth of funds to the nation. Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of <b>Mauritius</b> suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole. Annual growth dropped to about 1.9 percent from approximately 5 percent in 2001. The sugarcane industry suffered greatly from the storm, experiencing a 19.3 percent decrease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the French Red Cross {{supplied}} 1.5tons of supplies to approximately 10,000people victims of Kalunde. <b>Mauritius</b> Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on <b>Mauritius</b> officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, no one would be able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mauritius</b> Ferber, Bishop of Warmia, and Krzysztof Kreutzer, Prussian diplomat, {{are engaged}} in {{discussion}} just below {{and to the left}} of Hedwig. Ferber appears worried and makes a well-hidden gesture to repel evil; Kreutzer tries to calm him.|$|E
5|$|Old, vague {{accounts}} of several different now-extinct Mascarene parrots have created much confusion for {{the scientists who}} subsequently examined them. In 1967, American ornithologist James Greenway speculated that 17th- and 18th-century reports of then-unidentified grey parrots on <b>Mauritius</b> referred to the broad-billed parrot. In 1987, English ecologist Anthony S. Cheke correlated the L. bensoni subfossils with the grey parrots reported from <b>Mauritius</b> and Réunion, which had previously been ignored, or considered references to broad-billed parrots. Further study of contemporary accounts indicates that the broad-billed parrot was not grey, but had multiple colours.|$|E
5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia, which initially tracked to the south-southeast {{before turning to}} the southwest. Later that day, the system intensified to moderate tropical storm status, prompting the <b>Mauritius</b> Meteorological Service to name it Bakoly. The storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) on December23. After maintaining that intensity for about 12hours, Bakoly weakened below cyclone status as it turned to the south-southeast. On December25, the storm passed between Réunion and <b>Mauritius,</b> and later resumed its south-southwest trajectory. After executing a small loop, Bakoly turned to the southeast and dissipated on December30.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Mauritius,</b> {{power and}} water were {{gradually}} restored following the storm, and people without power used generators. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided $10,000 (1989USD) {{to the country}} to purchase water tanks and saws.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the storm's arrival, a class four cyclone alert {{was issued}} for Rodrigues Island. Between March11 and 13, flights {{to and from}} Rodrigues were {{canceled}} due to high winds. In addition, Cyclone Kalunde briefly posed a threat to <b>Mauritius.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British Indian Ocean Territory {{currently}} has no permanent population {{although there is}} a sizeable population who were born in the BIOT but currently live in <b>Mauritius</b> and the United Kingdom and so would be eligible to compete on birth criteria.|$|E
5|$|The Chagos Islands are {{a cluster}} of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First {{occupied}} by lepers from <b>Mauritius,</b> France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of <b>Mauritius.</b> Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.|$|E
