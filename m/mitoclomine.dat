40|$|Phase I-II {{trial of}} <b>mitoclomine</b> in chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) is described. Twenty seven courses of <b>mitoclomine</b> were given to 20 patients. This phase I-II study shows that <b>mitoclomine</b> is an active agent in reducing both blood lymphocytosis and organ infiltration in CLL. The neutropenic effect seems to be {{less important than the}} lymphopenic effect. Nevertheless, severe neutropenia which was observed in half of the patients represents the greatest threat in the administration of <b>mitoclomine.</b> Gastrointestinal side effects are tolerable in most patients and no alopecia is noted. When <b>mitoclomine</b> is given as a continuous treatment the daily dose of 100 mg seems sufficient to obtain a good therapeutic response. It should be worthwhile to test an intermittent dosage schedule, which was proven useful with chlorambucil. We propose to compare <b>mitoclomine</b> with other agents active in CLL in terms of therapeutic effectiveness and cross resistance. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>mitoclomine,</b> an anti-tumour agent, and of {{cortisone}} acetate on the antibody response of mice to thymus-dependent and thymus-independent antigens were compared. Both agents yielded patterns of immunosuppression which differed from that seen after X-rays, an agent {{which is likely}} to be active equally against T and B cells. <b>Mitoclomine,</b> at low doses, depressed thymus-independent responses the most; this effect can be explained if the drug is more active against B than T cells. Cortisone acetate at low doses, while depressing thymus-dependent responses, increased thymus-independent responses; this can be explained if the drug is more active against T than B cells. Thus three different patterns of immunosuppression (for X-rays, <b>mitoclomine</b> and cortisone acetate) can be interpreted in terms of effects simply on T or B cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a variety of agents on the mouse {{antibody}} response to sheep red cells (SRC) and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated. Agents formed two broad groups according to the time-dependence of their effects. Class I agents inhibited responses if given at any time over a broad period from before administration of antigen to 1 - 2 days afterwards. They included ionizing radiation, cortisone acetate, cholera toxin and several alkylating agents. Class II agents inhibited responses substantially only if given 1 - 2 days after the antigen. These agents were all either antimetabolites or vinca alkaloids. Class II agents had only moderate selectivity. When given at the time of maximal effectiveness they usually suppressed the response to SRC more than that to LPS. Some class I agents had striking selectivity. Radiation, cortisone acetate, and cholera toxin markedly suppressed the SRC response but had much less effect on the LPS response. In contrast, <b>mitoclomine</b> and its analogues, which are lipid-soluble alkylating agents, suppressed the response to LPS far more than that to SRC. Possible reasons for these differences in time-dependence and selectivity are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that human leukaemic cells and certain tumour tissues have a higher receptor-mediated uptake of low density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) than the corresponding normal cells or tissues. LDL has therefore been proposed as a carrier for anti-cancer agents. In the current study, a water-insoluble <b>mitoclomine</b> derivative (WB 4291) was incorporated into LDL. The WB 4291 -LDL complex contained about 1, 500 drug molecules per LDL particle and showed receptor-mediated toxicity in vitro as judged from the difference in growth inhibitory effect on normal and mutant (LDL-receptor-negative) cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, cellular drug uptake did not exclusively occur by the receptor pathway since mutant cells were also affected to some extent. The LDL part of the complex had the same plasma clearance and organ distribution as native LDL after i. v. injection in mice and rabbits. Therapeutic effects were observed when Balb-C mice with experimental leukaemia were treated with the complex. After i. p. administration to mice with i. p. leukaemia median survival time was prolonged 2. 5 -fold and 40 % became long time survivors. The effect was weaker (42 % increase in life span) after i. v. injections of the complex to mice with i. v. leukaemia...|$|E
