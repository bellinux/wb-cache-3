25|$|Despite its {{impressive}} size, the OED {{is neither}} the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language. Another earlier large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The {{first edition of}} the Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca is the first great dictionary devoted to a <b>modern</b> <b>European</b> <b>language</b> (Italian) and was published in 1612; {{the first edition of}} Dictionnaire de l'Académie française dates from 1694. The official dictionary of Spanish is the Diccionario de la lengua española (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Española), and its first edition was published in 1780. The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese was published in 1716.|$|E
25|$|Arabic {{dictionaries}} {{were compiled}} between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical {{order of the}} radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in <b>modern</b> <b>European</b> <b>language</b> dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, {{such as those of}} terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the Lisan al-`Arab (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and al-Qamus al-Muhit (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The Qamus al-Muhit is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the Lisan and the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

For two centuries Euclid had been taught from two Latin translations taken from an Arabic source; these contained errors in Book V, the Eudoxian theory of proportion, which rendered it unusable. Tartaglia's edition was based on Zamberti's Latin translation of an uncorrupted Greek text, and rendered Book V correctly. He also wrote the first modern and useful commentary on the theory.
