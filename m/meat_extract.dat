25|$|Blood {{agar plates}} (BAPs) contain {{mammalian}} blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at {{a concentration of}} 5–10%. BAPs are enriched, differential media used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show lysis and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include Streptococcus haemolyticus. α-Hemolysis will only cause partial lysis of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and will appear green or brown, due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example {{of this would be}} Streptococcus viridans. γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain <b>meat</b> <b>extract,</b> tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.|$|E

40|$|Cooking of meat usually aims in {{producing}} microbiologically safe food suitable for human consumption. However, doing so at such high temperatures may produce some cooking toxicants or mutagens. The objectives {{of this study}} were to investigate the mutagenicity of modelled-heat-treated meat after different cooking methods (boiling, pan-frying and charcoal grilling) using Ames Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. In addition, the content of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) in the <b>meat</b> <b>extracts</b> prepared under different cooking methods were measured using HPLC. In a trial to investigate the causes behind the mutagenicity of different <b>meat</b> <b>extracts,</b> HepG 2 cell line was exposed to different modelledheat-treated <b>meat</b> <b>extracts.</b> mRNA expression levels of various phase I and II xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) were examined using real time PCR. The results obtained declared that pan-fried and charcoal grilled-meat extracts significantly induced production of histidine＋ revertants in the Ames mutagenicity assay. Grilled-meat extracts had the highest residual concentrations of B[a]P followed by pan-fried-meat, boiled meat and raw <b>meat</b> <b>extracts,</b> respectively. Induction of XMEs especially CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2 and NQO 1 may contribute to the mutagenic ability of these extracts.

40|$|The {{intake of}} {{aluminum}} from cooking utensil is of growing {{concern to the}} health of the community. In the present work, leaching of aluminum from aluminum utensils using different types of water in food preparation was investigated. The effects of pH, salt concentration, temperature, and cooking time using tap and drinking water with Indian, Egyptian, Qatari, and Chinese utensils which are available in the local market were used in this work. The aluminum intake per person in (mg/person) was measured using drinking and tap water without adding any other ingredients. The aluminum intake was found to be in the following sequence. For drinking water: Qatari (0) < Chinese (20. 16) < Egyptian (21. 39) < Indian (100. 75). For tap water: Chinese (285. 12) < Indian 301. 93 < Egyptian (403. 8) < Qatari (407. 2). Changing the chemical composition of the used waters, the following results are found: For 40 % <b>meat</b> <b>extracts</b> with tomato juice, citric and salt in drinking water: Chinese (0 - 40. 25) < Qatari (20. 16 - 100. 63) < Egyptian (100. 63 - 120. 77) < Indian 181. 17.

40|$|Factors {{that could}} affect {{adsorption}} of monodispersed poliovirus to cell culture monolayers were evaluated. These included varying the virus adsorption period under static and nonstatic (rocked) conditions and altering the rocking rate. The effects of several soluble proteins on plaque formation, enumeration, and size were also evaluated. Rocking involved the mechanical spread of viruses over cell culture monolayers for 1 to 4 h. Rocked cultures exhibited significantly higher (P less than 0. 05) plaque counts than corresponding static cultures. Optimal plaque counts were obtained after a 2 -h adsorption period with rocking; increasing the period to 4 h did not significantly increase PFU. Optimal counts were not obtained until {{greater than or equal}} to 4 h with static adsorption. Plaque counts were not affected by increasing the rocking rate above one oscillation per minute, but a slower rocking rate resulted in a significant decrease in plaques. Adsorption of poliovirus in the presence of 3 % solutions of beef and <b>meat</b> <b>extracts,</b> acid-precipitated oyster protein, two brands of skim milk, and 3 and 10 % fetal bovine serum was compared with adsorption in protein-free controls. Significant reductions (P less than 0. 05) in plaque counts occurred with one brand of skim milk, whereas 3 % beef extract yielded highly significant reductions (P less than 0. 01) in plaque counts and appreciable decreases in plaque sizes. Salinities of protein-containing virus inocula were high for beef and <b>meat</b> <b>extracts</b> but somewhat below physiological levels for the remaining inocula. Beef extract-associated reductions in PFU were eliminated after the extracts were dialyzed. Plaque reductions were associated with dialyzable components of the beef extract but not with the inoculum salinity...|$|R
