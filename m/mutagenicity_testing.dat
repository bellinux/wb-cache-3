40|$|The {{replica plating}} method as {{developed}} by Lederberg {{has been used}} to differentiate between "true" and "false" histidine-requiring revertant bacterial colonies which develop on minimal agar plates in the Ames test. Strains of S. typhimurium LT 2, TA 100, when exposed to either sodium dichromate or the fumes from the welding of stainless steel, develop colonies whose apparent numbers are directly in proportion to the Cr(VI) content per plate in both cases, over a wide dose range. Replica impressions of the resulting colonies were transferred to Vogel Bonner minimal agar plates and incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C. It was then observed that considerable numbers of "false" revertant colonies were obtained at those Cr(VI) doses which resulted in a pronounced toxic effect, albeit with an acceptable level of the bacterial background lawn. No morphological distinction between "true" and "false" revertant colonies could be made. Although it would appear that at low doses (i. e., low toxicity) the true mutagenicity of stainless steel welding fumes can be completely accounted for by the presence of Cr(VI), the dose range over which the mutagenicity assay is reliable cannot be estimated from examination of the background lawn or from an estimate of the degree of survival of the treated cultures. Thus there is raised a serious question concerning the reliability of quantitative data published in bacterial <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>testing</b> where replica testing of the histidine requirement of the resulting "revertant" colonies is not routinely made.

Initial characterisation of the cell lines was carried out, and variation observed between the cell lines in growth rate, mitotic rate, chromosome number and chromosome size. A number of chromosome banding techniques were investigated, including G-banding, C-banding, Q-banding, Hoechst 33258 staining, silver staining and sister chromatid differentiation. Methods previously applied to both mammalian and fish chromosomes were adapted in an attempt to obtain reproducible results. The suitability of each of the cell lines for use in <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>testing</b> was assessed by exposure to EMS. The effects of EMS concentration on growth, mitotic rate, chromosome structure and SCE frequency observed in a number of the cell lines.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{reviewed the}} current science to inform and recommend the best evidence-based approaches {{on the use}} of germ cell genotoxicity tests. The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic cells predict germ cell effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most germ cell mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should germ cell tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target germ cells or gonadal tissue, {{it is not necessary to}} conduct germ cell tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in germ cells could be considered for germ cell <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>testing.</b> For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose germ cells, the chemical could be assumed to be a germ cell mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, germ cell <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>testing</b> would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of germ cell assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of germ cells during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of germ cell toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible germ cell genotoxicity.

These results indicate that the tested mouthwash brands are unlikely to present a mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard. However, these findings derived from an in vitro study cannot imitate the situation in situ, where a plethora of pharmacologically or bio-chemically active agents pass the oral cavity, thereby reacting with each other and th...|$|R
40|$|Genotoxicity and {{carcinogenicity}} {{testing of}} pharmaceuticals prior to commercialization is requested by regulatory agencies. The bacterial <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>test</b> was considered having the highest accuracy of carcinogenic prediction. However, some evidences {{suggest that it}} always results in false-positive responses when the bacterial <b>mutagenicity</b> <b>test</b> is used to predict carcinogenicity. Along with major changes made to the International Committee on Harmonization guidance on genotoxicity testing [S 2 (R 1) ], the old data (especially the cytotgenetic data) may not meet current guidelines. This review provides a compendium of retrievable results of genotoxicity and animal carcinogenicity of 136 antiparasitics. Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity data is available for 84 (61. 8 %), while 52 (38. 2 %) have been evaluated {{in at least one}} genotoxicity or carcinogenicity study, and only 20 (14. 7 %) in both genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Among 33 antiparasitics with at least one old result in in vitro genotoxicity, 15 (45. 5 %) are in agreement with the current ICH S 2 (R 1) guidance for data acceptance. Compared with other genotoxicity assays, the DNA lesions can significantly increase the accuracy of prediction of carcinogenicity. Together, a combination of DNA lesion and bacterial tests is a more accurate way to predict carcinogenicity...|$|R
