5|$|<b>Magnus</b> Olafsson (Old Norse: <b>Magnús</b> Óláfsson, Norwegian: <b>Magnus</b> Olavsson; 1073– 24 August 1103), {{better known}} as <b>Magnus</b> Barefoot (Old Norse: <b>Magnús</b> berfœttr, Norwegian: <b>Magnus</b> Berrføtt), was King of Norway (as <b>Magnus</b> III) from 1093 {{until his death in}} 1103. His reign was marked by {{aggressive}} military campaigns and conquest, particularly in the Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles and Ireland, where he extended his rule to the Kingdom of the Isles and Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The king {{known today}} as <b>Magnus</b> VI of Norway (the first Norwegian king known to use regnal numbers) {{originally}} used the regnal number IV for himself in contemporary Latin letters, leaving out <b>Magnus</b> Haraldsson. As the numbering system has seen changes in modern times, <b>Magnus</b> Haraldsson is today included as <b>Magnus</b> II.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Norway <b>Magnus</b> led campaigns into Dalsland and Västergötland in Sweden, {{claiming}} an ancient border with the country. After two unsuccessful invasions {{and a number of}} skirmishes Danish king Eric Evergood initiated peace talks among the three Scandinavian monarchs, fearing that the conflict would get out of hand. <b>Magnus</b> concluded peace with the Swedes in 1101 by agreeing to marry Margaret, daughter of the Swedish king Inge Stenkilsson. In return, <b>Magnus</b> gained Dalsland as part of her dowry. He set out on his final western campaign in 1102, and may have sought to conquer Ireland. <b>Magnus</b> entered into an alliance with Irish king Muirchertach Ua Briain of Munster, who recognised Magnus' control of Dublin. Under unclear circumstances, while obtaining food supplies for {{his return to}} Norway, <b>Magnus</b> was killed in an ambush by the Ulaid the next year; territorial advances characterising his reign ended with his death.|$|E

5|$|<b>Magnus's</b> kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short tenure, and because {{most of it was}} {{together}} with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow <b>Magnus's</b> reign, combined {{with the fact that the}} later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.|$|R

5|$|Having {{heard of}} Sweyn's defeat by <b>Magnus,</b> Harald {{met up with}} his fellow exile in Sweden (who was also his nephew), {{as well as with}} the Swedish king Anund Jacob, and the three joined forces against <b>Magnus.</b> Their first {{military}} exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast, in an effort to impress the natives by demonstrating that <b>Magnus</b> offered them no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn. Learning about their actions, <b>Magnus</b> knew that their next target would be Norway. Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father's petty kingdom, and thereafter claim the rest of the country. In any case, the people were unwilling to turn against <b>Magnus,</b> and on hearing news of Harald's schemes, <b>Magnus</b> (abroad at the time) went home to Norway with his entire army. Instead of going to war, Magnus's advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle, and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway (not Denmark) jointly with <b>Magnus</b> (although <b>Magnus</b> would have precedence). Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with <b>Magnus,</b> who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and <b>Magnus</b> had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.|$|E
5|$|Helen <b>Magnus</b> awakens in a {{dilapidated}} corridor in the Sanctuary and finds {{that both the}} building, and the surrounding city skyline lie in ruins; <b>Magnus</b> has no memory on how the devastation occurred. While venturing the streets, <b>Magnus</b> finds herself under attack by a savage humanoid creature, but is saved by two men in Hazmat suits, who proceed to capture and decontaminate her. <b>Magnus</b> is later shocked to discover that her protégé, Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), {{is the leader of}} the survivalist group. Unlike his original personality, Zimmerman is acting far more violent and aggressive, and believes <b>Magnus</b> to be an imposter, citing she died three years ago. As more creatures attack the base, <b>Magnus</b> escapes and returns to the Sanctuary, where on the way she is joined by a young girl, Jessica Mitchell (Nicole Muñoz).|$|E

5|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{settlement}} of peace between the Uí Briain and the Norwegians, Muirchertach was not only contending {{with the arrival of}} <b>Magnús,</b> but was also locked in an extended struggle with Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1121). The agreement of a year's peace between Muirchertach and <b>Magnús,</b> however, turned <b>Magnús</b> from an enemy into an ally. Whilst <b>Magnús</b> appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won overseas territoriesa region stretching from Orkney to DublinMuirchertach appears to have intended to exert influence into the Isles through his new son-in-law. In fact, during the following year, Muirchertach and <b>Magnús</b> cooperated in military operations throughout Ireland. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, <b>Magnús</b> was slain in Ulster in 1103. Thereupon Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna reveal that Sigurðr immediately repudiated Bjaðmunjotheir marriage apparently having been unconsummatedand returned to Norway. There Sigurðr proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his two brothers, Eysteinn (died 1123) and Óláfr (died 1115). It would over one hundred and fifty years until another King of Norway ventured into the Isles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnus</b> Haraldsson (Old Norse: <b>Magnús</b> Haraldsson; c. 1048 – 28 April 1069) was King of Norway from 1066 to 1069, {{jointly with}} his brother Olaf Kyrre from 1067. He was not {{included}} in official Norwegian regnal lists until modern times, but has since been counted as <b>Magnus</b> II.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnus</b> co-ruled with Olaf {{following}} his brother's return to Norway, {{but less than}} three years into his reign, <b>Magnus</b> became ill and died. His kingship has been downplayed in later history in part due to this. <b>Magnus</b> had only one child, Haakon Toresfostre who was king briefly after Olaf, but who also died young, and without issue.|$|E

5|$|<b>Magnus</b> had a son, Haakon Toresfostre, who was {{probably}} born {{the same year}} that <b>Magnus</b> died. Haakon went on to claim what he considered his part of the kingdom (after his father) in 1093 when his uncle Olaf Kyrre died, and shared the kingdom with his cousin <b>Magnus</b> Barefoot (son of Olaf Kyrre). Similar to the reign of his father, Haakon's reign also ended abruptly after a short time as he died young in 1095.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnus</b> {{was opposed}} by his cousin Haakon Magnusson, son of King Olaf's brother and {{short-lived}} co-ruler King <b>Magnus</b> Haraldsson, who claimed half the kingdom. Haakon was proclaimed king in the Uplands {{and at the}} Øyrating, the thing of Trøndelag (in central Norway). According to Førsund, Haakon {{took control of the}} entire portion of the kingdom once held by his father (also including the Frostating—the thing of Hålogaland in northern Norway—and the Gulating—the thing of western Norway). Haakon secured support by relieving farmers of taxes and duties (including taxes dating back to the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson during the early 1030s), while <b>Magnus</b> pursued costly policies and demanded lengthy military service. After <b>Magnus</b> settled at the new royal estate in Nidaros for the winter of 1094–95, Haakon also travelled to the city and took up residence at the old royal estate. Their relationship became increasingly tense, culminating when Haakon saw Magnus' longships fully rigged at sea. Haakon summoned the Øyrating in response, leading <b>Magnus</b> to sail southwards. Haakon attempted to intercept <b>Magnus</b> by travelling south to Viken by land (over the mountains of Dovrefjell), but he died unexpectedly while hunting in February 1095.|$|E
5|$|Muirchertach was {{skilled in}} diplomacy, and {{negotiation}} with the dowries {{of his daughters}} may {{have been part of}} a political game. While he may not have intended to honour his agreements with <b>Magnus</b> (or others), he needed the latter's assistance to crush Domnall. <b>Magnus</b> and Muirchertach went on joint raiding expeditions after the peace agreement, only interrupted by the winter of 1102–03. The sagas claim that <b>Magnus</b> wintered in Connacht, but since Connacht is incorrectly claimed to be Muirchertach's kingdom the location was corrected to Kincora, Munster by modern historians. Rosemary Power considered it more likely that <b>Magnus</b> would have kept his fleet near Dublin. <b>Magnus</b> was probably allied with Muirchertach during his campaigns against Domnall and the Cenél nEógain in 1103, but (in contrast to the Norse sources) Irish sources (the Annals of Ulster and Annals of the Four Masters) do not describe their campaigns as successful. On 5 August 1103, Muirchertach unsuccessfully tried to subdue Domnall in the Battle of Mag Coba. <b>Magnus</b> did not take part, but his Dublin subjects fought with Muirchertach. Since <b>Magnus</b> was closing in on the Irish throne, Muirchertach may have wanted him out of the way. According to Morkinskinna and Heimskringla, the two agreed that Muirchertach was to bring <b>Magnus</b> and his men cattle provisions for their return to Norway; as this dragged on past the agreed time, <b>Magnus</b> became suspicious that the Irish planned an attack. He gathered his men on St. Bartholomew's Day (or the day before, according to Ágrip), 24 August 1103, and ventured into the country. It is possible that <b>Magnus</b> and his men made an incautious landing to raid cattle, or the Ulaid mistook the Norwegians for cattle-raiding Hebrideans. Alternatively, Muirchertach may have ordered the Ulaid to bring provisions to <b>Magnus,</b> inciting the Ulaid to ambush the Norwegians.|$|E

5|$|After his arrival, <b>Magnus</b> began {{negotiations}} with Scottish and Irish kings about the hird {{and control of}} land in Scotland, Ireland and the surrounding islands. Upon arriving in Orkney, he sent the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson away to Norway as prisoners on a leidang ship, took their sons Haakon Paulsson, <b>Magnus</b> Erlendsson and Erling Erlendsson as hostages and installed his own son Sigurd as earl. <b>Magnus</b> then raided Scotland, the Southern Isles and Lewis. Meeting no significant opposition, he continued pillaging the Hebridean islands of Uist, Skye, Tiree, Mull and Islay, and the peninsula of Kintyre; Iona was visited, but not pillaged. <b>Magnus</b> is also recorded as warring in Sanday, although the exact location is unclear (there are three islands with that name in the region). Entered the Irish Sea, he lost three leidang ships and 120 men in Ulster. <b>Magnus</b> then continued to Mann, where the earl Óttar fell in a violent battle; he also chased (or captured) Lagman Godredsson, King of the Isles. Mann came under Norwegian control, and <b>Magnus</b> and his men stayed on the island for a time. During his time there, he organised Norwegian immigration to the island and had several forts and houses built (or rebuilt) using timber from Galloway on the Scottish mainland. This implied he had subdued part of that region too, reducing its chieftains to tributaries.|$|E
5|$|After some research, <b>Magnus</b> {{determines that}} the sisters are the Morrígan, who were created with the {{intention}} of destroying man. <b>Magnus</b> also discovers ties to a powerful secret organization, the Cabal, who had put the sisters into the crypt to be used again in the future. Ashley <b>Magnus</b> (Emilie Ullerup) learns that the Cabal was formed in the seventh century {{with the intention}} of controlling every abnormal on Earth for their own benefit; since going underground in the nineteenth century, its members have infiltrated several major organizations worldwide to continue their operation.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{intended}} for <b>Magnus</b> and Olaf to rule the kingdom jointly without division, in practice Olaf ruled over Viken (the south-eastern part of Norway), while <b>Magnus</b> controlled the Uplands and Trøndelag (the middle parts of Norway) along with Western Norway and Northern Norway. Despite of this division, {{there are no signs}} of hostility between the brothers, and their relationship appears to have been peaceful.|$|E

5|$|As {{the only}} son of King Olaf Kyrre, <b>Magnus</b> was proclaimed king in southeastern Norway {{shortly after his}} father's death in 1093. In the north his claim was contested by his cousin, Haakon Magnusson (son of King <b>Magnus</b> Haraldsson), and the two co-ruled uneasily until Haakon's death in 1095. Disgruntled members of the nobility refused to {{recognise}} <b>Magnus</b> after his cousin's death, but the insurrection was short-lived. After securing his position domestically, <b>Magnus</b> campaigned around the Irish Sea from 1098 to 1099. He raided through Orkney, the Hebrides and Mann (the Northern and Southern Isles), and ensured Norwegian control by a treaty with the Scottish king. Based on Mann during {{his time in the}} west, <b>Magnus</b> had a number of forts and houses built on the island and probably also obtained suzerainty of Galloway. He sailed to Wales later in his expedition, winning control of Anglesey (and possibly Gwynedd's submission) after repelling the invading Norman forces from the island.|$|E
5|$|Bjaðmunjo Mýrjartaksdóttir (also {{known in}} Old Norse as Bjaðmynja; and in Gaelic as Ben Muman, Bé Binn, Blathmuine, and Bláthmín; fl. 1102/1103) was a {{daughter}} of a Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. In 1102 whilst still a child, {{she was married to}} Sigurðr, son of <b>Magnús</b> Óláfsson, King of Norway. At this time, <b>Magnús</b> appears to have been in the process of setting up his son as king over the Earldom of Orkney, the Kingdom of the Isles, and the Kingdom of Dublin. The marriage itself temporarily bound Muirchertach and <b>Magnús</b> together as allies before the latter's death the following year. Sigurðr thereupon repudiated Bjaðmunjo, and left for Scandinavia, where he proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his brothers.|$|E
