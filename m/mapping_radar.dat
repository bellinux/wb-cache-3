The Rivet Clamps, originally designated C-130E(I), were {{equipped with an}} electronic and infrared (IR) countermeasures suite; and the AN/APQ-115 navigational radar. This radar, adapted from the Texas Instruments AN/APQ-89 radar used in the RF-4C Phantom photo reconnaissance aircraft, featured terrain following/terrain-avoidance (TF/TA), Doppler, and <b>mapping</b> <b>radar</b> modes, to enable it to operate at low altitudes at night and in all weather conditions and avoid known enemy radar and anti-aircraft weapons concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The F/A-18C and D {{models are}} the result of a block upgrade in 1987 {{incorporating}} upgraded radar, avionics, and the capacity to carry new missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile and AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-84 Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Other upgrades include the Martin-Baker NACES (Navy Aircrew Common Ejection Seat), and a self-protection jammer. A synthetic aperture ground <b>mapping</b> <b>radar</b> enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, the Loral AN/AAS-38 NITE Hawk FLIR (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) multi-function display (MFDs) and a color moving map.|$|E

From March to July 1943 Bomber Command began the campaign, dubbed the Battle of the Ruhr. Harris had 53 squadrons, 16 of which were medium bombers equipped with H2S terrain <b>mapping</b> <b>radar.</b> Zorner's first victory in the defence of the Ruhr came {{on the night of the}} 7/8 March 1943 northeast of Norden at 20:50 when he claimed a Wellington.

About 3 years of <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> have been analyzed in comparisons with about 30 years of measurements made by rain gauges located in the same area. The entire monitored area was divided into 4 subareas considering the complex orography near Turin, namely the flatlands, mountains, hills and urban areas. For each subarea, the Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) distributions are estimated considering rain gauges data and X-band <b>radar</b> <b>maps.</b> <b>Radar</b> <b>maps</b> are properly processed to be comparable with rain gauges measurements considering reference areas of different size centered over each available gauge.

50|$|Centimetric contour <b>mapping</b> <b>radars</b> like H2S greatly {{improved}} {{the accuracy of}} Allied bombers in the strategic bombing campaign. Centimetric gun-laying radars were much more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly, and with the newly developed proximity fuse, made anti-aircraft guns more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the German V-1 flying-bomb flight paths to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.|$|R

50|$|The British {{started a}} {{strategic}} bombing campaign in 1940 {{that was to}} last {{for the rest of}} the war. Early British bombers were all twin-engined designs, and the 1939 Battle of the Heligoland Bight had shown the vulnerability of bombers to fighter attack. Therefore, RAF Bomber Command turned to a policy of area bombing at night. Later in the war pathfinder tactics, radio location, ground <b>mapping</b> <b>radar,</b> and very low-level bombing enabled specific targets to be attacked.|$|E

It differed from the original H2S mainly in its 10 GHz operating frequency which was in the X band rather than H2S' 3 GHz S band emissions. This gave H2X higher resolution than H2S, which had problems over large cities, which appeared as a single mass on the H2S display.|$|E
40|$|Lunar radar {{mappings}} {{carried out}} in the late 1960 s and 1970 s have provided several valuable insights into lunar surface processes. These radar mappings used the delay-Doppler technique and needed the narrow antenna beams now available with large radio telescopes.

These techniques have provided high resolution lunar <b>radar</b> <b>maps</b> at 3. 8 -cm, 70 -cm, and 7. 5 -m wavelengths, a set of wavelengths which span the window available for earth-based <b>radar</b> <b>mapping</b> of the moon.
