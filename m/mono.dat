5|$|Chief Tenaya and his Ahwahneechee were {{eventually}} captured and their village burned; they were removed to a reservation near Fresno, California. The chief {{and some others}} were later {{allowed to return to}} Yosemite Valley. In the spring of 1852 they attacked a group of eight gold miners, and then moved east to flee law enforcement. Near <b>Mono</b> Lake, they took refuge with the nearby <b>Mono</b> tribe of Paiute. They stole horses from their hosts and moved away, but the <b>Mono</b> Paiutes tracked down and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya. The <b>Mono</b> Paiute took the survivors as captives back to <b>Mono</b> Lake and absorbed them into the <b>Mono</b> Lake Paiute tribe.|$|E
5|$|Gold rush–related boomtowns {{sprang up}} near <b>Mono</b> Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of <b>Mono</b> Lake), {{was founded in}} the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at <b>Mono</b> Mills, {{immediately}} northeast of <b>Mono</b> Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill.|$|E
5|$|In the US, <b>mono</b> {{records were}} already being phased out; the US release of The Beatles {{was the first}} Beatles LP to be issued in stereo only. In the UK, the {{following}} album, Yellow Submarine, {{was the last to}} be shipped in <b>mono.</b> The <b>mono</b> version of The Beatles was made available worldwide on 9 September 2009, as part of The Beatles in <b>Mono</b> CD boxed set. A reissue of the original <b>mono</b> LP was released worldwide in September 2014.|$|E

5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the <b>Mono</b> Craters. Black Point, {{today on the}} north shore of <b>Mono</b> Lake, is a flattened volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed under the surface of a much deeper <b>Mono</b> Lake about 13,300 years ago, during the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in <b>Mono</b> Lake formed Negit Island. The magma reservoir feeding the <b>Mono</b> Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the <b>Mono</b> Craters magma reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of <b>Mono</b> Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. <b>Mono</b> Basin {{was the first}} National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds <b>Mono</b> Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater {{and much of the}} northern half of the <b>Mono</b> Craters. Litigation and outreach by the <b>Mono</b> Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding <b>Mono</b> Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was {{collected}} by <b>Mono</b> Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. <b>Mono</b> Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in <b>Mono</b> Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the <b>Mono</b> Craters. <b>Mono</b> Lake Volcanic Field and {{a large part of the}} <b>Mono</b> Craters gained some protection under <b>Mono</b> Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking.|$|E

5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or <b>mono</b> full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main <b>mono</b> or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a <b>mono</b> subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recreational}} activities are available along the chain. The <b>Mono</b> Basin National Scenic Area visitor center is located near <b>Mono</b> Lake just off U.S. Route 395. A bookstore, an information desk staffed by USDA Forest Service Rangers, and museum exhibits help to orient visitors. The <b>Mono</b> Lake Committee has a staffed office and visitor information center in Lee Vining {{on the corner}} of U.S. Route 395 and 3rd Street. Information on camping, hiking, guided and self-guided tours can all be obtained at either location.|$|E

5|$|Tenaya's band {{fled the}} valley and sought refuge with the <b>Mono,</b> his mother's tribe. In mid-1853, the Ahwahneechee {{returned}} to the valley, but they subsequently betrayed the hospitality of their former <b>Mono</b> hosts by stealing horses that the <b>Mono</b> had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya; Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities subsided and by the mid-1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native Americans {{still living in the}} Yosemite area.|$|E
5|$|The Mono–Inyo Craters form a {{volcanic}} chain in Eastern California that sits along a narrow north–south-trending fissure system {{extending from the}} north shore of <b>Mono</b> Lake through the western Long Valley Caldera, south of Mammoth Mountain. The chain is within the Inyo National Forest and <b>Mono</b> County; the nearest incorporated community is Mammoth Lakes. The craters are in <b>Mono</b> Basin, {{which is part of the}} Great Basin geographic area.|$|E
5|$|Trade between tribes {{became more}} {{widespread}} during the Mariposa phase, and the diet continued to improve. Paiutes, Miwok, and Monos visited {{the area to}} trade; one major trading route went over <b>Mono</b> Pass and through Bloody Canyon to <b>Mono</b> Lake in Eastern California.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1881 and the fall of 1882, {{geologist}} Israel Russell studied the area as a side-trip during his field research of Lake Lahontan, a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last glacial period. His Quaternary History of the <b>Mono</b> Valley (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of <b>Mono</b> Lake and its volcanic features.|$|E

Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.|$|E

5|$|People {{have used}} {{resources}} on {{and around the}} Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. <b>Mono</b> Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the <b>Mono</b> Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final {{mix of the}} song on 21 April 1967. Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play {{at exactly the same}} time, only a <b>mono</b> mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this <b>mono</b> mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than using the April 1967 <b>mono</b> mix.|$|E
