25|$|Ketoconazole, {{along with}} <b>miconazole,</b> {{has been found}} to act as an {{antagonist}} of the glucocorticoid receptor.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of zonisamide is inhibited by ketoconazole, ciclosporin, <b>miconazole,</b> fluconazole and carbamazepine (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E
25|$|The {{substituted}} imidazole derivatives {{are valuable}} in treatment of many systemic fungal infections. Imidazoles {{belong to the}} class of azole antifungals, which includes ketoconazole, <b>miconazole,</b> and clotrimazole.|$|E
25|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or <b>miconazole</b> (commonly prescribed for vaginal yeast infections).|$|E
25|$|Both {{mother and}} baby {{must be treated}} {{to get rid of}} this infection. First-line therapies include nystatin, ketaconazole or <b>miconazole</b> applied to the nipple and given by mouth to the baby. Strict {{cleaning}} of clothing and breast pumps is also required to eradicate the infection.|$|E
25|$|In some {{patients}} a specific reason for adrenal insufficiency can be suspected, such as prior intake of corticosteroids that suppressed the HPA axis, {{or use of}} enzyme inducing drugs such as phenytoin. Treatment with imidazole drugs such as etomidate, ketoconazole and <b>miconazole</b> can also suppress the HPA axis, as well as drugs used specifically for this purpose, such as metyrapone.|$|E
25|$|The nail {{is often}} {{considered}} an impermeable barrier, {{but this is}} not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin, and the composition of the nail includes 7–12% water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including paraquat, a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans, urea which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use on hands and fingers, and several fungicidal agents such as salicylic acid, <b>miconazole</b> branded Monistat, natamycin; and sodium hypochlorite which is the active ingredient in common household bleach (but usually only in 2–3% concentration).|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, <b>miconazole,</b> fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, pentamidine, paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. <b>Miconazole</b> and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and albendazole have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. [...] There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. [...] About 70 percent of infections are caused by Microsporum canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. [...] Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. [...] Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the cliinical course can be shortened by using topical <b>miconazole</b> or clotrimazole. [...] Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or itraconazole. [...] Infection can spread to humans.|$|E

50|$|Griseofulvin, {{clotrimazole}} and <b>miconazole</b> are antimycotic {{agents that}} are used to treat M. nanum and T. rubrum. Of three human cases of M. nanum infection reported in 1986, all resolved with treatments by griseofulvin, clotrimazole or <b>miconazole</b> cream. Enilconazole is a fungicide that can be used as veterinary medicine. 0.2% of enilconazole in tap water was reported to be effective in clearing M. nanum in infected sows.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} with <b>miconazole</b> {{it has been}} studied as a possible treatment for infections of Clostridium difficile.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{candidiasis}} can {{be treated}} with topical anti-fungal drugs, such as nystatin, <b>miconazole,</b> Gentian violet or amphotericin B.|$|E

50|$|<b>Miconazole</b> {{is mainly}} used {{externally}} {{for the treatment}} of athlete's foot, ringworm, and jock itch. Internal application is used for oral or vaginal thrush (yeast infection). The oral gel may also be used for the lip disorder angular cheilitis. In the UK, <b>miconazole</b> may be used to treat neonatal oral thrush, while the alternative nystatin is only licensed for patients over the age of one month, but drug interactions are possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{solubilities}} of <b>miconazole</b> nitrate powder are 0.03% {{in water}} 0.76% in ethanol {{and up to}} 4% in acetic acid.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its antifungal actions, <b>miconazole,</b> along with ketoconazole, is known {{to act as an}} antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor.|$|E
50|$|Unlike nystatin, some <b>miconazole</b> {{is absorbed}} by the {{intestinal}} tract when used orally (and possibly if used vaginally); this may lead to drug interactions.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of zonisamide is inhibited by ketoconazole, ciclosporin, <b>miconazole,</b> fluconazole and carbamazepine (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E

50|$|The topical {{antifungal}} medications ketoconazole and ciclopirox {{are both}} effective for the condition. It is unclear if other antifungals, such as <b>miconazole,</b> are equally effective as {{these have been}} poorly studied.|$|E
50|$|Intravaginal agents: butoconazole, clotrimazole, <b>miconazole,</b> nystatin, tioconazole, terconazole. Candidal {{vulvovaginitis}} {{in pregnancy}} {{should be treated}} with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days. All {{are more or less}} equally effective.|$|E
50|$|Shampoos: Antibacterial/antifungal {{shampoos}} {{can help}} control bacterial and fungal infections when used daily for 7 to 10 days. Active ingredients include chlorhexidine (2%) as antibacterial and <b>miconazole</b> (1%), ketoconazole (1%) or enilconazole as antifungal.|$|E
5000|$|Final rinse: 1:00 @ 80-103 °F (26.7-39.4 °C). Up {{until the}} mid-1990s, the final rinse {{was called a}} {{stabilizer}} bath, since it contained formaldehyde. Currently, the final rinse uses a surfactant, and <b>miconazole,</b> an anti-fungal agent.|$|E
50|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or <b>miconazole</b> (commonly prescribed for vaginal yeast infections).|$|E
50|$|<b>Miconazole,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Monistat among others, is an {{antifungal}} medication used to treat ring worm, pityriasis versicolor, and yeast infections of the skin or vagina. It {{is applied to the}} skin or vagina as a cream or ointment.|$|E
50|$|Even with treatment, the {{condition}} is often fatal, and {{there are very few}} recorded survivors, almost all of whom suffered permanent neurocognitive deficits. Antifungal drugs including ketoconazole, <b>miconazole,</b> 5-flucytosine and pentamidine {{have been shown to be}} effective against GAE-causing organisms in laboratory tests.|$|E
50|$|Prevention is {{by keeping}} the skin dry, not walking barefoot in public, and not sharing {{personal}} items. Treatment is typically with antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or <b>miconazole.</b> If the scalp is involved antifungals by mouth such as fluconazole may be needed.|$|E
50|$|Vusion is {{a topical}} {{antifungal}} drug product {{that contains the}} active ingredients <b>miconazole</b> nitrate, zinc oxide, and white petrolatum.
