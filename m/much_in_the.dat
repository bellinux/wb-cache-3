5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a Lutheran {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} Lutheran church and his early home {{environment}} was strictly religious. Jacob did not receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of formal education. His father died when he was six or seven years old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E

5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 to redesign Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design was very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were {{the work of a}} later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade of brick with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} of November, Bangladesh hosted Zimbabwe for three ODIs and two T20s. Rahman played a salient role in the ODI matches, taking a total of 8 wickets. He {{captured}} his third five-wicket haul in the last game. He could not contribute <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> T20 series, though he bowled economically, which resulted both sides sharing a win. The next year in January, Bangladesh again played with Zimbabwe in four T20s. Rahman played {{in the first two}} matches, which they won. While bowling in the second T20I against Zimbabwe in January 2016, Mustafizur injured his shoulder. Following that, he was dropped from the squad {{for the first time since}} debut.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the long journey and the siege had a {{detrimental}} effect on the Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter. The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna.|$|E
5|$|MD410 was {{originally}} built along mostly new alignment between Bethesda and Silver Spring {{in the late}} 1920s. The highway was extended east to Hyattsville in the mid-1930s. While the Montgomery County portion has not changed <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing decades, MD 410 has been realigned and extended multiple times within Prince George's County. These changes include an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s, a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s, an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s, and the final extension to Landover Hills in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. <b>Much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
5|$|Of Stanford's other orchestral works, his six Irish Rhapsodies all {{date from}} the 20th century, the first from 1901 and the last {{from the year before}} his death. Two of the set feature solo {{instruments}} along with the orchestra: the third (cello) and the sixth (violin). In Dibble's view some of the concertante works such as the First Piano Concerto (1894) and the Violin Concerto (1899) are in their orchestration and their lyricism as <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition of Mendelssohn as of Brahms, with whom Stanford's music is often compared.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1651, {{the first}} {{significant}} naval battle {{of the war was}} fought south of Naxos, a three-day engagement in which the Venetians with 58 ships under Alvise Mocenigo were victorious over the twice as large Ottoman fleet. The remainders of the Ottoman fleet withdrew to Rhodes, from where they were however able to reach Candia. Mocenigo was replaced soon after by Leonardo Foscolo, but both sides did not accomplish <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next two years, although the Ottomans did succeed in supplying their forces on Crete while keeping their fleet intact.|$|E

5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay not so <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes {{had not yet been}} extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E

5|$|By 301, {{however, the}} system was in trouble, {{strained}} by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as <b>much.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> edict, preserved in an inscription {{from the city of}} Aphrodisias in Caria (near Geyre, Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards. It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency. This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.|$|E
5|$|George Gilbert Scott, the {{architect}} of ChristChurch Cathedral, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the clerk of works and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most obviously the tower and the west porch. He also designed the font, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral is very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European decorated Gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside {{the body of the}} cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.|$|E
5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956).|$|E
