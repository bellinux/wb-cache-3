25|$|Initial {{needs for}} food, clothing, {{medicines}} and basics, even toilet paper, {{were brought in}} on landing ships until harbours could be cleared of mines.

500|$|The legal {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Council for the Common Foreign and Security Policy {{are different from the}} legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of [...] "common positions", [...] "joint actions", and [...] "common strategies". Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in Myanmar, a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the African Great Lakes, or a certain issue such as support for the International Criminal Court. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for <b>mine</b> <b>clearing</b> or to combat the spread of small arms. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.|$|E
40|$|Visualization is {{essential}} for understanding the models obtained by process <b>mining.</b> <b>Clear</b> and efficient visual representations make the embedded information more accessible and analyzable. This work presents a novel approach for generating process models with structural properties that induce visually friendly layouts. Rather than generating a single model that captures all behaviors, a set of Petri net models is delivered, each one covering a subset of traces of the log. The models are mined by extracting slices of labelled transition systems with specific properties from the complete state space produced by the process logs. In most cases, few Petri nets are sufficient to cover {{a significant part of}} the behavior produced by the log. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

50|$|The Yarra River was an {{important}} resource for the Wurundjeri people for around 40,000 years. The river's resources were utilised sustainably by the Wurundjeri until European settlement in the early-mid-19th century. Early industry located along the river contributed great amounts of pollution such as dangerous chemicals, grease, oil and heavy metals. Through the mid-20th century, industry was slowly relocated away from the river and since then the major pollutants have come from storm water runoff, sewerage and lasting effects of previous pollution. Gold <b>mining</b> <b>cleared</b> small areas of land of vegetation and for periods of time, drained sections of the river, however when compared to land clearing and industrial pollutants, the effects of gold mining on the river were quite low.|$|R
500|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, the members of the Braunschweig class were {{assigned}} to IV Battle Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt, and tasked with coastal defense duties. Braunschweig and Elsass both participated in the early portion of the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. The two ships kept the Russian pre-dreadnought [...] at bay while a Russian minefield was cleared, but the Russian forces put up a strong defense. Vice Admiral Schmidt decided to withdraw his forces when it became apparent that the <b>mine</b> <b>clearing</b> had taken too long, and there wasn't sufficient daylight left for the minelayer [...] to lay a minefield of its own. In 1916, Hessen was assigned to II Battle Squadron, and participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. Late in the day on the 31st, Hessen and the other pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron briefly engaged Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, and in doing so, covered the withdrawal of the battered German battlecruisers under the command of Franz von Hipper.|$|E
