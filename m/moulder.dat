5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace <b>Moulder,</b> who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When <b>Moulder</b> returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. <b>Moulder</b> left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by Howling Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration from the long period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got {{the other members of}} the band involved. They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers, one being Alan <b>Moulder</b> (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). <b>Moulder</b> was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, Howling Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E
5|$|Henry Dewar, born 13 October 1883 in Foxton, New Zealand, {{was the son}} of Alexander and Lydia Dewar. He {{spent most}} of his early years in Wellington until moving to Taranaki in 1910 where he worked as an iron <b>moulder</b> for B. Harkness of Stratford.|$|E

5000|$|Although machine {{moulding}} {{was first}} introduced into Australia in the late 19th century the FMU initially refused to admit machine and plate <b>moulders</b> into the union, regarding the work as relatively unskilled compared to that done by fully qualified 'jobbing' <b>moulders.</b> These workers were therefore organised by industrial unions, such as the Federated Stove and Piano Frame Makers Association of Australia and the Federated Agricultural Implement Machinery and Ironworkers Association of Australia. In 1920 the FMU did expand its coverage to allow machine <b>moulders</b> to join, although the union's staunch opposition to the piece-work system of payment under which most machine <b>moulders</b> worked meant that few could become members. Despite its exclusive attitude towards membership, which kept {{the total number of}} FMU members low throughout its existence, the vital position of <b>moulders</b> in major industries such as mining, manufacturing and the railways ensured that the union remained industrially powerful. In 1983 the FMU merged with the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union (AMWSU) to form the Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and Shipwrights' Union.|$|R

5|$|The fifth album In Dream, {{produced}} by Editors themselves and mixed by Alan <b>Moulder,</b> {{was released on}} 2 October 2015. It marks the band's collaboration with the Iranian born Dutch photographer, film and music video director Rahi Rezvani who also directed the video for 'Ocean of Night', released on 24 November. In October 2015, Editors together with Brussels Beer Project has released their own beer 'Salvation', named after a track on their album In Dream.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} the game with VGA {{graphics}} and sound card audio appeared in 1991. Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards used the new game engine Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was released in 1991 for the Amiga, DOS, and Macintosh platforms. For the first remake, Al Lowe served as director and designer, also helping to program the game, and Ken Williams became executive producer. Other key people included Stuart <b>Moulder</b> (producer), William R. Davis Sr. (creative director), William D. Skirvin (art designer), Mark Seibert (music director), Oliver Brelsford (lead programmer), and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris Braymen.|$|E
5|$|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, released on October 23, 1995 in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States on Virgin Records. Produced by frontman Billy Corgan with Flood and Alan <b>Moulder,</b> the 28-track album was released as a two-disc CD and triple LP. The album features {{a wide array of}} styles, as well as greater musical input from bassist D'arcy Wretzky and second guitarist James Iha.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, {{the union}} was {{a founder of}} the Federation of <b>Moulders</b> and Collateral Trades, {{although}} this soon collapsed. It continued alone until 1920, growing to over 4,000 members, when it merged with the Associated Iron <b>Moulders</b> of Scotland and the Friendly Society of Ironfounders to form the National Union of Foundry Workers.|$|R

5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from playing by the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass <b>moulder,</b> and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but <b>Moulder</b> supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer. Marks set {{the tone of the}} environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E

25|$|Virgin {{began to}} grow {{impatient}} with the album's recording as it went over budget and became behind schedule. The band, however, would not let the company cut corners if it meant compromising the sound. By the time recording was completed, Corgan and Vig felt too emotionally exhausted to mix the record. Corgan suggested that engineer Alan <b>Moulder</b> mix the album, due to his work on Loveless by My Bloody Valentine. <b>Moulder</b> booked two weeks in a studio to mix the album; the mix ended up taking 36 days to complete. Eventually, the album was finished after four months and $250,000 over budget.|$|E
25|$|The Fragile was {{produced}} by Trent Reznor and Alan <b>Moulder</b> at Nothing Studios in New Orleans. There were some personnel changes within Nine Inch Nails after the Self-Destruct tour, which saw drummer Chris Vrenna replaced by Bill Rieflin and Jerome Dillon, the latter of whom would become Nine Inch Nails' full-time drummer until late 2005. Charlie Clouser and Danny Lohner contributed occasional instrumentation and composition to several tracks although the album was predominantly written and performed by Reznor alone. The Fragile was mixed by Alan <b>Moulder</b> and mastered by Tom Baker. The packaging was created by David Carson and Rob Sheridan.|$|E

25|$|Stanley Kirkby (pronounced Kir-k-by) {{was born}} in Ancoats, Manchester, England, {{in the last quarter}} of 1878 as James Baker to George Baker, an iron <b>moulder</b> and his wife Margaret Kirkby. He was a double cousin of the contralto opera singer Louise Kirkby Lunn (born 1873), two Kirkby sisters having married two Baker brothers. In 1891 at the age of 12 he was working as a {{warehouse}} boy in Manchester; his father was no longer present in the household and both his mother and sister had entered the confectionery trade. By 1901 the family was running a confectionery shop and living in Oldham Street in Manchester; his mother was no longer present in the household and Kirkby was working as a tobacco packer.|$|E
25|$|Cricket was engrained in Barlow from {{an early}} age, {{and he went on}} to play for Lancashire for 20 years and {{continued}} to play at lower levels into his sixties. Before this he had left school aged fourteen to work in a printing office as an apprentice compositor. He was later an iron <b>moulder</b> with Dobson & Barlow in Bolton, and then in 1865 he moved to Derbyshire when his father got work at the Staveley Iron Works. It was for Staveley Iron Works Cricket Club that Barlow first played cricket, becoming a cricket professional with Farsley in Leeds in 1871, which was the year in which he first played for Lancashire. From 1873 to 1877 he was the professional for Saltaire in Bradford. Barlow played one match for Derbyshire in the 1875 season against a United North of England Eleven.|$|E
