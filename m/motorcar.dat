5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring {{in and out of}} the shot. When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari <b>motorcar,</b> drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E

She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie <b>Motorcar</b> Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price for the picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts.

5|$|Paavo Nurmi Marathon, held {{annually}} since 1969, is {{the oldest}} marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest. In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill {{was replaced by a}} new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the Paavo Nurmi Stadium. Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel Marathon Man as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream., written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique <b>motorcar.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known streamlined rail {{equipment in}} the United States were McKeen rail <b>motorcars</b> built for Union Pacific and Southern Pacific between 1905 and 1917. Most of them sported a pointed [...] "wind splitter" [...] front, a rounded rear, and round porthole style windows in a style that was as much nautically as aerodynamically inspired. The McKeen cars were unsuccessful because internal combustion technology for that application was completely unreliable {{at the time and}} the lightweight frames dictated by their limited power tended to break. Upgraded trolley streetcars running on dedicated electrified tracks were preferred over rail <b>motorcars</b> for interurban service. Streamlined rail <b>motorcars</b> would appear again in the early 1930s after the internal combustion-electric propulsion technology developed by General Electric and promoted by the Electro-Motive Company became the accepted technology for rail <b>motorcars</b> in the 1920s.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to contemplate Saudi consumer attitudes toward the purchase of luxury <b>motorcars</b> in the Saudi automotive market. In Saudi Arabia, luxury <b>motorcars</b> sales have been increasing in recent years, thus making the automotive market in Saudi Arabia the biggest in the Middle East and the Gulf region. Therefore, studying Saudi consumer attitudes is particularly significant. Afterward, the general analysis of Saudi consumers is based on Fishbein 9 ̆ 2 s Multiattribute Attitude Model, which includes three main components (Affect, Behaviour and Cognition). In addition, the study incorporates consumers from different age groups. Moreover, the study mainly examines the characteristics of luxury <b>motorcars.</b> Regarding {{the research}} method, the core methods are descriptive and support the hypotheses. Also, the method of collecting the information is quantitative. Likewise, the precise method for collecting the information is through questionnaire with an actual sample size of 391. For the measurement of data collected, version 21 of SPSS software will be used to complete the analysis and test the hypotheses. The main findings of the study confirm that Saudi consumer attitude toward the purchase of luxury <b>motorcars</b> is strong. In addition, consumer responses of their cognition and the intention underlying their behaviour have a stronger attitude in comparison to consumer affection responses. Moreover, the variable of consumer income group has a significant effect on Saudi consumer intentions with respect to the purchase of luxury <b>motorcars.</b> It is acknowledged from the findings that cognition has {{a significant role in the}} intentions that underpin consumer behaviour. Therefore, luxury <b>motorcars</b> are able to induce and elicit affection from Saudi consumers and create objective consumers of luxury <b>motorcars</b> to increase in the long term...|$|R

25|$|As the {{popularity}} of the <b>motorcar</b> increased, train services were severely cut back {{due to the lack of}} patronage, and the number of services passing through Tunbridge Wells West declined as one line after another was closed from the 1950s onwards.

Tunbridge Wells West was itself listed for closure in 1966, only to be subsequently reprieved. The line to Tunbridge Wells West remained open, although in its latter years passenger services were mainly confined to a shuttle service between Tonbridge (via the single line connection to Tunbridge Wells Central - now plain Tunbridge Wells) and Eridge with a few through trains to Uckfield; however there was a depot at the station which housed rolling stock for services on the Uckfield and East Grinstead - London (via East Croydon) lines, and there were plenty of empty stock moves early and late in the day.|$|E
