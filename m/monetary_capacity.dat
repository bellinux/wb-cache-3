40|$|It is {{suggested}} that an extra degree of freedom is needed to construct a symmetric noncooperative price game in a market with n monopolists trading in n goods. This calls for the introduction of an n+ 1 good which {{can be interpreted as}} a commodity money. Where there are n monopolists using a commodity money in common a symmetric price or quantity noncooperative game can be constructed. The quantity game is examined. Necessary conditions are shown for the replicated game to have its noncooperative equilibria approach the competitive equilibria of the replicated market. It is demonstrated that unless there is "enough" commodity money convergence may not take place. There will be a "money shortage" and this will be reflected in a price for the commodity money higher than its utilitarian worth. This reflects the addition of a "shadow price" for the worth of relaxing the <b>monetary</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint. ...|$|E

The {{following}} project measures labor work {{performance in}} house building for MAVACON Construction Company. The main {{objective is to}} obtain the performance of labor work per worker in an hour time, to apply as a tool in planning and budget {{for this kind of}} projects. MAVACON currently does not count with this sort of information and is currently working with <b>monetary</b> <b>capacity</b> per activity ratios, which has very small advantages and efficiency. As a first approach, a measure instrument was selected in the behavioral studies so that, later on, {{it would be possible to}} obtain variable measurements that are of interest in this study. Next, data was codified to proceed in comparing with other sources of information and data given by the company.

40|$|Healthcare {{financing}} {{system is}} of crucial {{importance for the}} functioning of any healthcare system, especially {{because there is no}} country in the world that is able to provide all its residents with access to all the benefits afforded by modern medicine. Lack of resources in general and rising healthcare expenditures are considered a difficult issue to solve in Croatia as well. Since Croatia gained its independence, its healthcare system has undergone a number of reforms, the primary objective of which was to optimize healthcare services to the actual <b>monetary</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Croatian economy. The objectives of the mentioned re - forms were partially achieved. The solutions that have been offered until now, i. e. consolidation measures undertaken in the last 10 years were necessary; however, they have not improved the operating conditions. There is still the issue of the deficit from the previous years, i. e. outstanding payments, the largest in the last decade. Analysis of the performance of healthcare institutions in 2011 shows that the decision makers will have to take up a major challenge of finding a solution to the difficulties the Croatian healthcare system has been struggling with for decades, causing a debt of 7 billion kuna. At the same time, they will need to uphold the basic principles of the Healthcare Act, i. e. to provide access to healthcare and ensure its continuity, comprehensiveness and solidarity, keeping in mind that the National Budget Act and Fiscal Responsibility Act have been adopted...|$|E
40|$|Neoliberalism has {{not given}} rise to a {{sustained}} profit-led growth process, but to a finance-dominated accumulation regime in which growth relies either on financial bubbles and rising household debt ('debt-driven growth') or on net exports ('export-driven growth'). The financial crisis that began in the market for derivatives on the US subprime mortgage market has translated into the worst recession since the 1930 s. In Europe the crisis has been amplified by an economic policy architecture (the Stability and Growth Pact) that aimed at restricting the role of fiscal policy and insulating monetary policy and central banks from national governments. The crisis has thus led to a sharp economic divergence between core and peripheral countries. Contrary to the situation in the (export-driven) Germanic core of Europe, the crisis is escalating in the (debt-driven) southern countries of Europe. The paper interprets the policy regime as the outcome of national elites’ attempt to use European integration as a means to constrain nation states. The result is a policy regime that has fatally weakened nation states as regards their fiscal and <b>monetary</b> <b>capacities</b> without creating a European state...|$|R
50|$|Modern Monetary Theory, {{like all}} {{derivatives}} of the Chartalist school, emphasize that in nations with monetary sovereignty, a country is {{always able to}} repay debts that are denominated in its own currency. However, under modern-day monetary systems, the supply of money is largely determined endogenously. But exogenous factors like government surpluses and deficits play a role and allow government to set inflation targets. Yet, adherents of this school note that monetary inflation and price inflation are distinct, and that when there's idle <b>capacity,</b> <b>monetary</b> inflation can cause a boost in aggregate demand which can, up to a point, offset price inflation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} trade and exchange reforms that paved way {{for the implementation of}} the current flexible, market-based exchange rate regime in Ghana. Using descriptive method, the paper argues that Ghana has succeeded in unifying its exchange rates without the inflationary consequences, as Pinto (1988, 1990) predicts, partly because of the strategy used. The strategy involved a gradual, rather than overnight, exit from the rigidly fixed exchange rate regime. It therefore enabled the development of a relatively more liquid and deeper foreign exchange market as well as the development of <b>monetary</b> authorities’ <b>capacity</b> to monitor and supervise the operations of the market. In addition, the IMF/World Bank’s support with foreign exchange (loans and aid) enabled an orderly and gradual exit to a flexible regime in Ghana. The paper then examines the macroeconomic response to the reforms by analysing the trends in some major economic aggregates during the reform process. One major policy lesson from the Ghanaian exchange rate reforms is that unless there is a reliable source of foreign exchange, liberalising trade could cause policy reversals by causing substantial and sudden exchange rate depreciations that are politically risky. ...|$|R
40|$|Preventive {{strategies}} of renal {{failure in the}} Arab world. The prevalence of both acute and chronic renal failure is high in the Arab world. Data available on the exact prevalence of various renal diseases are very limited. Nevertheless, the reported prevalence of chronic renal failure is 80 to 120 per million population (pmp) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 225 pmp in Egypt. This is {{in comparison with the}} reported prevalence of 283 pmp in Europe, 975 pmp in the United States, and 1149 pmp in Japan. Lower prevalence rates reported in this region could be due to underreporting. AbstractThe economic burden of renal replacement on health care providers is enormous. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the estimated cost per annum incurred toward maintenance hemodialysis is US $ 19, 400 and, considering that there are more than 7200 patients on regular dialysis in this country, the total expenditure is enormous. Such large amounts may be beyond the <b>monetary</b> <b>capacity</b> of many countries in this region because of limited financial resources. AbstractThese figures clearly suggest that there is an urgent need to establish a massive prevention program. The strategy adapted should be innovative and imaginative and should be one that is maximally cost effective. AbstractParadoxically, in the Arab world, we have a good opportunity to reduce the incidence of kidney failure (chronic and acute) substantially by appropriately chosen models. This is because many of the causes of renal failure are eminently preventable. In fact, a rough estimate is that these programs, if successful, can reduce the incidence by as much as 40 % (personal communication, Shaheen, 2003). It is worthy of mention that, in the Arab world, the budget for research is about 0. 15 % of the national domestic product compared with the international average of 1. 5 %. AbstractIn this article, we concentrate on some of the main causes of renal failure in the Arab world that we feel can be prevented and suggest ways that can best address this issue...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing {{annual data}} for {{a sample of}} {{developing}} countries, the time-series evidence indicates the allocation of monetary policy shocks, both expansionary and contractionary, between price inflation and output growth. Subsequently, cross-country regressions evaluate factors that underlie the difference in these allocations and their implications. The real effects of monetary shocks increase as the elasticity of aggregate demand increases with respect to <b>monetary</b> shocks. Nonetheless, <b>capacity</b> constraints hamper the output adjustment to monetary shocks and increase price inflation. Across countries, trend output growth increases with the output response to monetary shocks. Consistent with the stabilizing function of monetary policy, the variability of output growth decreases {{in the face of}} monetary fluctuations across countries. In contrast, monetary fluctuations increase the trend and variability of price inflation across countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic behaviour {{of the bank}} lending channel at the mean and at various quantiles for a sample of European banks, by making use of the quantiles regression methodology, spanning the period 2000 – 2012. In the first case, the bank lending channel exists. In contrast, when policy interest rates are estimated at lower quantiles as the rates approach the Zero Lower Bound, the <b>monetary</b> policy's <b>capacity</b> to influence banking loans seems to lose its momentum and {{is found to be}} completely ineffective below a critical policy interest rate. The results remain robust for different bank characteristics such as capitalisation, asset size, and liquidity, as well as for alternative scenarios concerning the definition of monetary decisions and the construction of lending activities. The empirical findings also survived other robustness checks, such as a different methodological approach, the role of securitisation and the role of non-conventional monetary policy measures. The empirical findings are expected to be significant {{in the context of the}} recent global financial crisis where central banks had to push down their policy interest rates close to zero. In such a distressed financial environment, changes in bank lending terms should form an explicit component of macroeconomic models that describe monetary policy rules used for policy advice...|$|R
40|$|A {{coherent}} {{method to}} measure {{the effectiveness of a}} monetary policy improves the <b>monetary</b> authority's management <b>capacity</b> and renders the possibility of applying sound policies prior to and during a crisis. The trend in employing complicated and ambiguity-bearing unconventional monetary tools {{in the aftermath of the}} 2008 crisis has increased the value of such a method. The aim of this article is to introduce a coherent and consistent monetary policy evaluation method for Turkey. Accordingly, we suggest that innovations in the spread between overnight interest rates and Treasury auction interest rates are informative for exchange rate, output, and prices. Empirical evidence for this identification reveals that positive innovation in spread (implying a tight monetary policy measure) decreases output temporarily, permanently decreases prices, and appreciates local currency. This result is also robust to alternative specifications. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
30|$|We {{performed}} {{a set of}} numerical experiments to evaluate the relative quality of the different solution approaches, as presented in Sect.  4. To this end, the widely used PSPLIB problem library of heterogeneous and challenging RCPSP instances presented in Kolisch and Sprecher (1996) was used and modified to match the specific characteristics of our problem. In particular, we defined additional parameters not already included in the classical RCPSP. These are resource-specific overtime cost of κ _r= 1 / 2 <b>monetary</b> units per <b>capacity</b> unit and period, upper bounds for overtime z_r= 1 / 2 K_r, and the makespan-dependent revenue function u_t. The revenue function has to be constructed carefully to avoid that the optimal solutions either always have zero overtime or always use overtime whenever possible. In these two trivial cases, a standard RCPSP procedure to minimize the makespan would be sufficient after adjusting the capacities to K_r^' = K_r + z_r or K_r^' =K_r, respectively.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} instruments of economic policy of the opened countries is the exchange rate. It is considered both a mean of monetary regulation and a tool of outside competitiveness. Morocco plans to adopt the floating exchange rate regime, in the end of 2009. Indeed, the question which arises today is to know what type of floating exchange rate regime will be applied. Under the economic, technical and institutional factors, we ask if Morocco is ready and able to adopt this regime. In the light of this report, this paper will deal with the impact of the exchange rate policy on the real economy in Morocco through an empirical model called « The Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate » supported by Clark and MacDonald (1997). Firstly, our investigation deals with the efficiency of exchange rate policy adopted by Morocco, secondly, it deals with the capacity of Dirham to resist to the shocks caused by the misalignments and finely, with the Moroccan <b>monetary</b> authorities’ <b>capacity</b> to manage the existing exchange regime. Under using the cointegration method, the error correction model and the analysis of the shocks by using the method of the decomposition of variance, our results confirm that the dynamics of the exchange rate in Morocco is determined by the variables such as the terms of trade, the foreign assets and the foreign debt. Similarly, in terms of short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate and in the analysis of the shocks, the supply and demand dynamics the dirham seems determining. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{analyzes the}} patterns of fiscal and monetary policy in five economies of the Latin American Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) during four episodes of international crises: 1994, 1997 - 1999, 2001 and 2008. In contrast with earlier episodes when most {{countries in the region}} applied procyclical fiscal and monetary policies, the response of the five countries to the 2008 crisis was countercyclical. On the fiscal side, countries had a larger fiscal space in 2008 to implement a countercyclical policy thanks to increases in primary balances, improvements in sustainability indicators and a reduction in financing needs in the years before the crisis. On the <b>monetary</b> side, the <b>capacity</b> to implement countercyclical policy was supported by a shift towards more flexible exchange rate regimes, and monetary policy regimes that enhanced transparency, reduced price volatility and increased the credibility of monetary authorities. For countries to be able to implement countercyclical responses in future crisis episodes, the fiscal authorities should reverse expansionary measures during good times and Central Banks should meet their inflation targets to preserve fiscal space and anchor inflation expectations. ...|$|R

40|$|The European Capital Markets Union (CMU) {{project is}} a strong {{political}} commitment to market-­‐based finance, the new code word for shadow banking. Since securitisation, the financial innovation that triggered the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, is key for market-­‐based credit intermediation, its revitalisation has become of strategic importance. Considering that the CMU is an important pillar of European plans to support growth and to complete the European Monetary Union (EMU), what explains that securitisation (and market-­‐based finance) have become key for achieving these goals? Challenging arguments on regulatory capture, I claim that this outcome {{can be explained by}} not only taking the agency of financial market actors seriously, but also the agency of important EU actors, in particular the European Central Bank (ECB). In a nutshell, I argue that the political plans to strengthen securitisation and market-­‐based finance have its roots in the ECB’s efforts to stabilize the euro zone. The unique institutional setting of the EMU has forced the ECB into the role of what I shall call the ‘macroeconomic stabilizer of last resort’. While in 2011 -­‐ 2012 economic circumstances called for a swift solution of the Southern European banking crisis through a jointly financed program of bank recapitalisation, intra-­‐euro zone risk sharing was not a feasible political option. Yet, the weakness of the Southern European banks undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy {{while at the same time}} the ECB’s (bank-­‐based) monetary firepower reached its limits. Against this background, the ECB started deliberating on revitalising European securitisation markets in early 2013 both as an attempt to stimulate non-­‐bank credit intermediation and to restore <b>monetary</b> steering <b>capacity</b> over the economy. The study is based on documentary analysis and expert interviews. The analysis contributes to ongoing research on ‘public-­‐private’ interest alignments in the political system of the European Union and the role of the ECB in shadow markets...|$|R
40|$|Six {{years after}} the {{outbreak}} of the financial crisis that had shaken the global financial system, experts and analysts all over the world continue discussing the effectiveness, scope and adequacy of mechanisms and measures implemented in the meantime, as well as the adequacy of the underlying theoretical concept. A global consent has been reached on ensuring financial stability through the interaction of monetary, fiscal and prudential policy to ensure the necessary macroprudential dimension of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. The USA crisis spilled over to Europe. Strong support of governments to bail out banks quickly resulted in sovereign debt crises in some peripheral EU Member States. Fiscal insolvency of these countries strongly shook the EU and increased doubts in the monetary union survival. The European Union stood united to defend the euro and responded strongly with a new complex and comprehensive financial stability framework. This supranational framework is a counterpart to the global financial stability framework created by the G 20 member countries. Starting from the specific features of the <b>monetary</b> policy whose <b>capacities</b> are determined by euroisation, available instruments and resources for preventive supervisory activities, as well as the role of the government in crisis management, Montenegro created a framework for maintaining financial stability and prescribed fostering and maintaining financial stability as the main objective of the Central Bank of Montenegro...|$|R
