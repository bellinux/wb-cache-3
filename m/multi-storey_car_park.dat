5|$|In 1914 the {{graveyard}} was formally deconsecrated and the headstones {{were removed from}} the site, which became a children's playground in the 1930s and subsequently a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little parking {{elsewhere on the}} site, other than the 190-space facility at the Sainsbury's supermarket; this is partly mitigated by the retention of the London Road <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> located between Block C and the A23 London Road itself. The residential areas in particular have very few dedicated parking spaces. Block K will have 27 spaces to be shared between the hotel and the office building; nine of these will be for disabled drivers. The master plan proposed 34 (including five on-street spaces), {{all of which were}} allocated to the office building.|$|E

5|$|Vehicular {{access to}} the Quays has been {{improved}} by the construction of Broadway Link Road, which links the site to the M602 motorway at junction 2, and by the provision of car parking. The high-rise 2116 space <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was completed in August 2009. It is a pre-cast curved structure clad {{in a mixture of}} aluminium mesh panels and shaded aluminium tiles, comprising 11 floors of parking above the development's energy centre and commercial units.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, walking {{into the middle of}} a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|The town {{suffered}} {{very little}} from the bombing {{runs in the}} Second World War that did damage to many English locations. The worst case in Shrewsbury was in 1940, {{a woman and her}} two grandchildren were killed when a cottage was destroyed on Ellesmere Road, the only local air raid deaths. Therefore, many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s, which arguably destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK. However, some historic buildings were demolished {{to make way for the}} brutalist architectural style of the 1960s, though the town was saved from a new 'inner ring road' due to its challenging geography. Two notable examples of 1960s/70s construction in Shrewsbury were demolished in the 2000s — the Telecom Tower on Smithfield Road and the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> at St Austin's Friars.|$|E
50|$|Four <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and a <b>car</b> rental centre will be {{completed}} by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007, Burnley {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a £20 million redevelopment of Turf Moor. The plans also included {{the creation of a}} youth academy at the club's training facility at Gawthorpe Hall in nearby Padiham. The plans were detailed in six phases. In the first phase it was planned to move the changing rooms to the corner between the James Hargreaves Stand and the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. The second phase included the demolition of the Cricket Field Stand, a new stand to be built at that end of the ground that would incorporate a hotel, a restaurant and a newly constructed cricket pavilion, and would be able to accommodate 2,500 fans. The redevelopments also included the construction of a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> adjacent to the stadium. Other planned improvements include a new club superstore and other retail outlets, and new business offices {{on the site of the}} current club shop. Revealed in the fifth phase was a transformation of the Bob Lord Stand, which will eventually house a multi-screen cinema. The development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was later revealed by Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher, taking the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor to 28,000 spectators.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} team {{proposed the}} realignment of Baxtergate {{to a position}} alongside {{the bank of the}} River Freshney and Hammersons were encouraged to extend the shopping centre to the new alignment of the road, building two <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> one {{at each end of the}} development, to replace the surface level parking. The deal that was eventually approved by the Council, provided for the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> to be handed over to the Council for operation on completion so that the public <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> provision in the town centre could be co-ordinated. Subsequently, at the time that the payment for the area of the surface was due, Hammersons negotiated the retention of the <b>cars</b> <b>parking</b> under their control.|$|R
50|$|The term {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} minimum size of road tunnels and bridges, as well as doors into {{automobile}} repair shops, bus garages, filling stations, residential garages, <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and warehouses.|$|R
25|$|Phase 3 {{began in}} early 2016 on {{expanding}} the train station's <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> To {{be completed by}} December 2016, the car park will increase in capacity from 450 to over 800 spaces. The expansion of the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> will include a new cycle and motorcycle parking, short stay parking, passenger drop off point and a taxi rank adjacent to the car park. A new entrance will be created.|$|E
25|$|The first {{parts of}} the {{development}} to be completed were the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on Liver Street, and the bus station on Canning Place.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} a taxi rank, drop-off/pick-up point, and short- and long-stay car parks {{accessible}} from Fairfield Street. The long-stay <b>multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> {{is at the}} rear of the station.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} skyscrapers is <b>car</b> <b>parking.</b> In the largest cities most people commute via public transport, but for smaller cities {{a lot of}} parking spaces are needed. <b>Multi-storey</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{impractical}} to build very tall, {{so a lot of}} land area is needed.|$|R
