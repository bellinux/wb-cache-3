5|$|Beetles are {{the most}} widely eaten insects, with about 344 species used as food, usually at the larval stage. The <b>mealworm</b> (the larva of the darkling beetle) and the {{rhinoceros}} beetle are among the species commonly eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} meat ants {{depends on what}} {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with <b>mealworm</b> baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), <b>mealworm</b> larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mealworms</b> have {{generally}} been considered pests, because their larvae feed on stored grains. <b>Mealworms</b> probably originated in the Mediterranean region, but are now present {{in many areas of}} the world, spread by human trade and colonization. The oldest archaeological records of <b>mealworms</b> as human pests can be traced to Bronze Age Turkey. Records from the British Isles and northern Europe are from a later date, and <b>mealworms</b> are conspicuously absent from archaeological finds from ancient Egypt.|$|R
50|$|The larvae, like {{certain other}} <b>mealworms,</b> are fed to captive reptiles. As pet food {{they have been}} called buffalo worms and lesser <b>mealworms.</b> They have been {{reported}} as a good first food for Central American wood turtle (Rhinoclemmys pulcherrima mannii) hatchlings, {{because they are more}} active than common <b>mealworms</b> and their movement stimulates feeding behavior.|$|R
50|$|The diet studied was to {{determine}} if a spacecrew could subsist on a high protein diet with vegetation and <b>mealworms.</b> The <b>mealworms,</b> composed of 3/4 protein, were chosen due to a United Nations study recommending it as a foodsource for the poor and undernourished of the world; however, it has met with resistance when tried with Western astronauts. They also have a tendency to escape their farming environments. Growing <b>mealworms</b> the size of fingers took mere weeks. The <b>mealworms</b> were fed the leftover and inedible parts of the vegetative produce that was harvested.|$|R
25|$|In the Western world, {{agricultural}} technology {{companies such as}} Tiny Farms have been founded {{with the aim of}} modernizing insect rearing techniques, permitting the scale and efficiency gains required for insects to displace other animal proteins in the human food supply. The first domestic insect farm, LIVIN Farms Hive, has recently been successfully Kickstarted and will allow for the production of 200-500g of <b>mealworm</b> per week, a step toward a more distributed domestic production system.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Nathanson {{reported}} {{an effect of}} methylxanthines on larvae of the tobacco hornworm. He administered solutions of finely powdered tea leaves or coffee beans to the larvae and observed, at concentrations between 0.3 and 10% for coffee and 0.1 to 3% for tea, inhibition of feeding, associated with hyperactivity and tremor. At higher concentrations, larvae were killed within 24 hours. He repeated the experiments with purified caffeine {{and concluded that the}} drug was responsible for the effect, and the concentration differences between coffee beans and tea leaves originated from 2–3 times higher caffeine content in the latter. Similar action was observed for IBMX on mosquito larvae, <b>mealworm</b> larvae, butterfly larvae and milkweed bug nymphs, that is, inhibition of feeding and death at higher doses. Flour beetles were unaffected by IBMX up to 3% concentrations, but long-term experiments revealed suppression of reproductive activity.|$|E
500|$|Martin Stevens {{and colleagues}} in 2006 made what they {{believed}} was the first experimental test that [...] "disruptive coloration is effective even when some colour patches do not match the background and have a high contrast with both the background and adjacent pattern elements (disruptive contrast)". They used [...] "moth-like targets", some matching the lightness of the background oak tree bark, other mismatching it, each with a dead <b>mealworm.</b> If the <b>mealworm</b> was removed it was assumed a bird predator had taken it: this could be distinguished from visits by other predators. They found that disruptive coloration provided the best protection from bird predators when the pattern was matched to background luminance, but even when elements in a pattern did not match, disruptive patterns were still better at reducing predation than either non-disruptive patterns or plain (unpatterned) control targets.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mealworms</b> are {{new food}} {{products}} in Europe, but consumers {{do not know how}} to cook them. Although cooking could increase the safety, acceptability, palatability, and digestibility of insects, the heating process could have deleterious effects on protein and lipid quality. Therefore, this study characterized the effects of different household cooking methods (boiling, pan-frying, vacuum cooking, and oven cooking) on the microbial load and nutritive value of <b>mealworms,</b> with a focus on protein digestibility and fatty acid composition. Boiling and cooking under vacuum were the most efficient techniques to reduce microbial load while maintaining the high levels of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids of <b>mealworms.</b> Cooking method-related changes were very low on macronutrients content except for pan-fried <b>mealworms</b> which exhibited the highest lipid content. Cooking slightly changed fatty acid composition of <b>mealworms</b> by principally decreasing their level of saturated fatty acids but also increased the in vitro crude protein digestibility of <b>mealworms.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|In 2015, it was {{discovered}} that <b>mealworms</b> are capable of degrading polystyrene into usable organic matter {{at a rate of about}} 34-39 milligrams per day. Additionally, no difference was found between <b>mealworms</b> fed only styrofoam and <b>mealworms</b> fed conventional foods, during the one-month duration of the experiment. The mechanism behind this is currently unknown, and no attempts to commercialize this discovery have been made.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mealworms</b> {{have been}} {{incorporated}} into tequila-flavored novelty candies. <b>Mealworms</b> are not traditionally served in tequila, and the [...] "tequila worm" [...] in certain mezcals is usually the larva of the moth Hypopta agavis.|$|R
500|$|At first, the {{production}} company {{planned to use}} snakes in latex suits for the worms; when this proved impossible, <b>mealworm</b> larvae were used. The effect of the worms crawling in the host bodies was achieved with wires under fake skins, including a skin with hair for the dog. Digital effects were used for scenes involving the worms swimming in jars and entering the dog's ear. Although extra footage of the worm scenes was shot so they would {{last as long as}} intended if Fox's standards-and-practices officials asked for cuts, no edits were requested. [...] "Ice" [...] was the first significant role in the series for makeup effects artist Toby Lindala, who become its chief makeup artist. The dog used in the episode was a parent of Duchovny's dog, Blue. Ken Kirzinger, who played one of the scientists killed in the episode's cold open, was the series' stunt coordinator.|$|E
500|$|All {{insects are}} poikilothermic, so {{the ability of}} a few beetles to live in extreme environments depends on their {{resilience}} to unusually high or low temperatures. The bark beetle Pityogenes chalcographus can survive [...] whilst overwintering beneath tree bark; the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus is able to withstand its larvae may survive [...] At these low temperatures, the formation of ice crystals in internal fluids is the biggest threat to survival to beetles, but this is prevented through the production of antifreeze proteins that stop water molecules from grouping together. The low temperatures experienced by Cucujus clavipes can be survived through their deliberate dehydration in conjunction with the antifreeze proteins. This concentrates the antifreezes several fold. The hemolymph of the <b>mealworm</b> beetle Tenebrio molitor contains several antifreeze proteins. The Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides can survive −60°C: its cryoprotectants are xylomannan, a molecule consisting of a sugar bound to a fatty acid, and the sugar-alcohol, threitol.|$|E
2500|$|Familiar worms {{include the}} earthworms, members of phylum Annelida. Other {{invertebrate}} groups {{may be called}} worms, especially colloquially. In particular, many unrelated insect larvae are called [...] "worms", such as the railroad worm, woodworm, glowworm, bloodworm, inchworm, <b>mealworm,</b> silkworm, and wooly bear worm.|$|E
50|$|Tenebrioninae are {{eaten by}} large {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, such as birds, rodents, and lizards. The larval stages of several species are cultured as feeder insects for captive insectivores, and include <b>mealworms</b> and mini <b>mealworms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Some experimenters {{wanted to}} test the {{response}} of <b>mealworms</b> to light and moisture. To do this they set up four boxes {{as shown in the}} diagram below. They used lamps for light sources and constantly watered pieces of paper in the boxes for moisture. In the center of each box they placed 20 <b>mealworms.</b> One day later they returned to count the number of <b>mealworms</b> that had crawled to the different ends of the boxes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Mealworms</b> are edible for humans. Baked or fried <b>mealworms</b> are {{marketed as}} a healthy snack food. They may be easily reared on fresh oats, wheat bran or grain, with sliced potato, carrots, or apple as a {{moisture}} source.|$|R
2500|$|The Y {{chromosome}} {{was identified}} as a sex-determining chromosome by Nettie Stevens at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 during a study of the <b>mealworm</b> Tenebrio molitor. Edmund Beecher Wilson independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by Hermann Henking. She realized that the previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to {{the presence or absence of}} the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome [...] "Y" [...] simply to follow on from Henking's [...] "X" [...] alphabetically.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mealworms</b> are {{typically}} {{used as a}} pet food for captive reptiles, fish, and birds. They are also provided to wild birds in bird feeders, particularly during the nesting season. <b>Mealworms</b> are useful for their high protein content. They are also used as fishing bait.|$|R
50|$|Mini <b>mealworms</b> would {{probably}} remain largely unknown, {{if not for}} the reptile pet industry. In the search for easy to raise insects to use as food for captive reptiles and amphibians, mini <b>mealworms</b> have recently attracted interest as an ideal food item for smaller species.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the whole-body crude nutrient (fat, protein, ash) and mineral (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K) composition of mustached bats {{of three different}} groups: animals from the wild (n = 6), and animals from captivity on an unsupplemented feeding regime of <b>mealworms</b> (n = 7), and on a feeding regime in which the <b>mealworms</b> were kept on a mineral substrate prior to feeding (n = 6). It was shown that <b>mealworms</b> from the mineral substrate had higher Ca contents than <b>mealworms</b> from the conventional substrates. In an earlier study, differences in bone mineral density had been found between the groups. These differences, however, were not reflected in differences in whole-body composition. Captive animals showed a larger variation in body weight and fat content, indicating potential shortcomings of the dietary and husbandry regime...|$|R

40|$|Pesticides {{are known}} to affect insects {{metabolic}} rate and CO 2 release patterns. In the presented paper metabolic rate and mortality of <b>mealworms</b> Tenebrio molitor L. exposed to four different insecticides was evaluated, {{to find out whether}} there is a relationship between <b>mealworms</b> sensitivity to pesticides and their metabolic rate. Tenebrio molitor mortality was determined after intoxication with pyrethroid, oxadiazine, neonicotinoid and organophosphate. Metabolic rate before and after intoxication with insecticides was also determined. The highest CO 2 production and mortality rate was observed after <b>mealworms</b> exposition to neonicotinoid insecticide. The results suggest that high CO 2 release after intoxication is adequate to the intensity of the non-specific action of the xenobiotic (e. g. hyperactivity of neuromuscular system), rather than the intensity of detoxification processes, and it is correlated with <b>mealworms</b> mortality...|$|R
