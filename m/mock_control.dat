The present study was purposed to develop a tumor cell-based cancer vaccine by genetically modifying oral squamous cell cancer cell line Tca 8113 with human B 7 -H 3 immunoglobulin, and evaluate its efficacy on enhancing the tumor specific immune response. METHODS: T lymphocytes were isolated from nine healthy volunteers. The human B 7 -H 3 gene was extracted from the isolated T lymphocytes. Tumor cell vaccine TCV-hB 7 -H 3 and the <b>mock</b> <b>control</b> were prepared by transfecting Tca 8113 cells with B 7 -H 3 or mock vector. The expression of B 7 -H 3 in Tca 8113, <b>mock</b> <b>control</b> cells and tumor cell vaccine TCV-hB 7 -H 3 was assayed respectively by flow cytomentry, RT-PCR and Western blot. After being stimulated with TCV-hB 7 -H 3 or <b>mock</b> <b>control,</b> the proliferation, IFN-g expression and cytotoxicity of the T cells were assessed. Results: The expression of B 7 -H 3 was not detected in the tumor cell TCa 8113 and <b>mock</b> <b>control,</b> but in the cell vaccine TCV-hB 7 -H 3.

40|$|Abstract Background Chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) {{has been}} widely used to {{investigate}} the DNA binding sites {{for a variety of}} proteins on a genome-wide scale. However, several issues in the processing and analysis of ChIP-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background (<b>mock</b> <b>control)</b> subtraction and normalization within and across arrays. Results The binding profiles of Drosophila male-specific lethal (MSL) complex on a tiling array provide a unique opportunity for investigating these topics, as it is known to bind on the X chromosome but not on the autosomes. These large bound and control regions on the same array allow clear evaluation of analytical methods. We introduce a novel normalization scheme specifically designed for ChIP-chip data from dual-channel arrays and demonstrate that this step is critical for correcting systematic dye-bias that may exist in the data. Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates. The idea underlying the normalization can be used subsequently to estimate the background noise level in each array for normalization across arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods with the MSL complex binding data and other publicly available data. Conclusion Proper normalization is essential for ChIP-chip experiments. The proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of <b>mock</b> <b>control</b> data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results. </p...|$|E

We investigated post-transcriptional mechanisms of GPx 4 expression regulation and found that the guanine-rich sequence-binding factor 1 (Grsf 1) up-regulates GPx 4 expression. Grsf 1 binds to a defined target sequence in the 5 ′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mitochondrial GPx 4 (m-GPx 4) mRNA, up-regulates UTR-dependent reporter gene expression, recruits m-GPx 4 mRNA to translationally active polysome fractions, and coimmunoprecipitates with GPx 4 mRNA.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [99]- 103) Beet Curly Top Virus (BCTV) is a geminivirus causing serious {{losses in}} crop yield in the Southwestern U. S. BCTV is spread by a leafhopper insect vector {{and has a}} wide dicot host range, spreading systemically via phloem tissue. Earlier work indicated that BCTV infection may indirectly damage phloem tissue; however, its effects on sucrose translocation in the plant have not been examined before. Our {{research has focused on}} the effect of BCTV infection on photosynthesis and carbon allocation in sugarbeet plants. We have worked with two varieties of sugarbeet, Z- 10 and 9 BB 6090, as well as two viral strains, Logan and CFH, and a <b>Mock</b> <b>control.</b> Ten weeks after infection we found that photosynthetic rates were lower in plants infected with BCTV Logan when compared to <b>Mock</b> <b>control</b> plants. Lower photosynthetic rates were associated with decreased chlorophyll levels as well as reduced activity of RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), the primary CO 2 fixing enzyme. The Z- 10 variety showed lower Rubisco activity overall when compared to the 9 BB 6090 sugarbeet variety, which is more resistant to the virus. BCTV infection caused changes in assimilate partitioning, illustrated by dramatically higher sucrose levels in the 9 BB 6090 Logan-infected plant. Corresponding free glucose levels were also higher for Logan-infected plants of both varieties. Because of the seven-fold sucrose increase in Logan-infected plants, we investigated the ability of BCTV-infected plants to translocate exogeneously supplied 14 C-sucrose. The results showed that Z- 10 BCTV-infected plants transported less sucrose into the petiole. The high levels of sucrose in BCTV-infected leaves were associated with reduced cytoplasmic fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase) activity in BCTV Logan and BCTV CFH infected plants for both varieties. Chloroplastic FBPase activity was only reduced in the Z- 10 variety. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) rates did not show any significant change in Mock-control plants or BCTV-infected plants. We propose that the damage to phloem tissue caused by BCTV infection reduces the transport of sucrose. The resulting buildup of sucrose and glucose may result in feedback effects causing down-regulation of genes encoding chlorophyll and Rubisco subunits levels and certain sucrose-producing enzymes. M.

40|$|In {{compatible}} interactions, biotrophic microbial phytopathogens rely on {{the supply}} of assimilates by the colonized host tissue. It {{has been found in}} rice that phloem localized SWEET sucrose transporters can be reprogrammed by bacterial effectors to establish compatibility. We observed that sweet 11 /sweet 12 double mutants, but not single mutants, exhibited increased resistance toward the fungal hemibiotroph Colletotrichum higginsianum (Ch), both in the biotrophic and the necrotrophic colonization phase. We therefore investigated if the phloem localized transporters AtSWEET 11 and AtSWEET 12 represent additive susceptibility factors in the interaction of Arabidopsis with Ch. AtSWEET 12 -YFP fusion protein driven by the endogenous promoter strongly accumulated at Ch infection sites and in the vasculature upon challenge with Ch. However, susceptibility of sweet 12 single mutants to Ch was comparable to wild type, indicating that the accumulation of AtSWEET 12 at Ch infection sites does not play a major role for compatibility. AtSWEET 12 -YFP reporter protein was not detectable at the plant–pathogen interface, suggesting that AtSWEET 12 is not targeted by Ch effectors. AtSWEET 11 -YFP accumulation in pAtSWEET 11 :AtSWEET 11 -YFP plants were similar in Ch infected and <b>mock</b> <b>control</b> leaves. A close inspection of major carbohydrate metabolism in non-infected control plants revealed that soluble sugar and starch content were substantially elevated in sweet 11 /sweet 12 double mutants during the entire diurnal cycle, that diurnal soluble sugar turnover was increased more than twofold in sweet 11 /sweet 12, and that accumulation of free hexoses and sucrose was strongly expedited in double mutant leaves compared to wild type and both single mutants during the course of Ch infection. After 2 days of treatment, free and conjugated SA levels were significantly increased in infected and <b>mock</b> <b>control</b> leaves of sweet 11 /sweet 12 relative to all other genotypes, respectively. Induced genes in mock treated sweet 11 /sweet 12 leaves were highly significantly enriched for several GO terms associated with SA signaling and response compared to mock treated wild-type leaves, indicating sugar-mediated priming of the SA pathway in the double mutant. Infection assays with salicylic acid deficient sweet 11 /sweet 12 /sid 2 triple mutants demonstrated that reduced susceptibility observed in sweet 11 /sweet 12 was entirely dependent on the SA pathway. We suggest a model how defects in phloem loading of sucrose can influence SA priming and hence, compatibility...|$|E
40|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} forms of cancer affecting males worldwide, and knowledge of the immune defenses involved in PCa remains incomplete. Since the identification of immunity-related genes may have enormous implications for the understanding of PCa immunology, we recently reported the identification of immunity-related genes in PCa tissues and found potential binding sites for the ETS family prototype, ETS- 1, in the majority of genes identified. Therefore, as a continuation of our previous study, we investigated whether ETS- 1 regulates these genes in an in vitro PCa cell line model, PC 3 cells. We specifically blocked ETS- 1 in PC 3 cells by transfection with an ETS- 1 inverse antisense expression vector or a <b>mock</b> <b>control</b> vector. We then assessed the effect of the blockade on the expression of the recently identified PCa immunity-related genes using a comprehensive oligo gene expression microarray analysis. The results showed that ETS- 1 is involved in the activation or repression of the recently identified immunity-related genes in PCa. These findings provide insights into the regulation of immunity-related genes in PCa, and emphasize the importance of ETS- 1 in prostate cancer immunology...|$|E
40|$|We had {{repeatedly}} found ≈ 25 -nm-diameter virus-like particles in highly infectious brain fractions with little prion protein (PrP), {{and therefore we}} searched for similar virus-like particles in situ in infected cell lines with high titers. Neuroblastoma cells infected with the 22 L strain of scrapie as well as hypothalamic GT cells infected with the FU Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease agent, but not parallel <b>mock</b> <b>controls,</b> displayed dense 25 -nm virus-like particles in orthogonal arrays. These particles had no relation to abnormal PrP amyloid in situ, nor were they labeled by PrP antibodies that faithfully recognized rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes and amyloid fibrils, the predicted sites of normal and pathological intracellular PrP. Additionally, phorbol ester stimulated the production of abnormal PrP gel bands by > 5 -fold in infected N 2 a + 22 L cells, yet this did not increase either the number of virus-like arrays or the infectious titer of these cells. Thus, the 25 -nm infection-associated particles could not be prions. Synaptic differentiation and neurodegeneration, as well as retroviruses that populate the rough endoplasmic reticulum of neuroblastoma cells, were not required for particle production. The 25 -nm particle arrays in cultured cells strongly resembled those first described in 1968 in synaptic regions of scrapie-infected brain and subsequently identified in many natural and experimental TSEs. The high infectivity of comparable, isolated virus-like particles that show no intrinsic PrP by antibody labeling, combined with their loss of infectivity when nucleic acid–protein complexes are disrupted, make it likely that these 25 -nm particles are the causal TSE virions that induce late-stage PrP brain pathology...|$|R
40|$|The {{basidiomycete}} Ustilago maydis is {{the causal}} agent of corn smut disease and induces tumor formation during biotrophic growth in its host maize (Zea mays). We have conducted a combined metabolome and transcriptome survey of infected leaves between 1 d post infection (dpi) and 8 dpi, representing infected leaf primordia and fully developed tumors, respectively. At 4 and 8 dpi, we observed {{a substantial increase}} in contents of the nitrogen-rich amino acids glutamine and asparagine, while the activities of enzymes involved in primary nitrogen assimilation and the content of ammonia and nitrate were reduced by 50 % in tumors compared with <b>mock</b> <b>controls.</b> Employing stable isotope labeling, we could demonstrate that U. maydis-induced tumors show a reduced assimilation of soil-derived 15 NO 3 − and represent strong sinks for nitrogen. Specific labeling of the free amino acid pool of systemic source leaves with [15 N]urea revealed an increased import of organic nitrogen from systemic leaves to tumor tissue, indicating that organic nitrogen provision supports the formation of U. maydis-induced tumors. In turn, amino acid export from systemic source leaves was doubled in infected plants. The analysis of the phloem amino acid pool revealed that glutamine and asparagine are not transported to the tumor tissue, although these two amino acids were found to accumulate within the tumor. Photosynthesis was increased and senescence was delayed in systemic source leaves upon tumor development on infected plants, indicating that the elevated sink demand for nitrogen could determine photosynthetic rates in source leaves...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{explosion}} in genomic sequencing has made available {{a wealth of}} data that can now be analyzed to identify protein antigens, potential targets for vaccine development. Here we present, {{in the context of}} Plasmodium falciparum, a strategy that rapidly identifies target antigens from large and complex genomes. Sixteen antigenic proteins recognized by volunteers immunized with radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites, but not by <b>mock</b> immunized <b>controls,</b> were identified. Several of these were more antigenic than previously identified and well characterized P. falciparum-derived protein antigens. The data suggest that immune responses to Plasmodium are dispersed on a relatively large number of parasite antigens. These studies have implications for our understanding of immunodominance and breadth of responses to complex pathogens...|$|R
