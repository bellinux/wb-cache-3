50|$|The spool {{position}} may be actuated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers,</b> hydraulic pilot pressure, or solenoids which {{push the}} spool left or right. A seal allows {{part of the}} spool to protrude outside the housing, where it is accessible to the actuator.|$|R
25|$|In computing, a {{computer}} keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses {{an arrangement of}} buttons or keys {{to act as a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lever</b> or electronic switch.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, the United Kingdom {{network was}} host to over ten {{thousand}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lever</b> signalboxes. When British Rail was created from the Big Four private railway companies under the Transport Act 1947, they began to install power signal boxes (PSB) at strategic locations such as Euston, Crewe, Doncaster, Rugby and Carlisle. The PSBs would remove the necessity for lots of individual boxes along a particular route and would pass control to one centralized location. Carlisle's PSB took over the responsibility of 44 signal boxes alone in the north west area.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload. [...] The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot {{does not have to}} maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitude (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). [...] Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lever</b> or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. [...] Other secondary flight control systems may be available, including slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings.|$|E
30|$|These cabins execute {{switches}} and signals through <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers</b> which {{are connected to}} these elements via steel wires.

These cabins are the middle men which the proposed software based automated interlocking system design aims to remove.|$|R

25|$|The bridge {{initiating}} {{equipment is}} controlled by a system of hydraulic cylinders; the allocation of hydraulic oil can be controlled both manually by <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers</b> and automatically.

50|$|Interlockings {{operated}} {{solely by}} electrical circuitry may be operated locally or remotely, {{with the large}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers</b> of previous systems being replaced by buttons, switches or toggles on a panel or video interface. Such an interlocking may also be designed to operate without a human operator. These arrangements are termed automatic interlockings, and the approach of a train sets its own route automatically, provided no conflicting movements are in progress.|$|R

50|$|The modern suanpan has 4+1 beads, colored beads to {{indicate}} position and a clear-all button. When the clear-all button is pressed, two <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers</b> push the top row beads {{to the top}} position and the bottom row beads to the bottom position, thus clearing all numbers to zero. This replaces clearing the beads by hand, or quickly rotating the suanpan around its horizontal center line to clear the beads by centrifugal force.|$|R
50|$|Chord Master (also {{rendered}} Visual Chord Master, chordmaster) is the brand-name for {{a type of}} automated chording device {{produced for}} the ukulele. Competing products were sold under labels such as Noteless Player by Ferry & Co.. These devices allowed a ukulele player to easily play chords simply by choosing the mechanical button on the device labeled for the desired chord, and depressing it, causing <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers</b> to fret each string at the proper place to compose a chord.|$|R

50|$|A direct {{displacement}} control pump {{is a kind}} of axial piston pump with a direct {{displacement control}}.A direct displacement control uses a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lever</b> attached to the swashplate of the axial piston pump. Higher system pressures require more force to move that lever, making direct displacement control only suitable for light or medium duty pumps. Heavy duty pumps require servo control.|$|E
50|$|The station {{includes}} a historic signal box, {{which was built}} in 1869. This allowed the route to be set by means of <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers.</b> It is located opposite the entrance building near the Neckar. The building is no longer used for railway operations, but is heritage-listed. During the garden show, the pedestrian underpass that once connected the entrance building with Neckarstraße was shortened. It now extends only {{to the rear of}} the second platform and the signal box, which was secured with a new base.|$|R

50|$|The EF mount replaces its predecessor, the FD mount.The {{standard}} autofocus lens mounting {{technology of}} the time used a motor in the camera body to drive {{the mechanics of the}} focus helicoid in the lens by using a transfer lever. The key innovation of the EF series was to use a motor inside the lens itself for focusing. This allowed for autofocusing lenses which did not require <b>mechanical</b> <b>levers</b> in the mount mechanism, only electrical contacts to supply power and instructions to the lens motor. The motors were designed for the particular lens they were installed in.|$|R
