40|$|Abstract The {{automotive}} industry is increasingly using adhesive joints bonding advanced lightweight materials to reduce vehicle weight. Strength under impact loadings {{is a major}} concern for this application and <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints can effectively improve the joints by combining stiffness and flexibility on the same overlap. This work introduces and studies several configurations for static and impact tests of <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints with four adhesives in different combinations. The main purpose of this work is the development of a strong adhesive joint using a <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> layer and perform a series of mechanical to study its mechanical behaviour. It is concluded that the use of the <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> technique improves both static and impact strength by introducing flexibility to the joint which subsequently allows more energy absorption when introduced in crash resistant structures...|$|E

In this work, the potential of the technique is analysed for a single lap joint using the mixing adhesives approach. In order to include the compaction process effect in the structural analysis during the joint assembly, a computational fluid-dynamic model capable of integrating different resins along the bondline has been developed. Then, the results obtained from this model are mapped into a finite element model through an application developed for this purpose. Several parametric studies have been carried out comparing different configurations in terms of maximum load capacity of the joints.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a polyalkenoic acid {{conditioner}} pretreatment on the bond strength of a glass-ionomer adhesive to tooth substrates with or without smear layer was evaluated. Smear-layer covered and smear-layer free dentin and enamel surfaces were prepared from 24 extracted human molars. Resin composite was bonded to the surfaces using FujiBond LC {{with or without a}} polyalkenoic acid conditioner and subjected to microtensile bond strength (microTBS) testing. Failure modes were determined using scanning electron microscopy. For dentin, smear-layer coverage and conditioner treatment did not reveal significant differences in microTBS, which ranged from 20 to 29 MPa. For enamel, smear-layer coverage did not significantly affect microTBS, whereas, the use of conditioner significantly improved microTBS, reaching the same microTBS-values as when bonded to dentin. Regarding failure mode, most dentin specimens failed <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> cohesively. For enamel, adhesive failures mostly occurred when no conditioner was used, though mixed failures were predominant when the specimens were conditioned beforehand. Bonding of the glass ionomer adhesive to dentin can be achieved without the separate use of a polyalkenoic acid conditioner, even with the interposition of a smear layer. However, instrumented and non-instrumented enamel requires separate conditioning to provide sufficient micro-mechanical retention. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out with the aim of determining the tribological behavior of a VPS chromium carbide coating both in the as-deposited and heat-treated conditions. A commercial powder of Cr 2 C 3 – 25 % NiCr was sprayed employing a VPS system (Medicoat AG, Switzerland) onto plain low carbon steel coupons. The samples were subsequently annealed for 2 h at 600 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C in Ar. The microstructural characterization was carried out by using SEM and XRD before and after the heat treatment of the samples. SEM observations were employed for determining the degradation mechanisms that took place during the wear tests. When the coated systems rubbed against alumina under a 5 N normal load in air, a progressive change in the mechanism, from a <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> and abrasive, to a predominant abrasive was observed, as the heat treatment temperature increased. The wear constants were found to be of the order of approximately 10 − 6 mm 3 /N. m, which indicates a wear resistance of nearly 4 times higher in comparison with the wear results reported in the literature for similar coating systems obtained by employing HVOF deposition. However, the heat treatment carried out at 900 °C brought about only 20 % increase in the sliding wear resistance of the coated system...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} the null hypothesis {{that there is no}} difference between the effect of a one versus two-layer applications of Prompt L-Pop (3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) to sound, abraded human coronal dentine. Methods. In group I, the <b>mixed</b> <b>adhesive</b> was applied for 15 s, and light-cured for 10 s. In group II, after light-curing the first layer, the adhesive was re-applied and light-cured. Specimens bonded with a hybrid composite were sectioned into beams for microtensile bond strength evaluation. Additional teeth from each group were bonded similarly using a lining composite for transmission electron microscopy examination of the resin–dentine interfaces, and nanoleakage evaluation using ammoniacal silver nitrate. Results. A significant difference (p, 0. 001) was detected between microtensile bond strengths in the two groups. Stained, demineralized sections revealed 3 – 5 mm thick hybrid layers in both groups. An electron-lucent layer between 7 and 20 mm thick was present between the adhesive and the overlying composite. This layer was absent from the interfaces after removal with ethanol before composite placement. The use of a single application in group I resulted in the direct contact of the electron-lucent layer with the dentine surface and tubular orifices. In unstained, undemineralized sections used to evaluate nanoleakage, silver deposits were found mostly in the hybrid layer in group II, but throughout the entire adhesive layer in group I.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the micro-tensile bond strength (muTBS) of an adhesive luting agent to CAD-CAM ceramic. The hypothesis tested was that neither of the surface treatments would produce higher bond strength of the adhesive luting agent to CAD-CAM ceramic. METHODS: Ceramic specimens of two different sizes (6 mmx 8 mmx 3 mm; 13 mmx 8 mmx 4 mm) were fabricated from ProCAD ceramic blocs (Ivoclar-Vivadent) with a low-speed diamond saw. The ceramic blocks were divided into seven groups and submitted to the following surface treatments: group 1 : no treatment; group 2 : etching with 37 % H(3) PO(4); group 3 : etching with 37 % H(3) PO(4) +silane; group 4 : etching with 37 % H(3) PO(4) +silane+adhesive resin; group 5 : etching with 4. 9 % HF acid; group 6 : etching with 4. 9 % HF acid+silane; group 7 : etching with HF acid+silane+adhesive resin. After surface treatment, two differently sized porcelain disks were bonded together with a composite luting agent (Variolink II, Ivoclar-Vivadent). The specimens were stored for 24 h in distilled water at 37 degrees C prior to muTBS testing. One-way analysis of variance was used to test the influence of surface treatment and Scheffe multiple comparisons test determined pair-wise statistical differences (p< 0. 05) in muTBS between the experimental groups. RESULTS: The mean muTBSs (standard deviation) are: group 1 : 12. 8 (+/- 4. 6) MPa; group 2 : 19. 1 (+/- 5. 0) MPa; group 3 : 27. 4 (+/- 11. 1) MPa; group 4 : 34. 0 (+/- 8. 9) MPa; group 5 : 37. 6 (+/- 8. 4) MPa; group 6 : 34. 6 (+/- 12. 8) MPa; group 7 : 34. 5 (+/- 5. 1) MPa. Statistical significant differences were found between group 1 and groups 3 - 7, and between group 2 and groups 4 - 7. All specimens of groups 1 - 4 exhibited adhesive failures, while a combination of adhesive and <b>mixed</b> (<b>adhesive</b> and cohesive) failures was observed in the specimens of groups 5 - 7.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of three {{different}} drills used for post space preparation on fiber post retention after Reciproc endodontic treatment. Methods: 30 human upper incisors were endodontically treated using Reciproc and warm vertical gutta-percha compaction. Teeth were sealed coronally using Fuji VII, then stored in 0. 5 % T chloramine solution at 4 degrees C. After 1 week, teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups (n= 10) that differed for the drill type used for post space preparation: Group 1 : Calibrated drill; Group 2 : Largo drill; Group 3 : MTwo drill. Illusion posts were luted into the root canals using Gradia Core. After 24 hours, posted roots were transversally cut into 1 mm-thick slices for thin-slice post push-out testing. Two slices per apical, middle, and coronal thirds were obtained, resulting in a total of 6 slices per tooth. Thin-slice push-out test was conducted using a universal testing machine. Post push-out strength was measured in MPa. For the fracture analysis, the specimens were observed using a stereomicroscope at x 40 magnification and classified as adhesive [between post-cement (P-C) or dentin-cement (D-C) interface], cohesive (within the post or adhesive cement) and <b>mixed</b> (<b>adhesive</b> and cohesive fractures occurred simultaneously). Between-group differences in post retentive strength were statistically analyzed (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Dunn's Multiple Range test, P > 0. 05). Differences in push-out strength among root levels within each group (one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, depending on the normality of data distribution, P > 0. 05) and in failure mode distribution were also statistically evaluated (Fisher's Exact Test, P > 0. 05). Results: For each group the mean of MPa values was: (1) 10. 41 +/- 3. 56, (2) 10. 98 +/- 3. 96, and (3) 12. 11 +/- 1. 65. Failure mode was distributed as follows: Adhesive: (1) P-C - 23. 3 %, D-C - 21. 7 %; (2) P-C - 20 %, D-C 10 %; (3) P-C 46. 7 %, D-C 13. 3 %; Cohesive: (1) 0. 0 %, (2) 3. 3 %; (3) 0. 0 %; Mixed: (1) 55. 0 %; (2) 66. 7 %; (3) 40. 0 %.

Vita Titankeramik porcelain was applied for all groups and built up manually with dimensions limited to 8 x 3 x 1 mm and fired on Ti bars following the manufacturer’s instructions and ISO 9693 recommendations, and tested for bond strength by Schwickerath crack initiation test (ISO 9693) using an Instron universal testing machine (Model: 5566 A). The mode of failure and bond interface were evaluated by SEM / EDS. RESULTS: The mean bond strength values of groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were 2. 31 MPa (± 0. 2), 24. 3 MPa (± 0. 78), 46. 94 MPa (± 1. 29), 6. 18 MPa (± 0. 98), 9. 46 MPa (± 1. 08), 15. 14 MPa (± 0. 74), 24. 84 MPa (± 1. 73), 36. 24 MPa (± 1. 43), 41. 49 MPa (± 2. 13), 49. 45 MPa (± 0. 96), 69. 36 MPa (± 0. 96), 94. 45 MPa (± 1. 51), respectively. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test was performed to determine the groups that are statistically different. All tested groups (1 - 12) showed statistically significant difference except groups 2, and 7, P< 0. 05. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1 - Surface finish significantly affects the bond strength of low fusing porcelain to Ti grade V. 2 - Larger Al 2 O 3 particle size corresponded to higher bond strengths. 3 - Sandblasting in combination with Au or TiN coatings produced the highest bond strength values. 4 - Groups 1, 4, 5, & 6 showed Adhesive failure at the ceramic – metal interface; for groups 3, 10, 11, & 12 were found to be Cohesive failure within the porcelain layers; and for groups 2, 7, 8, & 9 were found to be <b>mixed</b> <b>Adhesive</b> / Cohesive failure. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

40|$|<b>Adhesive</b> {{particle}} <b>mixing</b> is {{a fundamental}} process in many applications, especially in dry powders for inhalation. Despite its importance, a mechanistic process description for designing the structure of interest is still lacking. Due to {{a wide array of}} the length and time scales of mechanisms governing <b>adhesive</b> <b>mixing,</b> a multi-scale approach that integrates mathematical models and experiments is a primary choice for achieving insight into such a process. To model a particulate system, balancing between the level of detail of a description and the relevant computational cost is the main challenge, {{especially in the case of}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>mixing</b> where microscopic information must be preserved. The proposed strategy to tackle this issue is (i) to isolate mechanisms governing <b>adhesive</b> <b>mixing</b> in order to investigate them independently, (ii) to evaluate their contributions to the mixing process, and (iii) to integrate those mechanisms into a mechanistic description. There are four mechanisms that govern adhesive mixing; (1) random mixing at the macro-scale level, (2) de-agglomeration at the meso-scale level, (3) adhesion, and (4) the redistribution of fines between carrier particles at the micro-scale level. CFD simulations of transient macroscopic flow show that in a high-shear mixer, the timescales of flow development and of random mixing are of the same order of magnitude. DEM simulations were used to study microscopic particle – particle interactions that demonstrate that the relative velocity and interface energies between particles have significant and predictable impacts on the microscopic structure of a mixture. By coupling mathematical models with experimental techniques, it was found that the mesoscopic de-agglomeration is the rate-limiting mechanism to achieve an adhesive mixture. A regime map relating particle properties and processing conditions to the structure of a mixture was constructed using dimensionless numbers, which serves as a predictive tool for designing adhesive mixtures. This research demonstrates that it is feasible to build a mechanistic relationship between particle properties, macroscopic particulate flow, and the microscopic structure of interest to transform the trial-and-error approach in process and product development to a more mechanistic strategy...|$|R

The load capacity of an adhesive bonding is determined by the cohesive and adhesive properties of the adhesives and the interaction between substrate and adhesive. The bond forces between the surface of the substrate and the adhesive are mostly based on auxiliary valence bonds, more seldom on valence bonds. The adhesion is based on a chemical bond or a mechanical clamp of the adhesives at the substrate of the surface. In the frame of some projects, lasers are used to clean the surface of technical materials, to increase the wettability and to improve the adhesion and the aging stability of bonded joints. First results show, that it is partly possible, to renounce complete the use of an additional primer and the pure laser pretreatment is enough to ensure good results. Further on it is clear, that different materials need different laser sources with different wavelength...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: For bonding {{indirect}} restorations, some 'universal' adhesives {{incorporate a}} silane coupling agent to chemically bond to glass-rich ceramics {{so that a}} separate ceramic primer is claimed to be no longer needed. With this work, we investigated the effectiveness/stability of the silane coupling function of the silanecontaining experimentally prepared adhesives and Scotchbond Universal (3 MESPE). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Experimental adhesives consisted of Scotchbond Universal and the silane-free Clearfil S 3 ND Quick (Kuraray Noritake) mixed with Clearfil Porcelain Bond Activator (Kuraray Noritake) and the two adhesives to which γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (γ-MPTS) was added. Shear bond strength was measured onto silica-glass plates; the adhesive formulations were analyzed using {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} (FTIR) and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In addition, shear bond strength onto CAD-CAM composite blocks was measured without and after thermo-cycling ageing. RESULTS: A significantly higher bond strength was recorded when Clearfil Porcelain Bond Activator was freshly <b>mixed</b> with the <b>adhesive.</b> Likewise, the experimental adhesives, to which γ-MPTS was added, revealed a significantly higher bond strength, but only when the adhesive was applied immediately after mixing; delayed application resulted in a significantly lower bond strength. FTIR and 13 C NMR revealed hydrolysis and dehydration condensation to progress with the time after γ-MPTS was mixed with the two adhesives. After thermo-cycling, the bond strength onto CAD-CAM composite blocks remained stable only for the two adhesives with which Clearfil Porcelain Bond Activator was mixed. SIGNIFICANCE: Only the silane coupling effect of freshly prepared silanecontaining adhesives was effective. Clinically, the use of a separate silane primer or silane freshly <b>mixed</b> with the <b>adhesive</b> remains recommended to bond glass-rich ceramics. status: publishe...|$|R

TiO 2 nanoparticle slurry was obtained after 50  min milling, followed by diluting the slurry with ethyl alcohol. To prepare the gel electrolyte, TBABr (806  mg, 2.5  mmol), silver nitrate (85  mg, 0.5  mmol), and copper chloride (13  mg, 0.1  mmol) were dissolved in 10  mL of DMSO, followed {{by the addition of}} PVB (1.32  g, 10  wt%). Finally, the mixed solution was placed in the dark for 24 ~ 48  h to obtain the gel electrolyte.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of failure in composite construction is through problems with secondary bonding. Preparation methods to achieve ideal conditions for secondary bonding are diverse and disputed. Although many processes have been tested and quantified by the aviation industry, procedures in the marine composite industry remain unregulated and varied. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to define a relative level of bonding integrity through testing a variation in surface preparation of composites. The effect of incorrect <b>mix</b> ratios in <b>adhesive</b> preparation is also investigated. A literature review of relevant information regarding secondary bonding techniques and related issues is made. Conclusions from the tests made and current information available is used to propose a relative superior method for preparation and application of secondary bonds in composites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In present study, {{two kinds}} of thermal power plant ashes; one the fly ash and the other waste ash are <b>mixed</b> with <b>adhesive</b> {{tragacanth}} and cement to produce new composite materials. 48 new samples are produced by varying the percentages of the fly ash, waste ash, cement and tragacanth. The new samples are subjected to some tests to find out their properties such as thermal conductivity, compressive strength, tensile strength and sucking capability of water. It is found that; the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing amount of tragacanth in the mixture. The compressive, tensile strength increases when the rate of tragacanth is up to 1 %, whilst {{as the amount of}} tragacanth increases up to 1. 5 %, the compressive, tensile strength decreases slightly. The rate of water absorption of samples was more than 30 %. From this result, it is concluded that these materials can not be used as external plaster or internal plaster material that faces to water. They can be used in internal plaster unless touching water and they can be used as cover plaster under roof and riprap material in sandwich panels. It is also found that, these materials can be cut with saw, drilled with screw and painted with any kind of paint. Keywords—Fly ash, tragacanth, cement, composite material. I...|$|R
