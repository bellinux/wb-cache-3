Semantic conceptualization can be performed at several levels of information granularity, leading to <b>multilevel</b> <b>indexing</b> and searching mechanisms. Various models at different levels of granularity are compared. At the finest level of granularity, multimedia data can be indexed based on image contents, such as identification of objects and faces. At a coarser level of granularity, indexing of multimedia data can be focused on events and episodes, which are higher level abstractions. In light of the above, we also examine modeling and indexing techniques of multimedia documents.

40|$|INTRODUCTION With the {{increase}} the computer abilities to handle image data {{the need of}} image databases increased substantially. There are different research prototypes of image databases, but commercial systems based on image content indexing are still not available. Traditionally {{there have been two}} major approaches to global image representation: th pm,ametric and the syntttctic ttpproach. In the parameffic approach image elements are represented by vectors of features (e. g., colour, size, etc.), which features can be measured from the images. In the syntactic representation the image features are represented as sets of symbolic entities, that is an alphabet of image prinfitives is used.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel method for {{recognizing}} partially occluded objects. The proposed method uses corner points and their spatial relationships perceived through the application of Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR) 1 by considering three successive corner points at a time. The perceived TSR among corner points are used to create a model object data base using B-tree, an efficient <b>multilevel</b> <b>indexing</b> structure. Since the TSR is preserved by the use of quadruples and B-tree does not support multidimensional data (4 -dimensional in our case), a distinct and unique key is computed for each distinct quadruple and then the computed keys are stored in B-tree as representatives of the corresponding quadruples. Each key value stored in B-tree is then attached with a list of objects, which have the corresponding quadruple as one of their associated quadruples. During matching, B-tree is accessed through in search of each key of the scene image to retrieve the list of objects associated with that key. The matched sequence is preserved in a two-dimensional matrix called status matrix. The object for which there is a longest substring of key match in the status matrix is declared to be the identified object. Experiments conducted on different sets of objects revealed the superiority of the proposed method over others and also its consistency with human perception. Read More: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-With {{the current}} {{rapid growth in}} {{multimedia}} technology, there is an imminent need for efficient techniclues to search and query large image databases. Because of their unique and peculiar needs, image databases cannot be treated iri a similar fashion to other types of digital libraries. The contextual dependencies present in images, and the complex nature of two-dimensional image data make the representation issues more difficult for image databases. An invariant representation of an image is still an open research issue. For these reasons, {{it is difficult to}} find a universal content-based retrieval technique. Current approaches based on shape, texture, and color for indexing image databases have met with limited success. Further, these techniques have not been adequately tested in the presence of noise and distortions. A given application domain offers stronger constraints for improving the retrieval performance. Fingerprint databases are characterized by their large size as well as noisy and distorted query images. Distortions are very common in fingerprint images due to elasticity of the skin. In this paper, a method of indexincl large fingerprint image databases is presented. The approach integrates a number of domain-specific high-level features such as pattern class and ridge density at higher levels of the search. At the lowest level, it incorporates elastic structural feature-based matching for indexing the database. With a <b>multilevel</b> <b>indexing</b> approach, {{we have been able to}} reduce the search space. The search engine has also been implemented on Splash 2 -a field programmable gate array (FPGA) -based array processor to obtain near-, 4 SIC level speed of matching.

In practice, commercial logic and fault simulators often require initialization under such a three-valued simulation model. In this paper, the first sound and systematic synthesis method is proposed to ensure the logical initializability of synchronous finite-state machines. The method includes both state assignment and combinational logic synthesis steps. It is shown that a previous approach to synthesis-for-initializability, which uses a constrained state assignment method, may produce uninitializable circuits. Here, a new state assignment method is proposed that is guaranteed correct. Furthermore, it is shown that combinational logic synthesis also has {{a direct impact on}} initializability; necessary and sufficient constraints on combinational logic synthesis are proposed to guarantee that the resulting gate-level circuits are logically initializable.

40|$|Abstract—The {{utilization}} of a burst-mode power amplifier (PA) together with pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a promising concept for achieving high efficiency in radio frequency (RF) transmitters. Nevertheless, such a transmitter architecture requires bandpass filtering to suppress side-band spectral com-ponents {{to retrieve the}} wanted signal, which reduces the transmit power and the transmitter efficiency. High efficiency can only be expected with the maximum transmit power and signals with low peak-to-average-power ratios (PAPRs). To boost efficiency for signals with high PAPRs and signals at variable transmit power levels, the burst-mode multilevel transmitter architecture has been widely discussed as a potential solution. This paper presents an efficiency optimization procedure of burst-mode multilevel transmitters for signals with high PAPRs and signals at variable transmit power levels. The impact of the threshold value on the transmitter efficiency is studied, where the optimum threshold value and the maximum transmitter efficiency can be obtained according to input magnitude statistics. In addition, {{the relation between the}} threshold value and the efficiency expression of burst-mode multilevel transmitters and those of Doherty PAs is investigated. It is shown that the obtained optimum threshold value, although originally designed for burst-mode transmitters, can also be applied to Doherty and multistage Doherty PAs to achieve maximum transmitter efficiency.

It was found that the students' reading attitudes reflected the influence of the student's gender, reading ability, and independent reading practices and that parental reading attitudes and home educational resources made significant contributions to the students' reading attitudes. Moreover, teaching the students reading skills explicitly and the school's overall reading attainment were positively related to the students' reading attitudes. The significance of the findings is examined and the educational implications are explored and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{data used}} by today’s {{scientific}} applications are often {{very high in}} dimensionality and staggering in size. These characteristics necessitate {{the use of a}} good multidimensional indexing strategy to provide efficient access to the data. Researchers have previously proposed the use of bitmap indexes for high-dimension scientific data as a way of overcoming the drawbacks of traditional multidimensional indexes such as R-trees and KD-trees, which are bulky and whose performance does not scale well as the number of dimensions increases. However, the techniques proposed in previous work on bitmap indexes are not sufficient to address all problems that arise in practice. In experiments with real datasets, we experienced problems with index size and query performance. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the use of adaptive, <b>multilevel,</b> multiresolution bitmap <b>indexes,</b> and evaluate their performance in two scientific domains. Our preliminary experiments with a parallel query processor and index creator also show that it is very easy to parallelize a bitmap index. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, various spatial and {{temporal}} methodologies were developed to investigate the processes that drive ecological and evolutionary patterns. However, these methods frequently fail {{to acknowledge that the}} observed patterns result from the overlap of different underlying processes. In order to understand how the patterns are formed, we must have recourse to methods that allow us to disentangle these simultaneous processes. Here we develop a hierarchical spatial predictive process (PP) combined with a separable temporal PP to disentangle and describe those overlapping processes in one very frequent setting in ecology and evolution: <b>multilevel</b> spatio-temporally <b>indexed</b> data. We present our methodology through a case study of fisheries discards and investigate for example whether the inclusion of the hierarchical structure and the temporal processes of the system alter the observed spatial patterns. Recently it is recognized that understanding the processes driving discards is essential to sustainably manage and conserve marine resources. The results show that consideration of multiple underlying processes dramatically changes the pattern and characteristics of the discards hot- and coldspots. In the Irish Sea, the inclusion of the hierarchical structure of the system leads to the reduction of the hot- and coldspots. Simultaneously, our model identifies key bi-annual fluctuations in the temporal process which, together with the variance associated at the level of individual fishing trips in the hierarchical structure of the data explained most of the variance driving discards. Whether the hierarchical, {{spatial and temporal}} processes are considered together or not can profoundly alter our understanding of what constitutes an appropriate mitigation measure. Misidentification of hotspots can culminate in inappropriate mitigation practices which can sometimes be irreversible. As the proposed method offers a unified approach for understanding the processes that drive observed patterns, many areas in ecology such as conservation and epidemiological studies can benefit from its use, increasing the effectiveness of management plans...|$|R
