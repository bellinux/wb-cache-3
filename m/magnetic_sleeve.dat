40|$|WO 2005022175 A UPAB: 20050504 NOVELTY - The device has an {{electrical}} energy source (100) and {{an electrical}} load (108) coupled to {{opposite ends of}} the electrical line (104, 106), with a measuring device (120), using high frequency measuring pulses for measuring faults along the electrical line via a pulse reflectrometry method and a unit (160) for decoupling of the measuring pulses from the energy source and the load. The electrical output of the electrical energy source has a lower frequency than the measuring pulses, or is provided by a DC signal, the decoupling unit using <b>magnetic</b> <b>sleeve</b> components, magnetically coupled with decoupling sections (150, 152, 154, 156) between the source and the line and between the line and the load, by enclosing the respective line sections. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a method for monitoring an electrical line is also included. USE - The device is used for monitoring an electrical line used for transmission of power between a source and a load in a current circuit. ADVANTAGE - Device provides line monitoring without interrupting transmission of power between electrical energy source and load...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{induction}} machines {{dominate the}} market for electrical machines in industrial pumping applications. This {{is also the case}} for subsea pumping applications. Permanent magnet machines are showing great promise for taking over this market, but in order for permanent magnet machines to succeed, their stability during load transients must be greatly improved. In this project, the aim has been to analyze the behaviour of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor with damper windings during transients. In addition to stability studies, a main topic if interest has been to develop a method to comprehensively determine the individual direct-quadrant axis parameters of the machine. A particular special case of damper windings, where a metallic sleeve around the rotor does the job of both the damper winding and the <b>magnetic</b> retention <b>sleeve,</b> has been the main topic of investigation. The machine has been tested using three different materials in the damper winding. To perform these simulations, a Finite Element Method software called Ansys Maxwell has been used. A method for determining the dq-axis parameters has been developed, results using this method, in combination with the stability studies, suggest there is a direct relationship between the damper winding resistance and the damping abilities of the machine...|$|R
