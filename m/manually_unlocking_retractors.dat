40|$|The {{development}} of the longitudinal restraint mechanism for the Army's Patriot missile system is reviewed. The initial design was an ordnance pin puller with a shear plane. Because of reliability problems {{and a desire to}} reduce cost, a fly-away restraint mechanism was chosen. After being <b>manually</b> <b>unlocked,</b> the restraint pin disengages the missile during launch by missile motion...|$|R
5000|$|None: the KVM switch {{lacks the}} {{circuitry}} {{to handle this}} data, and the monitor is not [...] "visible" [...] to the system. The system may assume a generic monitor is attached and defaults to safe settings. Higher resolutions and refresh rates {{may need to be}} <b>manually</b> <b>unlocked</b> through the video driver as a safety precaution. However, certain applications (especially games) that depend on retrieving DDC/EDID information {{will not be able to}} function correctly.|$|R
40|$|An {{orthopedic}} brace {{locking mechanism}} is described which under standing or walking conditions cannot be unlocked, however under sitting conditions the mechanism can be simply unlocked {{so as to}} permit bending of the patient's knee. Other features of the device include: (1) the mechanism is rendered operable, and inoperable, dependent upon the relative inclination of the brace {{with respect to the}} ground; (2) the mechanism is automatically locked under standing or walking conditions and is <b>manually</b> <b>unlocked</b> under sitting conditions; and (3) the mechanism is light in weight and is relatively small in size...|$|R
5000|$|Each train {{consists}} of four cars with three rows per car, two riders per row, holding 24 total riders. Each row has a lap bar and a seat belt. The lapbar itself is locked and unlocked by an electrical current that activates solenoids on the train, resulting in a [...] "buzzing" [...] electrical sound. They can be troublesome, sometimes requiring the operating crew to <b>manually</b> <b>unlock</b> the lapbar for a rider. The trains ride on steel wheels with guide wheels and upstops attached. The track is plank wood stacked 7 planks high, with steel running surfaces on the top, bottom and sides (locations where the running, guide, and upstop wheels contact the track).|$|R
5000|$|Thunderbolt is {{a wooden}} roller coaster located at Six Flags New England. Opened in 1941, It was {{designed}} by Harry Baker and Harry Traver, and built by Joseph Drambour. Thunderbolt is the oldest roller coaster at Six Flags New England. It is also the oldest roller coaster in any Six Flags park (the Wild One at Six Flags America was built in 1917, but it was relocated from Paragon Park and has only been at Six Flags America since 1986). The single PTC train has 4 cars, and an individual lap bar and seatbelt for each person. An attendant has to <b>manually</b> <b>unlock</b> each car's lap bars by stepping on and pushing down a release bar {{at the front of}} each car. [...] Thunderbolt was dedicated an ACE Coaster Landmark on August 2, 2008.|$|R
50|$|The gimbals, unless locked, are {{stabilized}} {{with three}} individual motors, keeping footage steady and stabilized without editing after. When not in use, the motors lock automatically, {{and can be}} <b>unlocked</b> <b>manually</b> during set-up and initialization.|$|R
50|$|Users {{are advised}} to use unorthodox methods (including <b>manually</b> {{deleting}} directories, <b>unlocking</b> files, stopping processes, unregistering DLL files and/or deleting registry entries) in order to completely remove the software. This is the typical modus-operandi of viruses and other malware in general.|$|R
5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was <b>manually</b> <b>unlocked,</b> the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, UCAR {{fabricated}} a snowfall simulator {{that they have}} used to test deicing fluids for aircraft, among other applications. Ice cores are actuated by a stepper motor and travel along a linear guide rail feeding it into an auger bit. This bit shaves the ice core, creating conditions that simulate snowfall. Currently, the simulator is in satisfactory operating condition, however upgrades have been proposed to make the simulator more user friendly. When one ice core has been exhausted, the motor controlling the carriage must be actuated in reverse to move the mount along a lead screw back to reloading position, which can take upwards of three minutes. The purpose of this project is to retrofit the simulator with a quick release system that allows for the user to <b>manually</b> <b>unlock</b> the carriage and quickly pull {{it back into the}} reloading position, decreasing turn around time in the testing process. The final design is a symmetric 2 -clamp system that is installed directly onto the ice core mount. The two clamps engage the lead screw from the left and the right. To reload the ice cores, the user must simply lift the Destaco clamps on each side and pull the entire carriage back to the original position {{at the front of the}} simulator...|$|R
5000|$|However, this {{conclusion}} raised another {{question as to}} how Saulin {{managed to get the}} train moving again. A fail-safe mechanism on the cars locks the brakes in the on position if the valve is closed. The only way to start the train again is to re-open the valve or <b>manually</b> <b>unlock</b> each brake pad. SNCF policy requires to call for an engineer to examine the train (who would have probably found the closed valve). However, Saulin, anxious to continue the trip, enlisted the help of Bove√© to work along opposite sides of the train unlocking each brake. Saulin believed the cause of the problem to be a common condition known as an [...] "air lock". When the emergency brake is activated, an [...] "air lock" [...] {{is the result of the}} compressed air filling up the brake pipes, clogging them and preventing the brakes from working. The brake pads lock as part of the fail-safe mechanism when an air lock occurs. To fix this problem, the trapped air must be bled out of the pipe to release the brakes. Nevertheless, Saulin had no idea of what he had done, and stated that the pressure gauge in his cab was marking the correct measure, which is why he thought all the braking systems were in working order. Unbeknownst to him, he had closed the main valve, isolating the front carriage from the rest of the train. Thus the gauge only showed the pressure of the first carriage's brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A hardlocked {{phone is}} one in which a telecom {{provider}} has modified the firmware on the phone to make it impossible to <b>manually</b> enter the <b>unlock</b> codes in any way. The only solution to SIM-unlock such a phone is to change the firmware to a firmware which has not been modified by any telecom provider, a so-called [...] "unbranded firmware".|$|R
50|$|The River King Mine Train is {{a hybrid}} wood {{structure}} roller coaster located at Six Flags St. Louis. Built in 1971, {{it was the}} first coaster of the park. The actual ride itself is one of two tracks, one which was later sold. Today, the ride operates with its original name. The ride has also received modern upgrades, including a new control panel. It is a popular family and beginner coaster being it is the smallest in the park. The Mine Train as it is often called, is unique in {{the fact that it has}} no automatic system for the lap bars. Instead, employees have to <b>manually</b> lock and <b>unlock</b> the bars. Trains are 5 cars with riders arranged 2 across in 3 rows. In total, the coaster has 3 trains that have a total capacity of 90 riders (30 each).|$|R
40|$|Database Interface, {{makes the}} {{application}} portable to different database platforms. Pattern 4, ORB Proxy for Database Object, deals with {{the integration of the}} often incompatible worlds of object brokers and object databases. Pattern 5, Automatic Object Locks, liberates developers from the tedious and error-prone work of <b>manually</b> locking and <b>unlocking</b> database objects. Pattern 6, Shared DB Connections, applies to the cases where it is necessary to have more simultaneous users than the number of connections the database servers will accept. This leads to pattern 7, Thread-Based Figure 1 : Three-tier architecture. Application Server Database Server Concurrency Management, which shows how concurrency control can be implemented in application servers when database locks can no longer be used to 36217 - 673 the clients. While pattern 5 is fairly C++-specific, the other patterns should apply to most object-oriented threetier application development projects. Pattern 1 : Three-Tier Architecture [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{riders in}} each car are {{restrained}} {{by a single}} solid lap bar that is locked across {{the body of the}} car, making the ride unsuitable for young children or people of short stature. The bar must be <b>manually</b> locked or <b>unlocked,</b> and only locks in one position. Lights and music are also controlled by the operator, which (as the name suggests) contribute heavily to the ride experience. After a certain amount of rotations or minutes, the ride operator will be alerted by the control box that the speed is going to increase, usually by a light on the box. At that time the operator will speak on a microphone asking the riders if they would like to go faster. Sometimes the ride operator can do this earlier than the alert light to build suspense. After a minute or two of faster speed, the ride will then slow down, and the operator can then ask the riders if they would like to go backwards. The speed up element is then repeated again only done in reverse. The Most parks and carnivals require all riders to be at least 42 inches or even taller, depending on circumstances and ride design.|$|R
