50|$|Two of {{the vessels}} built at Scarr's {{shipyard}} {{are on the}} National Historic Ships register. Hunt's Kim was built as a sailing keel in 1923, and was motorised in 1946. It {{was used as a}} floating workshop in the 1980s, and then as a <b>mooring</b> <b>pontoon</b> for dredgers in the Humber. It was then left at Goole and was unused for eight years, but has been bought and was undergoing restoration on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 2011. Eden was a similar vessel built in 1924 for John Hunts of Leeds, and originally named Hunts-Eden. It was motorised some time before 1946, when the engine was replaced. It sank in the River Ouse in the 1960s, but was refloated, and bought by Waddington's of Swinton. Waddington's fitted a new engine in 1968, gave it its present name, and it was used to carry steel beams from Goole to Rotherham. It remained in commercial use until 1998, when it was sold for private use. In 2011 it was fitted with a Perkins engine, and the owner announced his plans to refit a mast and rigging, so that it can again be sailed. The John M Rishworth is also still operational, and in 2012 was moored at Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs in East London.|$|E

40|$|Underwater {{environments in}} ports are {{designed}} for harbour activities solely. However, by simple and cost-effective measures, suitable habitat for underwater flora and fauna can be created. This {{is expected to have}} positive effects on higher trophic levels, such as fish, and improve water quality, by enlarging filter feeder biomass. In this study we developed ‘pole hulas’ and ‘pontoon hulas’, consisting of hanging ropes of different materials. The pole hulas are made up of many 6 mm thick and 55 cm long strings just above and below the mean low water level (MLWL) around poles. The pontoon hulas resemble raft like structures with 12 mm thick and 150 cm long ropes within the open space of <b>mooring</b> <b>pontoons.</b> The first experimentation with these structures was executed in the polyhaline harbours of the port of Rotterdam. The pole hulas were rapidly colonised by a variety of organisms. Above MLWL a seaweed community dominated on the strings. Below MLWL Mytilus edulis (the Blue mussel) was found to be the dominating species after a few months. In the dense layer of M. edulis on both pole hulas and pontoon hulas many mobile soft-bottom amphipods and young ragworms occurred, which means that colonisation on these structures compensate for biodiversity loss of bottom fauna due to dredging and disturbance by propellers of ships. Settlement of the exotic Crassostrea gigas (Pacific or Japanese oyster) did not occur on the strings of the pole hulas, the ropes of the pontoon hulas and not on the poles with hulas. Wet biomass (including shells) on pole hulas was positively correlated with depth and on average 4. 4 – 11. 4 times higher compared to biomass on reference poles. Colonization of the pontoon hula ropes was similar to colonization of the pole hulas below MLWL. Biomass production per rope was density dependent and optimal density of ropes was estimated at 4 – 8 ropes m− 2. Biomass (mainly M. edulis) on the ropes of pontoon hulas decreased to a half from the edge {{to the heart of the}} hula demonstrating the limitation of food by competition. It was concluded that ecological engineering in the port of Rotterdam with simple structures such as pole and pontoon hulas strongly enhances sessile biological production and biodiversity. This is likely to result in a positive impact on local water quality, and, if applied at larger scales, may have positive influences on the remains of Rhine–Meuse estuary...|$|R
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the lifeboat is now <b>moored</b> at a <b>pontoon.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of past world wars and the dumping of munition at {{designated}} dumping areas, residual military ordnance are found on and in the seabed, especially in the Wadden Sea, North Sea and Baltic Sea. Of the estimated 1. 5 million tons of military ordnance, roughly ten percent is classified as Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). There are three main arguments for removing the military ordnance: environmental protection, human safety and project related. Current study {{will focus on the}} project related removal of munition, specifically for offshore wind cable installation projects. Recovery of UXO is often preferred over redirection of the cable route due to cost savings. Current state of the art methods use dedicated clearance ROV's and divers to remove the munition ordnance. However, these methods prove to be dangerous, inefficient or even impossible to use in shallow water areas (0 - 10 m) with strong tidal currents. The objective of current study is to develop a remotely-operated munitions detection and removal concept for use in coastal water areas and assess its feasibility. First, a programme of requirements for the novel concept is obtained. During a systematic ideation process, fifteen different conceptual ideas are conceived and compared in a multi-criteria analysis from which the most promising concept is chosen: an excavator carrying a munitions toolskid on a <b>moored</b> <b>pontoon.</b> The second part of the study focuses on assessing the feasibility of the proposed concept for two project sites. Specifically for this study, the workability in waves is assessed. Limiting criteria are defined for two critical components on the munitions toolskid to ensure a safe operation; the motion amplitude of the detection coils, limited to X cm vertical motion and the motion amplitude of the manipulators, limited to X cm absolute motion. The latter limit is based on user experience of existing ROV operations and is thus subject to interpretation. The motion amplitude of manipulator and detection coils is modelled by combining three sources of motion; backlash mobilization in the excavator, bending deflection of the excavator arm and wave induced pontoon motions. Three different types of mooring are modelled; gravity spuds, backhoe-type spuds (i. e. preloaded spuds) and a jack-up system. Results of the workability assessment for two case studies show that the gravity spuds pontoon is not a feasible solution, mainly due to the freedom of heaving and pitching. Both defined motion limits are exceeded by more than X m. When using backhoe spuds or jack-up system, the criterion for the scanning coils is satisfied. The criterion for the manipulators is slightly exceeded by respectively X cm and X cm absolute motion for the backhoe and jack-up system. It can be concluded that none of the assessed solutions is workable if an exceedance of the motion limit for the manipulator is strictly prohibited. However, considering the exceedance of the limit is slight and the motion limit of the manipulator should be interpreted as an indication, the backhoe and jack-up system may prove to be workable solutions. Reassessment of the limiting criterion for the manipulator is required to give insight if a slight exceedance of the limit is allowable.

40|$|To achieve {{cost-effective}} {{and reliable}} structural design of floating wind turbines, efficient and accurate time domain numerical approaches {{are required to}} analyse structural responses in design conditions, e. g. wind and waves. This paper focuses on validation of a time-domain numerical approach for determining forces and moments in structural components of floaters. The approach considers floating wind turbines as a system of several structural components, e. g. blades, rotational shaft, nacelle, tower, <b>mooring</b> lines, columns, <b>pontoons</b> and braces. A finite element model is developed to represent global stiffness of the structural components. The external and inertia loads on the structural components are modelled as distributed loads. Hydrodynamic loads on each structural component are derived from the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients obtained by solving the first order boundary value problem using WAMIT. A 1 : 30 scaled braceless semi-submersible model test which implements the ReaTHM® testing approach was done by SINTEF Ocean, formerly MARINTEK, in its ocean basin. Measurements of the global forces and moments {{at the base of}} a side column of the model and rigid-body motions of the model are compared to the corresponding simulations. This paper focuses on responses in moderate waves for which linear hydrodynamic loads are applicable. Differences in the corresponding simulations and measurements are found to be small, while possible reasons, e. g. synchronizations, non-linear effects, and uncertainties in the measurements and simulations, for the differences are analysed. Essential information about the model test, descriptions of the numerical models, calibrations and results and discussions of the validation are given in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{design of}} the floater is an {{important}} aspect in developing cost efficient and reliable floating wind turbines. It is difficult to well account for the effect of strong non-linear dynamic characteristics and transient loading events, e. g. wind turbine faults, of floating wind turbines in a frequency-domain finite element analysis. The time-domain approach which implements the Morison's formula cannot accurately account for the hydrodynamic loads on the hull of floating wind turbines. While, the conventional hybrid frequency-time domain approach (based on the potential flow theory) fails to capture structural responses of the hulls since a rigid-body global model rather than a finite element model of the hull is employed. The present paper deals with the development and verification of a time-domain approach {{that can be easily}} implemented in various state-of-the-art computer codes for wind turbine analysis, e. g. Simo/Riflex/Aerodyn, OrcaFlex and FAST + CHARM 3 D, to extend their capabilities to analyze global forces and moments in structural components of a generic floater subject environmental loads from e. g. wind and waves. The global forces and moments in the structural components might be used as inputs of design formulas for structural strength design checks and/or used as boundary conditions in a sub-model finite element analysis to determine structural responses such as stresses. The proposed approach focuses on modeling of the inertia and external loads on the hull and mapping of the loads in the finite element model of the hull. In the proposed approach, floating wind turbines are considered as a system of several structural components, e. g. blades, rotational shaft, nacelle, tower, <b>mooring</b> lines, columns, <b>pontoons</b> and braces, rather than one rigid-body, while a finite element model for the hull is developed to represent the global stiffness of the structural components. The external and inertial loads on the hull are modeled as distributed loads rather than the integrated forces and moments. The conventional hybrid frequency-time domain approach, which is available in the state-of-the-art computer codes, is implemented to model the hydrodynamic loads on each structural component with essential modifications with respect to the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients, e. g. added mass and potential damping coefficients and wave excitation forces. Approaches for modeling the hydrostatic pressure forces, gravity loads, drag forces and inertial loads on each structural component are also illustrated. Second order and higher order terms of the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the hydroelasticity effects are not accounted for in the present paper but can be further included. So far, the proposed approach has been implemented in the computer code Simo/Riflex/Aerodyn to analyze global forces and moments in the hull of a semi-submersible wind turbine. Good agreement between the reference values and the simulation results has been observed and indicates that the developed time-domain numerical models are reliable. The simulation results show that the low-frequency aerodynamic loads and fluctuations of hydrostatic pressure forces on and gravity of the floating wind turbine are important contributions to the structural responses, in particular, in the low-frequency range...|$|R
