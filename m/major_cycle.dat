25|$|Kollwitz's second <b>major</b> <b>cycle</b> {{of works}} was the Peasant War, which, subject to many {{preliminary}} drawings and discarded ideas in lithography, occupied her from 1902 to 1908. The German Peasants' War was a violent revolution {{which took place}} in Southern Germany {{in the early years of}} the Reformation, beginning in 1525; peasants who had been treated as slaves took arms against feudal lords and the church. As was The Weavers, this subject, too, might have been suggested by a Hauptmann drama, Florian Geyer. However, the initial source of Kollwitz's interest dated to her youth, when she and her brother Konrad playfully imagined themselves as barricade fighters in a revolution. The artist identified with the character of Black Anna, a woman cited as a protagonist in the uprising. When completed, the Peasant War consisted of pieces in etching, aquatint, and soft ground: Plowing, Raped, Sharpening the Scythe, Arming in the Vault, Outbreak, After the Battle (which, eerily premonitory, features a mother searching through corpses in the night, looking for her son), and The Prisoners. In all, the works were technically more impressive than those of The Weavers, owing to their greater size and dramatic command of light and shadow. They are Kollwitz's highest achievements as an etcher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{accelerations}} of {{and forces}} among contacting rigid bodies may be computed by formulating the dynamics equations and contact constraints as a complementarity problem [1]. Dantzig’s algorithm, when applicable, {{will find a}} solution to the linear complementarity problem corresponding to an assembly with n contacts in O(n) <b>major</b> <b>cycles.</b> Can the dynamics of an assembly be computed more quickly if the dynamics of a subassembly are already known? This paper shows that Dantzig’s algorithm will find a solution in O(n − k) <b>major</b> <b>cycles</b> if the algorithm is initialized with a solution to the dynamics problem for a subassembly with k internal contacts. We apply this observation to two robotics problems: dynamic simulation and assembly sequence planning. In dynamic simulation, the positions of several bodies might remain fixed during a sequence of frames. We compute the dynamics of this motionless subset (which might not be motionless when considered in isolation), and use the result to initialize the computation for the entire assembly. In assembly planning, non-disjoint sets of objects are typically considered sequentially by the planner. If the configuration of only one body is varied, the dynamics of successive assemblies can be computed in a constant number of <b>major</b> <b>cycles.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|However, the {{standard}} does not specify any particular timing for any particular transfer — that's {{up to the}} system designers. Generally (the way it is done on most military aircraft), the Bus Controller has a schedule of transfers that covers the majority of transfers, often organized into a major frame or <b>major</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is often subdivided into minor cycles. In such a cyclic executive schedule structure, transfers that occur in every minor cycle (rate group 1) happen at the highest rate, typically 50 Hz, transfers that occur in every other minor cycle, {{of which there are}} two groups (rate group 2.1 and 2.2) happen at the next highest rate, e.g. 25 Hz. Similarly, there are four groups (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) at, e.g., 12.5 Hz and so on. Hence, where this scheduling structure is used, the transfers are all at harmonically related frequencies, e.g. 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 1.5625 Hz (for a major frame comprising 32 minor cycles at 50 Hz).Whilst RTs cannot start a transfer directly on their own, {{the standard}} does include a method for when an RT needs to transmit data that is not automatically scheduled by the Bus Controller. These transfers are often called acyclic transfers as they are outside the structure used by the cyclic executive. In this sequence, an RT requests transmission through a bit in the status word, the Service Request bit. Generally, this causes the Bus Controller to transmit a Transmit Vector Word Mode Code command. However, where an RT only has one possible acyclic transfer, the Bus Controller can skip this part. The vector word is transmitted by the RT as a single 16-bit data word. The format of this vector word is not defined in the standard, so the system designers must specify what values from what RTs mean what action the Bus Controller is to take. This may be to schedule an acyclic transfer either immediately or {{at the end of the}} current minor cycle. This means that the Bus Controller has to poll all the Remote Terminals connected to the data bus, generally at least once in a <b>major</b> <b>cycle.</b> RTs with higher-priority functions (for example, those operating the aircraft control surfaces) are polled more frequently. Lower-priority functions are polled less frequently.|$|E
