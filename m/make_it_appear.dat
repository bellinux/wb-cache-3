5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} disruptive coloration to break up an object's outlines, of masquerade, as when a butterfly mimics a leaf, and especially of countershading, where an animal's tones <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> flat by concealing its self-shadowing.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the species}} in this family have coiled shells that are planispiral, in other words, the shells {{are more or less}} coiled flat, rather than having an {{elevated}} spire {{as is the case in}} most gastropod shells. Although they carry their shell in a way that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> to be dextral, the shell of coiled planorbids is in fact sinistral in coiling, but is carried upside down, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> to be dextral.|$|R
5|$|Thayer {{observed}} and painted {{a number of}} examples, including the Luna moth caterpillar Actias luna, both in its habitual upside-down feeding position, where its countershading makes it appear flat, and artificially inverted from that position, where sunlight and its inverted countershading combine to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> heavily shaded and therefore solid. Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{appearing}} in the series mostly in his armor, Arakawa {{has been focused on}} searching ways to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> as Alphonse is expressing emotions despite not having a body. Alphonse has also appeared in materials related to the manga, including video games and light novels that follow his journey. His character has been well received by readers of the series; he has consistently appeared in the top ten series' popularity polls. The character has received positive remarks from critics, with some commending his design and his relationship with Edward.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The white-rumped swift {{is similar to}} Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary {{to be sure of}} correct identification.|$|E
5|$|Bamber and Mugford {{had started}} dating in 1983, {{when she was}} 19 and {{studying}} for a degree in education at Goldsmith's College in London. She had taken a holiday job in Sloppy Joe's, a pizzeria in Colchester, where Jeremy had a bar job in the evenings. Mugford admitted to a brief background of dishonesty. She had been cautioned in 1985 for using a friend's chequebook to obtain goods worth around £700, after it had been reported stolen; she said she and the friend had repaid {{the money to the}} bank. She also acknowledged having helped Bamber, in March or April 1985, steal just under £1,000 from the office of the Osea Road caravan site his family owned; she said he had staged a break-in to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that strangers were responsible.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Henstridge portrays Simmons, and {{is joined}} by guest star Dillon Casey as another {{survivor}} stranded on the planet. Series regulars Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, and Iain De Caestecker also briefly appear. The episode was {{a departure from the}} norm for the series, focusing on a single character rather than the usual ensemble, and taking place on an alien planet. The episode was filmed in the Californian desert, with a filtering effect used to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> to be night on the planet, as its sun rarely rises. The episode took inspiration from multiple science fiction films, and bears similarity to The Martian, which was released close to the episode's airing.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind had to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 {{two thirds of the}} remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{expanded}} several {{times by the}} Luttrell family during the 17th and 18th centuries; they built a large manor house within the Lower Ward of the castle in 1617, and this was extensively modernised, first during the 1680s and then during the 1760s. The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following the siege of Dunster Castle {{at the end of}} the English Civil War, when Parliament ordered the defences to be slighted to prevent their further use. In the 1860s and 1870s, the architect Anthony Salvin was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes; this work extensively changed the appearance of Dunster to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> more Gothic and Picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} the first in the series to feature the {{character}} of Worf, who had previously been a character on , in a central storyline. Due to time restraints in filming, there were edits made to the scripts and the production team were forced to make best use of the cave sets which had been seen on the show previously. The sword itself was created specifically for the episode, and was made to seem more elaborate than the bat'leths previously seen in Star Trek, including hand etchings to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> similar to Damascus steel. Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score, including the use of Wagner tubas. Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction, critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
50|$|The {{region is}} arid, {{receiving}} between 100 and 200 mm of annual precipitation, mostly snow. Mean January temperatures are -30 to -35 °C, though wind chill <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> significantly colder.|$|R

5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked to try to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> as unique as possible.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that Sheila was the killer. He discovered {{that she could not}} have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E
5|$|With 42 seconds remaining, the Jets {{still had}} a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York return man Earl Christy fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker Bill Budness. Oakland reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber picked up the fumbled ball and ran into the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not {{remember}} whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.|$|E

5|$|At {{the railway}} station in Belgrade, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death {{to one of}} his sons, and asks for an agent from Station Y to meet him at Zagreb. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant {{intercepts}} Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that their deaths were the result of a murder-suicide, to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrotte. Bond then drags the comatose Romanova from the train (which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice), where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.|$|E
5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages {{on them for}} five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when {{he was sentenced to}} probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> like the figures are in motion.|$|E
