Although the introduction of metallic particles in a ceramic matrix with concentration near the PT can dramatically enhance the dielectric response, a large increase in the conduction of charge carriers was observed simultaneously, leading to decreases in Eb and <b>energy</b> <b>density.</b> The <b>maximum</b> stored <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> of all the samples were calculated and found to be 3.11, 25.8, 26.0, 1.39, and 0.54  kJ/m 3 for the CCTO, CCTO/Au 1, CCTO/Au 2, CCTO/Au 3, and CCTO/Au 4 samples, respectively.

5000|$|Second, {{atoms of}} rare earth {{elements}} can have high magnetic moments because their orbital electron structure contains many unpaired electrons, in contrast to other elements in which {{almost all of the}} electrons exist in pairs with opposite spins, so their magnetic fields cancel out. This is a consequence of incomplete filling of the f-shell, which can contain up to 7 unpaired electrons. In a magnet it is the unpaired electrons, aligned so they spin in the same direction, which generate the magnetic field. This gives the materials high remanence (saturation magnetization Js). The <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> BHmax is proportional to Js2 so these materials have the potential for storing large amounts of magnetic energy. The magnetic energy product BHmax of neodymium magnets is about 18 times greater than [...] "ordinary" [...] magnets by volume. This allows rare earth magnets to be smaller than other magnets which produce the same field strength.|$|E
50|$|A CNT spring made of {{bundles of}} densely packed 1 nm {{diameter}} SWCNTs stretched to a 10% strain {{is predicted to}} have an energy density of 3.4 kJ/m3. The energy density of CNT springs loaded in tension {{is higher than the}} energy density of CNT springs loaded in compression. Whereas the current <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of a carbon-steel watch spring is reported to be between 1080 kJ/m3 and 3000 kJ/m3. Calculations show that when a support structure made of single crystal silicon carbide is used the energy density of CNT springs reduces to 1 kJ/m3. Even after considering a support structure and other energy extraction hardware associated with a CNT spring energy harvesting device, its energy density is much greater than mechanical springs and is in approximately the same range as that of lithium-ion batteries. The energy density is much lower than the energy density of any hydrocarbon used in combustion processes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{neodymium}} atom {{also can}} have a large magnetic dipole moment because it has 7 unpaired electrons in its electron structure as opposed to (on average) 3 in iron. In a magnet it is the unpaired electrons, aligned so they spin in the same direction, which generate the magnetic field. This gives the Nd2Fe14B compound a high saturation magnetization (Js ~1.6 T or 16 kG) and typically 1.3 teslas. Therefore, as the <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> is proportional to Js2, this magnetic phase {{has the potential for}} storing large amounts of magnetic energy (BHmax ~ 512 kJ/m3 or 64 MG·Oe). This magnetic energy value is about 18 times greater than [...] "ordinary" [...] magnets by volume. This property is higher in NdFeB alloys than in samarium cobalt (SmCo) magnets, which were the first type of rare-earth magnet to be commercialized. In practice, the magnetic properties of neodymium magnets depend on the alloy composition, microstructure, and manufacturing technique employed.|$|E

We extend Akbar [...] Cai derivation [hep-th/ 0609128] of Friedmann equations to accommodate a general entropy-area law. Studying the resulted Friedmann equations using a specific entropy-area law, which is motivated by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), reveals {{the existence of a}} <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> closed to Planck density. Allowing for a general continuous pressure p(ρ,a) leads to bounded curvature invariants and a general nonsingular evolution. In this case, the <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> is reached in a finite time and there is no cosmological evolution beyond this point which leaves the big bang singularity inaccessible from a spacetime prospective. The existence of <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> and a general nonsingular evolution is independent of the equation of state and the spacial curvature k. As an example we study the evolution of the equation of state p=ωρ through its phase-space diagram to show the existence of a maximum energy which is reachable in a finite time.
