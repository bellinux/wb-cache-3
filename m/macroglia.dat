50|$|Olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG), {{also known}} as {{olfactory}} ensheathing cells (OECs) or olfactory ensheathing glial cells, are a type of <b>macroglia</b> (radial glia) found in the nervous system. They are {{also known as}} olfactory Schwann cells because they ensheath the non-myelinated axons of olfactory neurons {{in a similar way}} to which Schwann cells ensheath non-myelinated peripheral neurons. They also share the property of assisting axonal regeneration. OEG are capable of phagocytosing axonal debris in vivo, and in vitro they phagocytose bacteria. Olfactory glia that express LYZ are thought {{to play an important role}} in immunoprotection in the mucosa, where neurons are directly exposed to the external environment. OEG have been tested successfully in experimental axonal regeneration in adult rats with traumatic spinal cord damage, and clinical trials are currently being conducted to obtain more information on spinal cord injuries and other neurodegenerative diseases.|$|E
40|$|Plaques of subpial {{demyelination}} were induced {{in adult}} cat spinal cords by repeated withdrawal and reinjection of cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral cord was fixed by replacing cerebrospinal fluid available at cisternal puncture with 3 per cent buffered OsO 4. Following extirpation, surface tissue was further fixed in 2 per cent buffered OsO 4, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in araldite. Normal subpial cord consists mainly of myelinated axons and {{two types of}} <b>macroglia,</b> fibrous astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Twenty-nine hours after lesion induction most myelin sheaths are deteriorating and typical <b>macroglia</b> are no longer visible. Phagocytosis of myelin debris has begun. In 3 -day lesions, axons are intact and their mitochondria and neurofibrils appear normal despite continued myelin breakdown. All axons are completely demyelinated by 6 days. They lack investments only briefly, however, for at 10 and 14 days, macroglial processes appear and embrace them. These <b>macroglia</b> do not resemble either one of the normally occurring glia; their dense cytoplasm contains fibrils {{in addition to the}} usual organelles. It is proposed that these <b>macroglia,</b> which later accomplish remyelination, are the hypertrophic or swollen astrocytes of classical neuropathology. The suggestion that these astrocytes possess the potential to remyelinate axons in addition to their known ability to form cicatrix raises the possibility of pharmacological control of their expression...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{permanent}} and {{close proximity to}} neurons, glial cells perform essential tasks for the normal physiology of the retina. Astrocytes and Müller cells (retinal <b>macroglia)</b> provide physical support to neurons and supplement them with several metabolites and growth factors. <b>Macroglia</b> are involved in maintaining the homeostasis of extracellular ions and neurotransmitters, are essential for information processing in neural circuits, participate in retinal glucose metabolism and in removing metabolic waste products, regulate local blood flow, induce the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), play fundamental roles in local immune response, and protect neurons from oxidative damage. In response to polyetiological insults, glia cells react with a process called reactive gliosis, seeking to maintain retinal homeostasis. When malfunctioning, macroglial cells can become primary pathogenic elements. A reactive gliosis has been described in different retinal pathologies, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes, glaucoma, retinal detachment, or retinitis pigmentosa. A {{better understanding of the}} dual, neuroprotective, or cytotoxic effect of macroglial involvement in retinal pathologies would help in treating the physiopathology of these diseases.

40|$|Many {{studies on}} retinal injury and repair {{following}} elevated intraocular pressure {{suggest that the}} survival ratio of retinal neurons has been improved by various measures. However, the visual function recovery is far lower than expected. The homeostasis of retinal synapses in the visual signal pathway is the key structural basis for the delivery of visual signals. Our previous studies found that complicated changes in the synaptic structure between retinal neurons occurred much earlier than obvious degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in rat retinae. The lack of consideration of these earlier retinal synaptic changes in the rescue strategy may be {{partly responsible for the}} limited visual function recovery with the types of protective methods for retinal neurons used following elevated intraocular pressure. Thus, research on the modulatory mechanisms of the synaptic changes after elevated intraocular pressure injury may give new light to visual function rescue. In this study, we found that thrombospondin 2, an important regulator of synaptogenesis in central nervous system development, was distributed in retinal <b>macroglia</b> cells, and its receptor α 2 δ- 1 was in retinal neurons. Cell cultures including mixed retinal <b>macroglia</b> cells/neuron cultures and retinal neuron cultures were exposed to elevated hydrostatic pressure for 2 h. The expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (the marker of activated <b>macroglia</b> cells), thrombospondin 2, α 2 δ- 1 and presynaptic proteins were increased following elevated hydrostatic pressure in mixed cultures, but the expression levels of postsynaptic proteins were not changed. SiRNA targeting thrombospondin 2 could decrease the upregulation of presynaptic proteins induced by the elevated hydrostatic pressure. However, in retinal neuron cultures, elevated hydrostatic pressure did not affect the expression of presynaptic or postsynaptic proteins. Rather, the retinal neuron cultures with added recombinant thrombospondin 2 protein upregulated the level of presynaptic proteins. Finally, gabapentin decreased the expression of presynaptic proteins in mixed cultures by blocking the interaction of thrombospondin 2 and α 2 δ- 1. Taken together, these results indicate that activated <b>macroglia</b> cells may participate in alterations of presynaptic proteins of retinal neurons following elevated hydrostatic pressure, and macroglia-derived thrombospondin 2 may modulate these changes via binding to its neuronal receptor α 2 δ- 1...|$|E

40|$|The choroid plexus is a {{structure}} within each ventricle {{of the brain}} that is composed of fenestrated vessels surrounded by secretory epithelial cells. The epithelial cells are linked by tight junctions to create a permeability barrier. The epithelial cells are derived from neuroectoderm, and are thus de?ned by some authors as a subtype of <b>macroglia.</b> Glutamate is a tightly regulated substance in the CSF, {{as it is in the}} rest of the brain. In the brain <b>macroglia</b> express multiple sodium dependent and independent glutamate transporters and are the main regulators of extracellular glutamate. However, the identities of the transporters in the choroid plexus and their localisations have remained poorly de?ned. In this study we examined the expression and distribution of multiple splice variants of classical sodium-dependent glutamate transporters, as well as the cystine-glutamate antiporter, and the PDZ protein NHERF 1, (which acts as a molecular anchor for proteins such as the glutamate transporter GLAST). We identi?ed three forms of sodium-dependent transporters (GLAST 1 a, GLAST 1 c and GLT 1 b) that are expressed at the apical surface of the epithelial cells, a location that matches the distribution of NHERF 1 and the cystineglutamate antiporter. We propose that this coincident localisation of GLAST 1 a/GLAST 1 c/GLT 1 b and the cystine-glutamate antiporter would permit the cyclical traf?cking of glutamate and thus optimise the accumulation of cystine for the formation of glutathione in the choroid plexus...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Previously, {{immunization}} of rats with ocular antigens induced retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. We {{investigated the}} effect of immunization with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or GDNF in combination with heat shock protein 27 (GDNF+HSP) on RGCs and other retinal cells. METHODS: Rats were immunized with GDNF or GDNF+HSP. After 4 weeks, retinas were stained with Brn- 3 a and NeuN to quantify RGCs. GFAP and vimentin staining were used to investigate <b>macroglia.</b> Microglia were marked with Iba 1 and ED 1. Amacrine cells were labeled with parvalbumin and ChAT. Photoreceptors were evaluated with rhodopsin and opsin staining and bipolar cells with PKCα and recoverin. For these cell types, Western blotting was also performed. RESULTS: Retinas of immunized animals showed a significant loss of Brn- 3 a+ and NeuN+ RGCs. No significant changes could be observed in regard to <b>macroglia.</b> An increase in Iba 1 + microglia was detected in both groups, but little change in regard to activated microglia. A loss of cholinergic amacrine cells {{was seen in the}} GDNF+HSP group by immunohistochemistry and in both groups via Western blot analysis. AII amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and photoreceptors were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Immunizations led to loss of RGCs and cholinergic amacrine cells and a strong increase in microglial cells. Our data suggest that RGC loss is the consequence of immunization with GDNF. Astrocyte activity and its neuroprotective effects seem to be inhibited by GDNF immunization. We presume more complex interactions between GDNF and HSP 27 because no additive effects could be observed...|$|E

40|$|Background Ocular {{hypertension}} is a {{major risk}} factor for glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by an irreversible decrease in ganglion cells and their axons. Macroglial and microglial cells appear {{to play an important}} role in the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. Here, we study the effects of laser-induced ocular hypertension (OHT) in the <b>macroglia,</b> microglia and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of eyes with OHT (OHT-eyes) and contralateral eyes two weeks after lasering. Methods Two groups of adult Swiss mice were used: age-matched control (naïve, n[*]=[*] 9); and lasered (n[*]=[*] 9). In the lasered animals, both OHT-eyes and contralateral eyes were analyzed. Retinal whole-mounts were immunostained with antibodies against glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), neurofilament of 200 kD (NF- 200), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (Iba- 1) and major histocompatibility complex class II molecule (MHC-II). The GFAP-labeled retinal area (GFAP-RA), the intensity of GFAP immunoreaction (GFAP-IR), and the number of astrocytes and NF- 200 [*]+[*]RGCs were quantified. Results In comparison with naïve: i) astrocytes were more robust in contralateral eyes. In OHT-eyes, the astrocyte population was not homogeneous, given that astrocytes displaying only primary processes coexisted with astrocytes in which primary and secondary processes could be recognized, the former having less intense GFAP-IR (P[*]<[*] 0. 001); ii) GFAP-RA was increased in contralateral (P[*]< 0. 05) and decreased in OHT-eyes (P < 0. 001); iii) the mean intensity of GFAP-IR was higher in OHT-eyes (P[*]<[*] 0. 01), and the percentage of the retinal area occupied by GFAP+ cells with higher intensity levels was increased in contralateral (P[*]=[*] 0. 05) and in OHT-eyes (P[*]<[*] 0. 01); iv) both in contralateral and in OHT-eyes, GFAP was upregulated in Müller cells and microglia was activated; v) MHC-II was upregulated on <b>macroglia</b> and microglia. In microglia, it was similarly expressed in contralateral and OHT-eyes. By contrast, in <b>macroglia,</b> MHC-II upregulation was observed mainly in astrocytes in contralateral eyes and in Müller cells in OHT-eyes; vi) NF- 200 +RGCs (degenerated cells) appeared in OHT-eyes with a trend for the GFAP-RA to decrease and for the NF- 200 +RGC number to increase from the center to the periphery (r[*]=[*]− 0. 45). Conclusion The use of the contralateral eye as an internal control in experimental induction of unilateral IOP should be reconsidered. The gliotic behavior in contralateral eyes could be related to the immune response. The absence of NF- 200 +RGCs (sign of RGC degeneration) leads us to postulate that the MHC-II upregulation in contralateral eyes could favor neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Brain {{has often}} been {{considered}} as an “immunologically privileged organ; ’ not normally accessible to leukocyte traffic, {{at least in part}} because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier, constituted by a specialized microvasculature and surrounding astrocytes, which restricts the exchanges between blood and brain. However, more recent studies have revealed that activated leukocytes can cross into the CNS, at very low levels under normal conditions, in much higher numbers during neuropathological disorders like multiple sclerosis or retroviral infection, and, within brain parenchyma, interact with CNS cells. The present review will thus highlight the multidirectional communication network, based on adhesion molecule expression and cytokine production, which appears in such situations between infiltrated leukocytes, brain microvessel endothelial cells, <b>macroglia</b> (including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), microglial cells an...|$|E

40|$|ONE OF THE {{important}} questions confronting neuroendocrinology {{is the relationship}} between steroids produced by peripheral steroidogenic organs (e. g. adrenals and gonads) and steroids produced by the central nervous system, neurosteroids (1). We have demonstrated that systemic estrogen treatment of ovariectomized and adrenalectomized (OVX-ADX) rats increases hypothalamic progesterone (PROG) levels (2). The estrogen-induced increase of neuro-PROG precedes the LH surge, and the LH surge is blocked by an inhibitor of 3 �-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/� 5 -� 4 isomerase (3 �-HSD), the enzyme that converts pregnenolone to PROG (2). These data suggest that de novo synthesis of PROG from cholesterol in the hypothalamus is a critical part of the estrogen positive-feedback mechanism that stimulates the LH surge.

In this investigation, we studied the expression of α 2 M-R/LRP in the brain, following tissue injury or neoplastic transformation, by immunohistochemistry. Significantly increased α 2 M-R/LRP immunoreactivity was identified in reactive astrocytes, indicating that expression of this receptor is regulated in vivo in response to brain injury. α 2 M-R/LRP immunoreactivity was also detected in glial cell tumors; this finding is novel since malignant transformation is typically thought to turn off expression of this receptor...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The glial {{cells of}} the retina aid in {{function}} and maintenance of the retina. The <b>macroglia,</b> Muller cells and the retinal astrocytes, become reactive following injury or disease in the retina, a response that is characterized by hypertrophy, dedifferentiation, loss of functionality, proliferation, and remodeling of tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM). The microglia which are the resident macrophages, also respond to injury/disease becoming activated, undergoing characteristic molecular and morphological changes, which include regulation of secreted factors, changes in inflammatory response and increased phagocytosis. Reactivity in Muller glia {{is thought to be}} the result of secreted signals, such as epidermal growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and broblast growth factor, which are released at the injury site to interact with quiescent glial cells. Furthermore, microglia and <b>macroglia</b> have been shown by some studies to interact following activation. While BMPs are known to be upregulated following injury in the CNS, little information is available concerning their role in reactive gliosis in the retina. We hypothesize that BMP 7 indirectly triggers Muller gliosis by activating microglia. Using RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence and western blot, we assessed changes in gliosis markers in the mouse retinal glia following treatment with BMP. Our results showed that BMP 7 was able to trigger Muller cell gliosis in the retina in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ablation of microglia lead to a subdued gliosis response in the mouse retina following BMP 7 exposure. Thus, BMP 7 triggers activation of retinal microglia in addition to the Muller glia. IFN-gamma and IL 6 could play a role in microglia mediated activation of Muller glia, following exposure to BMP 7. We also assessed the role of the Hippo/YAP pathway in the regulation of gliosis in the retina. We demonstrated that YAP was localized to the nucleus of the Muller {{cells of the}} retina and was upregulated in IFN-gamma induced gliosis in the mouse retina. 1 yea...|$|E

However, the functional repair promoted by OEC transplants was partial in the best cases, depending on lesion type and location.

40|$|Microglia are {{mononuclear}} phagocytes that reside {{within the}} central nervous system (CNS). They differ from <b>macroglia</b> (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in terms of their origin, phenotype and functions, but more closely resemble tissue-resident macrophages in all these aspects. The principal role of microglia is to provide a first line of defence against pathological insults at this primary site. Modern consensus holds that microglia are of myeloid origin, much like tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes within other organs, and arise during fetal development from progenitors in the yolk sac, liver or spleen or from mesenchymal tissues surrounding the nervous system that subsequently seed the CNS during gestation and perinatally, and differentiate morphologically to ramified and immunophenotypically suppressed adult varieties (20, 31).

40|$|Investigations {{performed}} on minute {{structures of the}} cerebellum in the albino rat by a modification of Bielschowsky 2 ̆ 7 s silver stain method have revealed the following findings: (1) All the fine branches of the Purkinje dendrite that run horizontally end free in the molecular layer. Each one of these fibrils terminates in an oese which the author has termed 2 ̆ 2 osen Korperchen. 2 ̆ 2 Among the fibrils that have oese-shaped terminations are the fibrils given off from the Purkinje dendrite {{and the process of}} the basket cell, and the climbing fibers and horizontal fibers that run in the molecular layer. The fibrils given off from the dendrite, which climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer, reach the surface of the cerebellar cortex, with the ultimate branches ramifying {{in the form of an}} umbrella, and ending in the innermost membrane which covers the surface of the cortex. The axon of a Purkinje cell has only two or three short collaterals that end free in the granular layer. (2) The descending branches given off from a basket cell concern in the formation of a basket-like nest, the upper Part of which is formed of fibers originating in the axon of the basket cell, and the lower part of which is made up of fibers originating in the medulla. The delicate twigs given off from the fibers forming a basket-like nest have terminations in the form of oese, and connect with the Purkinje cell. (3) climbing fibers originating in the medulla climb upward, winding spirally about the Purkinje dendrites and their branches. There are other fibers which climb parallel to the dendrites and their branches. They could also be classified as climbing fibers. (4) Countless horizontal nerve fibers that run horizontally in the tholecular layer have been found to be the horizontal branches given off either from the nerve fibers that climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer or from the axons of basket cells. The perpendicular nerve fibers climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer, and reach the surface of the cortex. (5) The Fananas nouroglia cell occurs in the molecular. layer. It has a process which, being given off from the upperpole alone, climbs perpendicularly in the molecular layer, and resembles oligodendroglia in form and structure. Large than Hortegaglia, the Fananas cell would be of a special type of oligodendroglia. (6) New types of neuroglia cells have been identified in the molecular layer: the cell of type 1 which, resembling as it does the Fananas, cell, has a process which, being given off only from the lower pole, descends in the molecular layer; and the cell of type 2 is a small round cell which always surrounds the Purkinje cell in the molecular and granular layers, and which has radial processes, the end of which connect with the fibrils of the basket cell, The neuroglia cells of this type form satellites around the Purkinje cells. (7) There are epitherial neuroglia cells of Golgi, which are located between the Purkinje cells. They have linear or Y-shaped processes which climb perpendicularly in the molecular layer, and reach the surface of the cortex. Having collaterals, the process connects with the Purkinje dendrites, as well as with the processes of adjoining nerve cells of the same variety. (8) Granular cells are of two forms: the one consists of a small nucleus and a large amount of cytoplasm, while the other has a large nucleus and a small amount of cytoplasm. Between these granular cells, there are the lymphatic lumen, the accumulated colloidal granules, the dendrites of granular cells and the oeseshaped terminations of moss fibers. These elements are connected with one another. It would seem that the granular cell is a form of nerve cells producing secretions, and that the colloidal granule is its product which is to be absorbed into the lymphatic lumen. (9) The Golgi cells located directly beneath the Purkinje cells are bipolar cells which resemble the Purkinje cells, but those located elsewhere are all multipolar cells. (10) The three types of neuroglia cells-macroglia, oligodendroglia and Hortegaglia-occur in every layer of the cerebellum. It has been found that there are two varieties of <b>macroglia,</b> big and little, and that the latter includes those that are transitional in form from oligodendroglia. <b>Macroglia</b> forms glial little foot in the capillary wall.

In addition, since water movements also occur through specialized water channels and transporters, GABAAR signaling could affect the movement of water by regulating {{the function of the}} channels and transporters involved, thereby affecting not only the direction of the water fluxes but also their dynamics. We will here review recent observations indicating that in neural cells GABAAR-mediated osmotic regulation affects the cellular volume thereby activating multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms important for cell proliferation, maturation, and survival. In addition, we will discuss evidence that the osmotic regulation exerted by GABA may contribute to brain water homeostasis in physiological and in pathological conditions causing brain edema, in which the GABAergic transmission is often altered...|$|E
40|$|Glial {{cells are}} now {{recognised}} {{to be important}} modulators of the innate immune response in the nervous system. While the focus to date has primarily been on astrocytes and Schwann cells, the immunomodulatory properties of a third class of <b>macroglia,</b> olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), also warrant investigation. OECs reside in the primary olfactory system and ensheath the olfactory nerves along their length from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulbs in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Olfactory neurons are unique among neurons in providing uninterrupted conduits for neurotropic pathogens to spread from the external environment directly into the brain. There is continual turnover of olfactory neurons throughout life and OECs phagocytose the axonal debris to facilitate new axonal growth. Given that infected olfactory neurons undergo widespread apoptosis, it is likely that OECs contribute to the innate immune response to such infections. This chapter will discuss recent data demonstrating that OECs are immunocompetent cells {{in a manner similar to}} astrocytes, and that this has significant implications for the use of OECs in spinal cord transplantation therapies...|$|E
40|$|Following our {{previous}} review of teleost microglia,we focus {{here on the}} morphological and histochemicalfeatures of the three principal <b>macroglia</b> types in the teleostcentral nervous system (ependymal cells, astrocyte-likecells/radial glia and oligodendrocytes). This review isconcerned with recent literature and not only providesinsights into the various individual aspects of the differenttypes of macroglial cells plus a comparison with mammalianglia, but also indicates the several potentials that theneural tissue of teleosts exhibits in neurobiological research. Indeed, {{some areas of the}} teleost brain areparticularly suitable in terms of the establishment of a“simple” but complete research model (i. e. the visualpathway complex and the supramedullary neuron clusterin puffer fish). The relationships between neurons and glialcells are considered in fish, with the aim of providing anintegrated picture of the complex ways in which neuronsand glia communicate and collaborate in normal andinjured neural tissues. The recent setting up of successfulprotocols for fish glia and mixed neuron-glia cultures,together with the molecular facilities offered by theknowledge of some teleost genomes, should allow consistentinput towards the achievement of this aim...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the morphological and functional {{organization of the}} human retina, choroid-retinal complex, neuronal cells of the retina, glial cells of the retina, and retinal vessels. The retina is the most internal of the three sheets that coat the posterior wall of the eye. This sheet extends from the optical nerve to the pupil-iris border, {{and it can be}} divided into an optical part, dedicated to the function of vision, and a blind part, in conjunction with the border of the pupil. The choroid is the intermediate layer of the three sheets of the posterior wall of the eye. The Bruch's membrane extends from the optic disk to the ora serrata. The basal side of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) lies on a basement membrane that is uniform in thickness throughout the retina. <b>Macroglia</b> are cells that regulate the retinal metabolism and modulate neuron function and blood vessels. The ganglion cells and bipolar cells receive their blood supply from these arterioles and their capillaries, whereas photoreceptor elements receive nourishment from the underlying choroidal vascular bed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} experimental investigations dealing with the study of a role of morphofunctional nerve cell changes {{in the development of}} postresuscitative encephalopathies. It has been established that there are general regulations, time course and some mechanisms of changes in the density and composition of neuronal populations in the rehabilitative period after clinical death. A relationship {{of the state of the}} brain to the duration of ischemia and the rates of neurological recovery was found at the level of neuronal populations. The individual and typological features of development of postresuscitative cerebral changes were revealed. The significance of <b>macroglia</b> in the development of postresuscitative disease was defined. There was a relationship of abnormal changes in the neuronal populations with their immunoresponsiveness to thermal shock protein. The implication of the detected impairments was established in the development of posthypoxic encephalopathies. It is suggested that further immunocytochemical studies of neurospecific proteins and neurotrophic factors will make a considerable contribution to the solution of a problem associated with the prevention and treatment of postresuscitative encephalopathies.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Neuropathic pain {{refers to}} a variety of chronic pain {{conditions}} with differing underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and origins. Recent studies indicate a communication between the immune system and the nervous system. A common underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain is the presence of inflammation {{at the site of the}} damaged or affected nerve(s). This inflammatory response initiates a cascade of events resulting in the concentration and activation of innate immune cells at the site of tissue injury. The release of immunoactive substances such as cytokines, neurotrophic factors, and chemokines initiate local actions and can result in a more generalized immune response. The resultant neuroinflammatory environment can cause activation of glial cells located in the spinal cord and the brain, which appear to play a prominent role in nociception. Glial cells, also known as neuroglia, are nonconducting cells that modulate neurotransmission at the synaptic level. Glial cells can be subdivided into two primary categories: microglia and <b>macroglia,</b> which include astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Astrocytes and microglia are known to play a role in the development, spread, and potentiation of neuropathic pain.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is an {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that causes}} severe {{central nervous system}} infection in humans and animals. The ability of this bacterium to penetrate nerve cells was investigated by using rat spinal cell cultures. Entry into distinct cell types, i. e., glial cells and neurons, was monitored by a differential im-munofluorescence technique with antibodies against cell type-specific markers and the bacterial pathogen. L. monocytogenes was detected predominantly within macrophages constituting the microglia. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, the major components of <b>macroglia,</b> were infected to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, Listeria innocua, a noninvasive and nonpathogenic species, also {{has the capacity to}} enter into these three types of glial cells. Entry into neurons was a very rare event. In contrast, we found that L. monocytogenes could efficiently invade neurons when these latter cells were cocultivated with Listeria-infected mouse macrophages. In this case, infection of neurons occurs by cell-to-cell spread via an actA-dependent mechanism. These data support the notion that infected phagocytes can be vectors by which L. monocytogenes gains access to privileged niches such as the central nervous system. Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous, gram-positive, facul-tative intracellular bacterium responsible for infrequent but often serious opportunistic infections in humans and animals...|$|E
40|$|Neurological {{injury is}} a {{frequent}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} from general anesthesia and related surgical procedures that could be alleviated by development of effective, easy to administer and safe preconditioning treatments. We seek to define the neural immune signaling responsible for cold-preconditioning as means to identify novel targets for therapeutics development to protect brain before injury onset. Low-level pro-inflammatory mediator signaling changes over time are essential for cold-preconditioning neuroprotection. This signaling is consistent with the basic tenets of physiological conditioning hormesis, which require that irritative stimuli reach a threshold magnitude with sufficient time for adaptation to the stimuli for protection to become evident. Accordingly, delineation of the immune signaling involved in cold-preconditioning neuroprotection requires that biological systems and experimental manipulations plus technical capacities are highly reproducible and sensitive. Our approach is to use hippocampal slice cultures as an in vitro model that closely reflects their in vivo counterparts with multi-synaptic neural networks influenced by mature and quiescent <b>macroglia</b> / microglia. This glial state is particularly important for microglia since they are the principal source of cytokines, which are operative in the femtomolar range. Also, slice cultures can be maintained in vitro for several weeks, which is sufficient time to evoke activating stimuli an...|$|E
