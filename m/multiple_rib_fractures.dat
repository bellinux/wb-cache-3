Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries.

Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis.

In traumatic cases where chest compression is not effective, such as <b>multiple</b> <b>rib</b> <b>fracture</b> and significant loss of blood volume from bleeding, contrast-enhancement would be insufficient {{due to the lack of}} effective perfusion of the contrast media in the body.

40|$|Abstract Background Cronkhite-Canada {{syndrome}} (CCS) {{is a rare}} multiple gastrointestinal polyposis. Up till now, many {{complications of}} CCS {{have been reported in}} the literature, but rib fracture is not included. Case Presentation We report a case of a 58 -year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with a 6 -month history of frequent diarrhea, intermittent hematochezia and a weight loss of 13 kg. On admission, physical examination revealed alopecia of the scalp, hyperpigmentation of the hands and soles, and dystrophy of the fingernails. Laboratory data revealed hypocalcaemia and hypoproteinemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, video capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed various sizes of generalized gastrointestinal polyps. Histological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained from the stomach and the colon showed adenomatous polyp and inflammatory polyp respectively. Thus, a diagnosis of CCS was made. After treatment with corticosteroids for 24 days and nutritional support for two months, his clinical condition improved. Two months later, he was admitted to our hospital for the second time with frequent diarrhea and weight loss. The chest radiography revealed fractures of the left sixth and seventh ribs. Examinations, including emission computed tomography, bone densitometry test, and other serum parameters, were performed, but could not identify the definite etiology of the rib fractures. One month later, the patient suffered from aggravating <b>multiple</b> <b>rib</b> <b>fractures</b> due to the ineffective treatment, persistent hypocalcaemia and malnutrition. Conclusions This is the first case of a CCS patient with <b>multiple</b> <b>rib</b> <b>fractures.</b> Although the association between CCS and <b>multiple</b> <b>rib</b> <b>fractures</b> in this case remains uncertain, we presume that persistent hypocalcaemia and malnutrition contribute to this situation, or at least aggravate this rare complication. Besides, since prolonged corticosteroid therapy will result in an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture, CCS patients who accept corticosteroid therapy could be potential victims of rib fracture. </p...|$|E
