Does “family” have an impact? Is the effect of family related variables similar among genders? With a French survey, we find that if postdoc is as common for women as for men, females are less mobile internationally, especially in direction of the United States. The impact of the “family” on the probability of taking a postdoc position and on the location of postdoc is different among genders. Married women take less frequently such appointments and, when they do so, they are less mobile internationally. There are no similar effects for males. migration; geographical mobility; brain drain; immigrants; family; skilled labor; doctorate; gender gap...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the major patterns and drivers of interlinked geographical and career <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> Indian-born <b>researchers</b> and scientists. Based {{on a global}} survey of 4, 600 Indian researchers and 40 in-depth interviews, this study provides evidence on the internationalisation of careers and the diversification of destinations of Indian-born academics. Our survey indicates that about a third <b>of</b> all Indian <b>researchers</b> have some international study or professional experience at some stage of their career. Prime destinations are still the US, Canada, and the UK, but outside these ‘academic core’ destinations some new European and East Asian destinations are emerging {{and are expected to}} play a more prominent role in the future. <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> Indian <b>researchers</b> is mainly driven by an intrinsic motivation to internationalise their scientific careers, but has also to do with the status quo of the research environment in India. Moving abroad enables researchers to acquire expertise in a field of research that is not sufficiently developed back home, and provides exposure to research facilities and personnel deemed better and more qualified than those back home. In this respect, international study and work experience are often perceived of as providing professional merits which are instrumental in career progression upon return to India. This happens through the acquisition of tangible – specialisation, access to new networks and funding – and immaterial resources: ‘know-how’, quality and reputation of degrees and work experience, new managerial skills. This study also sheds some light on the role of destination countries’ immigration policies, which seems to play a minor role in the <b>mobility</b> decisions <b>of</b> Indian scientists. However, even if researchers do not really take migration policies into account in their decision making process, we cannot conclude that their international mobility is barrier-free. Immigration policies and rights to work may affect the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> scientists rather indirectly by influencing the recruitment decisions of employers and departments in destination countries, without the candidates themselves being aware of these criteria...|$|R

At {{the end of the}} 2000 s, this number was estimated as 20 % (Roshina and Yudkevich 2009). Latest studies of publication activity in leading Russian universities show that less than 10 % of teaching staff publishes in international journals (Arefyev 2014).

30|$|In Russia, {{internal}} <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> {{is low and}} {{the government}} thus far has not {{paid much attention to}} this characteristic of labor resources. Mobility, as a knowledge transfer, is seen by the government mostly in terms of development of the science base in the government sector (research institutes and universities) but not as an instrument for fostering commercialization of research results. Such low mobility is rooted in Soviet legacy, including traditions as inbreeding, when universities persistently hire their own graduates.|$|E
30|$|Mobility {{studies are}} linked to human-capital theories.

A combination of different types of human capital is more likely to produce innovation than a mere increase in any particular type.

30|$|ISM {{is one of}} the {{paradigms}} in {{the sociology}} of science and scientometrics. New approaches in scientometrics often arise not from discarding current paradigms, but rather by expanding them to provide more substantial information. In this article we have expanded the paradigm of ISM by studying the synchronous international scientific <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> Russian <b>researchers.</b> Since ISM is a global structure, its components should be investigated in their synchronous relationships. Needless to say, the evolution of ISM means that new synchronous relationships are continually being generated. However, the core patterns of the ISM system can only be identified by means of synchronous analysis. Analysis of synchronous international scientific mobility (SISM for short) as the aggregate of permanent statistical relationships between affiliations reveals the structure of ISM. This structure is presented in our paper as the space of affiliations.|$|R

30|$|Until recently, the {{internal}} <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> Russian <b>researchers</b> {{has not been}} studied. Russian scholars concentrated mostly on the exploration <b>of</b> external (international) <b>mobility,</b> which for Russia is better known as “brain drain”. Such imbalance in studies of different types <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> is {{explained by the fact}} that brain drain is a highly politicized topic. Studies of brain drain started in Russia in the beginning of the 1990 s, when the most common view was that brain drain is a danger for the country since not only researchers leave but also with them - technical and technological know-how. Another popular direction of research was “the cost to train a researcher” and, thus, financial losses are caused by brain drain. Some discussants were even suggesting setting a price for every leaving researcher - analogous to a process of selling football players. However, despite the high level of attention to the problem of brain drain, there are no reliable quantitative data on its relative scale and evolution (Dezhina 2002).|$|R
