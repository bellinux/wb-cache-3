50|$|In the {{electricity}} grid at any <b>moment</b> <b>balance</b> {{must be maintained}} between electricity consumption and generation - otherwise disturbances in power quality or supply may occur. Wind generation is a direct function of wind speed and, in contrast to conventional generation systems, is not easily dispatchable. Fluctuations of wind generation thus receive {{a great amount of}} attention. Variability of wind generation can be regarded at various time scales. First, wind power production is subject to seasonal variations, i.e. it may be higher in winter in Northern Europe due to low-pressure meteorological systems or it may be higher in summer in the Mediterranean regions owing to strong summer breezes. There are also daily cycles which may be substantial, mainly due to daily temperature changes. Finally, fluctuations are observed at the very short-term scale (at the minute or intra-minute scale). The variations are not of the same order for these three different timescales. Managing the variability of wind generation is the key aspect associated to the optimal integration of that renewable energy into electricity grids.|$|E

Therefore, additional redundancy bits {{are added to}} the encoded data stream to allow for insertion/deletion correction. In this dissertation, <b>moment</b> <b>balancing</b> templates are used to add a single insertion/deletion capability to an arbitrary additive-error-correcting code. <b>Moment</b> <b>balancing</b> can be used for systematic encoding of number-theoretic codes. The selection of a particular additive-error-correcting codebook has potential influence on the <b>moment</b> <b>balancing</b> template. In direct relation to this, partition distributions of linear sets are considered and their connection to <b>moment</b> <b>balancing</b> templates illustrated. As an alternative to fixed length <b>moment</b> <b>balancing</b> templates, a variable length approach to <b>moment</b> <b>balancing</b> is also considered.

MethodsGeometrical measures were determined in hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients (n= 5) and healthy controls (n= 5). Bilateral differences between the spastic arm and the unaffected side were compared to bilateral differences between the dominant and non-dominant side in the healthy controls. Hypothetical effects of bone torsion on potential maximal forearm rotation moment were calculated using an existing anatomical muscle model. FindingsPatients showed significantly smaller (radius: 41. 6 %; ulna: 32. 9 %) and shorter (radius: 9. 1 %; ulna: 8. 4 %) forearm bones in the non-dominant arm than in the dominant arm compared to controls (radius: 2. 4 %; ulna 2. 5 % and radius: 1. 5 %; ulna: 1. 0 % respectively). Furthermore, patients showed a significantly higher torsion angle difference (radius: 24. 1 °; ulna: 26. 2 °) in both forearm bones between arms than controls (radius: 2. 0 °; ulna 1. 0 °).
