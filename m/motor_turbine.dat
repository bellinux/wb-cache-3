40|$|For wide use of {{coal and}} oil {{processing}} wastes in heat power industry we investigated the structural stability of coal-water slurries (CWS) and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals (CWSP). Three methods of evaluating slurry stability were considered. The method of evaluation of separation (into layers) of the slurry {{was chosen to}} determine the stability of fuel compositions based on bituminous and brown coal, filter cakes of bituminous coals, waste <b>motor,</b> <b>turbine,</b> transformer, compressor oils, oil, oiled mixture and mazut. The experiments shown, that the addition of waste oils (with mass fraction of 10 %) to investigated fuel compositions leads to increase of slurry segmental stability is almost by 2 times...|$|E
40|$|To use widespreadly {{the waste}} of coals and oils {{processing}} in the great and the small-scale power generation, the key parameter, which is sectional constancy of promising organic coal-water fuels (OCWF), was studied. The compo-sitions of OCWF from brown and bituminous coals, filter cakes, used <b>motor,</b> <b>turbine</b> and dielectrical oils, water-oil emul-sion and special wetting agent (plasticizer) were investigated. Two modes of preparation were considered. They are with homogenizer and cavitator. It was established that the constancy did not exceed 5 – 7 days for the compositions of OCWF with brown coals, and 12 – 15 days for that compositions with bituminous coals and filter cakes. The injection of used oils in a composition of OCWF led to increase in viscosity of fuel compositions and their sectional constancy...|$|E
40|$|To {{converge}} {{the conditions}} of organic water-coal fuel composition combustion in the typical power equipment we developed a new approach and installed an experimental setup, eliminating the traditional fixing the fuel droplets on the thermocouples or rods. Specialized cone-shaped chamber was used to implement the process of lingering of organic water-coal fuel droplets. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the lingering of organic water-coal fuel droplets were established. We determined {{the parameters of the}} system (droplet size of 0. 4 - 0. 6 mm, temperatures 823 - 903 K and the velocity of the oxidizer flow 1. 5 - 6 m/s) at which the droplets were consistently ignited in the process of lingering. Minimum temperatures and ignition delay times of organic water-coal fuel droplets based on brown coal, used <b>motor,</b> <b>turbine,</b> transformer oils, kerosene, gasoline and water were defined...|$|E

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{recently}} proposed Coiled Tube Turbodrilling technology for drilling deep hard rocks mineral exploration. Coiled Tube (CT) is a continuous length of ductile steel or composite tube that itself cannot rotate {{and therefore a}} down hole motor is needed to provide mechanical power to the bit. Amongst the down hole <b>motors,</b> turbodrills (<b>turbine</b> down hole <b>motors)</b> are an excellent fit with CT operations for hard rocks, providing a smooth borehole with little vibrational effects during drilling with high output rotational speed. The <b>turbine</b> <b>motor</b> section has multistage of rotors and stators which convert the hydraulic power to mechanical power. This paper presents a methodology for designing turbodrills with asymmetric rotor or stator blades configurations. Here, the turbodrill is designed specifically for small size CT system providing suitable output power and rotation speed with applicable input flow properties. Also, {{the results of a}} few numerical simulations carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code are presented. The results help in choosing the best <b>turbine</b> <b>motor</b> configurations to obtain optimum rotational speed and torque during drilling hard rocks for small hole size exploration applications. Similar methodology can be used to design and choose the best turbodrill for other hard rocks drilling conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Industrial {{fans and}} blowers are {{machines}} whose primary {{function is to}} provide and accommodate a large flow of air or gas to various parts of a building or other structures. This is achieved by rotating a number of blades, connected to a hub and shaft, and driven by a <b>motor</b> or <b>turbine.</b> The flow rates of these mechanical fans range from approximately [...] to [...] per minute. A blower is another name for a fan that operates where the resistance to the flow is primarily on the downstream side of the fan.|$|R
50|$|When {{a driver}} like an {{electric}} <b>motor</b> or a <b>turbine</b> is coupled to a pump, generator, {{or any other}} piece of equipment, {{it is essential that}} the shafts of the two pieces are aligned. Any misalignment between the two increases the stress on the shafts and will almost certainly result in excessive wear and premature breakdown of the equipment. This can be very costly. When the equipment is down, production might be down. Also bearings or mechanical seals may be damaged and need to be replaced. Flexible couplings are designed to allow a driver (electric <b>motor,</b> engine, <b>turbine,</b> hydraulic <b>motor)</b> to be connected to the driven equipment. Flexible couplings use an elastomeric insert to allow a slight degree of misalignment. Flexible couplings can also use shim packs. These couplings are called disc couplings. Tools used to achieve alignment may be mechanical or optical, like the Laser shaft alignment method, or they are gyroscope based. The gyroscope based systems can be operated very time efficient and can also be even used if the shafts have a large distance (e.g. on marine vessels).|$|R
50|$|After Cambridge, Crosfield {{joined the}} British Thomson-Houston Company (BTH) at Rugby {{as a student}} apprentice, where he worked in {{departments}} testing electric <b>motors,</b> <b>turbines</b> and generators, and in the drafting, design and estimating departments. Adjoining the turbine department, where the monotony of the production line exasperated him, was Frank Whittle's laboratory. Crosfield sneaked {{in to see the}} first prototype of a jet engine. Frustrated at being stuck for six months in the drafting department, Crosfield left BTH in February 1938 to continue his apprenticeship at ASEA, based in their headquarters in Västeräs, Sweden. The summer of 1939 found him in Stockholm at one of ASEA's companies making electric lifts. He was on a painting holiday in the Skärgäden when he heard that the Luftwaffe had bombed Warsaw. After a false start he reached Newcastle by boat from Bergen and, as he had sailed in the Baltic, he volunteered for the Navy. He had to wait for his papers and ASEA gave him a job to install a newspaper drive at Manchester for Allied Newspapers, his first work on a printing press. Crosfield was impatient to get into the Navy, where he wanted to join a fighting ship. He explained his frustration to an acquaintance at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, who referred him to a friend in the Admiralty.|$|R
