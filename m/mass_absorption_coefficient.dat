500|$|Boyd {{was born}} to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in Tignall, Georgia, a small town near the eastern border {{of the state of}} Georgia. He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Georgia, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from Duke University. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at Yale University in 1930, and was a graduate assistant there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled Scattering of X-Rays by Cold-Worked and by Annealed Beryllium. In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, cold-worked and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are [...] "rather imperfect", that annealing caused [...] "no appreciable change" [...] in beryllium's lattice structure, and that the <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the theoretical value calculated using Compton's empirical formula.|$|E

2500|$|All {{elements}} absorb X-rays to some extent. Each element has {{a characteristic}} absorption spectrum {{which consists of}} a [...] "saw-tooth" [...] succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the count rate [...] {{compared with the same}} concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.|$|E

A mica crystal was used as the monochromator. The construction and alignment procedure for the spectrometer are described together with the operation of a thin-window gas flow proportional counting system for measurement of the incident and transmitted X-ray flux. Nordfors method for measuring the scattered X-ray background in the spectrometer and calculating the optimum counting times for a given absorber thickness has been employed throughout. The preparation and mounting of the absorbing foils is described, including the use of Polypropylene as a substrate. The experimental values are compared with those available from the literature and also with the 'Universal' curve of Jonsson.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{polynomial}} coefficients and a semi-empirical relation using {{which one can}} derive photon <b>mass</b> energy <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of any H-, C-, N-, O-based sample of biological interest containing any other elements in the atomic number range 2 - 40 and energy range 200 - 1500 keV. More interestingly, {{it has been observed}} in the present work that in this energy range, both the mass attenuation coefficients and the <b>mass</b> energy <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> for such samples vary only with respect to energy. Hence it was possible to represent the photon interaction properties of such samples by a mean value of these coefficients. By an independent study of the variation of the mean mass attenuation coefficient as well as <b>mass</b> energy <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> with energy, two simple semi-empirical relations for the photon <b>mass</b> energy <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> and one relation for the mass attenuation coefficient have been obtained in the energy range 200 - 1500 keV. It is felt that these semi-empirical relations can be very handy and convenient in biomedical and other applications. One possible significant conclusion {{based on the results of}} the present work is that in the energy region 200 - 1500 keV, the photon interaction characteristics of any H-, C-, N-, O-based sample of biological interest which may or may not contain any other elements in the atomic number range 2 - 40 can be represented by a sample-independent (single) but energy-dependent mass attenuation <b>coefficient</b> and <b>mass</b> energy <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient...</b>|$|R

Evidence is presented that the existing sets of <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> for carbon K a radiation are perhaps not fuUy consistent and a new set is therefore proposed, which is in better agreement with the experimental results.

5000|$|When X-rays hit matter, {{part of the}} {{incoming}} beam is transmitted through the material {{and part of it}} is absorbed by the material. The amount absorbed is dependent on the material's <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> and tends to decrease for incident photons of greater energy. True absorption occurs when X-rays of sufficient energy cause electron energy level transitions in the atoms of the absorbing material. The energy from these X-rays are used to excite the atoms and do not continue past the material (thus being [...] "filtered" [...] out). Because of this, despite the general trend of decreased absorption at higher energy wavelengths, there are periodic spikes in the absorption characteristics of any given material corresponding to each of the atomic energy level transitions. These spikes are called absorption edges. The result is that every material preferentially filters out x-rays corresponding to and slightly above their electron energy levels, while generally allowing X-rays with energies slightly less than these levels to transmit through relatively unscathed.|$|E

40|$|Coral {{skeletal}} density {{information is}} a useful growth parameter and may be coupled with extension rates to determine calcification rates. The conventional process for density determination is often cumbersome and requires some parameters which are difficult to precisely specify (e. g., <b>Mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients).</b> We have developed a technique and windows based computer program which enables the rapid collection of coral density data. The coral skeleton slab is xradiographed with an aluminum wedge. Thickness and density of the aluminum wedge, thickness of the coral slab, density of pure coral aragonite, and digitized images of the coral and wedge x-radiographs provide necessary input. The program uses the wedge image and an empirically determined ratio of relative <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients,</b> (thus removing difficulties with absolute values) in an equation relating wedge optic density and thickness to coral skeletal density. A transect is defined on the coral x-radiograph image, normal to growth band boundaries. Optic density of pixels are converted to skeletal density, averaged, and plotted. Variations of skeletal density along the transect are expressed as peaks and valleys corresponding to high and low density band portions.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} mineral compositions by {{measurement of the}} X-ray <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> has been investigated. Absorption measurements have been made on several simple two and three component systems.

The method may be extended in particular circumstances to allow determination of three component systems. Several examples are presented, and the applicability of the technique is discussed. Previous calculations have indicated that the absorption of a rock relative to some standard is almost constant over a large range in wavelength. Direct measurements suggest that this relationship holds only if the relative absorption has a value close to 1. 0. The relationship has considerable potential for use in rapid matrix corrections in X-ray fluorescence spectrography, since a single measurement at a convenient wavelength gives a relative matrix correction which is applicable over a large wavelength range...|$|E

40|$|Imperial College, London SUMMARY. A {{quantitative}} X-ray {{diffraction method}} {{has been successfully}} applied to the determination f anal-time in pumice rock samples. A calibration line was constructed from spiked pumice standards (range: o to 4 2 %) and the mean relative rror of the standards on the calibration line was < o. 6 %. The major-element compo-sitions of the samples and standards were available, and this allowed the total <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> tobe calculated. The latter were then used to correct the sample and standard intensities for absorption effects resulting from compositional variations. When compositional data already exist, the calculation of the total <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> provides a rapid and accurate alternative to direct measurement, or o {{the use of an}} internal standard. VARIOUS techniques for quantitative X-ray diffractometric (XRD) determination of mineral concentrations have been discussed by Klug and Alexander (I 973). If an internal standard is not used then a knowledge of the <b>mass</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the samples and standards is required. These coefficients may be determined directly on the powders (Leroux et al., I 953; Williams, 1959; Norrish and Taylor, I 962; Niskanen, i 964). As an alternative to direct measurement, the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> may be calculated, provided that major-element concen-tration data is available for the powders. While Klug and Alexander (1973) discuss in detail a large number of quantitative XRD techniques, they do not include the method of calculating the absorp-tion correction, and {{the purpose of this paper}} is to draw attention to the potential of this technique in quantitative XRD. The present work is concerned with the quanti-tative determination f analcime in certain pumice samples recovered from the Vulsini volcano in central Italy. The volcanic rocks from this area are noted for their high potassium values and the presence of leucite. Leucite readily alters to anal-cime even at relatively low surface (25 ~ tem-peratures (Gupta and Fyfe, 1975).
