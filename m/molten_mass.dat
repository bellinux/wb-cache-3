In the case of Paudash Lake, and a number of other Haliburton and Muskoka lakes, the local bedrock is metamorphosed sedimentary roack, including limestone (now marble), which helps to neutralize Acid rain which creates problems for lakes throughout North America and Europe.|$|E

These contrasting theories offered differing explanations of how the rock layers of the Earth’s surface had formed.

[...] The theory extended chemical theories that had been developing since the seventeenth century and was promoted by Scotland's [...] John Walker, Sweden's Johan Gottschalk Wallerius and Germany's [...] Abraham Werner. [...] Of these names, Werner's views become internationally influential around 1800. [...] He argued that the Earth’s layers, including basalt and granite, had formed as a precipitate from an ocean that covered the entire Earth. Werner’s system was influential and those who accepted his theory were known as Diluvianists or Neptunists. The Neptunist thesis was the most popular during the late eighteenth century, especially for those who were chemically trained. [...] However, another thesis slowly gained currency from the 1780s forward. [...] Instead of water, some mid eighteenth-century naturalists such as Buffon had suggested that strata had been formed through heat (or fire). [...] The thesis was modified and expanded by the Scottish naturalist James Hutton during the 1780s. [...] He argued against the theory of Neptunism, proposing instead the theory of based on heat. [...] Those who followed this thesis during the early nineteenth century referred to this view as Plutonism: the formation of the Earth through the gradual solidification of a <b>molten</b> <b>mass</b> at a slow rate by the same processes that had occurred throughout history and continued in the present day.

60|$|But {{there is}} another sense in which the Dominion of Canada, or {{at least part of}} it, is perhaps the oldest country in the world. According to the Nebular Theory the whole of our planet was once a fiery <b>molten</b> <b>mass</b> {{gradually}} cooling and hardening itself into the globe we know. On its surface moved and swayed a liquid sea glowing with such a terrific heat that we can form no real idea of its intensity. As the mass cooled, vast layers of vapour, great beds of cloud, miles and miles in thickness, were formed and hung over the face of the globe, obscuring from its darkened surface the piercing beams of the sun. Slowly the earth cooled, until great masses of solid matter, rock as we call it, still penetrated with intense heat, rose {{to the surface of the}} boiling sea. Forces of inconceivable magnitude moved through the mass. The outer surface of the globe as it cooled ripped and shrivelled like a withering orange. Great ridges, the mountain chains of to-day, were furrowed on its skin. Here in the darkness of the prehistoric night there arose as the oldest part of the surface of the earth the great rock bed that lies in a huge crescent round the shores of Hudson Bay, from Labrador to the unknown wilderness of the barren lands of the Coppermine basin touching the Arctic sea. The wanderer who stands to-day in the desolate country of James Bay or Ungava is among the oldest monuments of the world. The rugged rock which here and there breaks through the thin soil of the infertile north has lain on the spot from the very dawn of time. Millions of years have probably elapsed since the cooling of the outer crust of the globe produced the solid basis of our continents.|$|E

The old people hereabout have a tradition, that a considerable part of the metal was supplied by a brass cannon, captured in one of the victories of Louis the Fourteenth over the Spaniards, and that a Bourbon princess threw her golden crucifix into the <b>molten</b> <b>mass.</b> It is said, likewise, that a bishop baptized and blessed the bell, and prayed that a heavenly influence might mingle with its tones. When all due ceremonies had been performed, the Grand Monarque bestowed the gift--than which none could resound his beneficence more loudly--on the Jesuits, who were then converting the American Indians to the spiritual dominion of the Pope. So the bell,--our self-same bell, whose familiar voice we may hear at all hours, in the streets,--this very bell sent forth its first-born accents from the tower of a log-built chapel, westward of Lake Champlain, and near the mighty stream of the St. Lawrence. It was called Our Lady's Chapel of the Forest. The peal went forth as if to redeem and consecrate the heathen wilderness. The wolf growled at the sound, as he prowled stealthily through the underbrush; the grim bear turned his back, and stalked sullenly away; the startled doe leaped up, and led her fawn into a deeper solitude. The red men wondered what awful voice was speaking amid the wind that roared through the tree-tops; and, following reverentially its summons, the dark-robed fathers blessed them, as they drew near the cross-crowned chapel. In a little time, there was a crucifix on every dusky bosom. The Indians knelt beneath the lowly roof, worshipping in the same forms that were observed under the vast dome of St. Peter's, when the Pope performed high mass in the presence of kneeling princes. All the religious festivals, that awoke the chiming bells of lofty cathedrals, called forth a peal from Our Lady's Chapel of the Forest. Loudly rang the bell of the wilderness while the streets of Paris echoed with rejoicings for the birthday of the Bourbon, or whenever France had triumphed on some European battle-field. And the solemn woods were saddened with a melancholy knell, as often as the thick-strewn leaves were swept away from the virgin soil, for the burial of an Indian chief.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} {{of these two}} strange functionless elements, although the most striking symptom of the new phase of progressive mechanical civilization now beginning, {{is by no means}} the most essential change in progress. These appearances involve also certain disappearances. I have already indicated pretty clearly that the vast irregular development of irresponsible wealthy people is swallowing up and assimilating more and more the old class of administrative land-owning gentlemen in all their grades and degrees. The old upper class, as a functional member of the State, is being effaced. And I have also suggested that the old lower class, the broad necessary base of the social pyramid, the uneducated inadaptable peasants and labourers, is, with the development of toil-saving machinery, dwindling and crumbling down bit by bit towards the abyss. But side by side with these two processes is a third process of still profounder significance, and that is the reconstruction and the vast proliferation of what constituted the middle class of the old order. It is now, indeed, no longer a middle class at all. Rather all the definite classes in the old scheme of functional precedence have melted and mingled,[25] and in the <b>molten</b> <b>mass</b> there has appeared a vast intricate confusion of different sorts of people, some sailing about upon floating masses of irresponsible property, some buoyed by smaller fragments, some clinging desperately enough to insignificant atoms, a great and varied multitude swimming successfully without aid, or with an amount of aid that is negligible in relation to their own efforts, and an equally varied multitude of less capable ones clinging to the swimmers, clinging to the floating rich, or clutching empty-handed and thrust and sinking down. This is the typical aspect of the modern community. It will serve as a general description of either the United States or any western European State, and the day is not far distant when the extension of means of communication, and of the shareholding method of conducting affairs, will make it applicable to the whole world. Save, possibly, in a few islands and inaccessible places and regardless of colour or creed, this process of deliquescence seems destined to spread. In a great diversity of tongues, in the phases of a number of conflicting moral and theological traditions, in the varying tones of contrasting racial temperaments, the grandchildren of black and white, and red and brown, will be seeking more or less consciously to express themselves in relation to these new and unusual social conditions. But the change itself is no longer amenable to their interpretations, the world-wide spreading of swift communication, the obliteration of town and country, the deliquescence of the local social order, have an air of being processes as uncontrollable by such collective intelligence as men can at present command, and as indifferent to his local peculiarities and prejudices as the movements of winds and tides....|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of sample width and {{sidewalls}} on downward flame spread over extruded polystyrene (XPS) slabs, a series of laboratory-scale experiments were conducted. Flame shape, flame spread rate, mass loss rate and temperature were recorded. For XPS without sidewalls, the average maximum flame height (H) and average flame area per unit of width (A/w) rise linearly with an increase in sample width (w) and mass loss rate per unit of width. When sidewalls are absent, flame spread rate first drops and then rises with an increase in width. This trend is determined by gas-phase heat transfer. When sidewalls are present, flame spread rate increases with a rise in width, and solid-phase heat conduction determines the trend. Sidewall effects are comprised of four aspects: oxygen concentration near the sidewalls and gypsum board is low, which leads to reduced flame heat flux; upward and front air flow is intensified; the flame is stretched, and the surface flame is weakened; and <b>molten</b> XPS <b>mass</b> decreases. For narrow samples, H and A/w with sidewalls are higher than those without sidewalls, while the reverse was observed in wider samples.

Since the rheological behaviour of the <b>molten</b> chocolate <b>mass</b> is key in chocolate production, the rheology of fibre-rich materials in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) is studied and {{compared to the}} rheology of sucrose in MCT. The materials studied are side streams of the fruit and vegetable processing industry: lemon peels, spent grain, grape pomace and pecan fibre. All suspensions showed shear thinning behaviour at volume fractions > 0. 2, where side stream materials showed lower shear thinning behaviour than sucrose. The values for the maximum packing fraction, obtained via the Maron–Pierce equation and using the Casson Plastic Viscosities, were lower for the side stream materials than for sucrose. Addition of lecithin resulted in {{a decrease in the}} Casson Yield Value of sucrose suspensions, which was not observed with the fibre-rich materials. The rheological behaviour of the fibre-rich materials suspended in MCT is explained by the effective volume of the irregularly shaped particles. The behaviour of sucrose suspensions is explained by the formation of aggregates, which seem to be promoted by water bridges between the particles. Overall, the behaviour of the sucrose dispersions was very different compared to the other materials with respect to the shear thinning behaviour, the impact of lecithin as well as the impact of water. Therefore it is suggested that only partial replacement of sucrose by fibre-rich materials will be successful in industrial product development...|$|R

However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. In this thesis industrial aluminium reduction cells and their material handling and dry scrubbing operation were analysed in respect to their energy and material balance. A number of experiments were carried out to study the influence of process parameters and operations on the state and path function of a cell. Bath inventory measurements lead to a better understanding of the underlying process behaviour, and it was obvious that energy and mass balance cannot be controlled independently. With regard to the response of bath inventory, bath and liquidus temperature to pot operation, the following interesting phenomena were identified: -	some cells are active or inactive with respect to their response to aluminium fluoride additions -	positive and negative voltage steps cause non-proportional changes in liquidus and bath temperatures -	the liquidus temperature, bath volume and composition can respond rapidly to changes due to alumina feeding Successful application of the results and understanding developed in this research resulted in an energy requirement reduction of 1 kWh/k...|$|R

Once-through fuel cycles based on solid fuel thermal reactors are found to be the best candidates for mid-century deployment because the substantial increase in electricity costs entailed by reprocessing schemes is unlikely to be justified by the afforded reductions in long-term proliferation and waste management risks. Furthermore, once-through cycles present lower proliferation and waste management risks in the short-term and their inefficient use of uranium is not likely to become an important issue before the middle of the century even under a high growth scenario. by Etienne Parent.

Such stones are known as banded agate, riband agate and striped agate.|$|E
50|$|Nylon 6 can be {{modified}} using comonomers or stabilizers during polymerization to introduce new chain end or functional groups, which changes the reactivity and chemical properties. It’s often done to change its dyeability or flame retardance. Nylon 6 is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of caprolactam. Caprolactam has 6 carbons, hence 'Nylon 6'. When caprolactam is heated at about 533 K in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen for about 4-5 hours, the ring breaks and undergoes polymerization. Then the <b>molten</b> <b>mass</b> is passed through spinnerets to form fibres of nylon 6.|$|E
30|$|The {{reactor vessel}} was dual-shell type with an insert made of titanium, widely {{utilized}} as corrosion-resistant metal, and a pressure shell. The reactor {{used in this}} study was also equipped with auxiliaries such as a stirrer, thermocouples, nozzles, and a pressure gauge. The reaction was initiated by immersing the reactor into <b>molten</b> salt bath (<b>mass</b> ratio of salt was adjusted to K 2 NO 3 :NaNO 2 :NaNO 3  =  6 : 5 : 1). After lapse of predefined time, the reactor was taken out of the bath and subsequently quenched to stop the reaction. HPLC high-pressure pump was used for feeding the distilled water to the reactor to adjust the reaction pressure precisely. The reaction temperature was measured by K-type thermocouple and pressure with digital pressure gauge. The reactor was loaded with deionized water and initial sewage sludge (2 wt % of deionized water) for every experiment (250  rpm and particles size 180  μm). The amount of catalyst was 20 wt % of the organic waste. Then, the air in the reactor was replaced with argon gas. The reactor was sealed and put into the sand bath heated at reaction temperature. It took about 3  min for the reactor to reach the setting reaction temperature around 700  °C. It took about 2  min for final setting of the reaction pressure and reaction time will be considered as zero. As the reaction pressure increased by about 1  MPa than the initial reaction pressure for all experiments, the reaction pressure was assumed to be the initial reaction pressure of the experiment.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{and assessment of}} the late-phase damage progression models in the current version (designated MOD 3. 2) of the SCDAP/RELAP 5 code are described. The SCDAP/RELAP 5 code is being developed at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory under the primary sponsorship of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to provide best-estimate transient simulations of light water reactor coolant systems (RCS) during severe accident conditions. Recent modeling improvements made to the MOD 3. 2 version of the code include (1) molten pool formation and heat up, including the transient start-up of natural circulation heat transfer, (2) in-core molten pool thermal-mechanical crust failure, (3) the melting and relocation of upper plenum structures, and (4) improvements in the modeling of lower plenum debris behavior {{and the potential for}} failure of the lower head. Finally, to eliminate abrupt transitions between core damage states and provide more realistic predictions of late phase accident progression phenomena, a transition smoothing methodology was developed and implemented that results in the calculation of a gradual transition from an intact core geometry through the different core damage states leading to molten pool formation. A wide range of experiments and modeling tools were used to assess the capabilities of MOD 3. 2. The results of the SCDAP/RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 assessment indicate that modeling improvements have significantly enhanced the code capabilities and performance in several areas compared to the earlier code version. New models for transition smoothing between core damage states, and modeling improvements/additions for cladding oxide failure, molten pool behavior, and molten pool crust failure have significantly improved the code usability {{for a wide range of}} applications and have significantly improved the prediction of hydrogen production, <b>molten</b> pool melt <b>mass</b> and core melt relocation time...|$|R
