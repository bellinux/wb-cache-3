40|$|An {{analysis}} of the driving behaviour, based <b>on</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> and 85 % velocity, demonstrates that all types of speed regulation signals are efficient for a reduction of car speed. In addition, {{the order of the}} effect depends on the speed limit in the preceding zone and on several border conditions, e. g. road type, size of a city, location. By linear regression the effect of traffic control measures on the regionally smoothing of the traffic could be quantified. The hazard statistics prove a substantial improvement of traffic security in areas with smoothed traffic.

40|$|It {{has been}} noticed from tests made <b>on</b> a <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> {{catamaran}} model, with central bulbs placed between the demi-hulls [1], that resistance and motion reduction {{are affected by}} bulb size and its placing. By using small size bulbs, moderate reductions are obtained, especially on heavier and larger hulls. By comparing {{the results obtained on}} different displacement catamaran models, but having the same main size and the same bulbs, larger motion reductions have been noticed on the lightest model. For this reason, it has been decided to extend the investigation <b>on</b> a <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> catamaran, by using larger central bulbs and placing also flat plate dampers on the same bulb. The results obtained have been positive and demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution. A detailed description of the catamaran hull and its bulbs will be reported and the most relevant results obtained from the model tests will be shown and discussed...|$|R

This {{research was conducted}} from April 2015 through March 2016 in the laboratory of Microbiology/ Mycology Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Andalas. This study aimed to compare the media effectively {{to the growth of}} mold isolates lignoselulolitik and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity it generates in the response to the lignocellulosic organic waste. Comparison of media composition adapted to the treatment used is Bran 100 %: Sawdust 0 %; Bran 75 %: Sawdust 25 %; Bran 50 %: Sawdust 50 %; Bran 25 %: Sawdust 75 % and Bran 0 %: Sawdust 100 %. Parameters include the observation of mold growth <b>on</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> baglog and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity was measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 310 nm with Veratryl Alcohol as a substrate. The results showed that the ratio of the bran media effectively : sawdust against mycelial growth of mold isolates are on treatment lignoselulolitik bran 75 % : sawdust 25 %, while the activity of lignin peroxidase (LiP) at the highest bran ratio of 50 % : 50 % sawdust...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{potential}} of internal purification methods <b>on</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> diesel engines to meet the IMO Tier III nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission regulations, combined 1 -D engine working cycle simulation and 3 -D CFD simulation were conducted to predict the performance and emissions of the engine under different valve close timings, geometric compression ratios, injection timings, and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rates. The numerical results show that, as the inlet valve close timing is advanced, NOx is reduced {{by as much as}} 27 %, but the peak of premixed combustion heat release rate is increased; this can weaken the ability to reduce NOx with the Miller cycle. Moreover, the peak of premixed combustion heat release rate is reduced when the geometric compression ratio is increased to 15. 4, and linking with injection timing by delaying 6 °CA can further reduce NOx by 55. 3 % from the baseline. Finally, over 80 % NOx reduction can be achieved when the above schemes are combined with over 15 % EGR. The NOx and soot can be reduced simultaneously by using moderate Miller cycle combination with moderate EGR, and the results show a large reduction of NOx and moderate reduction of soot. This can be a feasible technical solution to meet Tier III regulations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract??? In {{diesel engine}} cycle, 35 % of energy losses through the exhaust gases, {{the heat is}} an energy {{potential}} that can still be reused for various purposes. This research aims to design a heat exchanger, based of diesel engine exhaust gases integrated with rice milling unit for drying agricultural products. The exhaust gas is derived from 6 D 16 diesel engine of 120 kVA as a power generator for rice milling unit at South Sulawesi. Exhaust gas temperature reaches 357 oC with the mass flow rate of 636 kg/hour at ambient temperatures of 32 oC and 84 % relative humidity. From the calculation, {{the energy of the}} exhaust gas is able to dry 2 tons of paddy in the drying air temperature of 53 oC and drying mass flow rate of 6, 600 kg/hour for 8 hours drying time. Used is a compact heat exchanger with 0. 3 m long, 0. 3 m wide and 0. 2 m high, using a plain- fin 2. 0. Tests carried out using a flat bed drying 174 kg capacity of grain with 24. 56 % moisture content, using a drying air temperature of 53 oC and mass flow rate of 706 kg/hour. At the test, the diesel engine operates <b>on</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> and without milling process, can produce 128 oC exhaust gas temperature and mass flow rate of 403 kg/hour. Dried grain with a moisture content of 13. 67 % was obtained after the drying process for 5 hours 11 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper conducts an {{investigation}} on marine diesel engine condition monitoring based on artificial neural network. The engine surface vibration signals are measured and analyzed using time series method. The characteristic parameters of engine vibration signals obtained from {{time series analysis}} are used to build a suitable artificial neural network by means of Back Propagation Algorithm in order to detect the engine operating faults and improve the diagnosis accuracy. The diagnoses of variations in valve clearances and engine cylinder loads are discussed. The relationships between vibration characteristics and engine working conditions are presented. Experimental investigations were carried out <b>on</b> a <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> 6 -cylinder marine diesel engine. The cylinder cover vibration signals are measured and analyzed for monitoring the working conditions of valve clearances and engine loads. The results show that it is effective to detect the variations in valve clearance and engine cylinder load from cylinder cover vibration signals.
