40|$|Abstract—With the {{proliferation}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>management</b> of the growing user personal generated multimedia content is more demanding. Proper organization of this content requires manual metadata authoring, since automated or crowdsourcing approaches are inapplicable in case of personal content or content of a small social group (e. g. family). Recently, games with a purpose gained popularity in solving many human intelligence tasks, with main focus drawn onto resource metadata and semantics acquisition. Games with a purpose seem to have large potential for solving further problems, but they also face several design issues involving mainly the validation of human-created artifacts they provide. In this paper we analyze these issues and propose directions for overcoming them for the semantics acquisition domain. Furthermore, we propose a method for annotating and presenting personal multimedia content based on our previously developed game with a purpose, which also exploits the alternative artifact evaluation.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>devices</b> {{location}} {{systems for}} remote objects (vehicle, person, commodity, etc.), such as RTLS (Real Time Location System) {{in general and}} AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) particularly for vehicles and persons, are increasingly used today by several enterprises. Indeed, this facilitates the management of personal, products, increases productivity, and so on. These systems use positioning devices such as GPS and communication devices to send remote location data. The first constraint of GPS {{is that it does}} not provide a precise position at any time. The extensions of GPS such as WAAS systems and A-GPS, that improve the precision, have also other constraints (availability and cost). The second constraint comes when sending remote location data. Often, the communication devices used for this purpose are GSM modules that send data on the GSM network. The use of GSM network is expensive to send data periodically. To overcome these drawbacks (improve precision and send data with minimum cost), we propose a framework on hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> <b>management</b> system to create a reliable and optimal location system by: i) coupling the radio devices at low integration cost with GPS devices, ii) allowing different mobile objects to cooperate and deliver the positioning data to the remote server...|$|R
