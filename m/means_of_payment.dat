40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze the {{parallel}} note issuance {{conducted by the}} National Debt Office and the Riksbank from a monetary theory perspective. These monetary authorities both issued notes unrelated to each other between the years 1789 and 1803.

Within short the National Debt Office Notes became the main <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> As the Riksbank notes fell out of circulation their value also appreciated {{in relation to the}} National Debt Office Notes. This discrepancy in value made the National Debt Office notes the new unit of account. Although the case yet remains to be studied in depth previous research and a brief look at the empirics shows that no monetary theory in itself is consistent with the process of why the notes were accepted as <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> how the notes were endowed with value, and why the divergence in value occurred. The general implication so far of this paper is that if we want to understand what role money plays in the economy we have to redefine the basic assumption of money as a neutral facilitator of exchange of goods...|$|R

This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the Goldsmith-banker.|$|E

25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The first {{short-lived}} {{attempt at}} issuing banknotes by {{a central bank}} was in 1661 by Stockholms Banco, a predecessor of the Bank of Sweden. These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> This banknote issue was {{brought about by the}} peculiar circumstances of the Swedish coin supply. Cheap foreign imports of copper had forced the Crown to steadily increase the size of the copper coinage to maintain its value relative to silver. The heavy weight of the new coins encouraged merchants to deposit it in exchange for receipts. These became banknotes when the manager of the Bank decoupled the rate of note issue from the bank currency reserves. Three years later, the bank went bankrupt, after rapidly increasing the artificial money supply through the large-scale printing of paper money. A new bank, the Riksens Ständers Bank was established in 1668, but didn't issue banknotes until the 19th-century.|$|E

Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked [...] "paper" [...] or documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire also permitted the exchange of very large sums without the physical transfer of coins, {{in part because of the}} risks of moving large amounts of cash, particularly by sea. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, a credit crisis in 33 AD that put a number of senators at risk; the central government rescued the market through a loan of 100 million HS made by the emperor Tiberius to the banks (mensae). Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers. The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves.|$|E
