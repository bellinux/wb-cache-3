5|$|Tripathi {{started writing}} The Secret of the Nagas {{while the first}} part of the trilogy was being released.

Before its release, the author confessed that many revelations would be present in the book, including the true nature of many characters.

5|$|The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and {{included}} {{the sale of}} Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, {{and the threat of}} administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of meetings and events, including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch {{around the perimeter of the}} pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club's estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced the £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, <b>multiplex</b> <b>cinema</b> and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.|$|E
