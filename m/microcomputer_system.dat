40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The proliferation of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>systems</b> within Naval Aviation organizations {{in this decade}} has forced managers to rethink the role of information production. This thesis addresses {{the interaction of the}} organization process on information production, which Navy managers must be aware of in order to perform their job. The role of information management is examined to allow management to use existing <b>microcomputer</b> information <b>systems</b> capabilities more effectively. Discussion includes the impact of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>systems</b> on the flow of information, and microcomputer assistance to management in planning, problem solving, and decision making. Research findings indicate that management of microcomputers has increased the actual time and cost of information flow within organization units. Security of classified materials processed on microcomputers and training of user skills are deficient. Organizations need to incorporate a specialized computer manager.

40|$|A {{recursive}} {{interconnection structure}} for multiple <b>microcomputer</b> <b>systems</b> is described. The average path length through such structures was computed, {{and the results}} were used as a measure of performance. Other characteristics such as flexibility, locality and complexity were also considered. An experimental dual-processor configuration was constructed and programmed to execute a producer-consumer multi-tasking algorithm, using a semaphore-protected queuing system in shared memory. The execution time was recorded, and was compared to the execution time of an optimized uniprocessor program. The results indicated that multiple <b>microcomputer</b> <b>systems</b> in general, and recursive structures in particular, are very promising, provided that sufficient attention is paid to task partitioning and interprocessor communications...|$|R
