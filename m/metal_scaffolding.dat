40|$|VPS 29 {{is a key}} {{component}} of the cargo-binding core complex of retromer, a protein assembly with diverse roles in transport of receptors within the endosomal system. VPS 29 has a fold related to metal-binding phosphatases and mediates interactions between retromer and other regulatory proteins. In this study we examine the functional interactions of mammalian VPS 29, using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. We find that although VPS 29 can coordinate metal ions Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + in both the putative active site and at other locations, the affinity for metals is low, and lack of activity in phosphatase assays using a putative peptide substrate support the conclusion that VPS 29 is not a functional metalloenzyme. There is evidence that structural elements of VPS 29 critical for binding the retromer subunit VPS 35 may undergo both metal-dependent and independent conformational changes regulating complex formation, however studies using ITC and NMR residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements show {{that this is not the}} case. Finally, NMR chemical shift mapping indicates that VPS 29 is able to associate with SNX 1 via a conserved hydrophobic surface, but with a low affinity that suggests additional interactions will be required to stabilise the complex in vivo. Our conclusion is that VPS 29 is a <b>metal</b> ion-independent, rigid <b>scaffolding</b> domain, which is essential but not sufficient for incorporation of retromer into functiona...|$|R

40|$|The 48 -acre David Witherspoon, Inc. (DWI) 1630 Site {{operated}} as an unregulated industrial landfill and scrap yard. The Tennessee Division of Superfund (TDSF) {{closed the}} landfill in 1974. During {{the period of}} operation, the site received solid and liquid wastes from salvage and industrial operations. The site consists of five separate tracts of land including a small portion located across the Norfolk Southern Railroad track. The landfill occupies approximately 5 acres of the site, and roughly 20 acres of the 48 acres contains surface and buried debris associated with the DWI dismantling business operation. Beginning in 1968, the state of Tennessee licensed DWI to receive scrap metal at the DWI 1630 Site, contaminated with natural uranium and enriched uranium (235 U) not exceeding 0. 1 percent by weight (TDSF 1990). The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has agreed to undertake remedial actions at the DWI 1630 Site as specified under a Consent Order with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) (Consent Order No. 90 - 3443, April 4, 1991), and as further delineated by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DOE and the State of Tennessee (MOU Regarding Implementation of Consent Orders, October 6, 1994). The soil and debris removal at the DWI 1630 Site is being performed by Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC) {{on behalf of the}} DOE. Remediation consists of removing contaminated soil and debris from the DWI 1630 site except for the landfill area and repairing the landfill cap. The DWI 1630 remediation waste that is being disposed at the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility (EMWMF) as defined as waste lot (WL) 146. 1 and consists primarily of soils and soil like material, incidental debris and secondary waste generated from the excavation of debris and soil from the DWI 1630 site. The WL 146. 1 includes soil, soil like material (e. g., shredded or chipped vegetation, ash), discrete debris items (e. g., equipment, drums, large scrap metal, cylinders, and cable) and populations of debris type items (e. g., piles of bricks, small scrap <b>metal,</b> roofing material, <b>scaffolding,</b> and shelving) that are located throughout the DWI 1630 site. The project also generates an additional small volume of secondary waste [e. g., personal protective equipment (PPE), and miscellaneous construction waste] that is bagged and included in bulk soil shipments to the EMWMF. The Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) for the EMWMF does not allow for material that does not meet the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Land Disposal Restrictions (LDRs). The waste being excavated in certain areas of the DWI 1630 site contained soil that did not meet RCRA LDR criteria; therefore this waste had to be segregated for treatment or alternate disposal offsite. This document identifies the approach taken by the DWI 1630 project to further characterize the areas identified during the Phase II Remedial Investigation (RI) as potentially containing RCRA-characteristic waste. This document also describes the methodology used to determine excavation limits for areas determined to be RCRA waste, post excavation sampling, and the treatment and disposal of this material...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Bamboo {{scaffolding}} {{has been}} widely used in South China, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia for many years.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{laser scanning}} methodology {{applied to the}} study of a gothic stained-glass window: the work can help understanding how glass objects are measured by laser scanner, conforming to more parameters. A glass window from King’s Chapel, Cambridge (UK) was modelled: a vertical ensemble, divided into more parts, made of glass, coloured during its realisation or coloured before being placed on the wall. Thus, a different sensitivity to laser beam is expected from glass. The acquisition was performed using Konica Minolta Vivid 910, with a 5 x 8 scan matrix. Registration via ICP algorithm was carried in 8 horizontal stripes. Scans seem to be quite homogeneous, except some lacunas, probably depending on a “brownout-effect ” induced by the presence of stain structure, partly obscuring glass surface. Otherwise they could be depending on local condition of glass, causing loose of signal from the surface. Some details show a particular noise in the acquisition, probably caused by an outdoor <b>metal</b> <b>scaffolding,</b> especially in more transparent areas. A comparison with the acquisition of an object protected by a glass showcase is illustrated too, to study the response of glass material. It was argued that glass painted with non covering colours is more sensitive to such object while covering colours (or coloured glass) “stop ” laser beam and give no noise. Besides with painted sheets, a 3 D laser scanning model can give a sub-millimetrical mapping with the thickness of colour layers: thus, noise induced by the <b>metal</b> <b>scaffolding</b> can be evaluated too. 1...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} {{for the use of}} metal supports at elevated temperatures is their corrosion. Partial oxygen pressures during SOFC operation can vary from values ~ 1  atm on the cathode side to values ~ 10 − 20 atm on the anode side. Although the latter is a very low value it is thermodynamically in the metal oxide formation region. The problem can be partially resolved by the formation of Cr 2 O 3 protective coating onto the <b>metal</b> <b>scaffolding</b> which effectively stops further degradation and retains good electrical conductivity. Variety of different ferritic steels and alloys have been studied for SOFCs applications including standard commercial 316 and 430 series and as well as more expensive specialized (higher Cr content) ones-Crofer 22 APU (ThyssenKrupp VDM), E-Brite (Allegheny Ludlum), ZMG 232 (Hitachi Metals Ltd.), FeCr (70 : 30) (AMETEK) and Ti-Nb stabilized 17  % Cr ferritic stainless steel used by CERES Power [8, 9, 10, 13, 14]. Some austenitic nickel-based alloys (Haynes 230 and Haynes 242 -Haynes International) have also been experimented with. The higher percentage of chromium content promotes the formation of a protective scale but chromia is volatile under certain conditions and can degrade the performance of the cell. Thus, a number of protective coatings preventing the effects of Cr poisoning and depletion are currently under development [13, 14]. The corrosion resistance of 430 steel has been previously investigated in both cathode (air) and anode (H 2 –H 2 O) conditions at operational SOFC temperatures (750 – 900  °C). It was found that chromium content of ~ 16  at. % is not sufficient to form protective scale at cathode conditions. As a consequence, such metallic components are considered better employed on the anode side where rich hydrogen atmosphere is present [15, 16, 17, 18].|$|E
40|$|Scaffolding {{represents}} an important {{trade in the}} construction of buildings by providing platforms which allow the workers to carry out their works at height. In Mega City of Central Gujarat region of India particularly Ahmedabad and Vadodara, a variety of scaffolding systems are available. The bamboo scaffolding is regarded to be the dominant type in the local construction industry over the years chiefly because of its low costs. Local buildings have been constructed with the ever increase in height. Literatures reveal the importance of safety and cost as well as their close relationship in construction. and it is found that bamboo scaffolding is rather unsafe and unreliable especially in such high-attitude constructions, while <b>metal</b> <b>scaffolding</b> is too expensive. The success of a scaffolding system depends on many factors, e. g. its features, application and suitability in a market. This study aims at investigating the opportunity of scaffolding system and hence determining its success in Mega City of Central Gujarat region of India particularly Ahmedabad and Vadodara.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare and to analyse bond {{strengths}} of different metal-ceramic systems by using the testing method proposed by VOSS and assessed under clinical aspects. Prosthetic anterior metal-ceramic crowns of the human maxilla were used as specimens for the VOSS test. The metallic frameworks were made out of precious metal alloys (Bio PontoStar, Bio PontoStar XL, PontoLloyd P BegoCer G, Bio PlatinLloyd, BegoLloyd LFC, ECO d'Or) and the non-precious alloys (Wirobond 280, Wirobond C, Wirobond SG, Wirobond C +, Wiron 99, Wirocer Plus, Wirobond LFC). The metal frameworks were veneered with VITA Omega 900, VM 13, Noritake EZ- 3, Duceram Kiss, Vintage Halo, Vintage, Creation and the LFC mass response was used. The metallic frameworks were veneered manually. A total of 146 anterior crowns were made, which are divided into 21 test series from each 7 specimens. The series with 6 specimens of Wirobond C+ copings is an exception, due to their selective laser melting manufacturing at BEGO MEDICAL. From the 21 test series 8 series were faced with porcelain and precious <b>metal</b> <b>scaffolding</b> different compositions. 5 of 8 series were created with conventional material (Vita Omega 900) and 3 were processed with LFC mass (Response). The remaining 13 series are based on non-precious metal copings. From this 13 series of tests were examined 6 with various non-precious alloys, with 5 of them done with conventional material (Vita Omega 900) and one supplied with LFC mass (Response). The remaining 7 series are characterized by a uniform metallic framework (Wirobond 280) and modifications in the veneering ceramic. By using the measured fracture strength it should be noted that porcelain veneered precious metal alloys tend to have more stable bonding systems than similar systems with non-precious alloys. The comparison of the high expansion ceramics in conjunction with the corresponding EM and non-precious alloys showed higher bond strengths of connections to EM base, but overall, these composite systems lower elongation values than conventionally veneered anterior crowns. Furthermore it was shown in another series of tests that veneering metallic frameworks of Wirobond 280 direct result proportional bending strengths of the ceramics used for the measured fracture values. A comparison of test results from the VOSS test is limited in other studies of the same procedure as well as results from other material testing due to lack of standardization. Nevertheless, in this case a parallel study by M. Jacobs testet different prothetic materials for the anterior front tooth by using the same preparation of the tooth, using the same machines to create and test the prothetic front tooth crowns, in the same laboratory at the same time. Therefore it is obvious that the results of booth studies must be seen as one. Finally it is clear to see, that using the uniform and practical testing method by VOSS is a good way to compare results of in-vitro material testing...|$|E
