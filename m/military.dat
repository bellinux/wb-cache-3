5|$|After Reagan's <b>military</b> buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further {{building}} its <b>military</b> because the enormous <b>military</b> expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large <b>military</b> expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E

5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators {{struggled with}} the <b>military</b> leaders, and the two forces went {{through a number of}} leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed <b>military</b> governor in 1892.

5|$|From 1947 to 1960 {{the country}} {{seems to have}} been divided into three major <b>military</b> regions: Cluj, Bacău, and Bucharest in the west, east, and south, respectively.

5|$|From a <b>military</b> standpoint, the Portuguese regular army {{held the}} upper hand during the {{conflict}} against the independentist guerrilla forces.

According to historians of the Revolution, the <b>military</b> coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese <b>military</b> insurgents who led the Lisbon's <b>military</b> coup, and, on the other hand, {{the pressure of the}} international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.|$|E
