On the NIST-BSSR 1 database, we formalize a common assumption in the literature: for independent scores, multibiometric systems can be evaluated on "random chimeric" persons. We show {{that this is not}} valid for dependent scores and propose a novel protocol for building "cluster-based chimeric" persons maintaining the level <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> between scores. Finally, we show that performance evaluation for dependent modalities on such persons is equivalent to that obtained on "real" persons...|$|R

40|$|Computation of {{principal}} angles between subspaces {{is important in}} many applications, e. g., in statistics and information retrieval. In statistics, the angles {{are closely related to}} <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> and covariance <b>of</b> random variables. When applied to column-spaces of matrices, the principal angles describe canonical correlations of a matrix pair. We highlight that all popular software codes for canonical correlations compute only cosine {{of principal}} angles, thus making impossible, because of round-off errors, finding small angles accurately. We review a combination of sine and cosine based algorithms that provide accurate results for all angles. We generalize the method to the computation of principal angles in an A-based scalar product for a symmetric and positive definite matrix A. We provide a comprehensive overview of interesting properties of principal angles. We prove basic perturbation theorems for absolute errors for sine and cosine of principal angles with improved constants. Numerical examples and a detailed description of our code are given...|$|R

MethodologyThe patients included were victims of severe traumatic brain injuries in 2007 or 2008. A standardized assessment was performed for each patient including clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological data collected at the initial stage, The outcomes were assessed at least 2  years after injury. Depending on the patients’ availability and ability to communicate, the assessments included <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> for activities <b>of</b> daily living (ADL), cognitive functions, behaviour, mood, and quality of life. ResultsEighteen patients were included, of whom ten were autonomous for ADL at the time of assessment. Memory complaints, attentional deficits, anxiety, and irritability were the main long-term impairments observed. A correlation analysis showed significant correlations between the dependency level (as rated by the Functional Independence <b>Measure)</b> and each <b>of</b> length of coma, length of the post-traumatic amnesia, and the N 100 auditory evoked potentials.

A year after, however, in 1115, Pope Pascal II attributed it to the monastery of San Pietro in Perugia. Both attributions were confirmed by succession of Popes, which led to a conflict of interests between the two monasteries of Arezzo and Perugia. In 1206, for instance, Pope Innocent III counts Sant’Arcangelo [...] "with all its properties" [...] among the churches owing allegiance to the bishop of Perugia. In 1238, on the other hand, Pope Gregory IX confirmed the affiliation of the monastery to Santa Maria of Farneta. Every Ascension day, it had to pay a tribute <b>of</b> two <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> oil, ten <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> wheat and 20 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> wine. This <b>dependency</b> <b>of</b> Farneta ended towards 1420; in 1332 an independent abbot presided over Sant’Arcangelo. Ties to Farneta - and San Pietro - remained close, however, for which frequent commissions by the abbots of these monasteries to the abbot of Sant’Arcangelo testify.|$|R
40|$|Information {{theory is}} {{valuable}} in multiple-variable analysis for being model-free and nonparametric, {{and for the}} modest sensitivity to undersampling. We previously introduced a general approach to finding multiple <b>dependencies</b> that provides accurate <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> for subsets <b>of</b> variables in a data set, which is significantly nonzero only if the subset of variables is collectively dependent. This is useful, however, only if we can avoid a combinatorial explosion of calculations for increasing numbers of variables. The proposed dependence measure for a subset of variables, tau, differential interaction information, Delta(tau), has the property that for subsets of tau some of the factors of Delta(tau) are significantly nonzero, when the full dependence includes more variables. We use this property to suppress the combinatorial explosion by following the "shadows" <b>of</b> multivariable <b>dependency</b> on smaller subsets. Rather than calculating the marginal entropies of all subsets at each degree level, {{we need to consider}} only calculations for subsets of variables with appropriate "shadows. " The number of calculations for n variables at a degree level of d grows therefore, at a much smaller rate than the binomial coefficient (n, d), but depends on the parameters of the "shadows" calculation. This approach, avoiding a combinatorial explosion, enables the use <b>of</b> our multivariable <b>measures</b> on very large data sets. We demonstrate this method on simulated data sets, and characterize the effects of noise and sample numbers. In addition, we analyze a data set of a few thousand mutant yeast strains interacting with a few thousand chemical compounds...|$|R

This paper investigated {{features of the}} landscape {{and their impact on}} transmission during the period of predominantly local spread which followed the implementation of the national movement ban during the 2001 UK FMD epidemic. In this study 113 farms diagnosed with FMD which had a known source of infection within 3 km (cases) were matched to 188 control farms which were either uninfected or infected at a later timepoint. Cases were matched to controls by Euclidean distance to the source of infection and farm size. Intervening geographical features and connectivity between the source of infection and case and controls were compared. Results Road distance between holdings, access to holdings, presence of forest, elevation change between holdings and the presence of intervening roads had no impact on the risk of local FMD transmission (p > 0. 2). However the presence of linear features in the form of rivers and railways acted as barriers to FMD transmission (odds ratio = 0. 507, 95 % CIs = 0. 297, 0. 887, p = 0. 018). Conclusion This paper demonstrated that although FMD spread can generally be modelled using Euclidean distance and numbers of animals on susceptible holdings, the presence of rivers and railways has an additional protective effect reducing the probability of transmission between holdings. </p...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{experiments}} with the new proton storage ring COSY will be the measurement of the differential cross-section in the reaction pd#->#" 3 He#eta# at threshold. This reaction {{is known to be}} of interest due to a surprisingly large #eta#-production cross section. Thus, #eta#-production mechanism and decay features can be studied. Monte-Carlo-Calculations have proved that the Time-Of-Flight-detector (TOF) is well suited for such measurements with a good resolution and almost 4 #pi#-acceptance (in CMS). The necessary supression of background reactions will be achieved by using the time-of-flight- and the #DELTA#E-information of the scintillator hodoscopes of this apparatus. In the future, the TOF-detector will be extended by an additional tracking device with good spatial resolution (#sigma#_x#approx# 30 #mu#m) and high rate capability (#propor to# 10 " 6 p/mm" 2. s) to improve the angular resolution and to identify secondary vertices. Such a device, an Induction Drift Chamber, was developed and has been tested in measurements in Hamburg, Bonn and at CERN (Geneva). To assure long-term stability of this drift chamber, a detailed study on the mechanisms of wire-breaking due to sparks was carried out. Based on the results of this examination, a new technique for an almost massless support of the wires with nylon threads was developed, which helped to avoid breakdowns of the chamber due to destroyed wires. In the first measurement with COSY the IDC was installed to test its applicability as a high resolution beam monitor and to measure the rate capability with highly ionizing protons. The IDC shows a good performance and is able to determine the COSY beam diameter with a resolution of less than 100 #mu#m. The use of a Flash-ADC read out of the chamer signals made it possible to test a new method for an exact <b>measuring</b> <b>of</b> the rate <b>dependency</b> <b>of</b> the gas gain, even at a low beam rate. At a gas gain of #approx# 2. 10 " 3 the IDC can be used up to beam rates of at least 2. 5. 10 " 6 particles/mm" 2. s (allowing a reduction in the gas gain of 10 %), which makes this tracking device compatible to the other components of the TOF-detector.
