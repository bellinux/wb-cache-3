25|$|The main {{difference}} between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them {{on the premise that}} their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of protein sources for <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> on growth performance and serum biochemical indexes of suckling calves. Fifty Chinese Holstein bull calves with similar BW and age were randomly allocated to 5 groups (1 control and 4 treatments) of 10 calves in each group. Five types of <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> were designed {{to have the same}} level of energy and protein. The protein source for <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> of the control group was full milk protein (MP). The protein source of <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> of the 4 treatment groups was composed of MP and one vegetable protein (VP) (30 and 70 % of total protein). The 4 types of VP were soybean protein concentrate (SP), hydrolyzed wheat protein (WP), peanut protein concentrate (PP), and rice protein isolate (RP). Results of the experiment showed: 1) {{there was no significant difference}} on average daily gain (ADG) and feed:gain ratio (F:G) among the MP, SP and RP groups (P >  0. 05), whereas the ADG and F:G of the WP and PP groups were significantly lower compared with the MP group (P    0. 05). Thereby the 4 VP <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> had no adverse effects on body size of calves; 3) all groups showed no significant difference in the serum contents of urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, globulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1, and the ratio of albumin to globulin (A:G) (P >  0. 05). In conclusion, SP or RP (accounts for 70 % of the total protein) as calf <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> could substitute MP, whereas wheat gluten and PP had a significant adverse effect on growth performance in this experiment...|$|R

40|$|Commercially {{prepared}} <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> {{are frequently}} {{used to provide}} the sole source of nutrition for hand-reared cheetah cubs (Acinonyx jubatus). The nutrient composition of two commonly used <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> was determined. Using titanium dioxide as an indigestible marker, nutrient digestibility was calculated from the analyses of fecal samples collected from each cub (n = 4 on formula 1, and n = 2 on formula 2). Mean apparent total tract digestibility for both formulas was > 90 % for all nutrients analyzed (crude protein, amino acids, crude fat (CF), and dry matter). However, the total CF content and the concentration of the essential fatty acids, such as a-linolenic, linolenic, and arachidonic acid, of both formulas was lower than reported for maternal cheetah milk. Additionally, one formula contained a comparatively high amount of carbohydrate, {{at the expense of}} protein. Although data were lacking for cheetah maternal milk, comparison with domestic cat milk revealed high concentrations of a number of minerals (K, Fe, Zn, and Cu), while vitamin D 3 was not detected in one formula. Both formulas were low in the majority of essential amino acids compared with domestic cat maternal milk. Despite their apparently high digestibility, neither formula was complete or balanced in terms of nutrient concentrations and ratios when maternal cheetah milk and/or the requirements established for growth in domestic cats were used as estimates of ideal. On this basis, although all cubs in this study were healthy and maintained good body conditions {{for the duration of the}} trial, the results of dietary analyses indicate that these <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> may not provide optimal nutrition for growth in cheetah cubs when used for extended period...|$|R

40|$|International audienceReplacement of {{skim milk}} {{proteins}} by solubilized wheat protein (SWP) in <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> for veal calves {{would contribute to}} the reduction in feeding costs. The occurrence of metabolic disorders has, however, been reported. Forty-two male calves received one of three treatments over 140 days: a control diet, a diet containing SWP without or with branched-chain amino acid supplementation. Liveweight gain, carcass yield, color and conformation did not show any significant differences. No metabolic disorders were noted. Supplementation with branched-chain amino acids reduced the marginal Val deficiency but did not modify the growth performances. With the SWP containing diets, the plasma metabolite profile was characteristic of those observed with non-clotting diets. It was statistically correlated to {{the changes in the}} orientation of the Semitendinosus muscle energy metabolism towards a more oxidative type and to indications of a lower efficiency of amino acid utilisation for protein deposition.

This indicates that the activity of enzymes required for the hydrolysis of starch to glucose limits starch digestion in milk-fed calves. It is however unknown which enzyme system is limiting the rate of starch hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen of calves.

50|$|The {{first trial}} ever {{reported}} with MOS was with young bull calves. Newman et al. noted improved intake and subsequently better growth rates. The {{health status of}} young calves {{is one of the}} most important factors contributing to growth and performance. Diarrhoea in young calves is a major issue in the dairy sector. The cause can be viral or bacterial, however, E. coli is often involved. As MOS can bind E. coli (see Effects of MOS on the intestinal microflora), it can modify and help to improve the composition of the intestinal microflora. This resulted in a reduction in faecal E. coli counts and improvements in faecal score in calves fed MOS. These improvements were coupled with an increase in concentrate (dry feed) intake and better performance. In addition to the changes in the gut, several authors also noticed improvements in respiratory health, which can also contribute to better performance. Conversely, one trial reported no effects on liveweight gain despite increased feed intake. Higher liveweight gain, similar to that gained with the use of antibiotics, has been achieved following supplementation of <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> with MOS.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{on the effect}} of fostering or moving individual piglets from one litter to another after they are 24 to 48 hours of age was conducted. Late fostering disrupts nursing, increases fighting, and impairs the growth rate of adopted piglets and their littermates. Pig body weight at weaning was reduced 13 to 24 % in extensively fostered litters vs. those where no piglets were fostered after 48 hours of age. No evidence was found that late fostering improves preweaning survival. For the greater good of all piglets, producers are encouraged to resist the urge to even-up litters or foster individual piglets after they are 24 hours old. Piglets that fall behind or grow slower than littermates after the initial fostering is done should be transferred to nurse sows where an entirely new litter(s) of older pigs is made. <b>Milk</b> <b>replacers</b> can also play a role in providing slower-growing or starving piglets more milk...|$|R
