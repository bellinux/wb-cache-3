25|$|In 1975, the {{collapse}} of Portuguese colonial rule in neighbouring Angola allowed members of SWAPO's militant arm, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) to begin using Angolan sanctuaries near the southern border as forward operating bases. The South African Defence Force (SADF) soon found itself confronted with an ever-increasing number of well-armed guerrillas infiltrating by the hundreds across the porous frontier. Unwilling to accept a purely defensive posture, South African patrols began crossing into Angola to stop PLAN cadres before they could reach their targets. An interim solution to solving the <b>manpower</b> <b>problem</b> also emerged via the growing recruitment of black and coloured soldiers by the SADF. The first South African army unit which permitted black personnel to serve in a combat role was 32 Battalion, led by Colonel Jan Breytenbach. Breytenbach had encouraged a number of partisans loyal to the demobilised National Liberation Front of Angola, an armed faction opposed to Angola's leftist government, to seek refuge in South West Africa. He then ordered them retrained, re-equipped, and formed into a new fighting unit led by white South African officers. Under his unorthodox leadership the battalion was tasked with denying PLAN freedom of movement within a zone roughly fifty kilometres north of the Angolan border.|$|E

Although Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Liberal party leader, understood the need for a coalition government in order to withstand the war, he was opposed to the implementation of conscription. Prime Minister Borden, however, was able to convince several key Liberal members to join his Union government. It was prior to the dissolution of Parliament that two bills were created to increase Borden’s chances of getting the coalition government elected. The bills were the Wartime Elections Act and the Military Voters Act.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis {{is a study}} of the feasibility of manning the airwings of a fifteen carrier force by FY 1990. An initial review {{of the history of the}} carrier force and the composition of its airwings and the manpower requirements needed to man them was accomplished. Manpower studies were conducted of the 131 X/ 132 X designators for officers and for eleven selected enlisted aviation ratings (AD, AE, AME, AMH, AMS, AO, AQ, AT, AW, AX and PR). Specific predictive information used included personnel attrition, retention, promotion and accession data. All of this information was processed by an APL computer program designated MANMOD, which allowed projection of manpower requirements and personnel supply data forward to the year 1990. The MANMOD model permitted estimation of the accessions and retention requirements for the officer designators and enlisted ratings chosen for study. This projection of data provided predictions on whether current-day policies will meet future billet requirements or whether changes in policies will have to be made in order to man a fifteen-carrier force. This thesis indicates serious problems in manning if present supply and requirements trends continue. The thesis also identifies other <b>manpower</b> <b>problem</b> areas.
