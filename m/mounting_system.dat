25|$|The <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> for {{the skin}} has {{undergone}} a number of changes over time.|$|E
25|$|The modern <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> {{arose in}} the early seventies, when touring ballets {{came into contact with}} {{synthetic}} rope used by the military. Initially, the synthetic rope was used to replace the twisted cowhide strips. However, the rope could now be tightened {{to the point where it}} tore through the skin; in response, drum makers started using steel rings instead of twisted cowhide to hold the skin in place. Despite objections from many djembefolas, the modern <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> gradually displaced the traditional one and, by 1991 had completely replaced it.|$|E

50|$|The {{program was}} {{launched}} in September 2009 and the tariffs were fixed then. The solar projects ≤10 kW received $0.802, however, as of 13 August 2010 ground <b>mounted</b> <b>systems</b> will receive a lower tariff than rooftop <b>mounted</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Photovoltaic <b>mounting</b> <b>systems</b> (also called {{solar module}} racking) {{are used to}} fix solar panels on {{surfaces}} like roofs, building facades, or the ground. These <b>mounting</b> <b>systems</b> generally enable retrofitting of solar panels on roofs {{or as part of}} the structure of the building (called BIPV).|$|R

25|$|Mounting base: Attaches the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> to the vehicle. This {{element is}} {{commonly}} composed of rugged {{materials such as}} steel. Tunnel Mounts attach to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. Passenger Side Mounts attach to floor {{on the passenger side}} of the vehicle. Console mounting brackets attach to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|E
25|$|Rooftop solar array: A rooftop {{solar panel}} {{installation}} {{was completed in}} February 2006. The 33.6kW (DC) photovoltaic (PV) arrays consist of 168 Sharp Solar 200 watt DC PV modules laminated to PowerLight's flat-roof PowerGuard <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> and utilizes a Xantrex PV-30208 30kW AC 3 phase inverter. Integration with the school's computer network allows students to monitor the solar panels' production of electricity in real time, while saving on the school's energy cost. A screen just off the main lobby displays production data at every moment.|$|E

25|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{can accept}} quick-detachable rails and adapters used to mount optics (STANAG 2324 compliant). The scope <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> {{consists of a}} centering hole located on the front face of the rear sight assembly and a dovetail-like mounting point at {{the front end of}} the receiver. Swiss Arms (respectively Brügger & Thomet) offer several types of quick-release scope mounts and Picatinny rails. A version of the rifle with an integral receiver-mounted Picatinny rail is also offered; in this configuration the weapon is fitted with flip-up emergency battle sights—a rear aperture sight which folds down into a recess in the rail and a folding front blade.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. The skin was {{attached}} with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{for ways}} around the deadlock, Henry Tizard sent Archibald Vivian Hill to the US {{to take a}} survey of US {{technical}} capability {{in order to better}} assess what technologies the US would be willing to exchange. This effort was the start on the path that led to the famous Tizard Mission in late August 1940. Ironically, by the time the Mission was being planned, the Norden had been removed from the list of items to be discussed, and Roosevelt personally noted this was due largely to political reasons. Ultimately, although Tizard was unable to convince the US to release the design, he was able to request information about its external dimensions and details on the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> so it could be easily added to British bombers if it were released in the future.|$|E

25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed the whole idea of the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E
25|$|A {{night vision}} device (NVD), {{also known as}} night optical/observation device (NOD) and night vision goggles (NVG), is an {{optoelectronic}} device that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. The image may be a conversion to visible light of both visible light and near-infrared, while by convention detection of thermal infrared is denoted thermal imaging. The image produced is typically monochrome, e.g. shades of green. NVDs are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. The term usually refers to a complete unit, including an image intensifier tube, a protective and generally water-resistant housing, and some type of <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Many NVDs also include optical components such as a sacrificial lens, or telescopic lenses or mirrors. An NVD may have an IR illuminator, making it an active as opposed to passive night vision device.|$|E
500|$|A user's motor abilities, {{communication}} skills and needs, cognition and vision are assessed {{in order to}} determine the most appropriate match to a communication system. Depending on the individual's physical status, recommendations of an alternative access method, a change in seating/positioning, a <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> and/or communication aid adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with spastic arm movements may require a key guard on top of the keyboard or touchscreen to reduce the selection of non-target items. The person's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social purposes. Researcher Janice Light identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family. In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices. However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct, and influence family attitudes towards AAC.|$|E
