40|$|This report {{identifies}} a {{group of}} compounds, polymethylene bisacetamides (acetylated diamines), which are potent inducers of erythroid differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. A known inducing agent, N-methylacetamide, was dimerized through varying numbers of <b>methylenes</b> {{in an attempt to}} increase the local effective concentration at adjacent target sites. The simple dimer was no more effective than N-methylacetamide alone; introduction of five to eight <b>methylenes</b> between acetamide groups substantially increased the effectiveness of these compounds. The hexamethylene bisacetamide was active between 0. 5 mM and 5 mM; the percentage of cells induced and the rate at which they were recruited to differentiation was dependent upon the concentration of inducer within this range. At 5 mM hexamethylene bisacetamide essentially the entire population (greater than 99 %) was induced to a pathway of erythroid differentiation which was greater differentiation of the cultured cells than with any inducer yet tested...|$|R

5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an aryl or allyl group, the reagent {{is referred}} to as a semi-stabilized ylide. These have been developed extensively, second only to the classical <b>methylene</b> reagents (R1=R2=H).

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to <b>methylene</b> chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} on oxidation kinetics of polyamides and model compounds has been reviewed {{in order to}} try to extract suitable information for non-empirical kinetic modeling. Polyamide characteristics are systematically compared to polyoleﬁn ones, these latter being more extensively studied. From kinetic analysis point of view, it is shown that oxidation attacks predominantly a amino <b>methylenes</b> of which C eH bond is considerably weaker than the other <b>methylenes.</b> As a result, propagation by H abstraction is considerably faster in polyamides than in polyethylene for instance. Termination by radical combination is also very fast. Another cause of PA oxidizability is the instability of a amino hydroperoxides linked to the inductive effect of nitrogen. This instability is responsible for many key features of oxidation kinetics especially the absence of induction period.

40|$|AbstractAlthough ethanol {{has been}} {{reported}} to affect cholesterol homeostasis in biological membranes, the molecular mechanism of action is unknown. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques have been used to investigate possible direct interactions between ethanol and cholesterol in various low dielectric solvents (acetone, methanol, isopropanol, DMF, DMSO, chloroform, and CCl 4). Measurement of 13 C chemical shifts, spin-lattice and multiplet relaxation times, as well as self-diffusion coefficients, indicates that ethanol interacts weakly, yet specifically, with the HC-OH moiety and the two flanking <b>methylenes</b> in the cyclohexanol ring of cholesterol. This interaction is most strong in the least polar-solvent carbon tetrachloride where the ethanol–cholesterol equilibrium dissociation constant is estimated to be 2 × 10 − 3 M. 13 C-NMR spin-lattice relaxation studies allow insight into the geometry of this complex, which is best modeled with the methyl group of ethanol sandwiched between the two <b>methylenes</b> in the cyclohexanol ring and the hydroxyl group of ethanol hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of cholesterol...|$|R

5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with <b>methylene</b> transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, <b>methylene</b> chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of <b>methylene</b> blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E

The hydrocarbon backbone was produced by ADMET polymerization followed by hydrogenation of a gem-dimethyl substituted α,ω-diene, and this material was then endcapped with alcohol-containing monoenes with varied numbers of <b>methylenes</b> between the alcohol group and olefin. Some molecular weight control was achieved in the resulting telechelics, which had 2.0 functionality.|$|R

5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous <b>methylene</b> blue.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and <b>methylene</b> groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E
5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes <b>methylene</b> blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E

40|$|Several polymethylene tetraamines {{related to}} methoctramine (1) were {{prepared}} and evaluated for their blocking activity on M- 2 muscarinic receptors in guinea pig atria and ileum. It {{turned out that}} antimuscarinic potency depends on the following parameters: (a) nature of the substituent on both inner and outer nitrogens and (b) carbon chain length separating the inner nitrogens {{as well as the}} inner and outer nitrogens. Optimum activity at cardiac M- 2 muscarinic receptors was associated with the chain lengths present in 1, that is, eight <b>methylenes</b> between the inner nitrogens and six <b>methylenes</b> between the inner and outer nitrogens. With regard to the substitueats, replacement of the benzylic moiety of 1 by a 2 -fury 1 or a 5 -methyl- 2 -fury 1 nucleus resulted in enhanced potency toward cardiac M- 2 muscarinic receptors. In fact, furtramine (18) and mefurtramine (19) proved to be more potent and more selective than 1. Moreover, N-methylation of the four nitrogens of 1 gave different effects: methylation of the outer nitrogens, giving 22, caused a significant decrease in activity whereas methylation of the inner nitrogens, yielding 23, resulted in an increase in activity in both atria and ileum...|$|R
