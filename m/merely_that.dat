5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction {{does not mean that the}} species is extinct, <b>merely</b> <b>that</b> it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury {{prior to}} his {{becoming}} a bishop. Several historians opine {{that he might have}} been the same as the Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead. The evidence is not <b>merely</b> <b>that</b> they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes {{the fact that he was}} felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.|$|E

5|$|Stephen of Ripon {{says that}} Wilfrid stayed in Lyon for three years, leaving {{only after the}} archbishop's murder. However, Annemund's murder took place in 660 and Wilfrid {{returned}} to England in 658, suggesting that Stephen's chronology is awry. Stephen says that Annemund gave Wilfrid a clerical tonsure, although this {{does not appear to}} mean that he became a monk, <b>merely</b> <b>that</b> he entered the clergy. Bede is silent on the subject of Wilfrid's monastic status, although Wilfrid probably became a monk during his time in Rome, or afterwards while he was in Gaul. Some historians, however, believe that Wilfrid was never a monk. While in Gaul, Wilfrid absorbed Frankish ecclesiastical practices, including some aspects from the monasteries founded by Columbanus. This influence may be seen in Wilfrid's probable adoption of a Frankish ceremony in his consecration of churches later in his life, as well as in his employment of Frankish masons to build his churches. Wilfrid would also have learned of the Rule of Saint Benedict in Gaul, as Columbanus' monasteries followed that monastic rule.|$|E
5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or <b>merely</b> <b>that</b> he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E

25|$|At {{some point}} the culture's {{settlements}} and burial grounds expanded out of lowland river valleys and into highland areas.

25|$|A Euclidean {{space is}} not {{technically}} a vector space {{but rather an}} affine space, on which a vector space acts by translations, or, conversely, a Euclidean vector is the difference (displacement) in an ordered pair of points, not a single point. Intuitively, the distinction says <b>merely</b> <b>that</b> there is no canonical choice of where the origin should go in the space, {{because it can be}} translated anywhere. When a certain point is chosen, it can be declared the origin and subsequent calculations may ignore the difference between a point and its coordinate vector, as said above. See point–vector distinction for details.|$|E

It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.|$|E

As well as the obvious need for a hull strong enough not to be crushed at depth, the hundreds of dives over a submarine's lifetime mean that the fatigue life {{is also an important}} issue. To provide resistance to fatigue, the hull must be designed so that the steel always operates below its elastic limit; that is the stress applied by pressure is less than its yield stress. The HY- series steels were developed to provide a high yield stress, so allowing this.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority.

However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
