Marley has also evolved into a global symbol and inspired numerous items of merchandise.|$|E
5|$|In 2007/08 Omega FM was {{established}} in West London and became actively involved in political discussions. By late 2010 {{it was clear that}} Omega FM was {{following in the footsteps of}} pioneering black political pirate stations such as Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, adopting a similar format playing information documentaries concerning black history and Pan Afrikan ideologies along with Nation of Islam and The Nuwaubian ideologies as well as alternative approaches on current affairs, while also playing mostly Reggae <b>music</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> touch of other genres of black music that is often politically orientated.|$|E

5|$|<b>Music</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many commending the band for making <b>music</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> darker tone. However, {{the album was}} criticized for lacking a stand-out lead single. Commercially, the album was not as successful as Flood (1990), peaking at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and spending only six weeks on that chart. In addition, some fans were upset that and Flansburgh and Linnell opted to use a backing band for the album's tour, with some even boycotting shows.|$|E
5|$|Worship at St James' is {{in a style}} {{commonly}} found in the High Church and moderate Anglo-Catholic traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church <b>music,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> robed choir singing psalms, anthems and responses {{in contrast to the}} great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the ordination of women.|$|E

5|$|Early synth-pop pioneers {{included}} Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League and Berlin Blondes; the Human League used monophonic synthesizers {{to produce}} <b>music</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, {{large numbers of}} artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success {{opened the way for}} synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Kurt Atterberg's Stormen premiered in 1948 and Frank Martin's Der Sturm in 1955. Michael Tippett's 1971 opera The Knot Garden {{contains}} various {{allusions to}} The Tempest. In Act 3, a psychoanalyst, Mangus, {{pretends to be}} Prospero and uses situations from Shakespeare's play in his therapy sessions. John Eaton, in 1985, produced a fusion of live jazz with pre-recorded electronic <b>music,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> libretto by Andrew Porter. Michael Nyman's 1991 opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs was first performed as an opera-ballet by Karine Saporta. This opera is unique in that the three vocalists, a soprano, contralto, and tenor, are voices rather than individual characters, with the tenor just as likely as the soprano to sing Miranda, or all three sing as one character.|$|E
5|$|Sargent worked {{first as}} an organist at St Mary's Church, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, from 1914 to 1924, except {{for eight months}} in 1918 when {{he served as a}} private in the Durham Light Infantry during the First World War. He was chosen for the organist post over more than 150 other applicants. At the same time, he worked on many musical {{projects}} in Leicester, Melton Mowbray and Stamford, where he not only conducted but also produced the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan and others for amateur societies. The Prince of Wales and his entourage often hunted in Leicestershire and watched the annual Gilbert and Sullivan productions there, together with the Duke of York {{and other members of the}} Royal Family. At the age of 24 Sargent became England's youngest Doctor of <b>Music,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> degree from Durham.|$|E

He has worked with several bands, including Junk Beer Kidnap Band, Korn, Disturbed, Apocalyptica, Anthrax, and Soulfly. Taylor was ranked at #86 in Hit Parader's Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was also named the seventh greatest heavy metal frontman by NME. Taylor was also found, by VVN Music, to possess the second-widest vocal range of any known singer in popular <b>music</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> range of {{five and a half}} octaves. He was beaten only by Mike Patton (six octaves).|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live <b>music</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
