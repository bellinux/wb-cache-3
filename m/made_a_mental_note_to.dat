60|$|Wolfenden {{swore to}} himself softly. He {{could have been}} there. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> leave a card at the Embassy that afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drummond'll be good next year," [...] said Trevor. And he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> tell Allardyce, {{who would}} succeed {{him in the}} command of the school football, {{to keep an eye}} on the player in question.|$|E
60|$|Half-a-dozen men of {{more or less}} {{importance}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> nod to Kingston Brooks {{next time}} they saw him, and Mr. Bullsom trudged up his avenue with fresh schemes maturing in his mind. In the domestic circle he further unburdened himself.|$|E
60|$|Canon Spratte {{smiled and}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the remark, which {{he thought would}} do very well from his own lips.|$|R
60|$|Lucy Coulson did not inquire {{whether he}} was acquainted with the lady in question, but <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the fact.|$|R
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{never to}} seem fairly {{friendly}} to an explorer. If you do, he always decides {{to stay the}} night.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} I did not fancy her {{appearance}} and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> {{the effect that}} I would never like Miss Ashley. I {{had no use for}} cool, businesslike women--women should have no concern with business. Nellie would never have troubled her dear, curly head over it.|$|E
60|$|His mood, as the {{automobile}} whirred {{its way down}} the hill toward the town, was sunny. He looked on life benevolently and found it good. The view appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days. As a rule, {{he was the man}} of blood and iron who had no time for admiring scenery, but to-day he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance. It was certainly a dandy little place, this island of his. A vineyard on the right caught his eye. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> uproot it and run up a hotel in its place. Further down the hill, he selected a site for a villa, where the mimosa blazed, and another where at present {{there were a number of}} utterly useless violets. A certain practical element was apt, perhaps, to color Mr. Scobell's half-hours with nature.|$|E
40|$|As an {{academic}} engaging with the tortuous process of bidding for funding, in scanning the contents page of this volume, my eye was immediately {{drawn to a}} study on rhetorical patterns in research grant proposals (Koutsantoni) and I have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> revisit this chapter at a later date. Moreover, as a researcher of undergraduate writing, a postgraduate writer, and a teacher of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) this book ticks all boxes for me. I imagine that every reader of this journal will have some interest in academic writing, even if only as a reader and writer of research articles. This comprehensive volume covers a range of disciplines (e. g. Biology, Economics, History), examines highly specific genres (e. g. the PhD literature review, undergraduate discursive essays) and expands our knowledge of specific features of writing (e. g. restrictive adverbs, engagement features, conjunctive ties) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon I'll {{stay here}} to see the thing out," [...] {{answered}} Williamson. Edwards <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the frontiersman's evasive answer.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly {{they got}} into a hansom, and Mrs. d'Aubigne having given the address in Pimlico, of which George {{instantly}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note,</b> they started.|$|R
60|$|The {{distinguished}} foreigners {{looked at}} each other and then at Miss Jones. Each <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the average cold-blooded ferocity of the young American female.|$|R
6000|$|... "Calm yourself, my good woman, calm yourself," [...] {{said the}} senior partner. He {{perceived}} that the evil prophesied {{by his son}} had come upon him, and he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of this fresh instance of Ezra's powers of foresight.|$|R
6000|$|The {{inspector}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note.</b> Tallente {{threw the}} remains of his cigarette into the sea. [...] "I am going to bed now." [...] he said. [...] "Can I offer you any refreshment, Mr. Inspector, or are your investigations not yet complete?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jean had smelled whisky {{upon his}} {{entrance}} to this cabin. Bill {{was a hard}} drinker, and his father was not immune. Blaisdell, too, drank heavily upon occasions. Jean <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{that he would not}} permit their chances to become impaired by liquor.|$|R
60|$|The {{guns were}} {{standing}} on the green; the soldiers and horses were scattered about, and the handsome captain whom Dare had pointed out to Havill was inspecting the buildings in the company of the quartermaster. Dare <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of these things, and, apparently changing a previous intention, went out from the barracks and returned to the town.|$|R
60|$|Then Mr Dean {{began to}} smell another rat, besides that {{which he was}} just then in pursuit of, for the Colonel had {{incidentally}} mentioned to him the circumstance of the estate passing away from him, owing to a new will having been recently discovered. Although the matter was not the detective's present business, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of it.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of {{that piece}} of {{information}} with {{a good deal of}} satisfaction. I could kill this miscreant now, if I got a chance, and no one would know it. But this very reflection made me so lighthearted that my Conscience could hardly keep his seat, but was like to float aloft toward the ceiling like a toy balloon. I said, presently: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{journey to}} Blentz {{was a short}} one. They had been much nearer that grim {{fortress}} than either had guessed. At {{the outskirts of the}} town they were challenged by Austrian sentries, through which Maenck passed with ease after the sentinel had summoned an officer. From this man Maenck received the password that would carry them through the line of outposts between the town and the castle--"Slankamen." [...] Barney, who overheard the word, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of it.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Trelawny {{came very}} quickly. When Mr. Corbeck saw her, he seemed {{somewhat}} surprised. But his annoyance and excitement had not disappeared; quite enough remained {{to cover up}} any such secondary and purely exoteric feeling as surprise. But as she spoke he never took his eyes off her; and I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that I would find some early opportunity of investigating {{the cause of his}} surprise. She began with an apology which quite smoothed down his ruffled feelings: ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she rode}} home with Uncle John in the afternoon, {{after a day}} of really hard work, Patsy sized up the {{situation}} and declared that she was satisfied that she had made progress. She told Mr. Merrick of the mortgage held over Thompson by Mr. Hopkins, and the little man <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the fact. He also was satisfied with his day's work, and agreed to ride over to Fairview the next day with her and carry the war into this, the largest village in Kenneth's district.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} founded in 1992 as Tex Perkins relates: [...] "I saw Charlie and thought [...] "Jesus Christ". He was easily the best rock guitar player I had seen. He was really dexterous, but gutsy. Not flashy. I think {{it had a lot}} of jazz in him as well. I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that I'd like to work with Charlie and about I year later I heard he was playing with Don Walker in Catfish. Then {{somebody}} suggested I do something with Don Walker and I said [...] "Sure, as long as Charlie Owen is there"." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never {{heard of}} Giulio Clovio!' cried Lord Connemara, seizing the {{opportunity}} with well-affected surprise. 'You really astonish me. He was a Croatian, I believe, or an Illyrian--I forget which--and he studied at Rome under Giulio Romano. Wonderful draughtsman in the nude, and fine colourist; took hints from Raphael and Michael Angelo.' So much {{he had picked}} up from Menotti and Cicolari, and, being a distinguished connoisseur, had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the facts at once, for future reproduction upon a fitting occasion. 'Well, this missal was executed for Cardinal Farnese, as a companion volume to the famous Vita Christi in the Towneley collection. You know it, of course, Lady Exmoor?' ...|$|R
60|$|A red-faced man, {{slamming}} the cabin {{door behind him}} and stumping out on the deck, interrupted my reflections, though I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the topic {{for use in a}} projected essay which I had thought of calling “The Necessity for Freedom: A Plea for the Artist.” The red-faced man shot a glance up at the pilot-house, gazed around at the fog, stumped across the deck and back (he evidently had artificial legs), and stood still by my side, legs wide apart, and with an expression of keen enjoyment on his face. I was not wrong when I decided that his days had been spent on the sea.|$|R
60|$|But Mr Pogram {{was going}} to make a great speech in the next session about foreign relations, and {{was going to}} write strong {{articles}} on the subject; and as he greatly favoured the free and independent custom (a very harmless and agreeable one) of procuring information of any sort in any kind of confidence, and afterwards perverting it publicly in any manner that happened to suit him, he had determined to get at Martin's opinions somehow or other. For if he could have got nothing out of him, he would have had to invent it for him, and that would have been laborious. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of his answer, and went in again.|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed at}} Captain Ackinson, {{and her husband}} {{continued}} his dinner in silence. Mr. Sabin <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of two things--first, that Mr. Watson did not treat his wife with that consideration {{which is supposed to}} be distinctive of American husbands, and secondly, that he drank a good deal of wine without becoming even a shade more amiable. His wife somewhat pointedly drank water, and turning her right shoulder upon her husband, devoted herself to the entertainment of her two companions. At the conclusion of the meal the captain was her abject slave, and Mr. Sabin was quite willing to admit that Mrs. J. B. Watson, whatever her nationality might be, was a very charming woman.|$|R
5000|$|It is true, and I have {{experienced}} it myself, that quick progress ... with artistic pieces (Kunst-Stücke) canons {{and the like}} can engross a sensible composer {{so that he can}} sincerely and secretly delight in his own work. But through this self-love we are unwittingly led away from the true purpose of music, until we hardly think of others at all, although it is our goal to delight them. Really we should follow not only our own inclinations, but those of the listener. I have often composed something that seemed to me trifling, but unexpectedly attained great favour. I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of this, and wrote more of the same, although it had little merit when judged according to artistry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} founded in 1992 as Tex Perkins relates: [...] "I saw Charlie and thought 'Jesus Christ'. He was easily the best rock guitar player I had seen.

Then {{somebody}} suggested I do something with Don Walker and I said 'Sure, as long as Charlie Owen is there'." [...] In early 1992, the as yet unnamed band performed an acoustic live performance for alternative radio station JJJ with James Cruickshank also contributing guitar.|$|R
40|$|Prior {{to reading}} Houston’s book, Telepractice in Speech-Language Pathology, I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of {{questions}} I often hear regarding telepractice and service delivery in our profession. My five questions concerned: technical specifications, reimbursement, professional qualifications, populations {{that would benefit}} from services in this mode, and recommendations for application. I wondered if this book would address those questions. I’m happy to report that it did. Thus, I give this book a “thumbs up ” and highly recommend it as a good addition to your library {{if you want to}} understand telepractice, consider delivering services via technology, invest in alternative approaches to treatment or supervision, or add this delivery method as a new service option to your practice. This is the first book I am aware of that is entirel...|$|R
5000|$|Perkins later said, [...] "I saw Charlie {{and thought}} 'Jesus Christ'. He was easily the best rock guitar player I had seen. He was really dexterous, but gutsy. Not flashy. I {{think it had}} a lot of jazz in him as well. I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that I'd like to work with Charlie and about one year later I heard he was playing with Don Walker in Catfish. Then {{somebody}} suggested I do something with Don Walker and I said 'Sure, as long as Charlie Owen is there'. Walker said, [...] "The first time I clapped eyes on Tex was when he came in my front door, and the next thing I noticed was that he opened his mouth & sung a song or two, and he had this extraordinary voice." ...|$|R
5000|$|Along the way, Jesse {{discovers that}} the most likely {{perpetrator}} of the cruiser explosion, a former associate of Gino, has apparently hanged himself. He learns from Amanda (Christine Tizzard), Gino's executive assistant, that Gino [...] "has a boss", whose identity is a mystery. An otherwise routine traffic stop adds an additional clue: there is an assassin, Arthur [...] "Art" [...] Gallery (Robert Carradine), who has been following Jesse. Despite finding a [...] "deer rifle" [...] in the car's trunk, Jesse lets the man go with a warning: [...] "Don't follow me around!" [...] The flashlight which {{was attached to the}} barrel of the [...] "deer rifle" [...] would have been illegal for hunting game, a deer, but would be quite helpful, if not mandatory, for the assassin's assumed purpose, the killing of a man, and Jesse <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of that.|$|R
5000|$|James Alcock and Ray Hyman {{discussed}} their friendship with Beyerstein and explained how high energy and helpful he was. Alcock stated {{that when he}} knew Barry {{was going to be}} staying at his house, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{of all the things that}} needed fixing around the house. [...] "All I would have to do is look at what needed to be done and Barry would insist on fixing it right then." [...] Hyman stated that Beyerstein was a polymath, he knew everything. Lindsay broke in and said, [...] "Sports, he knew nothing about sports." [...] "I didn't know that" [...] stated Hyman, [...] "Good to know he didn't know everything." [...] He was a do-it-yourself kind of man; he and his wife Suzi built their home from the ground up together, and when he accidentally cut off the tip of his finger, [...] "he sewed it back on." ...|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, {{however, the}} rooms {{turned out to}} be as neat as a new pin, and as admirably kept as any woman in England could keep them. I {{gathered}} from the very first, of course, that Jane {{had been one of the}} servants at The Grange in the days of my First State; and while I drank my cup of tea, Jane herself came in and talked volubly to me, disclosing to me, parenthetically, the further fact that she was the parlour-maid at the time of my father's murder. That gave me a clue to her identity. Then she was the witness Greenfield who gave evidence at the inquest! I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of that, and determined to look up what she'd said to the coroner, in the book of extracts the Inspector gave me, as soon as I got alone in my bedroom that evening.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Bill Horton met {{a curious}} {{character}} while {{in prison for}} his involvement in Kitty Horton's death. [...] "If you touch my bunk, I'll kill you." [...] Bill's cellmate, Brent Douglas, {{was different from the}} rest of the earthy prison population, though his first words to Bill were hardly friendly. He was a singer/con man who was actually intelligent. He and Bill became fast friends in prison despite their rocky start. While in the big house, Brent and Bill had long conversations about Bill's hometown, Salem, and its residents. During one of these talks, Bill innocently mentioned the fact that Susan Martin had inherited $250,000 from her late husband David. This large sum of money sparked Brent's interest, and he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of it. When Bill left the prison, he told Brent to stop by Salem anytime. When Brent was released, that's exactly what he did. Except for one thing: he came to Salem using the name Doug Williams.|$|R
50|$|Meetings of the King of Clubs did {{not always}} {{take place at the}} Crown and Anchor, and after 1819 they were held at the Freemasons Tavern, at Grillions in Albemarle Street, and latterly at the Clarendon Hotel. A {{surviving}} account from one of the clubs early meetings shows that a dinner for twelve members cost a £24, which included two bottles of Madeira, three bottles of Sherry, two bottles of Port and three bottles of Claret. Despite such unashamed conviviality {{there is no evidence that}} alcohol in any way impeded the flow or the quality of the conversation that took place, and we may imagine that the reverse was probably the case since the atmosphere was always a happy blend of the jovial and the serious. It was expected that members should give time to the preparation of their bon-mots, witticisms and anecdotes so that in due course these could be woven into the discussion as productively and effectively as possible. Peter William Clayden recalls how on one occasion Sharp, in fun, chanced upon Boddingtons notes before <b>a</b> meeting, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of all his stories and brought them into the conversation before Boddington could relate them himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm {{glad to be}} here," [...] {{said the}} Altrurian, as simply as the other. He looked about the best room of a farm-house that had never adapted itself to the tastes or needs of the city boarder, and was as stiffly {{repellent}} in its upholstery and as severe in its decoration as hair-cloth chairs and dark-brown wall-paper of a trellis pattern, with drab roses, could make it. The windows were shut tight, and our host did not offer to open them. A fly or two crossed the doorway into the hall, but {{made no attempt to}} penetrate the interior, where we sat in an obscurity that left the high-hung family photographs on the walls vague and uncertain. I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of it as a place where it would be very characteristic to have a rustic funeral take place; and I was pleased to have Mrs. Makely drop into a sort of mortuary murmur, as she said: [...] "I hope your mother is as well as usual this morning?" [...] I perceived that this murmur was produced by the sepulchral influence of the room.|$|R
