50|$|One of {{the easiest}} control {{procedures}} for activated sludge systems is the Constant <b>Mixed</b> <b>Liquor</b> <b>Suspended</b> <b>Solids</b> method. In this method, the operator selects a certain MLSS concentration or range of mix liquor concentrations that produces the best effluent and the highest removal efficiencies. This specific value or range must be calculated depending on COD or BOD load kg/day. When the operator finds the optimum MLSS concentration for each plant, he attempts to maintain this value by adjusting the sludge wasting or sludge excess rate. One rule of thumb for activated sludge systems is that for every pound of BOD removed in the secondary system a half a pound of new solids is generated through reproduction of the organisms and addition of new organisms from the influent wastes. So, the operator tries to waste the proper amount of solids to keep his selected optimum mix liquor concentration constant. If the MLSS concentration is above the desired concentration, the wasting of the excess solids {{will have to be}} started or increased. If the MLSS concentration is below the desired concentration level, wasting should be decreased or stopped.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (MLSS) is the {{concentration}} of suspended solids, in an aeration tank during the activated sludge process, which occurs during the treatment of waste water. The units MLSS is primarily measured in are milligram per litre (mg/L), but for activated sludge its mostly measured in gram per liter g/l which is equal to kilogram per m3 kg/m3. Mixed liquor {{is a combination of}} raw or unsettled wastewater or pre-settled wastewater and activated sludge within an aeration tank. MLSS consists mostly of microorganisms and non-biodegradable suspended matter. MLSS {{is an important part of}} the activated sludge process to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity of active biomass available to consume the applied quantity of organic pollutant at any time. This is known as the food to microorganism ratio, more commonly notated as the F/M ratio. By maintaining this ratio at the appropriate level the biomass will consume high percentages of the food. This minimizes the loss of residual food in the treated effluent. In simple terms, the more the biomass consumes the lower the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) will be in the discharge. It is important that MLSS removes COD and BOD in order to purify water for clean surface waters, and subsequently clean drinking water and hygiene. Raw sewage enters in the water treatment process with a concentration of sometimes several hundred mg/L of BOD. Upon being treated with MLSS and other methods of treatment, {{the concentration}} of BOD in water is lowered to less than 2 mg/L, which is considered to be clean, safe to discharge to surface waters or to reuse water.|$|E
