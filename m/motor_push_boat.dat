5000|$|A pusher, <b>pusher</b> craft, <b>pusher</b> <b>boat,</b> <b>pusher</b> tug, or towboat, is a <b>boat</b> {{designed}} for <b>pushing</b> barges or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels {{refer to them}} as towboats. These vessels are characterized by a square bow, a shallow draft, and typically have knees, which are large plates mounted to the bow for pushing barges of various heights. These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways. Multiple barges lashed together, or a boat and any barges lashed to it, are referred to as a [...] "tow" [...] and can have dozens of barges. Many of these vessels, especially the long distances, or long haul boats, include living quarters for the crew.|$|R

Just to the east and downstream of this, the navigable river is crossed by a swing bridge carrying the road from the centre of Woolhampton village to the nearby village of Brimpton. Craft are warned to enter or leave the lock and pass under the open bridge in a single movement, since the current from the incoming river tends to <b>push</b> <b>boats</b> off course and there is nowhere to moor between the lock and bridge. Adjacent to this bridge is the Row Barge public house.|$|R
