500|$|The {{ownership}} of Chelsea by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich also caused friction between both clubs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in May 2005: [...] "They are a financially doped club. They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's {{a kind of}} doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources. It puts pressure on the market that is not very healthy. They can go to Steven Gerrard or Rio Ferdinand and 'say how <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> earn, we'll give you twice as much.'" [...] Wenger admitted this put Arsenal at a disadvantage in the transfer market; in the case of Shaun Wright-Phillips, a long-term target, Chelsea's interest meant Arsenal needed to wait before making a bid. The player eventually joined Chelsea from Manchester City for £21 million.|$|E

2500|$|Recently, global pollsters {{and psychologists}} have studied {{individual}} differences {{in the sense of}} global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the World Values Survey, administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.” [...] For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) [...] [...] [...] all humans everywhere?”), Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”), Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”), and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”). These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.|$|E
