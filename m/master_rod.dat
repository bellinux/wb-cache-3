50|$|Steel {{cylinder}} liners were screwed into the heads, with their lower parts projecting into the crankcase. Steel seats for valves and sparking plugs were shrunk into the heads. The pistons were forged from alugir, with three compression and one scraper ring and floating bronze bushes for the gudgeon pins. The twelve pistons {{were connected to}} the six crankpins in pairs, each with a master and an auxiliary connecting <b>rod.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>rods</b> had forked big ends with white metal bearings; the auxiliary rod ends ran between the forks on bronze bushes.|$|R

50|$|A {{complicated}} slipper {{bearing system}} {{was used in}} the Le Rhône engine. The <b>master</b> <b>rod</b> was of a split-type, which permitted assembly of the connecting rods. It also employed three concentric grooves, designed to accept slipper bearings from the other cylinders. The other connecting rods used inner-end bronze shoes, which were shaped to fit in the grooves. The <b>master</b> <b>rod</b> was numbered as number one and the shoes of numbers two, five and eight rode in the outer groove, the shoes of three, six and nine in the middle groove and four and seven in the inner groove. Although this system was complex, the Le Rhône engines worked very well.|$|E

50|$|The WHE-25 is {{designed}} with six connecting rods sharing one crankpin on the crankshaft. The standard design for such connection {{is with a}} master connecting rod connected to one piston and the remaining rods connected to pins in the big end of the <b>master</b> <b>rod.</b> Harry Schoell, inventor of the WHE, also invented {{what he called a}} 'spider bearing', which is a disk that can rotate around the crankpin, and has one bearing journal around its periphery for each of the six connecting rods. While this design eliminates the need for a separate <b>master</b> <b>rod,</b> it introduces one uncontrolled degree of freedom, i.e., the spider bearing itself can rotate in one direction until its motion is stopped by impacting with the connecting rods, then rotate in the other direction through some angle before it is stopped by again impacting connecting rods.|$|E

25|$|The Nordberg Manufacturing Company of the United States {{developed}} {{and produced a}} series of large two-stroke radial diesel engines from the late 1940s for electrical production, primarily at aluminium smelters and for pumping water. They differed from most radials in that they had an even number of cylinders in a single bank (or row) and an unusual double <b>master</b> connecting <b>rod.</b> Variants were built that could be run on either diesel oil or gasoline or mixtures of both. A number of powerhouse installations utilising large numbers of these engines {{were made in the}} U.S.|$|R
5000|$|Design {{work on the}} Jumo 222 {{started in}} 1937. The engine was {{configured}} with six inline cylinder banks spaced at equal angles around the crankcase, each bank having four cylinders. The engine looked like a radial due to the arrangement — this was evident from a cross-sectional drawing of the original version, using a <b>master</b> connecting <b>rod</b> with five additional conrods pivoted from the <b>master</b> <b>rod's</b> crankpin end casting, as with a single-row radial — but the internal workings were designed to operate more like a V engine with each adjacent pair of cylinder banks, each with a crossflow head, and it was liquid-cooled like most inlines. Looking at a complete Jumo 222 from a [...] "nose-on" [...] view, the half-dozen cylinder banks were arranged at 60° equal angles from each other, such that neighbouring banks had their exhaust ports (at the [...] "60°, 180° & 300°" [...] spaces) and intake ports (at the [...] "0°, 120° & 240°" [...] spaces) facing each other, resulting in simpler [...] "plumbing" [...] from the rear-mounted supercharger and resulting in only three sets of exhaust headers. The trio of exhaust header sets would have been most likely present {{at the bottom of}} an engine nacelle, and on the upper quarters to either side (appearing like the exhausts for many Allied [...] "upright" [...] V-style aviation engines) for the shortest possible exhaust outlet routing. The four-cylinder-long multibank design also engendered a shorter (by roughly 80 cm/31 in), larger cross-section cylindrical nacelle design somewhat like the Ju 88A used (and in comparison to them), which could still use an enlarged-diameter variety of annular radiator to cool the 222's cylinders and motor oil, and which for the Junkers Ju 288, intended to use pairs of the in-house multibank powerplants (spinning their propellers in opposing directions, like the He 177A), mounting each annular radiator directly ahead of a Jumo 222's multibank crankcase (as with the Jumo 211s used on the Ju 88A) and using hollow ducted spinners with each of its four-blade propellers, to pass the air rearwards into the annular radiators.|$|R
5000|$|It was a {{conventional}} air-cooled radial: nitrided steel barrels with integral fins were screwed into heat-treated Y alloy heads. The pistons were also of heat-treated Y alloy. The crankcase was cast from aluminium alloy, with some minor parts using magnesium alloy.

25|$|The {{progenitor}} for the ASh-73 was the M-70. It {{was tested}} in late 1938 {{and was a}} failure because of cracks in the <b>master</b> connecting <b>rod</b> and the geared centrifugal supercharger's impeller. The exhaust valves also burnt through. The M-71 of 1939 was the successor to the M-70 and it too was not a success. It used some components from the M-62 engine, but its development was slowed by the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. It passed its State acceptance tests {{in the autumn of}} 1942, but was not placed into production as there was not any production capacity available, although it was tested on a number of different prototypes during the war. The M-72 of early 1945 was a boosted version of the M-71 and was superseded by the ASh-73 before production could get underway.|$|R

50|$|Construction of the 18R {{was largely}} of Elektron {{magnesium}} alloy for body components with high strength steels for highly loaded parts {{such as the}} crankshaft. In common with many multiple bank and radial engines the pistons were connected to the crankshaft via master and slave connecting rods; the central vertical bank was served by the <b>master</b> <b>rod</b> which housed the big-end bearing with connecting rods articulating from this {{to the other two}} banks. The 18R was available with or without a Farman (bevel planetary) reduction gear.|$|E
50|$|In certain engine types, master/slave rods {{are used}} {{rather than the}} simple type shown in the picture above. The <b>master</b> <b>rod</b> carries one or more ring pins to which are bolted the much smaller big ends of slave rods on other cylinders. Certain designs of V engines use a master/slave rod for each pair of {{opposite}} cylinders. A drawback {{of this is that}} the stroke of the subsidiary rod is slightly shorter than the master, which increases vibration in a vee engine, catastrophically so for the Sunbeam Arab.|$|E

2500|$|The first prototypes of the ASh-73 {{were built}} in 1945 {{and by the end}} of 1946 testing had {{completed}} successfully. The first models to enter production in 1947 lacked turbo-superchargers. They weighed [...] and had [...] during take-off. The ASh-73TK had two TK-19 turbochargers and an intercooler fitted which were direct copies of the units used on the R-3350. The engine was upgraded over the course of its production. On the fourth series of engines the crankshaft nose was changed, the articulated connecting rods were strengthened and the accessory drive was changed. The middle part of the crankcase and the pistons were strengthened and the ignition was improved in the fifth series. In the sixth series the <b>master</b> connecting <b>rod</b> and the crankshaft cheeks were strengthened, the pistons were lightened and shortened. For the seventh series exhaust valves with floating seats were introduced and the reduction gearing was improved.|$|R
50|$|After their {{successful}} water-cooled radial engines, {{developed from}} 1908 to 1918, Salmson changed their focus to air-cooling to reduce weight and increase specific power (power per unit weight). The {{majority of the}} engines produced by Salmson were of radial type with a few other arrangements such as the Salmson T6.E. In common with other engines produced by this manufacturer, the air-cooled radial engines featured the unorthodox Canton-Unné internal arrangement that dispensed with a <b>master</b> <b>rod</b> in favour of a cage of epicyclic gears driving the crankpin. Production ended in 1951 with the liquidation of the manufacturing company.|$|E
50|$|After an {{intensive}} investigation, the probable {{cause of the}} crash was cited to be failure of the rear <b>master</b> <b>rod</b> bearing on the number three engine. The failure caused the rear crankpin to overheat and fail, whereupon all the rear connecting rods failed, tearing through the cylinder walls and crankcase. In the process, oil lines were torn open, which caused the fire. Sludge buildup in the crankpins, blocking oil flow {{was thought to be}} the root cause, which resulted in improved oil screens and the implementation of a crankpin plug, as well as revised oil change intervals.|$|E
5000|$|A likely {{candidate}} for {{an extreme example}} of compound articulated rod design could be the complex German 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 222 aviation engine, meant to have — unlike an X-engine layout with 24 cylinders, possessing six cylinders per bank — only four cylinders per bank, and six banks of cylinders, all liquid-cooled with five [...] "slave" [...] rods pinned to one <b>master</b> <b>rod,</b> for each [...] "layer" [...] of cylinders in its design. After building nearly 300 test examples in several different displacements, the Junkers firm's complex Jumo 222 engine {{turned out to be}} a production failure for the more advanced combat aircraft of the Third Reich's Luftwaffe which required aviation powerplants of over 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output apiece.|$|E
50|$|When Moses entered Jethro's {{household}} he {{read the}} Name, and by means of {{it was able to}} draw up the rod, for which service Zipporah, Jethro's daughter, was given to him in marriage. Her father had sworn that she should become the wife of the man who should be able to <b>master</b> the miraculous <b>rod</b> and of no other (Pirḳe R. El. 40; Sefer ha-Yashar; Yalḳ. Exodus 168, end). It must, however, be remarked that the Mishnah (Pirkei Avoth v. 9) as yet knew nothing of the miraculous creation of Aaron's Rod, which is first mentioned by the Mekilta (l.c.) and Sifre on Deuteronomy (Berakhot xxxiii. 21; ed. Friedmann, p. 355).|$|R
40|$|Nine {{types of}} Al-Ti, Al-Ti-C and Al-Ti-B <b>master</b> alloy <b>rods</b> have been {{investigated}} by metallography and also by LiMCA measurements after {{the dissolution of the}} alloys in an aluminium melt. The results show the presence of TiC and TiB 2 particle clusters in the Al-Ti-C and Al Ti-B alloys, respectively. The size of the clusters as measured by LiMCA was in the range of 20 - 100 µm. The percentage of the total TiB 2 and TiC additions to the melt that was found in the clusters was up to 2. 8 %. EDX analysis of the TiC particle clusters showed the presence of oxygen, presumably in the form of aluminium oxide, and the TiB 2 clusters also contained oxygen, fluorine and potassium. AI- 5 Ti- 1 B master alloys from different manufacturers contain different quantities of impurities containing oxide and fluoride salts. Furthermore, the distribution of phases varies, especially with respect to texturing of the TiB 2 particles, and the impurities show a varying degree of association with the TiB 2 texture lines. The Al-Ti-C master alloys also showed texturing but the main difference was observed in their oxide content. The quantity of clusters as determined by LiMCA can be related to the microstructure of the master alloys, further supporting the conclusion that oxide {{plays an important role in}} cluster formation in the Al-Ti-C rods and the impurities containing oxide and fluoride salts in the Al-Ti-B rods. The LiMCA tests also confirm that further agglomeration of the clusters and particles occurs in the aluminium melt both for Al-Ti-C and AI-Ti-B master alloys. The flow conditions and particle distribution in an aluminium melt in launders was modelled using CFD for two launder designs. In the first design the effect of vortex formation in the dead-zone at a corner of the launder was demonstrated. Particle dispersion from a point source simulating the dissolution of a <b>master</b> alloy <b>rod</b> was modelled for the second launder. An effective distribution was achieved within 1000 mm from the source of particle introduction, this distance being less than that required for the dissolution of the soluble TiAl 3 particles from the master alloys. LiMCA measurements in the first launder and chemical analysis of samples taken from the flowing melt support the flow and particle distribution modelling...|$|R
