40|$|The {{problem of}} finding small unsatisfiable cores for SAT {{formulas}} has recently {{received a lot}} of interest, mostly for its applications in formal verification. However, propositional logic is often not expressive enough for representing many interesting verification problems, which can be more naturally addressed in the framework of Satisfiability Modulo Theories, SMT. Surprisingly, the problem of finding unsatisfiable cores in SMT has received very little attention in the literature. In this paper we present a novel approach to this problem, called the Lemma-Lifting approach. The main idea is to combine an SMT solver with an external propositional <b>core</b> <b>extractor.</b> The SMT solver produces the theory lemmas found during the search, dynamically lifting the suitable amount of theory information to the Boolean level. The <b>core</b> <b>extractor</b> is then called on the Boolean abstraction of the original SMT problem and of the theory lemmas. This results in an unsatisfiable core for the original SMT problem, once the remaining theory lemmas are removed. The approach is conceptually interesting, and has several advantages in practice.

In this study, the response of folded (corrugated) plate and pyrami-dal truss cores are explored under both quasistatic and dynamic loadings. In particular, two important characteristics of <b>metal</b> <b>cores,</b> the nonuniform hardening/softening evolution due to stressing in different directions and the rate-dependence of this process, are discussed for different core topologies, including the square honeycomb core. In addition, the role of core behavior on the overall performance of sand-wich plates is studied by employing a constitutive model for the elastic-plastic behavior of plastically compressible orthotropic materials [Xue et al. 2005]. The constitutive model is capable of capturing both the anisotropy of the core, associated with stressing in different directions, and its rate-dependence.

40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as penetration bead thickness and toe radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wires for robotic GMAW. Even though <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> electrode. Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding.

Results indicated that for <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis.

Pulsed welding revealed that only a trade-off between values of bead thickness and penetration can create a quality weld.
