40|$|Portable {{fuel cell}} systems consist of three {{essential}} parts: {{the fuel cell}} stack, the fuel storage and the balance of plant (BOP) which contains all required peripheral components. Scaling down fuel cell systems to smaller dimensions in the power range of 1 mW to 1 W currently leads to an increased volume fraction of the peripheral components. Consequently {{it is necessary to}} forego peripheral components in small systems and develop passive systems. Furthermore fuel storage is a challenging issue for portable <b>micro</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems. Common approaches for hydrogen storage, e. g. pressure cartridges or reversible metal hydrides yield a low energy density for the entire system. In our approach a gas evolving cell (GEC) is used to generate hydrogen "on demand". This allows to develop small <b>micro</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems with a high energy density. The GEC is electrically connected in series to the fuel cell. Hydrogen is generated through the electro catalytic Zn-H 2 O reaction and pr oportional to the cell current according to Faraday's law, which leads to a simple and passive system. The dynamic and long-term behavior of the GEC is studied experimentally in this work. The electrical and chemical behavior of the GEC {{plays an important role in}} the design and operation of the <b>micro</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system. Portable applications generally imply dynamic load profiles. Therefore the study focuses on the dynamic response of the GEC. The electric response of the GEC is examined for load pulses in the range of milliseconds with an amplitude of up to 150 mA for the lifecycle of a cell. The results are compared to the behavior of the GECs under an equivalent static load in order to draw conclusions on the effect of the dynamic load. Furthermore the electrical and chemical capacity of the GECs is examined for different loads.

40|$|Fuel cell is an {{electrochemical}} conversion device. It produces {{electricity from}} fuel and an oxidant which reacts {{in the presence}} of an electrolyte. The proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is particularly interesting for mobile applications and it is currently an important research topic in the leading automobile industries. PEMFC has also been developing as a power device for computers and mobile telephones. Hydrogen is a potential fuel for PEMFC because of its high electrochemical reactivity and practically zero pollution level. Since the challegenes of hydrogen storage and delivery for such applications have not been resolved, methanol becomes an alternative fuel for PEMFC. Currently, Nafion® is the most widely applied electrolyte in PEMFC but it suffers from high cost, swelling and loss of mechanical strengths {{in the presence of}} methanol. These problems lead to deterioration of membrane structure, resulting in poor performance in PEMFC. Methanol crossover can be remedied by chemical treatment, modification of polymer chain and addition of copolymers. Inorganic materials such as zeolites, metal oxides and clays were used as fillers of Nafion membrane to decrease methanol permeation. Pure zeolite material as proton-exchange membrane was applied for developing a novel conceptual <b>micro</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> using zeolite micromembrane as electrolyte in this dissertation. Silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5 micromembranes were fabricated via microelectronic fabrication technology. The whole micromembrane unit was made of forty-nine micromembrane arranged in a 7 x 7 square array. Each micromembrane measured 0. 062 mm 2 and gave a total membrane area of 3. 062 mm 2. Molecular sieving was a clearly evidence from the single gas permeation, which indicated that the zeolite micromembrane was relatively free of defects, i. e. the primary gas transport was through the zeolite pores. Proton transport measurement showed that zeolite micromembrane exhibited comparable proton flux as the commercial Nafion® 117 membrane.

In the small power range, both hydrogen and methanol are very attractive fuels but also chemical hydrides and even the reforming of hydrocarbons are moving more and more into the focus of research activities. Hydrogen has the higher potential in terms of power density whereas methanol fuel cells dominate from the energy density point of view. Meanwhile there are numerous institutes and companies dealing with the development of small fuel cell stacks and systems.
