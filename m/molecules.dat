5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior <b>molecules</b> have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary <b>molecules</b> are missing neighbors (compared to interior <b>molecules)</b> and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary <b>molecules</b> must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary <b>molecules</b> results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self <b>molecules.</b> In immunology, self <b>molecules</b> are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self <b>molecules</b> are those recognized as foreign <b>molecules.</b> One class of non-self <b>molecules</b> are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large <b>molecules.</b> These include breaking down and oxidizing food <b>molecules.</b> The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build <b>molecules.</b> The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic <b>molecules</b> are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor <b>molecules</b> such as organic <b>molecules,</b> water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor <b>molecules</b> such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic <b>molecules</b> that are broken down to simpler <b>molecules,</b> such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a chimeric target <b>molecule</b> having an activity {{which can be}} regulated or modulated by a binding <b>molecule.</b> The invention also relates to methods of using the chimeric target <b>molecule</b> to detect the presence and/or amount of a desired analyte in a sample. The analyte is a binding <b>molecule,</b> or a competitor of a binding <b>molecule,</b> which binding <b>molecule,</b> upon binding to the target <b>molecule,</b> alters {{the activity of the}} target <b>molecule</b> in a detectable way. In one aspect of the invention, a binding <b>molecule</b> binds to the chimeric <b>molecule,</b> inactivating it. An analyte in a test sample competes and/or displaces the binding <b>molecule</b> from the chimera, reactivating it. The reappearance of activity {{in the presence of the}} analyte indicates its existence in the test sample, existence and amount. Another aspect of the invention relates to a binding <b>molecule</b> which regulates a chimeric target <b>molecule</b> and methods of producing it...|$|R
50|$|The {{inductive}} effect {{also plays}} {{a vital role in}} deciding the acidity and basicity of a <b>molecule.</b> Groups having +I effect attached to a <b>molecule</b> increases the overall electron density on the <b>molecule</b> and the <b>molecule</b> is able to donate electrons, making it basic. Similarly, groups having -I effect attached to a <b>molecule</b> decreases the overall electron density on the <b>molecule</b> making it electron deficient which results in its acidity. As the number of -I groups attached to a <b>molecule</b> increases, its acidity increases; as the number of +I groups on a <b>molecule</b> increases, its basicity increases.|$|R
5|$|Most of the <b>molecules</b> {{detected}} {{so far are}} organic. Only one inorganic {{species has}} been observed in <b>molecules</b> which contain at least five atoms, SiH4. Larger <b>molecules</b> have so far all {{had at least one}} carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid <b>molecules</b> {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid <b>molecules,</b> resulting in a net force of zero. The <b>molecules</b> at the surface {{do not have the same}} <b>molecules</b> on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small <b>molecules,</b> and large water-soluble <b>molecules</b> (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein <b>molecules</b> have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small <b>molecules</b> is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of <b>molecules</b> {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small <b>molecules</b> might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

50|$|A difluorine {{complex is}} a {{molecular}} complex involving a difluorine <b>molecule</b> (F2) and another <b>molecule.</b> The first synthesised difluorine complex was gold heptafluoride (AuF7) in 1986, which involved a gold pentafluoride <b>molecule</b> (AuF5) and a difluorine <b>molecule.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these <b>molecules</b> have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped <b>molecules.</b> Discotics are flat disc-like <b>molecules</b> consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped <b>molecules</b> have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar <b>molecules</b> is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies {{near the center}} of the Milky Way galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the <b>molecules</b> listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A rich source of investigation for circumstellar <b>molecules</b> is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was once}} thought to be a simple {{solution}} of <b>molecules,</b> the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small <b>molecules</b> such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E

[...] However, the <b>molecule</b> will rearrange (due to allylic strain) into <b>molecule</b> C, causing <b>molecule</b> C to be the major species.

5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large <b>molecules</b> (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch <b>molecules,</b> for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller <b>molecules</b> such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex <b>molecules.</b> In general, the complex <b>molecules</b> that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex <b>molecules</b> such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar <b>molecules</b> that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the <b>molecules</b> with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the <b>molecules</b> with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable <b>molecules</b> with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene <b>molecules</b> supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the <b>molecules</b> with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E

50|$|Usually {{hydrolysis}} is {{a chemical}} {{process in which}} a <b>molecule</b> of water is added to a substance. Sometimes this addition causes both substance and water <b>molecule</b> to split into two parts.

5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like <b>molecules</b> with the long axes of neighboring <b>molecules</b> aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of <b>molecules</b> {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is impermeable to large <b>molecules,</b> nuclear pores {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport of <b>molecules</b> across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger <b>molecules</b> must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small <b>molecules</b> and ions. Movement of large <b>molecules</b> such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA <b>molecules,</b> and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E
5|$|Communication in {{the form}} of quorum sensing plays a role in the {{regulation}} of luminescence in many species of bacteria. Small extracellularly secreted <b>molecules</b> stimulate the bacteria to turn on genes for light production when cell density, measured by concentration of the secreted <b>molecules,</b> is high.|$|E
50|$|Binding {{between the}} target <b>molecule</b> to be {{separated}} and the binding <b>molecule</b> on the column beads can be modeled using a simple equilibrium reaction Keq = CS/(CS) where Keq is the equilibrium constant, C and S are the concentrations of the target <b>molecule</b> and the binding <b>molecule</b> on the column resin, respectively. CS is the concentration of the complex of the target <b>molecule</b> bound to the column resin.|$|R
50|$|At this point, signal {{amplification}} takes place. A label extender DNA <b>molecule</b> {{is added}} that has two domains (similar {{to the first}} extender). The label extender hybridizes to the target and to a pre-amplified <b>molecule.</b> The preamplifier <b>molecule</b> has two domains. First, it binds to the label extender and second, it binds to the amplifier <b>molecule.</b> An example amplifier <b>molecule</b> is an oligonucleotide chain bound to the enzyme alkaline phosphatase.|$|R

The resulting carbamate is then phosphorylated with another <b>molecule</b> of ATP. The resulting <b>molecule</b> of carbamoyl phosphate leaves the enzyme.|$|R
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions.

50|$|Damage {{occurs when}} the free radical {{encounters}} another <b>molecule</b> and seeks to find another electron to pair its unpaired electron. The free radical often pulls an electron off a neighboring <b>molecule,</b> causing the affected <b>molecule</b> to become a free radical itself. The new free radical can then pull an electron off the next <b>molecule,</b> and a chemical chain reaction of radical production occurs. The free radicals produced in such reactions often terminate by removing an electron from a <b>molecule</b> which becomes changed or cannot function without it, especially in biology. Such an event causes damage to the <b>molecule,</b> and thus to the cell that contains it (since the <b>molecule</b> often becomes dysfunctional).|$|R
