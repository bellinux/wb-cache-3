50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the choice of}} IDs for {{messages}} was done simply {{on the basis of}} identifying the type of data and the sending node; however, as the ID is also used as the <b>message</b> <b>priority,</b> this led to poor real-time performance. In those scenarios, a low CAN bus utilization of circa 30% was commonly required to ensure that all messages would meet their deadlines. However, if IDs are instead determined based on the deadline of the message, the lower the numerical ID and hence the higher the <b>message</b> <b>priority,</b> then bus utilizations of 70 to 80% can typically be achieved before any message deadlines are missed.|$|E

50|$|In {{accordance}} with the SAE J1939 protocol, NMEA 2000 messages are sent as packets that consist of a header followed by (typically) 8 bytes of data. The header for a message specifies the transmitting device, the device to which the message was sent (which may be all devices), the <b>message</b> <b>priority,</b> and the PGN (Parameter Group Number).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedNetworks {{have become an}} integral part of life today. However, connectivity problems arise in rural areas or battlefields where wired networks do not exist and wireless networks have limited coverage. In this regime, research into delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) techniques can help maintain opportunistic connectivity with eventual delivery of information. However, current generations of DTN routing techniques have several weaknesses of their own; particularly when the network is under high demand, both message losses and message delays rise quickly. This thesis investigates the potential of a <b>message</b> <b>priority</b> system to maintain delivery rate delays in proportion to <b>message</b> <b>priority.</b> Currently, the priority field exists in the standardized DTN metadata bundle header, but no implementation exists to use <b>message</b> <b>priority</b> as a forwarding criterion. In this thesis, using an eight node PC-based test-bed, we examine performance using existing DTN forwarding strategies, and then implement two new forwarding strategies of our own. Using these two new strategies we repeat the baseline testing using simulated data and disruptions, and observe the results. Our research aims to provide service estimations in terms of delivery rates and comparative delivery times for all levels of priority through all regimes of network demand...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the use of}} IEEE 802. 11 e for <b>priority</b> based <b>messaging</b> in Military Inter-Vehicle Communications (IVC). In the battlefield, {{messages}} generated by military vehicles (i. e., urgent combat related messages, warning <b>messages)</b> have different <b>priorities</b> which have different performance requirements in terms of delay and reliability. The <b>message</b> <b>priorities</b> are assigned based on {{the urgency of the}} message. For example, combat related messages will have the highest priority which is reflected in the lowest delay and highest reliability. We investigate the use of IEEE 802. 11 e to provide such priority based service differentiation. We examine a number of parameters' setting in the IEEE 802. 11 e Enhanced Distribution Coordination Access (EDCA) that will meet military vehicular communication requirements for different types of messages. OPNET based simulation studies are conducted to compare the protocol performance for each priority in terms of average delay as well as the percentage of dropped data.
