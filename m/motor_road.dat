5|$|The Battle of Romani has, however, been {{surrounded}} with controversy and criticism. It {{has been suggested}} that, like {{the attack on the}} Suez Canal in 1915, it was merely a raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal. That the Ottoman Empire's intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good <b>motor</b> <b>road</b> beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel's Desert Mounted Corps {{deployed}} {{the attached}} 53rd (Welsh) Division, and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, {{along with the}} Anzac Mounted and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions, to threaten the Ottoman forces defending the road to Jerusalem. Their advance pushed back the Ottoman forces into the Judean Hills {{to the north of}} Beersheba, creating sufficient space for the XX Corps to get into position for a flank attack on the centre at Hareira and Sheria. This advance was also designed to isolate the Eighth Army forces on the maritime plain, supplied by the roads and railways from Ramla, from those of the Seventh Army, supplied by the <b>motor</b> <b>road</b> from Jerusalem in the hills.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking over}} the western drive up the Ramu River from the 24th Infantry Battalion, the 2/2nd Commando Squadron {{advanced}} from Kesawai and then to Orgoruna, linking up with the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion around Yaula on 4 April. Advancing along a <b>motor</b> <b>road</b> that had been laid by the Japanese, the Australians moved along an axis bounded by the Nuru River and Kabenau River. The withdrawing Japanese offered stiff resistance, but continued to withdraw, allowing the Australians to link up with US forces around Rimba. Bogadjim was eventually reached on 13 April. Meanwhile, part of the 11th Division's divisional carrier company was flown into Wantoat in response to intelligence of Japanese patrols in the area. The dismounted troops fought a brief engagement with about 20 Japanese soldiers on 14 April during which four Japanese were killed and one Australian wounded. The Australians subsequently expanded their patrols towards {{the confluence of the}} Wantoat and Ikwap Rivers. Detecting a small group withdrawing to the north, they returned to Wantoat. A later patrol resulted in four Japanese being taken prisoner.|$|E

500|$|The loss of Beersheba on 31 October {{stunned the}} Yildirim Army Group {{commander}} and staff. The Beersheba garrison withdrew {{either to the}} Ottoman defences around Tel es Sheria or northwards to Tel el Khuweilfe to defend the Hebron road. Here a considerable force, including all available reserve units, was deployed in the Kuweilfeh area to stop a threatened advance up the Hebron road to Jerusalem about [...] to the north. According to Powles, [...] "...the Turkish line had been thrown back on its left, but not broken." [...] The remainder of the Ottoman line stretching westward to the Mediterranean coast continued to be strongly defended, particularly at Hareira, Sharia and Gaza, but the loss of Beersheba had placed EEF mounted units across the Beersheba to Hebron and Jerusalem road, and three Eighth Army infantry battalions were sent by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein to reinforce the Ottoman troops fighting at Khuweilfe to protect the road. They established a new defensive line north of Beersheba, and the 19th Division was sent from the XXII Corps defending Gaza to reinforce the new line at Ebuhof. However, {{the objective of the}} EEF advance north of Beersheba was to separate the Ottoman forces supplied by the roads and railways from Ramleh on the maritime plain from those supplied by the <b>motor</b> <b>road</b> from Jerusalem north of Beersheba. Such an advance would also place the EEF infantry corps in a position to begin to [...] "roll up" [...] the Ottoman flank.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Baekdudaegan is a Korean main {{mountain}} range that {{passes through the}} Korean Peninsula, and Korean people consider {{it to be the}} main ecological axis of the Korean Peninsula. Many <b>motor</b> <b>roads</b> cross the Baekdudaegan, and the Baekdudaegan trail is popular among hikers. The present study investigated the ants of Baekdudaegan using pitfall traps in two separate surveys (2006 – 2008 and 2009) with different sampling designs at six uphill passes to identify the impacts of <b>motor</b> <b>roads</b> and trails. There was no influence from <b>motor</b> <b>roads</b> found (distance from the road and forest fragmentation by road). In the case of trails, however, the further the ants were located from the trails, the less population tended to be observed. The composition of ant species was determined by the temperature niche of ants. When the ants went further south, cold-adapted species declined, while warm-adapted species increased. In this study, a total of 28 species were collected, which is not higher compared with species richness in other areas...|$|R

The ascent from Eskdale is very good, but that is at least a 15-kilometre (9-mile) round trip (depending on where in Eskdale one starts), and many people will think that this too far to [...] "bag" [...] just one fell.

2500|$|The {{normal route}} of Italian supply to Tripoli in Libya, went west round Sicily and then {{close to the}} coast to the port, about , to avoid {{interference}} from British aircraft, ships and submarines based at Malta. On land, supplies had to be carried long distances by road or in small consignments by coaster. The distance from Tripoli to Benghazi was about [...] along the Litoranea Balbo (Via Balbia, the coast road built by the Italians) and only half-way to Alexandria; {{a third of the}} Italian merchant marine was interned after Italy declared war. The road could flood, was vulnerable to the Desert Air Force (DAF) and alternative desert tracks increased vehicle wear. The Italian advance over the Egyptian frontier in late 1940, increased the road transport distance from Tripoli over the Khedival <b>Motor</b> <b>Road,</b> which was much inferior to the Via Balbia.|$|E
2500|$|Water boats from Alexandria and a {{distillation}} {{plant at}} Matruh increased supply but rigorous economy {{had to be}} enforced and much water had to be moved overland to outlying areas. The number of vehicles available in 1939 was inadequate and lorries were diverted to provide the Armoured Division with a better rear link; only the desert-worthy vehicles could be risked off-road, which left tanks unable to move far from Matruh. Matruh was [...] east of the Libyan border. From the border, there was no water at Sollum, for [...] east of Sollum to Sidi Barrani, {{there was only the}} Khedival <b>Motor</b> <b>Road,</b> which deliberately was kept in poor condition in case of an invasion, which meant that an invader would have to move through a waterless and trackless desert to reach the main British force.

2500|$|Mandalay Hill ( [...] ) is a [...] {{hill that}} is located to the {{northeast}} of the city centre of Mandalay in Burma. The city took {{its name from the}} hill. Mandalay Hill is known for its abundance of pagodas and monasteries, and has been a major pilgrimage site for Burmese Buddhists for nearly two centuries. At {{the top of the hill}} is the Sutaungpyei (literally wish-fulfilling) Pagoda. A panoramic view of Mandalay from the top of Mandalay Hill alone makes it worthwhile to attempt a climb up its stairways. There are four covered stairways called saungdan leading up the hill from the south, southeast, west and north, and convenient seats of masonry work line these stairways all the way up. A one-way <b>motor</b> <b>road</b> today saves time and also makes it accessible for those who are unable to climb up the stairs, leading to an escalator and a lift to the pagoda at the summit.|$|E
