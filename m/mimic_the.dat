5|$|Another type of play, called apad, is {{used for}} {{conveying}} linguistic messages from one player to another. This ability to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> intonations of the Maguindanao language on the three highest-tuned gongs has dubbed the gandingan as the talking gongs.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{need not}} involve visual mimicry, but can employ {{deception}} {{of any of}} the senses. While visual signals have attracted most study, some moths <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> ultrasound warning signals sent by unpalatable moths to bat predators, constituting auditory Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Female Photuris fireflies {{sometimes}} <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> {{light pattern}} of another firefly, Photinus, to attract its males as prey. In this way they obtain both {{food and the}} defensive chemicals named lucibufagins, which Photuris cannot synthesize.|$|E
25|$|The common mime has two mimetic {{forms in}} both sexes. The {{nominate}} form P. clytia form clytia <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> common Indian crow (Euploea core) while <b>the</b> form dissimilis <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> blue tiger (Tirumala limniace).|$|R
50|$|The typical form of {{the great}} blue mime <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> striped blue crow (Euploea mulciber) in both sexes. There also occurs in India a form danisepa which <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> magpie crow (Euploea radamanthus). Though the great mimes are easily {{distinguished}} when caught, in flight they very closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>mimicked</b> butterflies.|$|R

5|$|The Mercury {{spacecraft}} that astronaut Gus Grissom flew on July 21, 1961, {{was dubbed}} Liberty Bell 7. Mercury capsules were somewhat bell-shaped, {{and this one}} received a painted crack to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> original bell. Liberty Bell 7 became the only Mercury capsule to suffer an integrity failure.|$|E
5|$|A larger {{outbreak}} occurs {{elsewhere in}} the city, and the virus further evolves to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> nanomachines' abilities. Yuuji delays the creatures' advance as Ai creates the projected being and uses all of her power to purge the infected area of the virus. Yuuji and Ai are later discharged from CURE and spend time together, free from their duties at last.|$|E
5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{version of}} this version of You Don't Know Jack was {{released}} for iOS systems in April 2011. It featured twenty 10-question episodes, but was limited to a single-player mode. Jellyvision Games later pulled the application, in anticipation of release of a more robust client for both iOS and Android that will <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> Facebook application, featuring cross-platform multiplayer between iOS, Android, and Facebook versions, and downloadable episodes from the Facebook game.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult, because the stellar activity may create signals that <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> presence of planets. Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date.|$|E
5|$|Assante and Banderas {{did their}} own singing, and studied {{to master the}} {{instruments}} their characters use in the film. Assante practiced on drums, preparing for {{a scene in which}} his character plays a musical number with Tito Puente. Banderas worked to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> correct posture and finger placements for his character's trumpet performances, while the actual playing was performed by Arturo Sandoval.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This {{ensures that the}} inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> feeling of being hit.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they <b>mimic,</b> <b>the</b> Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|Just Dance is a dance {{video game}} {{developed}} by Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft Paris {{and published by}} Ubisoft. The game was released exclusively for Wii on 17 November 2009 in North America, 26 November 2009 in Australia, and 27 November 2009 in Europe. Expanding upon a concept introduced in a minigame for , players <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> motions of an on-screen dancer's choreography for a selected song, using the Wii Remote to judge the player's motions and accuracy (eschewing accessories such as physical dance pads).|$|E
5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups {{and examples of}} other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E

5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had never left the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Quality of {{life may}} be {{significantly}} reduced, {{even in those}} people on optimum medical therapy. Many report both physical and psychological problems. It {{is likely that the}} commonly used replacement therapies do not completely <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> natural hormone levels in the body. Health costs remain about double those of the normal population.|$|E
5|$|Some fireflies of {{the genus}} Photuris <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> {{flashing}} of female Photinus species to attract males of that species, which are then captured and devoured.
