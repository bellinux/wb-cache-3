25|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} amount of research into the pre-synaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon, which is a <b>multi-domain</b> scaffolding protein universally expressed at synapses in the central nervous system. Mutations in Bassoon have been shown to result in decreased synaptic transmission. However, the underlying mechanisms behind this observed phenomenon are not fully understood and are currently being investigated. It has been observed that in the retina of Bassoon-mutant mice, photoreceptor ribbon synapses are not anchored to pre-synaptic active zones during photoreceptor synaptogenesis. The photoreceptor ribbon synapses are observed to be free floating in the cytoplasm of the photoreceptor terminals. These observations have led to the conclusion that Bassoon plays a critical role {{in the formation of the}} photoreceptor ribbon synapse.|$|E

This paper addresses several types of potential conflicts and consistency properties with a systematic and rigorous approach. In the approach, graph theory, network flow technology and colored Petri nets are applied for specifying and verifying a secure interoperation design. The componentbased integration of policies is applicable for both static and dynamic <b>multi-domains</b> environments...|$|R

One approach {{was to use}} interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables <b>multi-domain</b> LCD. <b>Multi-domain</b> and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E

2500|$|... These domains {{consist of}} two trans-membrane (T) domains and two cytosolic (A) domains. [...] The two T domains {{alternate}} between an inward and outward facing orientation, and the alternation {{is powered by}} the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate or ATP. ATP binds to the A subunits and it is then hydrolyzed to power the alternation, but the exact process by which this happens is not known. [...] The four domains can be present in four separate polypeptides, which occur mostly in bacteria, or present {{in one or two}} <b>multi-domain</b> polypeptides. When the polypeptides are one domain, they can be referred to as a full domain, and when they are two multi-domains they can be referred to as a half domain. [...] The T domains are each built of typically 10 membrane spanning alpha helices, through which the transported substance can cross through the plasma membrane. [...] Also, the structure of the T domains determines the specificity of each ABC protein. [...] In the inward facing conformation, the binding site on the A domain is open directly to the surrounding aqueous solutions. [...] This allows hydrophilic molecules to enter the binding site directly from the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. [...] In addition, a gap in the protein is accessible directly from the hydrophobic core of the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer. [...] This allows hydrophobic molecules to enter the binding site directly from the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. [...] After the ATP powered move to the outward facing conformation, molecules are released from the binding site and allowed to escape into the exoplasmic leaflet or directly into the extracellular medium.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Security Management {{has become}} a {{critical}} aspect for large scale&# 13; distributed systems. Particularly, recent Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) schemes in&# 13; High Speed Networks (HSN) have raised new serious management problems and challenges. &# 13; Increasing the effectiveness of IDS monitoring is primordial to satisfy the restrictive constraints in&# 13; such large <b>multi-domains</b> environment for narrow context of HSN. Approach: We consider the&# 13; intrusion detection monitoring as a two facets entity: one at local level (single domain) and another at&# 13; the global one (<b>multi-domains).</b> Through the local level, evolution of single domain intrusion detection&# 13; process (vulnerability data collection, alert generation and sensor configuration according to some&# 13; improvement scenarios) can be monitored. The global level represents evolution of multi-domain&# 13; intrusion detection process {{as well as the}} eventual security defending process through overall network&# 13; (policy generation, load balancing operations and global alert correlation). Differentiating these two&# 13; facets, leads to the design of a scalable intrusion detection management solution. Results: The&# 13; effectiveness of DIDS management in HSN had been studied and an IDS scalable monitoring&# 13; architecture for <b>multi-domains</b> had been proposed. Several scenarios of Snort IDS showed an&# 13; improvement on the performance of real-time detection. An integration of a set of tools provided a&# 13; convivial IDS monitoring platform. Conclusion: To satisfy the constraints of Intrusion detection&# 13; process in term of real-time and efficiency in HSN we need to monitor efficiently the IDS process. In&# 13; this context, the management framework outlined is more appropriate, convenient and efficient. The&# 13; herein proposed architecture, the snort IDS improvement techniques and the integrated platform&# 13; {{played a crucial role in}} improving of IDS real-time monitoring. </div...|$|R
