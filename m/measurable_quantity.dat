25|$|Momentum is a <b>measurable</b> <b>quantity,</b> and the {{measurement}} {{depends on the}} motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a frame of reference, in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{since the}} {{gravitational}} potential {{is linked to}} the wave-function in the picture of the Schrödinger–Newton equation, the wave-function must be interpreted as a real object. Therefore, at least in principle, it becomes a <b>measurable</b> <b>quantity.</b> Making use of the nonlocal nature of entangled quantum systems, this could be used to send signals faster than light, which is generally thought to be in contradiction with causality. It is, however, not clear if this problem can be resolved by applying the right collapse prescription, yet to be found, consistently to the full quantum system. Also, since gravity is such a weak interaction, {{it is not clear that}} such an experiment can be actually performed within the parameters given in our universe (cf. the discussion about a similar thought experiment proposed by Eppley and Hannah).|$|E

2500|$|In physics, approximations of real {{numbers are}} used for {{continuous}} measurements and natural numbers {{are used for}} discrete measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no <b>measurable</b> <b>quantity</b> could have an infinite value, [...] for instance by taking an infinite value in an extended real number system, or by requiring the counting of {{an infinite number of}} events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite plane wave exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas {{had been}} {{developed}} at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. [...] Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying [...] "intelligence" [...] and the [...] "line speed" [...] at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation [...] (recalling Boltzmann's constant), where W is the speed of transmission of intelligence, m {{is the number of}} different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and K is a constant. [...] Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a <b>measurable</b> <b>quantity,</b> reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as , where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, which has since sometimes been called the hartley in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.|$|E
