Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E
5|$|The corona is the {{extended}} {{atmosphere of the}} Sun, which has a volume <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} canal {{system remains}} from the Industrial Revolution, {{with the city}} having more miles of canal than Venice, although because Birmingham is <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Venice the canals are less of a prominent feature {{than they are in}} Venice. Nowadays the canals are mainly used for leisure purposes, and canalside regeneration schemes such as Brindleyplace have turned the canals into tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> itself.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length is <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> their diameter. Consequently, as {{expected from the}} classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Pratt's {{curriculum}} is narrower in scope, but still accommodates double majors {{in a variety}} of disciplines. The school emphasizes undergraduate research—opportunities for hands-on experiences arise through internships, fellowship programs, and the structured curriculum. More than 27 percent of Pratt undergraduates study abroad, small compared to about half of Trinity undergraduates, but <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the recent national average for engineering students (3.2%).|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat also {{interacts with}} parasites {{that live in}} the trees that they roost in and {{transfer}} themselves to the bats while they are sleeping. The greater noctule bat also interacts with the few nocturnal flying predators in its area, mainly owls that are <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the bat. Evidence of greater noctule bat bones have been found in owl pellets.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic {{errors in the}} measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small planet {{in the range of}} 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island. Ensigns, {{associated}} with maritime matters, are marks of nationality and not sovereignty. Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. The Pulau Pisang incident {{was not an}} acknowledgement by Malaysia of Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca; {{it had been a}} matter of domestic political sensibility – Pulau Pisang is <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Pedra Branca and has a small local population.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E

Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of their own and teach it in the ways of the Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the Gobbos.|$|E
5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by {{the fact that there is}} a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The Fairey Spearfish was a British carrier-based, single-engined, torpedo bomber/dive bomber {{that was}} ordered from Fairey Aviation for the Fleet Air Arm during World War II.

Seven prototypes were ordered, but only five were built, of which four actually flew. They were mostly used for experimental work until the last aircraft was scrapped in 1952.|$|E
