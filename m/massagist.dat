50|$|<b>Massagist</b> is a 2015 horror film {{directed}} by Taweewat Wantha. A Chinese-Thai co-production, {{the film was}} released in China on December 31, 2015.|$|E
50|$|Sergei Vladimirovich Larin (Сергей Владимирович Ларин; born 22 July 1986 in Almaty) is a Kazakhstani {{football}} {{manager and}} former player, He is currently <b>massagist</b> coach of FC Astana.|$|E
50|$|Next {{morning they}} went to the massage salon. But the salon was vanished. So Misae went to the Kasukabe Police Station. The chief Kuroiwa Jintaro ordered the police officer, Dandanbara Teruyo to find the lady <b>massagist</b> who had vanished. But they couldn’t find.|$|E
50|$|Few days later, Shinnosuke met the lady, {{the same}} <b>massagist,</b> and {{she gives him}} a moustache. After he came back home, during dinner Shinnosuke let Robot dad put on the moustache. Suddenly Robot dad changes totally. He becomes a tyrant and rules his family.|$|E
50|$|Once there, Volante {{took part}} in the {{historical}} Rennes 1934-35 squad and also played for Olympique Lillois and CA Paris. During 1938 FIFA World Cup, held in France, he was hired by Brazil National Football Team to work as a <b>massagist.</b> The fear from World War II and a nice relationship built with Brazilian players made Volante transfer to Flamengo, where he would side with Brazilian stars Domingos da Guia and Leonidas.|$|E
40|$|It {{is one of}} {{critical}} factors for a massage robot to find and position the acupuncture point precisely in order to cure the diseases. Based on large amount of sample data offline, Chinese medical empirical knowledge is also introduced to build the prediction model. The <b>massagist</b> prescription and the robot mechanism devise are both considered for robot positioning. Least squares method is of simplicity, {{easy to use and}} high efficiency. Its real-time calculation is very effective, too. A modeling method for robot positioning is proposed based on least squares. Knowledge consultation is set for the calculation of acupoint position. The robot needs to get the feature points of a foot to be massaged. The foot contour sampling data are divided into piecewise curve fitting. Q-learning is adopted to optimize the robot positioning for they are model free. CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller) cerebellum model is incorporated into the function approximation of Q learning. The learning system is rewarded by referring to the strengths of instrumental signal. By the direct representation, the model of human pelma acupoint is expressed with the vector variables and formal computer language. Through prediction model&# 39;s calculation, the robot will work out the rough position of acupuncture point. Meanwhile, Q learning does the online adjustment for accurate location. These strategies provide for the robot to automatically search and position the pelma acupoint with little real-time computation and storage. The idea of this paper also prompts a research cue for the development of Chinese medical standardization...|$|E
