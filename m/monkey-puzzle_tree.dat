5|$|The black mineraloid jet, the {{compressed}} remains of {{ancestors of the}} <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> {{is found in the}} cliffs and on the moors and has been used since the Bronze Age to make beads. The Romans are known to have mined it in the area. In Victorian times jet was brought to Whitby by pack pony to be made into decorative items. It was at the peak of its popularity in the mid-19thcentury when it was favoured for mourning jewellery by Queen Victoria after the death of Prince Albert.|$|E
5000|$|William Lobb (1809 - 1864) Cornish plant collector, {{employed}} by Veitch Nurseries of Exeter, introduced into England Araucaria araucana (the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree)</b> from Chile ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{took his}} {{pseudonym}} from the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> whose Latin name is Araucaria araucana. Another {{name for this}} tree is the [...] "Chile Pine", of which [...] "Cinephile" [...] is an anagram, demonstrating his love for film.|$|E

50|$|Unknown to his employers, Lobb {{also sent}} seeds {{back to his}} former employers, Sir Charles Lemon at Carclew and John Williams of Scorrier House, where a {{plantation}} of <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>trees</b> was grown.|$|R
50|$|William Sawrey Gilpin (1762-1843), {{the artist}} and later {{landscape}} designer, laid out the pinetum, which forms {{the core of the}} arboretum. The trees are now mature, with giant redwoods and <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|William Lobb (1809 - 3 May 1864) was a Cornish plant collector, {{employed}} by Veitch Nurseries of Exeter, {{who was responsible}} for the commercial introduction to England of Araucaria araucana (the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree)</b> from Chile and the massive Sequoiadendron giganteum (Wellingtonia) from North America.|$|E
50|$|The gardens at Scorrier House are notable, {{particularly}} due to {{the influence}} of William Lobb, a famous Victorian nurseryman, botanist and plant hunter, who worked for the Williams family. Lobb repeatedly ventured to the Americas on botanical expeditions and introduced many new exotic species to the United Kingdom. As a result, the gardens of Scorrier House contain many unique species, including Britain’s tallest <b>Monkey-puzzle</b> <b>Tree.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{woodland}} {{that surrounds}} the Grotto or [...] "Secret Spring" [...] of Polmaise Castle supports a number of woodland species such as wood anemones, wood sorrel and bluebells. In {{the area around the}} Grotto many towering, ‘exotic’ conifers were planted in the 1860s by the Murray family which include four Sierra Redwoods, two Coast Redwoods (which can reach over 350’ high becoming the tallest trees on Earth), Douglas-firs, and a South American <b>Monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
50|$|Strathtay is a {{particularly}} attractive village in Highland Perthshire, very much shaped by the Scottish feu system, {{which has led to}} a prevalence of Victorian architecture and landscaping. The village has many stone houses with large, mature gardens containing oak, beech, and <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>trees</b> and rhododendrons. J. M. Barrie is known to have spent summer holidays at Beechwood in Strathtay.|$|R
50|$|The {{sizeable}} {{grounds in}} which the school was situated included a number of spinneys, two grass tennis courts, a hard court, an outside swimming pool and a large playing field, and it adjoined St Kenelm's Church. The grounds directly {{to the west of}} the house were dominated by a mature Wellingtonia tree, a very tall specimen of the Giant Sequoia family, while on the other side of the house towards St Kenelm's Church were two <b>Monkey-Puzzle</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nothofagus dombeyi (Dombey's beech, coigue, coihue or coigüe (from koywe in Mapuche language)) is a {{tree species}} native to {{southern}} Chile and the Andean parts of Argentine Patagonia. It grows from 35 to 45° South latitude between 700 and 1,200 m above mean sea level. It forms dense forests, like {{those found in}} the Los Alerces and Nahuel Huapi national parks. It thrives in low hills with gentle slopes, being very demanding of water and soil; the largest forests are found on the slopes looking south, and the healthier specimens tend to grow on the banks of rivers and lakes. It sometimes forms mixed forests with Araucaria araucana (<b>monkey-puzzle)</b> <b>trees,</b> for example in the Villarrica National Park in Chile. It is fast-growing and well-distributed species that lives in several climatic conditions.|$|R
50|$|James Veitch's {{instructions}} to Lobb included {{a request to}} locate and bring back seeds of the Chile pine (more popularly known as the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree)</b> (Araucaria araucana) which had originally been introduced to Britain by Archibald Menzies in 1795. Veitch had seen a young specimen at Kew Gardens grown from seed brought back by the Horticultural Society's collector James McRae in 1826, and was convinced that this tree would be hugely popular as an ornamental plant.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperate}} forest ecoregions of southwestern South America, including the temperate rain {{forests of the}} Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregions, and the Juan Fernández Islands and Desventuradas Islands, are a refuge for the ancient Antarctic flora, which includes trees like the southern beech (Nothofagus), podocarps, the alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides), and Araucaria pines like the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> (Araucaria araucana). These magnificent rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing non-native pines and eucalyptus.|$|E
50|$|The Victorians fell in {{love with}} the tree in much the same way as they had with the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> a few years earlier, using it as a {{specimen}} tree and often planting it to form avenues, including James Bateman who planted an avenue at Biddulph Grange, alternating Wellingtonia with monkey-puzzle trees. There is a good example of the tree in the garden of the manager’s house at the gunpowder plant in Herodsfoot, Cornwall, where William’s brother, Henry Lobb, lived for many years.|$|E
50|$|In a Gardenesque plan, all trees, {{shrubs and}} other plants are {{positioned}} and managed {{in such a way}} that the character of each plant can be displayed to its full potential. With the spread of botany as a suitable subject of study for the enlightened, the Gardenesque tended to emphasize botanical curiosities and a collector's approach. New plant material that would have seemed bizarre and alien in earlier gardening found settings: pampas grass from Argentina and <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>trees</b> from Chile, for example. Winding paths linked scattered plantings. The Gardenesque approach involved the creation of small-scale landscapes, dotted with features and vignettes, to promote beauty of detail, variety and mystery, sometimes to the detriment of coherence. Artificial mounds helped to stage groupings of shrubs, and island beds became prominent features.|$|R
50|$|The present-day {{campus is}} located {{on the grounds of the}} former estate of Horace Hawes, author of the {{legislative}} bill that created San Mateo County. The grounds include a Japanese tea garden and is surrounded by a number of historical trees; the Giant Sequoia, <b>Monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> Australian Tea tree, Ginkgo biloba trees, Cork Oak tree and many others. The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1995, under its former name Sequoia Union High School.|$|E
5000|$|The genus is {{familiar}} to many people as the genus of the distinctive Chilean pine or <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> (Araucaria araucana). The genus is named after the Spanish exonym Araucano ("from Arauco") applied to the Mapuches of central Chile and south-west Argentina, whose territory incorporates natural stands of this genus. The Mapuche people call it , and consider it sacred. Some Mapuches living in the Andes name themselves [...] ("people of the [...] ") as they traditionally harvested the seeds extensively for food.|$|E
50|$|They called Pehuensat-1 in {{reference}} to the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> an ancient tree and native to the Andean Patagonian forest. The Argentine satellite weighs 6 pounds, goes into orbit about 640 miles high and traveling at a speed around the Earth of 25 000 kilometers per hour. It has an aluminum body structure and space-like solar panels on one side. The electronics consists of a transmitter, a computer and two packs of batteries that are recharged with solar energy. Also responsible for transmitting antenna to Earth parameters.|$|E
5000|$|He and his brother, Thomas Lobb, {{were the}} first {{collectors}} to be sent out by the Veitch nursery business, with the primary commercial aim of obtaining new species and large quantities of seed. His introductions of the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> Wellingtonia and many other conifers to Europe earned him the sobriquet [...] "messenger of the big tree". In addition to his arboreal introductions, he also introduced many garden shrubs and greenhouse plants to Victorian Europe, including Desfontainia spinosa and Berberis darwinii, which are still grown today.|$|E
50|$|The black mineraloid jet, the {{compressed}} remains of {{ancestors of the}} <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> {{is found in the}} cliffs and on the moors and has been used since the Bronze Age to make beads. The Romans are known to have mined it in the area. In Victorian times jet was brought to Whitby by pack pony to be made into decorative items. It was at the peak of its popularity in the mid-19th century when it was favoured for mourning jewellery by Queen Victoria after the death of Prince Albert.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his long}} {{career as an}} Oxford don Bowra had contact with a {{considerable}} portion of the English literary world, either as students or as colleagues. The character of Mr Samgrass in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited {{is said to have}} been modelled on Bowra. Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Anthony Powell and Kenneth Clark knew Bowra quite well when they were undergraduates. Clark called Bowra [...] "the strongest influence in my life". Waugh marked his friend's election as Warden of Wadham by presenting him with a <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> for his garden.|$|E
50|$|Oxycraspedus {{utilizes}} the cones of the <b>Monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> (Araucaria araucana). Adults {{seek shelter}} in the cones - usually female one but occasionally male ones too - and larvae feed on the parenchymatous tissue but not the seeds. Indeed, {{by the time the}} larvae have finished their development to pupation, the host cones are typically already discarded by the plant and have shed their seeds. Very old cones that are slowly rotting on the forest floor are also taken, demonstrating the evolutionary link between Oxycorynini and the other Belidae which also feed on decaying woody tissue, but of twigs and stems.|$|E
50|$|The extreme oceanic climate, with winds {{whipping}} {{vast quantities}} of sea salt into the air, makes the islands very unfavourable to trees, though a few species from South America have been introduced since the 1970s. One outstanding for its beauty and for having resisted strong storms and cool summers is the <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> from Argentina and Chile. Trees from Tierra del Fuego: Drimys winteri, Maytenus magellanica, Embothrium coccineum, Nothofagus antarctica, Nothofagus pumilio, and Nothofagus betuloides, have thrived too, in this cold oceanic climate. In 1979, 6000 small Nothofagus plants were transferred from Tierra del Fuego to the Faroe Islands, making it the biggest Nothofagus population in Europe. Species from the Alaskan coastline and islands have also adapted well in the Faroe Islands, especially Pinus contorta, Picea sitchensis, Salix alaxensis, Populus trichocarpa and Alnus sinuata. The biggest Alaskan pine tree (Pinus contorta) in Europe (in width, not in height), {{is to be found}} in the Selatrað plantation in the Faroe Islands.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{his most}} {{noticeable}} character traits is his association with the devil. This is suggested by his ability to shape-shift (for example in Mr Druce's office, where one minute he is described as adopting {{the form of a}} <b>monkey-puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> the next a professor and then a television interviewer). He is also deformed, as one of his shoulders is higher than the other. Throughout the novel he is described as being an [...] "angel-devil" [...] and a [...] "succubus". He asks various people to feel his head where there are two lumps, apparently where his horns have been surgically removed. However, at certain points of the novel he alludes to the idea {{of not being able to}} cross water, suggesting that he may be more aligned with witchcraft rather than the devil. Elsewhere he boasts about having powers of exorcism and at one point admits he is not the devil, but [...] "one of the wicked spirits that wanders through the world for the ruin of souls".|$|E
