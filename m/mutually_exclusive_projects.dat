We model the spark spread using two-factor model, allowing mean-reversion in short-term variations and uncertainty in the equilibrium price to which prices revert. We analyze two types of gas plants. The first type is a base load plant, generating electricity at all levels of spark spread. The second type is also a base load plant from the outset, but can be upgraded, at a cost, to a peak load plant generating electricity only when spark spread exceeds emission costs. We compute optimal building and upgrading thresholds for such plants when the plant types are <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b> Our results indicate that selecting a project which is first profitable leads to a nonoptimal investment policy, and that increase in short-term volatility preempts upgrading whereas increase in equilibrium volatility delays upgrading.

40|$|In capital {{budgeting}} processes, {{there are}} some crucial problem related to infation and the criteria in making the decision. Among the two discounting methods, analysts may use NPV or IRR. If NPV is used in making capital investment decision, some still doubt that project having zero NPV is still a good project. In this paper we try to explore how important infation factor {{to be considered in}} capital badgeting. The fnancial professional literatures dealing with investment decisions, state in general that the net present value shows objective picture for the decision maker. The net present value shows the amount of wealth growth that have been accumulated by the investment during the life time of the project, but the investmentâ€™s internal rate of return informs the decision maker that how works the real yield of long capital investment. The NPV method is theoritically superior to the IRR method in dealing with <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> <b>project.</b> The Project having zero NPV is considered to be proftable. In general terms, a sound capital investment will earn its original investment and cover the cost of capital invested.

Generally, this criterion consists of individuals' utility and the optimization problem involves minimizing the distortions caused by taxation. A neutral tax is a theoretical tax which avoids distortion and inefficiency completely. Other things being equal, if a tax-payer must choose between two <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> economic <b>projects</b> (say investments) that have the same pre-tax risk and returns, the one with the lower tax or with a tax exemption would be chosen by a rational actor.

50|$|Of these three, {{only the}} {{net present value}} and {{internal}} rate of return decision rules consider all of the project's cash flows and the time value of money. As we shall see, only the net present value decision rule will always lead to the correct decision when choosing among <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> <b>projects.</b> This is because the net present value and {{internal rate of return}} decision rules differ with respect to their reinvestment rate assumptions. The net present value decision rule implicitly assumes that the project's cash flows can be reinvested at the firm's cost of capital, whereas the internal rate of return decision rule implicitly assumes that the cash flows can be reinvested at the project's IRR. Since each project is likely to have a different IRR, the assumption underlying the net present value decision rule is more reasonable.|$|E

Because of the idiosyncratic characteristics of project comparisons and the compound nature of the options involved, neat analytical solutions and techniques are not available to replace the elegant, but inadequate, textbook models.
