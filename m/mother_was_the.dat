Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714.

5|$|Henry's <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> eldest {{daughter}} of Henry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy.

The war, termed the Anarchy by Victorian historians, dragged on and degenerated into stalemate.|$|E
