However, when I tried to teach grammar the way it had been taught to me, I was met with huge resistance from <b>my</b> <b>students.</b> That resistance turned to frustration not just for <b>my</b> <b>students,</b> but also with myself. I tried everything – diagramming sentences, worksheets from grammar books, the Writing Process, “grammar in context, ” even imitating popular writers – but nothing seemed to work.

While I watched other colleagues give up, or press on with their teaching techniques that clearly weren’t working, I became ever more convinced that <b>my</b> <b>students</b> needed <b>to</b> learn Standard English grammar to be successful.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a bilingual cross-curricular approach for Deaf <b>students</b> <b>to</b> gain a meaningful appreciation for history. Social Studies is often {{perceived as a}} boring and unnecessary subject. It is {{even more of a}} challenge for Deaf students when they are typically limited to their History textbooks, which is presented in their secondary language, English. Research shows that the most effective way in educating Deaf children is by using the bilingual approach, utilizing both American Sign Language (ASL) and English in all aspects of the classroom. Based on this research and other learning theories such as Cummins’ Common Underlying Proficiency (CUP), Vygotsky’s scaffolded instruction, and Gardner’s multiples intelligences, a bilingual curriculum with cross-curricular approach, integrating Social Studies and Language Arts together, was designed to teach our Deaf <b>students</b> <b>to</b> {{gain a better understanding of}} our history. The implementation of student-centered literature circles based on historical fiction books allowed <b>my</b> Deaf <b>students</b> <b>to</b> make meaningful connections between ASL and English, thus deepen their understanding of historical period they were studying on.

This was a prelude to the pending publication of a book by Brown titled Samizdat: And Other Issues Regarding the 'Source' of Open Source Code. The book claims that Linux was initially illegally copied from MINIX. Tanenbaum published a strong rebuttal, defending Torvalds, and stated at that time:I would like to close by clearing up a few misconceptions and also correcting a couple of errors. First, I REALLY am not angry with Linus. HONEST. He's not angry with me either. I am not some kind of [...] "sore loser" [...] who feels he has been eclipsed by Linus. MINIX was only a kind of fun hobby for me. I am a professor. I teach and do research and write books and go to conferences and do things professors do. I like my job and my students and my university. ... I wrote MINIX because I wanted <b>my</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> have hands-on experience playing with an operating system. After AT&T forbade teaching from John Lions' book, I decided to write a UNIX-like system for <b>my</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> play with. ... I {{was not trying to}} replace GNU/HURD or Berkeley UNIX. Heaven knows, I have said this enough times. I just wanted to show my students and other students how you could write a UNIX-like system using modern technology. A lot of other people wanted a free production UNIX with lots of bells and whistles and wanted to convert MINIX into that. I was dragged along in the maelstrom for a while, but when Linux came along, I was actually relieved that I could go back to professoring. ... Linus seems to be doing excellent work and I wish him much success in the future.While writing MINIX was fun, I don't really regard it as the most important thing I have ever done. It was more of a distraction than anything else. The most important thing I have done is produce a number of incredibly good students, especially Ph.D. students. See my home page for the list. They have done great things. I am as proud as a mother hen. To the extent that Linus can be counted as my student, I'm proud of him, too. Professors like it when their students go on to greater glory.|$|E

[...] He also claimed {{that he did not have}} figure to back up his claims, but he is convinced that grade inflation began with African American students getting grades which were too high, [...] "Because I have no access to the figures, I have to rely on what I saw and heard at the time.
