2500|$|On reflection, Hantuchová {{said that}} 2012 was a {{difficult}} year for her. She struggled with niggling injuries even before she fractured her foot and was forced out for two months. As a result, her form was inconsistent and she suffered ten first round defeats. She said: [...] "I think 2012 has been a difficult year for me. Had a great start to the season, making the final in Brisbane, winning in Pattaya and feeling very good about my game, but unfortunately, suffered a fracture stress... that kept <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tracks for two months." [...] However, she said that playing in the Olympics at Wimbledon, where she reached the third round, was a [...] "special moment". In an interview {{at the end of}} the year, Hantuchová reflected on turning 30 the following April, saying that it was [...] "just a number" [...] and that she wanted to keep playing as long as possible and break back into the top 10.|$|E
2500|$|Hirst {{was born}} Damien Steven Brennan in Bristol {{and grew up}} in Leeds. He never met his father, with his mother marrying his {{stepfather}} when he was 2 and divorcing 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic. Hirst's mother who was from an Irish Catholic background worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau, and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young. He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker {{to turn it into a}} fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, [...] "If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bus stop." [...] She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.|$|E

6000|$|Toby's eyes glistened at {{the thought}} of the {{unexpected}} pleasure, and then his face grew sad as he replied, [...] "I'd like to come first rate, Mr. Treat, but I don't s'pose Mr. Lord would let <b>me</b> stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shop long enough." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{five minutes}} he had carried <b>me</b> far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> clattering, fidgetty folk around, {{to a quiet}} world where men meditated for three weeks over a bronze, and scoured all Japan for a sword-guard {{designed}} by a great artist and--were horribly cheated in the end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{grief is}} a welcome homage to my own," [...] he said. [...] "Alas, Dio Santo! it is most hideously true. She lies there cold and white as marble, I have just seen her. Come hither, Lazzaro." [...] He drew <b>me</b> aside, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd {{and out of that}} antechamber, into a closet that had been Madonna's oratory. With us came the physician.|$|R
60|$|The {{course of}} this narrative, {{steadily}} flowing on, bears <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> morning-time of our married life, and carries me forward to the end.|$|E
6000|$|I {{read her}} the placard, {{and let her}} lead <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> subject. I could {{not talk about it}} to any one, and how I longed for Eustace! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No indeed,' replied Sissy. 'He {{told me that}} I {{might come}} in now, but he sent <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> room this morning - or at least - ' ...|$|E
6000|$|SERGIUS. Thank you, none for <b>me.</b> (He gets <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{table with}} a certain distaste for Petkoff's {{enjoyment}} of it, and posts himself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps leading to the house.) ...|$|R
60|$|If you {{can meet}} me when the ship arrives, you can help <b>me</b> to get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reporters; and maybe you can take me to your own or some other lodgings where they can't find me.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{was begun}} in 1959 whan I first took {{interest}} in the cyclical behaviour of the balance of payments. My intention {{at that time was}} to try an integration of the business cycle theory into the theory of the balance-of-payments adjustment. Soon, however, I realised that a combination of two already over-simplified models would only take <b>me</b> further <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> practical reality of life, and that a great deal more empirical study would have to be made before a theoretical work could be ventured. [ [...] . ...|$|R
60|$|He looked puzzled, as well he might. Then he smiled, took my {{hand and}} led <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> door--to the knob of which I was still holding with all my might--to the sofa.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] she said, as {{she pushed}} her hand through my arm and began to propel <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sight and hearing {{of people on the}} piazza, [...] "I hope you didn't make a fool of {{yourself}} with Kendricks. They're engaged!" ...|$|E
60|$|Weakly I {{followed}} my dingy acquaintance. He led <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> park down {{a side street}} and {{through a crack in}} a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on. Behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused, and took out his birds.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could recall}} no more the {{hallucination}} of the Eastern Archipelago which I certainly hoped to see again. The story of [...] "Almayer's Folly" [...] got put away under the pillow for that day. I {{do not know}} that I had any occupation to keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it; <b>the</b> {{truth of the matter is}} that on board that ship we were leading just then a contemplative life. I will not say anything of my privileged position. I was there [...] "just to oblige," [...] as an actor of standing may take a small part in the benefit performance of a friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beds! beds!" [...] she cried, [...] "beds everywhere, with dying men on them! And one bed {{the most}} terrible of all--look at it! The {{deformed}} face, with {{the white of the}} pillow all round it! His face? his face, that hadn't a fault in it? Never! It's the face of a devil; the finger-nails of the devil are on it! Take <b>me</b> <b>away!</b> drag <b>me</b> out! I can't move for that face: it's always before me: it's walling me up among the beds: it's burning me all over. Water! water! drown me in the sea; drown <b>me</b> deep, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> burning face!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{remained}} silent. [...] "Perhaps it {{is because}} he loves something else better," [...] I went on. [...] "Come, Mrs Anthony, don't let <b>me</b> carry <b>away</b> <b>from</b> here <b>the</b> idea {{that you are a}} selfish person, hugging the memory of your past happiness, like a rich man his treasure, forgetting the poor at the gate." ...|$|R
60|$|But nobody {{then thought}} I {{was right to}} go. To become clerk to an Irish surveyor, in Connaught, with a salary of 100 a year, at twenty-six years of age! I {{did not think it}} right even myself,--except that {{anything}} was right which would take <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> General Post Office and from London.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{lips were}} upon mine before I could speak. She was drawing <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> door. Her eyes, her arms, {{her whole body}} seemed to be {{pleading}} with me. Then suddenly there came a low knocking at the door. I stood away--no longer a prisoner. It was a wonderful intervention this! How else could I have escaped? ...|$|E
6000|$|By {{reason of}} some {{business}} engagements that called <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, I {{did not see}} my friend the physician for three months afterward. When I did I asked tidings of The Man with the Aneurism. The Doctor's kind face grew sad. [...] "I'm afraid--that is, I don't exactly know whether I've good news or bad. Did you ever see his wife?" ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{and there}} the snow told stories; gay stories, tragic stories, sad, wandering, patient stories of the little woods-people, which the frost had {{hardened}} into crust, as if Nature would keep their memorials forever, like the records on the sunhardened bricks of Babylon. But would the deer live? Would the big buck's cunning provide a yard large enough for wide wandering, with plenty of browse along the paths to carry his flock safely through the winter's hunger? That was a story, waiting somewhere ahead, which made <b>me</b> hurry <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> foot-written records that otherwise would have kept me busy for hours.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 October 2012, Minogue {{was interviewed}} on the {{production}} of the sessions saying, [...] "It's exploring other avenues - but I don't think it takes <b>me</b> completely <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dancefloor, because I'm still a sucker for that ... But I think it just rounds things up, makes things more whole and satisfies a different place in me." [...] Before recording at Abbey Road, she had started rehearsals [...] "somewhere cheaper". She said that the Abbey Road studio was [...] "a bit intimidating. I thought the place would have attitude but the whole experience was really gorgeous and you know, you know you are on hallowed ground." ...|$|R
60|$|So hot did our {{arguments}} become {{about this}} subject of the Church, for, as may be imagined, {{in the course of}} them I revealed some unorthodoxy, especially as regards the matter of our methods of Christianising Kaffirs, that I was extremely thankful when a diversion occurred which took <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home. <b>The</b> story of my defence of Maraisfontein had spread far, and that of my feats of shooting, especially in the Goose Kloof, still farther. So the end of it was that those in authority commandeered me to serve in one of the continual Kaffir frontier wars which was in progress, and instantly gave me a commission as a kind of lieutenant in a border corps.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have told}} lies {{in order to}} turn <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> only man who ever loved me. You and your odious son have conspired to ruin my {{happiness}} and break my heart. What have you told him that keeps him away? I shall see him and learn the truth." [...] Kate's face was unnaturally calm and rigid as she faced her guardian's angry gaze.|$|E
6000|$|... "They think they'll drive <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studio; {{but they}} won't; I shall stay there just exactly {{as long as}} it suits me. All that this morning, it was Lucy Otter's doing, I know it was. She always has hated me. She thought after that I'd take myself off. I daresay she'd like me to go. She's afraid I know too much about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have a good}} memory," [...] he replied. [...] "That {{sometimes}} happened; {{but there}} were other reasons which turned <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> paths of the pedagogue. With my widely extended opportunities, I naturally came to know a good deal of medicine and surgery. Frequently I had been a doctor in spite of myself, and {{as far back as the}} days of the patriarchs I was called upon to render aid to sick and ailing people.|$|E
60|$|It was {{necessary}} for <b>me</b> to get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> king's town without confiding my determination to any one, or any one having knowledge of my departure, for I knew very well {{that there was not}} one of my officers but would have stayed me from acting on my plans had they been informed of them, even if they should find it needful to use force to prevent my going.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. You see, I've allers worked there, an' am 'quainted {{with the}} fellers, {{so it seems}} to me it's 'bout the only spot. If you should try down by South Ferry, or 'round here anywhere, everybody'd do their best to drive you out, same's Skip did. I b'long up to City Hall, so they can't shove <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> there; an' <b>the</b> bootblacks in any place else would raise a row if I come takin' trade away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How's {{a fellow}} {{going to learn}} if he isn't allowed to try? Might as well tell <b>me</b> to keep <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water till I can swim. You {{give me a chance}} and see if I can't ride as well as some older fellows who have been pitched round pretty lively before they dared to try a twenty-mile spin," [...] {{answered}} Hugh, clapping both hands on his knees to hide the tell-tale darns.|$|R
60|$|After a long supplication, {{pronounced}} {{standing at}} the doorway, we entered, and sauntered about the burial-ground. On {{the left of the}} road stood an enclosure, which, according to Abdullah, belonged to his family. The door and stone slabs, being valuable to the poor, had been removed, and the graves of his forefathers appeared to have been invaded by the jackal. He sighed, recited a Fatihah with tears in his eyes, and hurried <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you? Then {{you must}} be very thick-headed. My father has sent me word that you are to be turned out. Of course he means it for me. He {{does not wish to}} give me the power of saying that he sent <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house,--me, whom he has so long {{endeavored}} to rob,--me, to whom he owes so much for taking no steps to punish his fraud. And he knows that I can take none, because he is on his death-bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still {{pulling at}} my sleeve, she led <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cottage. As we went I glanced back, {{and there was}} that yellow livid face {{watching}} {{us out of the}} upper window. What link could there be between that creature and my wife? Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day before be connected with her? It was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never know ease again until I had solved it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am," [...] was Slaty's prompt response. [...] "It {{will take}} pretty bad weather to drive <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> here. If <b>the</b> snow gets too deep I'll just {{go up to}} Farmer Brown's barnyard. I can always pick up a meal there, for Farmer Brown's boy {{is a very good}} friend of mine. I know he won't let me starve, no matter what the weather is. I {{think it is going to}} snow some more. I like the snow. You know I am sometimes called the Snowbird." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{that day}} stood out above all my other days. To this day it so stands out. The {{memory of it}} is branded in my brain. But the price exacted was too high. I refused to play and pay, and {{returned}} to my cannon-balls and taffy-slabs. The point {{is that all the}} chemistry of my healthy, normal body drove <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> alcohol. <b>The</b> stuff didn't agree with me. It was abominable. But, despite this, circumstance was to continue to drive me toward John Barleycorn, to drive me again and again, until, after long years, the time should come when I would look up John Barleycorn in every haunt of men--look him up and hail him gladly as benefactor and friend. And detest and hate him all the time. Yes, he is a strange friend, John Barleycorn.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2013, news {{reporting}} {{was published}} {{that there had}} been systematic looting of the Biblioteca Girolamini. Images showed empty shelves and tables piled with papers. Senior Police investigator, Major Antonio Coppola, was quoted as saying, [...] "Our investigations found that there was a true criminal system in action," [...] and that [...] "A group of people... carried out a devastating, systematic looting of the library." [...] The report stated that Professor Tomaso Montanari CV, an art historian and academic, first alerted the police to what was happening, after having gained access to the library along with a student in early 2012. The Professor said, [...] "One of the library's members of staff took <b>me</b> aside, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CCTV cameras, and said: 'Professor, the director (Marino Massimo de Caro) has been looting the library!'"
