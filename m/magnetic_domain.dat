25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a ferromagnetic material {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains. Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal <b>magnetic</b> <b>domain</b> boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{commonly}} used analogies {{that do not}} use power conjugate pairs. [...] For sensors, correctly modelling energy flows {{may not be so}} important. [...] Sensors often extract only tiny amounts of energy into the system. [...] Choosing variables that are convenient to measure, particularly ones that the sensor is sensing, may be more useful. [...] For instance, in the thermal resistance analogy, thernal resistance is considered analogous to electrical resistance, resulting in temperature difference and thermal power mapping to voltage and current respectively. [...] The power conjugate of temperature difference is not thermal power, but rather entropy flow rate, something that cannot be directly measured. [...] Another analogy of the same sort occurs in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>domain.</b> [...] This maps magnetic reluctance to electrical resistance, resulting in magnetic flux mapping to current instead of magnetic flux rate of change as required for compatible variables.|$|E
