30|$|Physical {{properties}} of different fibers (mineral, cellulose, or carbon fiber) and their stabilizing and reinforcing effects on asphalt mortar performance were studied. Scanning electron microscopy {{was used to}} study the effect of fiber’s microstructure on asphalt mortar’s performance. Laboratory tests of mesh-basket draindown and oven heating were designed and performed to evaluate the fibers’ asphalt absorption and thermostability. A cone penetration {{test was used to}} study the flow resistance <b>of</b> fiber-modified <b>asphalt</b> mortar. Results showed that fiber can form a three-dimensional network structure in asphalt, and this network can be retained at high temperature. This network of fibers favors the formation of a thick coating <b>of</b> <b>mastic</b> without <b>asphalt</b> draining down. Cellulose fiber possessed a greater effect on asphalt absorption and stabilization than did the other fibers (mineral and carbon fiber). A dynamic shear rheometer was used to evaluate their rheological properties and rut resistance. Results indicated that fiber can effectively improve the rut and flow resistance <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> mortar. However, the bending beam rheometer results demonstrated that the addition of fiber had negative effects on the creep stiffness and creep rate <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> mortar.|$|R

Because aggregates represent around 95 % in mass <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt</b> mixtures, {{it is important to}} understand how these materials affect properties and performance of such mixtures. This research focus on how different types and contents of aggregates affect properties <b>of</b> <b>mastics</b> and <b>asphalt</b> mixtures, and their performance considering the viscoelastic nature <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt</b> material. Five different types of aggregates and hydrated lime were used for sample fabrication together with two different binders. Several different tests were performed to the aggregates separately. Viscoelastic properties for both mastics and hot mix asphalt mixtures were characterized. In addition, the mixtures produced with those aggregates were also evaluated for rutting and fatigue performances using the APA and UTM- 25 kN machines. Among the studies conducted in this research work are: restricted zone, a controversial concept and its redundancy; rutting potential of mixtures with different coarse and fine angularities; the stiffening potential of binders provided by different fillers; the stiffening provided by different contents of hydrated lime to asphalt concrete mixtures and fatigue and rutting potential of mixtures with different contents of hydrated lime. The results indicate that the restricted zone should not be a criterion for the selection of mixture gradations, that angularity somewhat affects the rutting potential <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete mixtures, that fillers of different materials provide different gain in stiffness for binders and that this improvement is binder dependent. Also, hydrated lime was found to have higher stiffening potential than general mineral fillers used in this study. Hydrated lime was also proven to improve the stiffness <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete mixtures. Even though stiffening the mixtures, hydrated lime was shown to improve the fatigue performance of the mixtures. Finally, this filler also improved the rutting resistance of mixtures...|$|R

Static punch penetration tests and channel formation tests were conducted at different temperatures in order to investigate the deformation characteristics. Low-temperature characteristics were examined in tension and cooling tests. The power consumption of the mixer was measured over the mixing and dwell times. (orig.)

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the mechanical performance of the polymer modified mastic asphalt with 4 % montan wax (Asphaltan A) additive. The impact of wax modification on binder, binder/filler mixtures and mastic asphalt was investigated in the laboratory. Wax modified binder properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conventional tests (softening point, penetration, elastic recovery, breaking point, viscosity and storage stability). The bending beam rheometer (BBR) was used for determining low temperature creep compliance and the tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) for determining low temperature fracture. The fatigue cracking behavior <b>of</b> <b>mastic</b> <b>asphalt</b> was investigated using Superpave Indirect Tensile Test (IDT). Based on HMA Fracture Mechanics the influence of wax on the asphalt mixture resistance to fatigue and brittle cracking has been evaluated. The addition of wax to the polymer modified binder resulted in a viscosity reduction at higher temperatures, indicating a possible lower production and laying temperature as compared to asphalt without wax additive. DMA and BBR results showed some increase in stiffness and a more elastic response of the wax modified binder at medium and low temperatures. The TSRST fracture temperature was higher for the mastic asphalt containing wax, indicating a certain negative impact of wax modification. QC 20111208 </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of low {{temperature}} (LT) asphalt products {{can result in}} a significant decrease of temperature (up to 250 °C) required for asphalt production. This, in turn, reduces energy costs and consumption. Moreover, safety during asphalt production and laying improves – especially in the case <b>of</b> <b>mastic</b> <b>asphalt</b> production –, because the amount of potentially harmful vapours and aerosols decreases. Temperature decrease, in addition to the above, reduces the short-term ageing of bitumen in the asphalt production process, and ultimately has a positive impact on the durability of pavements. It is a high priority on the innovation agenda of COLAS Group Hungary to promote the application <b>of</b> {{low temperature}} <b>asphalt</b> products in Hungarian road construction.

40|$|In this study, {{asphalt binder}} and asphalt {{concrete}} (AC) materials are characterized using laboratory nanoindentation testing and mechanical models. Traditionally, laboratory nanoindentation test data is analyzed using the Oliver-Pharr method to determine elastic modulus and hardness of materials. In a nanoindentation test, a test sample surface is indented or loaded by a hard indenter tip and then unloaded. In the past, several {{studies of the}} polymer materials area have selected a loading rate and dwell time (i. e., the peak load is kept constant {{for a few seconds}} before unloading) to avoid or minimize the viscous effect of a material. No studies have attempted {{to examine the effects of}} dwell time and loading rate on viscous materials such as asphalt binder, which is the main topic of discussion in this study. This study focuses on determination of mechanical properties such as the elastic modulus and the hardness of viscoelastic materials, like asphalt, from nanoindentation load-displacement data. An existing spring-dashpot-rigid (SDR) element model developed by Oyen and Cook is employed as well as the well-established Oliver Pharr method. The SDR model uses the loading, holding and unloading time-displacement data to predict the modulus, hardness and viscosity of the material. The model has shown excellent agreement with the laboratory indentation data <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> binder. Further, the SDR model is calibrated for nanoindentation test data <b>of</b> polymer modified <b>asphalt</b> binder. In addition, mechanical models such as the Voigt model and the Burger model are fitted to creep displacement and time data from nanoindentation tests to predict viscosity, retardation time and creep compliance for asphalt binder. All the models are found to fit very well with an average R 2 -value of 0. 99 for the Voigt model and R 2 -value of 0. 99 for the Burger model. Lastly, the nanoindentation test is performed on an AC (solid) sample to understand the aging in AC. Nanoindentation is done on two different parts of the AC sample: one on the <b>mastic</b> part (mix <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> binder and fines) and the other on the pure aggregate part. One hundred indentations were made in a single test on the mastic part to capture the heterogeneity. Approximately sixty indentations were made during a single indentation test on the aggregate part of AC. A small dwell time was applied to reduce the viscous effect <b>of</b> the <b>mastic.</b> This research is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through GOALI program.

It is a workable approach for the micromechanics <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete and other geomaterials. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, London. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{rheological model}} <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete {{based on the}} generalized Kelvin model is offered. The mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete viscoelastic behavior {{that can be used}} for calculation <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete upper layers of non-rigid pavements for strength and rutting has been developed. It has been proved that the structural model of Burgers does not fully meet all the requirements of the asphalt-concrete...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{installations}} involve {{two layers}} <b>of</b> <b>asphalt.</b> For this installation, a base layer <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> (1" [...] thick) is placed down first. Heating cables are then installed and secured {{to the surface}} of the base layer. Once the heating cables are installed, a second layer <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> is placed over the heating cables and the first layer, embedding the heating cables within the slab.|$|R
