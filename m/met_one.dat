5|$|Home <b>met</b> <b>one</b> of {{his future}} closest friends in 1867; the young Lord Adare (later the 4th Earl of Dunraven). Adare {{was fascinated by}} Home, and began documenting the séances they held. The {{following}} year, Home {{was said to have}} levitated out of the third storey window of one room, and back in through the window of the adjoining room in front of three witnesses (Adare, Captain Wynne, and Lord Lindsay).|$|E
5|$|In early April, Dangić {{made the}} mistake of {{travelling}} to Serbia, where he <b>met</b> <b>one</b> of Nedić's representatives and various other Chetnik leaders, and attended a public rally in Valjevo. Shortly afterwards, Kuntze ordered Dangić's arrest. Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland, being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia. Dangić escaped from prison in 1943. The following year he participated in the Warsaw Uprising, an anti-German rebellion which resulted in the deaths of 18,000 members of the Polish Home Army and over 200,000 Polish civilians.|$|E
5|$|Tension between Tutsi and Hutu {{had been}} {{escalating}} during the 1950s, and {{culminated in the}} 1959 Rwandan Revolution. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Kagame's family abandoned their home, living {{for two years in}} the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing the border into Uganda. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the Toro sub-region in 1962. It was around this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, Fred Rwigyema, first <b>met</b> <b>one</b> another.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura <b>met</b> <b>one</b> of the most promising students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only <b>met</b> <b>one</b> person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|The Boys from Baghdad High {{received}} its world première at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, an annual film festival for documentary productions held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In the US it was screened on 29 April 2008 at the Tribeca Film Festival, and 1 August 2008 at the Traverse City Film Festival. The first time Winter and O'Mahoney <b>met</b> <b>one</b> of the film's subjects {{was at the}} 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, nearly {{a year after the}} filming had completed. Ali and his family had relocated to the US since completing the documentary, and so he was able to attend the screening. Winter and Ali met a second time at the Traverse City Film Festival. The producers had tried to get the boys visas to enter the UK for a screening in London, but they were denied entry by the British Government.|$|E
50|$|They {{experienced}} {{their first}} losing season {{in franchise history}} in 1984, finishing 30 games behind the first place Lynchburg <b>Mets.</b> <b>One</b> reason {{may have been the}} fact the team had three different managers (John Hart, Len Johnston and Grady Little) during the season. In 1985, the Suns played an exhibition game with the parent club Baltimore Orioles.|$|R

5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it <b>met</b> <b>one</b> {{more time in}} December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E

25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Detroit Red Wings and the Maple Leafs {{was at its}} height during the Original Six-era. The Leafs and Red Wings met in the postseason six times during the 1940s, {{including}} four Stanley Cup finals. The Leafs beat the Red Wings in five of their six meetings. In the 1950s, the Leafs and Red Wings <b>met</b> <b>one</b> another in six Stanley Cup semifinals; the Red Wings beat the Leafs in five of their six meetings. From 1961 to 1967, the two teams <b>met</b> <b>one</b> another in three playoff series, including two Stanley Cup finals.

25|$|Veterans {{would be}} allowed to settle only if they <b>met</b> <b>one</b> or more {{conditions}} based on length of service, gallantry or related illness. Many of the requirements seemed designed to frustrate: for example, one way to qualify automatically was by soldiering for at least 20 years, though most rank-and-file Gurkhas serve for only 15. Another was to prove that a long-term medical condition was caused or worsened by active service—a tall order for those whose injuries were sustained decades ago.|$|E

25|$|According to {{traditional}} legend, Wang Chongyang met two Taoist immortals {{in the summer}} of 1159 CE. The immortals, Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin taught him Taoist beliefs and trained him in secret rituals. The meeting proved deeply influential, and roughly a year later, in 1160, Wang <b>met</b> <b>one</b> of these men again. In this second encounter, he was provided with a set of five written instructions which led to his decision of living by himself in a grave he created for himself in Zhongnan Mountain for three years.|$|E
25|$|Teams {{coming from}} the qualifiers that had already <b>met</b> <b>one</b> of the provincial champions in an earlier match in the {{competition}} were automatically kept apart from that team. This made a draw unnecessary on the A side of the draw, Cork and Galway were prevented from facing Kerry and Mayo respectively. On the B side of the draw, Armagh had not met either of the teams {{and were able to}} play either Donegal or Dublin, but Monaghan's earlier game with Donegal meant that those two teams were kept apart, again making a draw unnecessary.|$|E
