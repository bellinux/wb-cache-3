25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{black-and-white}} photos dated back to {{the summer}} of 1982 (after her freshman year at Syracuse University) when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for Mount Kisco, New York photographer Tom Chiapel. Williams stated {{at the time that}} Chiapel said that [...] "he had a concept of having two models pose nude for silhouettes. Basically to make different shapes and forms. The light would be behind the models. I was reluctant, but since he assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be the only one to see them and I would not be identifiable in the photographs, I agreed. He had also gotten another model to agree to this." [...] In a 2012 interview with NPR, Williams discussed these events stating that her mother: ...|$|E
2500|$|Luther and {{his wife}} moved into a former monastery, [...] "The Black Cloister," [...] a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast (1525–32). They {{embarked}} on what {{appears to have been}} a happy and successful marriage, though money was often short. Katharina bore six children: Hans– June 1526; Elizabeth– 10 December 1527, who died within a few months; Magdalene– 1529, who died in Luther's arms in 1542; Martin– 1531; Paul– January 1533; and Margaret– 1534; and she helped the couple earn a living by farming and taking in boarders. Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526: [...] "My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seems to}} <b>me</b> then <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather {{be a hero}} of a French duel than a crowned and sceptered monarch.|$|R

2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
60|$|On that date, I was {{composed}} {{enough to think}} again of Lucilla, and to remember Mrs. Finch's polite request to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write to her from Marseilles.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] cried Nanny {{with sudden}} passion. [...] "Na, na; I'll {{be a woman}} on the poor's rates. Oh, mither, mither, you little thocht when you bore <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come to this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be {{that this}} armour will be useful, {{on the day of}} battle," [...] Philip said; [...] "but at present it seems to <b>me,</b> Francois, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> much rather be without it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, old fellow, {{take care}} what you are about. Don't let them say of you that you show the white feather. Upon my honour, I'd sooner have {{anything}} said of <b>me</b> than <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> indeed,--anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None in the least:--or {{to giving}} it {{you to keep}} for <b>me,</b> only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not so far trouble you. But I have an {{objection}} to telling them. They are my enemies. Let them find out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{the first}} time I saw her, {{and that was very}} soon after I came to this neighborhood. I knew as soon as she spoke to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never marry any one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just as you like, father; {{it seems}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather fight than be robbed; but as {{everyone}} {{seems to think that}} we should be certainly beaten I am willing to agree to anything you wish.' ...|$|E
60|$|There was my {{only chance}} to escape detection. If the fellow turned, I was lost; nor could I have {{dropped to the floor}} undetected, since he was no nearly below <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have struck him had I done so.|$|E
60|$|On my dearie's wedding morning I wakened {{early and}} went to her room. Long and long ago she had made <b>me</b> promise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{be the one to}} wake her on the morning of her wedding day.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} blame her," [...] she loyally insisted. [...] "I am to blame. My guides tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{surrender}} myself completely to them <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find peace," [...] she ended, slowly, sadly, {{as if in}} confession.|$|R
6000|$|... "You dined there!" [...] exclaimed St. Barbe. [...] "It is very odd, {{they have}} never asked <b>me.</b> Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have {{accepted}} their invitation. I avoid parvenus. They are too fidgety for my taste. I require repose, and only dine with the old nobility." ...|$|R
60|$|His face brightened at my words, and {{he assured}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find him as ready to {{acknowledge}} my command upon {{the wrong side}} of thirty as upon the right, an assurance which I hastened to tell him I did not need.|$|E
60|$|When I {{mentioned}} my {{inability to}} repay {{them for their}} kindness to me they assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have ample opportunity if I lived long upon Barsoom, and bidding me farewell they watched me until I {{was out of sight}} upon the broad white turnpike.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, yes; {{you are not}} at all sharp {{at keeping}} your secrets from me. And, mother, at one time, for a day or so, I thought that I could oblige you. You have been so good to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> almost do {{anything}} for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once from Mrs. Hasketh, to make <b>me</b> promise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{leave the}} child to her altogether, and not write to her, or ask to see her. When I went to the {{cemetery}} to-day, I did not know but I should find her grave, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt. She told it <b>me</b> presuming <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not betray her; but <b>I</b> shall,--if <b>that</b> be a betrayal. The Duke {{must know}} it. It will be {{infinitely}} better {{that he should}} know it through you, or through her, than through me. But he must be told." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said that}} he was a trader in sandal-wood, and no pirate, and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> join him for this trip he would give me a good share of the profits, or put me on shore in some civilised island if I chose." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{questioned}} {{many of them}} concerning past historical events, {{but they}} knew nothing beyond the narrow limits of their island and the savage, primitive life they led there. London they had never heard of, and they assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find no human beings upon the mainland.|$|E
6000|$|... "These two youths, as I drew near, gave me very courteous greeting, and besought <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> declare to them my {{name and}} degree, and I did so. Then they besought <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come {{with them to the}} castle, and I went with them with great content of spirit; for {{it seemed to me that}} this was likely to be a very fair and cheerful place to lodge over-night. So I entered with those two youths into the castle, and there came attendants and took my horse and there came others who unarmed me and led me to a bath of tepid water. After that I descended to the hall of that castle, and there I beheld that it was all hung with {{tapestries}} and fabrics of divers sorts and of very rich and beautiful designs.|$|E
6000|$|I {{postulated}} {{that it should}} be none of those [...] "ten minutes in the air" [...] affairs. I wanted a real business flight. Commander O. assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get [...] "awfully bored," [...] but I declared that I was willing to take that risk. [...] "Very well," [...] he said. [...] "Eleven o'clock to-morrow. Don't be late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I hope to take {{possession}} and pull {{in the earth}} above me [...] And, renouncing my profession, ne'er be heard of any more. [...] For there's not a soul to love me and no living thing respects me, [...] Which so painfully affects <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> fain <b>would</b> 'go before.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D'ye {{think so}} I" [...] said Bremner; [...] "it seems to <b>me</b> so calm <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> think a storm a'most impossible. But the fish never tell lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Fanny, let <b>me</b> say first, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> far rather {{we worked}} for a scanty living again than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> see you rich and married to Mr Sparkler.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, exactly. You see, I have {{a restless}} nature, for some reason, {{while all the}} rest of my race are quiet and {{contented}} Orks and seldom stray far from home. From childhood days I loved to fly long distances away, although father often warned <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get into trouble by so doing.|$|E
60|$|He {{exchanged}} {{a few words}} with his men, motioned to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ride behind one of them, and then mounted his own animal. The fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him on the glossy back of his mount, where I hung on as best I could by the belts and straps which held the Martian's weapons and ornaments.|$|E
60|$|When I had {{mastered}} all this I {{was filled with}} rage and bethought <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> cause Larico to be taken and suffer the fate of traitors. Soon, however, I changed this mind of mine and placing the spy in close keeping where none could come at him, I set a watch on Larico but said nothing to him or to Kari of all that I had learned.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may {{ask what}} {{questions}} you please, {{but you have}} my answer to <b>that</b> already,' said <b>I.</b> 'Besides, sir,' said I, 'can you think so ill of <b>me</b> as <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give any answer to such a question beforehand? Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Ashley, {{gathering}} {{himself up}} from his hassock with difficulty, and confronting her: [...] "Do I look {{like a man who}} would dare to make fun of you? I am half a head shorter than you, and in moral grandeur you overtop <b>me</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> always have to wear a high hat when I was with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} has been some fault; but Flo, dearest, listen to <b>me.</b> You know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask you to do nothing from which a woman should shrink." ...|$|R
