5|$|His {{importance}} in the literary context of the saga is his prominence {{as the son of}} Bolli Þorleiksson and Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir, the two central characters of the work. He is <b>mentioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the Sneglu-Hall þáttur (The Tale of Sarcastic Halli), and is also the subject of his own tale, the Bollaþáttur, which was later appended {{to the end of the}} manuscripts in the early 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Hardware {{benchmarking}} {{conducted using}} Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and <b>mentioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 {{times higher than}} the iPhone 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4S.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 1936, Charles de Chambrun, French {{ambassador}} to Italy, presented the French government's non-intervention plan; Galeazzo Ciano promised to study it. The British, however, accepted {{the plan in}} principle immediately. The following day, it was put to Konstantin von Neurath, {{the foreign minister of}} Nazi Germany by André François-Poncet. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, so long as the USSR was present. It was <b>mentioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> meeting of the French with Neurath that both countries were already supplying the parties in the war, France the Republicans and Germany the Nationalists. A similar approach was made by the French to the Soviet Union. On 6 August, Ciano confirmed Italian support in principle. Despite a Pravda claim that 12,145,000 roubles had already been sent by Russian workers to Spain, the Soviet government similarly agreed in principle, so long as Portugal was included, and so long as Germany and Italy stopped aid immediately.|$|E

5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, {{it was in a}} state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was <b>mentioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E

25|$|The Abhidhamma {{philosophies of}} the various early schools often {{disagree}} on doctrine and belong to the period of 'Divided Buddhism' (as opposed to Undivided Buddhism). The earliest texts of the Pali Canon (the Sutta Nipata, parts of the Jatakas, and the first four Nikayas of the Suttapitaka) have no mention of (the texts of) the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Abhidhamma is also not <b>mentioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> report of the First Buddhist Council, directly {{after the death of}} the Buddha. This report of the first council does mention the existence of the Vinaya and the five Nikayas (of the Suttapitaka).|$|E

Only later was an independent regiment or cavalerie de reserve established in 1693 under the command of Duc du Maine.

This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian Paolo Sarpi, who received the report in November, and the English mathematician and astronomer Thomas Harriot, who used a six-powered telescope {{by the summer of}} 1609 to observe features on the moon.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Science {{launched}} a phone hotline {{to deal with}} concerns about radiation exposure outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had been walking with Geiger-counters through their locality in search of all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be <b>mentioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized {{by the state of}} Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper way, how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.|$|E
