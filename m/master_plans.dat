5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> to renovate the airport.|$|E
5|$|The American {{occupation}} in 1898 {{introduced a new}} breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham's plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture. In Iloilo, a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American {{occupation in}} the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan has}} been very controversial, {{primarily}} because it was planned to include the demolition of many residences and shops owned by the town's inhabitants.

Many were concerned what negative effects the redevelopment would have on their lives and the prosperity of the town as a whole.

After Egypt opened {{itself to the}} West in the 1970s, the United States, various European countries and the World Bank provided major investment financing for {{water supply and sanitation}} and for irrigation and drainage. The Gulf countries partially financed mega-projects to develop new lands for irrigation in the New Valley (supported by the United Arab Emirates) and in Northern Sinai (supported by Kuwait an Saudi Arabia). Concerning technical assistance, the Netherlands, the World Bank and UNDP played important roles in supporting successive national water <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> since the 1980s. UNDP and the National Water Research Center have developed a computer-supported Decision Support System for Water Resources, which can produce various climate change scenarios for the Nile basin and therefore help to improve water resource planning and management. USAID provided substantial support to improve irrigation infrastructure and to support water user associations. With support by USAID a layer of management - the Inspectorate level - was stripped from the MWRI administrative system, different chains of command were brought together in the form of Integrated Water Management Districts (IWMDs), and Branch Canal Water User Associations were established across around 40% of the irrigated area of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In early 2000, the {{national}} government developed two key policy instruments to control wastewater pollution. First, the National Plan for Municipal Wastewater Management (PMAR), which provides a framework for the rapid evolution of wastewater management programs in the large urban areas. This national plan promotes coordinated wastewater management at the local, regional, and national levels by focusing on institutional strengthening {{and the application of}} existing planning tools. Furthermore, it promotes the construction of wastewater treatment systems in municipalities with adequate water and sewerage service and with prioritized high impact watersheds, including Río Bogotá, Río Chicamocha, Río Medellin and Río Cauca. Second, the Sanitation and Management of Wastewater Discharge Plan (Plan de Saneamiento y Manejo de Vertimientos, PSMV), which mandates that the service providers indicate programs, projects and activities following an implementation schedule and investment plan aimed at reducing pollution loads in receiving waters and improving wastewater collection in municipal sewer systems. PSMV’s action plans are aligned with other planning instruments, for instance water quality objectives defined by the environmental authority, as well as <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> and investment plans set by the municipalities. These two national policies have been instrumental to support the recent increase of wastewater programs in large cities in Colombia.|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate development has generated considerable debate regarding the exclusive {{nature of these}} developments. <b>Master</b> <b>planned</b> estates appear to find considerable support from planners and governments, {{as well as the}} residents within these new estate areas. The research presented here analysed the constructions of exclusivity for a <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate (Glenmore Park) {{and the extent to which}} the constructed identity for Glenmore Park resulted in socio-spatial polarisation within western Sydney.

2500|$|The main {{campus is}} marked by an {{irregular}} layout and eclectic architectural styles, including ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings, and the more spare international and modernist structures.

While some buildings are neatly arranged into quadrangles, others are packed densely and haphazardly.
