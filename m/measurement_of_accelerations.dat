The exciting frequencies at which the possible causes of vibration can be recognised are estimated for all principle parts of the ball mill.

40|$|Due to {{advanced}} technology, {{it is very}} important the performance of FMS for sensivity, production quality, repeatability and energy consumptions. Flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) are the most automated and technologically sophisticated of the machine cell types used to implement cellular manufacturing. An FMS usually has multiple automated stations and is capable of variable routings among stations, while its flexibility allows it to operate as a mixed model system. The FMS concept integrates many of the advanced technologies that we met in previous units, including flexible automation, CNC machines, distributed computer control, and automated material handling and storage. In this experimental investigation, vibration and accelerations analysis of an experimental FMS with 5 degrees of freedom robot manipulator are presented.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of the}} MICROSCOPE space {{mission is}} to test the weak {{equivalence}} principle (WEP) with a precision of 10 − 15, 100 times better than on-ground experiments. The WEP violation signal that we look for in flight has a particular frequency signature and must be extracted from the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accelerations</b> dominated by a colored noise integrated over several orbits. The measured data include various modeled or possibly unknown perturbation signals and may be frequently interrupted during the long integration period. Therefore the cautious analysis of the time series that will be obtained is of utmost importance for the validation of the mission. We present a linear regression procedure that we have developed to tackle the problem of missing data {{in the presence of}} correlated residuals. While the uncertainty of standard least square methods is increased by more than an order of magnitude in the presence of gapped data, we show that our method allows us to maintain the targeted level of precision of the experiment.

40|$|International audienceVibration {{monitoring}} is conventionally performed from <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration,</b> velocity or displacement. However, {{these are}} not the primer parameters of interest in most structural diagnosis. Dynamic stress and strain are the appropriate parameters, which may be used in this monitoring. In some cases, strain is measured using strain gages techniques. But, when it is required to measure strain at different points, these techniques become onerous, because the strain gages must be fixed in structure and cannot be reused. In this sense, some methods have been developed to predict the dynamic strain from vibration measurements on structures. These methods basically consist in the numerical differentiation of displacement, obtained by modal analysis. Here, the dynamic strain prediction, based on hybrid modal analysis and acceleration measurements, is carried out. We used the finite difference method in the displacement to strain transformation. The displacements were obtained from <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> and operating deflection shapes technique. The predicted strains were compared with the measured strains in the time domain. The predicted results closely agree with the measured results...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} two configurations of an echo interferometer {{that rely on}} standing wave excitation of a laser-cooled sample of rubidium atoms that measures acceleration. For a two-pulse configuration, the interferometer signal is modulated at the recoil frequency and exhibits a sinusoidal frequency chirp {{as a function of}} pulse spacing. For a three-pulse stimulated echo configuration, the signal is observed without recoil modulation and exhibits a modulation at a single frequency. The three-pulse configuration is less sensitive to effects of vibrations and magnetic field curvature leading to a longer experimental timescale. For both configurations of the atom interferometer (AI), we show that a <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> with a statistical precision of 0. 5 % can be realized by analyzing the shape of the echo envelope that has a temporal duration of a few microseconds. Using the two-pulse AI, we obtain <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> that are statistically precise to 6 parts per million (ppm) on a 25 ms timescale. Using the three-pulse AI, we obtain <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> that are statistically precise to 0. 4 ppm on a timescale of 50 ms. A further statistical enhancement is achieved by analyzing the data across the echo envelope to improve the statistical precision to 75 parts per billion (ppb). We discuss methods for reducing prominent systematic effects due to a magnetized vacuum chamber and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Simulations of both AI configurations with a timescale of 300 ms reached in a non-magnetic vacuum chamber suggest that an optimized experiment with improved vibration isolation and atoms selected in the mF = 0 state can result in <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> g statistically precise to 0. 3 pbb for the two-pulse AI and 0. 6 ppb for the three-pulse AI.
