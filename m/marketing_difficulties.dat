5000|$|Prior to 1999, {{producer}} Sara Colleton {{sought to}} develop a script for The Painted Veil. The script was frequently redrafted, being written {{to be close to}} the source material, to take liberties with the source material, and to create a feminist version. Actor Edward Norton became involved with the project in 1999. [...] Norton explained his attraction to the project, [...] "It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings." [...] The actor suggested casting Naomi Watts for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in Mulholland Drive (2001) and 21 Grams (2003). When Watts joined the project, she recommended director John Curran, with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film We Don't Live Here Anymore. The director's expertise with We Don't Live Here Anymore convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in The Painted Veil. [...] The project began development at producers Bob Yari and Mark Gordon's Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start Warner Independent Pictures, he brought the project with him. Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by Warner Bros. production president Jeff Robinov, which later led to the film's <b>marketing</b> <b>difficulties.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When the {{fighting}} started, the Chinese Government commissioned {{a group to}} help mill owners move their equipment inland. Areas such as Shantung, Honan, and Wuhan were able to move tons of equipment inland before the Japanese arrived, essentially clearing out existing mills and setting up new ones. However, around Shanghai, {{the fighting}} started so suddenly that only the equipment inside the International Settlement survived. Approximately 44% of the Chinese mills were located in and around Shanghai, and as a result, 60 Chinese owned mills possessing about 70% of Chinese-run manufacturing equipment were lost. A large number of small weaving and dyeing workshops were also destroyed. When mills were not entirely destroyed, they were either operated by Japanese companies or transformed into hospitals or military headquarters. Most mills around Shanghai were too badly damaged to get fully running again quickly and were simply transformed to military use, but in the North, mills soon resumed work under the Japanese. However, these Japanese controlled mills were constantly harassed by guerrillas or revolting workers. The Japanese were further hindered by the exhaustion of raw materials, scarcity of labor, and <b>marketing</b> <b>difficulties</b> due to nationalistic conflicts. For example, when they evacuated their Qingdao mills {{for a few months}} in late 1937, the mills were in ruins when they returned. Soon the Japanese began to offer a system of [...] "cooperative management" [...] to the Chinese mill owners. Under this organization, there would be Japanese management and the Japanese would get 51% of the profits. Meanwhile, all repair costs would be borne by the Chinese. Most owners rejected this system.|$|E

40|$|Many {{companies}} have exploited {{the power of}} brand equity in B 2 C markets {{as a source of}} competitive advantage. The trend in B 2 B, however, seems to be slightly different where many decision makers still believe that branding is not relevant to their business as it is to B 2 C. This paper investigates the role of brand equity in B 2 B businesses and shows how long-term investment in brand equity can change {{the rules of the game}} radically in favor of those B 2 B companies who have invested in their brand with a "holistic" approach which conform the overall strategy of the company. Caterpillar Inc. has been chosen as the case study and the role of its brand equity in its superior performance over its competitor, Komatsu Ltd, is investigated. The qualitative part of the research analyses the brand associations and the roles that these associations together with other brand elements play for Caterpillar and its customers. The quantitative part investigates two particular areas of recovery from <b>market</b> <b>difficulties</b> and efficiency in market communications and proves the role of higher brand equity in superior performance in recovery from <b>market</b> <b>difficulties</b> and <b>marketing</b> communications efficiency. The results are then tested further on the second case study which compares Intel to AMD. The results also open up new lines for further research on the subject both in depth and breadth where suggestions are made for generalizability of the research as well as determining the role of brand equity in companies' performances more precisely...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Overall {{labor market}} {{conditions}} deteriorated markedly in 2008 following {{the onset of}} the recession in December 2007. Although individuals in all race and ethnicity groups experienced labor <b>market</b> <b>difficulties,</b> labor <b>market</b> problems for blacks or African Americans and Hispanics or Latinos were especially acute in 2008. For example, in 2008, the unemployment rate was 10. 1 percent for blacks and 7. 6 percent for Hispanics. These figures were considerably higher than the unemployment rates for whites and Asians, at 5. 2 percent and 4. 0 percent, respectively. The labor <b>market</b> <b>difficulties</b> of blacks and Hispanics are associated with many factors, not all of which are measurable. Some of these factors are their lower average levels of schooling; their tendency to be employed in occupations with high levels of unemployment; their greater concentration in the central cities of urban areas, where job opportunities may be relatively limited; and the likelihood that they experience discrimination in the workplace. These and other factors may make it especially difficult for some black and Hispanic workers to find or keep jobs as the overall demand for labor contracts during economic downturns. This report describes the labor force characteristics and earnings patterns among the major race and ethnicity groups and provides detailed data through a set of supporting tables. These data are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly survey of 60, 000 households that is a rich source of information on the labor force. For definitions of terms and concepts used in this report, see the Technical Note. For additional information about the CPS, see the explanatory note for the household survey online at [URL]...|$|R

Cassava varieties with 50 % more yielding potential and technologies to boost processing and marketing of cassava are available.

40|$|Purpose – The Indonesian Government {{has taken}} many {{measures}} {{to support the}} development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are expected to {{play a crucial role}} in employment creation, gross domestic product growth, and non-oil and gas export development. The purpose of this paper is to examine recent developments of SMEs in Indonesia. More specifically, it aims to address the following research questions: How important are SMEs in Indonesia? What are their main constraints? What is the impact of women entrepreneurs on SME development? and Can Indonesian SMEs be sources of innovation? Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyzes data from Indonesia's National Agency of Statistics and reviews key literature and secondary data on Indonesian SMEs. Findings – First, SMEs have been the main player in domestic economic activities as they account for more than 99. 9 percent of all firms and employ 96. 2 percent of the workforce. Second, key SME constraints include lack of finance and <b>marketing</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Third, representation of women entrepreneurs is still relatively low and can be attributed to low level of education and cultural/religious constraints. Finally, SME innovation capability is low for several key reasons.

In the context of stagnating/depleting catches, sustainable development of fisheries sector and the livelihood of fishers become problems. The concern over the sustainability of fisheries resources and the resulting threat on the livelihood of the traditional fishers in Kerala form {{the subject matter of}} the present study. The study includes descriptive, exploratory and confirmatory research. It reveals that technological developments resulted in the stagnation/declining of marine landings in Kerala. It also identifies the sustainability issues which are directly or indirectly related to technology.
