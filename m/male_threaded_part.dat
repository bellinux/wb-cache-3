50|$|A screw {{is a type}} of fastener, {{sometimes}} {{similar to}} a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> (external thread) or just thread.|$|R
50|$|Every {{matched pair}} of threads, {{external}} and internal, {{can be described}} as male and female. For example, a screw has <b>male</b> <b>threads,</b> while its matching hole (whether in nut or substrate) has female threads. This property is called gender.|$|R
5000|$|Jointing threads: These are {{pipe threads}} where pressure-tightness is made through the mating of two threads together. They always use a taper <b>male</b> <b>thread,</b> but can have either {{parallel}} or taper female threads. (International standards require all female threads to be parallel.) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS <b>parts</b> are screw, <b>thread</b> rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special <b>thread</b> of these <b>parts.</b> To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> pitch diameter control...|$|R

5000|$|Longscrew threads: These are {{parallel}} pipe threads used where a pressure-tight joint {{is achieved by}} the compression of a soft material (such as an o-ring seal or a washer) between the end face of the <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> and a socket or nipple face, with the tightening of a backnut.|$|R
5000|$|By common convention, right-{{handedness}} is {{the default}} handedness for screw threads. Therefore, most <b>threaded</b> <b>parts</b> and fasteners have right-handed threads. Left-handed thread applications include: ...|$|R

The thread is {{nominally}} 1.000 in in diameter, with 32 threads per inch, designated as [...] "1-32 UN 2A" [...] in the ANSI B1.1 standard for unified screw threads. The flange focal distance is 17.526 mm for a C mount.|$|R
40|$|Techniques for {{determining}} and correcting <b>threaded</b> <b>part</b> alignment using force and angular position data are developed to augment currently limited techniques for align- ing <b>threaded</b> <b>parts.</b> These new techniques {{are based on}} backspinning a nut {{with respect to a}} bolt and measuring the force change that occurs when the bolt "falls" into the nut. Kinematic models that describe the relationship between <b>threaded</b> <b>parts</b> during backspinning are introduced and are used to show how angular alignment may be determined. The models indicate how to distinguish between the aligned and misaligned cases of a bolt and a nut connection by using axial force data only. In addition, by tracking the in-plane relative attitude of the bolt during spinning, data can be obtained on the direction of the angular misalignment which, in turn, is used to correct the misalignment. Results from experiments using a bolt held in a specialized fixture and a three fingers Stanford/JPL hand are presented...|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{threading}} processes including: cutting threads with a tap or die, thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A tap {{is used to}} cut a female thread on the inside surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a die cuts a <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> on a preformed cylindrical rod.|$|R

50|$|A plug fits {{inside the}} pipe segment or fitting {{to which it}} is mated. In a {{threaded}} plumbing system, plugs have <b>male</b> <b>threads.</b> There are a number of plug types: mechanical, pneumatic-disk, single-size pneumatic rubber, multi-size pneumatic and flow-through, and high-pressure. Special temporary plugs, usually made of flexible rubber, may be installed into a plumbing system to allow pressure testing for leakage.|$|R
50|$|British Standard Pipe (BSP) is {{a family}} of {{technical}} standards for screw threads that has been adopted internationally for interconnecting and sealing pipes and fittings by mating an external (<b>male)</b> <b>thread</b> with an internal (female) thread. It has been adopted as standard in plumbing and pipe fitting, except in the United States, where NPT and related threads are the standard used.|$|R
50|$|A double-tapped bushing is {{more compact}} than a reducer, {{but not as}} flexible. While a double-tapped bushing has a smaller female thread {{concentric}} to a larger <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> (and thus couples a smaller male end to a larger female), a reducer may have large and small ends of either gender. If both ends are the same gender, it is a gender-changing reducer.|$|R

5000|$|Linear {{polarizing}} filters can {{be easily}} distinguished from circular polarizers. In linear polarizing filters, the polarizing effect works (rotate to see differences) regardless of {{which side of the}} filter the scene is viewed from.

50|$|In an {{external}} (<b>male)</b> <b>thread</b> (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter Dmaj and the minor diameter Dmin define maximum {{dimensions of the}} thread. This means that the external thread must end flat at Dmaj, but can be rounded out below the minor diameter Dmin. Conversely, in an internal (female) thread (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are minimum dimensions, therefore the thread profile must end flat at Dmin but may be rounded out beyond Dmaj.|$|R

25|$|Inspection of the {{finished}} screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with {{the expense of the}} method tailored to the requirements of the product application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a nut onto it (for <b>male</b> <b>threads)</b> or a bolt into it (for female threads). This is plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although it is not good enough for most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision methods are discussed below.|$|R
