In this work, process variables optimization of Powder Mixed Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (PMWEDM) of AISI 304 stainless steel (SS) is studied using <b>molybdenum</b> <b>wire</b> as the tool material. This work illustrate the implementation of Taguchi technique and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to identify the optimal process variables of WEDM using dielectric medium mixed with Silicon Carbide(SiC) powder. Selection of optimum process variables for obtaining higher cutting efficiency and accuracy is a difficult task in WEDM due to presence of large number of control variables and complicated stochastic process mechanisms.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have been}} found to have extraordinary properties, such as ballistic electrical conductivity, extremely high thermal conductivity and they can be metallic or semiconducting {{with a wide range of}} band gaps. There are however several issues that have to be solved before these properties can be fully utilised. One of these issues is that the nanotube growth temperature must be lowered in order to make the synthesis compatible with the fabrication processes used in electronics. The whole environment is heated to temperatures typically higher than 500 °C in the standard growth techniques whereas only a very localised area is heated in the technique developed here. This technique thus provides a way around the temperature issue. In the method developed here, the catalyst is deposited on top of a small metal (<b>molybdenum)</b> <b>wire</b> on the substrate. The high temperature required for nanotube growth is then reached by Joule heating by sending a current through the metal wire. This process eliminates the furnace which is used in conventional chemical vapour deposition and localises the high temperature to a very small and controlled area of the sample. Consequently, this technique is compatible with the semiconductor technology used today. Another advantage of this technique is that, since no furnace is required, a small growth chamber, which fits under a microscope, can be used. This allows in situ studies of the growth by optical microscopy and by Raman spectroscopy. By changing the carbon precursor, single- or multiwalled nanotubes can be grown. This can be important when producing devices since single-walled nanotubes predominantly are semiconducting whereas multi-walled mainly are metallic. The multi-walled nanotubes grow in a rapid and concerted process. This growth was monitored through an optical microscope. It was found that the thickness of the support layer and especially the catalyst are even more crucial parameters for nanotube growth using this local heating technique than in conventional processes. The activation energy could be extracted and was found to be 1. 1 - 1. 3 eV. The carbon nanotube growth was investigated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The growth evolution could be well described by a model using the initial growth rate and the catalyst lifetime as parameters. The process was found to be limited by the mass transport of the carbon precursor. It was found that the <b>molybdenum</b> <b>wire</b> creates an additional pathway for the carbon cycle from gas to nanotube formation. The Raman spectra were studied at elevated temperatures. A decrease in intensity and a shift towards lower wavenumbers with increasing temperature was observed for the Stokes signal. It was found that the laser used for the Raman measurements could heat the nanotubes to high temperatures without any other heat source. Vertically aligned arrays of nanotubes were grown by conventional CVD. These arrays were actuated by applying a DC voltage between them. An effective Young's modulus of the arrays was found to be similar to that of rubber, which is orders of magnitude lower than for individual nanotubes.

Time-integrated penumbral imaging recorded the X-ray source dimension of less than 15 μm in the spectral region above 2. 4 keV. The total yield of more than 80 mJ was registered with the radiation pulse duration as short as 1. 5 ns. The appearance of single- or multiple-source core structures is discussed in correlation with used wire material and X-pinch torsion angle. The results confirm the possibility of using an X-pinch driven by a fast compact capacitor bank for backlighting applications...|$|R
40|$|Grit-blasted anode {{surfaces}} {{are commonly used}} in ion engines to ensure adherence of sputtered coatings. Next generation ion engines will require higher power levels, longer operating times, and thus there will likely be thicker sputtered coatings on their anode surfaces than observed to date on 2. 3 kW-class xenon ion engines. The thickness of coatings on the anode of a 10 kW, 40 -centimeter diameter thruster, for example, may be 22 micrometers or more after extended operation. Grit-blasted wire mesh, titanium, and aluminum coupons were coated with molybdenum at accelerated rates to establish coating stability after the deposition process and after thermal cycling tests. These accelerated deposition rates are roughly three orders of magnitude more rapid than the rates at which the screen grid is sputtered in a 2. 3 kW-class, 30 -centimeter diameter ion engine. Using both RF and DC sputtering processes, the molybdenum coating thicknesses ranged from 8 to 130 micrometers, and deposition rates from 1. 8 micrometers per hour to 5. 1 micrometers per hour. In all cases, the molybdenum coatings were stable after the deposition process, {{and there was no}} evidence of spalling of the coatings after 20 cycles from about - 60 to + 320 C. The stable, 130 micrometer <b>molybdenum</b> coating on <b>wire</b> mesh is 26 times thicker than the thickest coating found on the anode of a 2. 3 kW, xenon ion engine that was tested for 8200 hr. Additionally, this coating on wire mesh coupon is estimated to be a factor of greater than 4 thicker than one would expect to obtain on the anode of the next generation ion engine which may have xenon throughputs as high as 550 kg...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{metallic}} {{films were}} pulled from molten aluminium alloys containing {{different types of}} stabilising particles 0 20 vol. of SiC or TiB 2. A chamber with a controlled atmosphere lt; 1 2. 1 105 ppm O 2 and different <b>molybdenum</b> <b>wire</b> frame structures were used. The objective was to discuss stabilisation of metallic foams {{based on the same}} melts [Heim, 2013]. Beside in dividual flat films, a modification of the wire frame structure allowed us to create artificial metallic Plateau borders and keep them liquid in order to study melt dynamics. Drainage, the velocity of the propagating rupture as well as the behaviour of the ceramic particles inside the melt were analysed in situ both visually via a high speed camera system and by means of synchrotron X ray radiography. The oxide surface on the films was studied ex situ by energy filtered TEM and the particle distribution by metallography and SEM to discuss their role in stabilisation. We found that the particles and the immobile oxide skin, whose for mation depends on the level of oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere and the presence of magnesium, are strongly interrelated. Phenomena such as the healing of thin regions in a film or the fixation of moveable clusters at the immobile gas liquid interface could be discerned. Interactions of particles and oxygen were also visible during film collapse, where at the oxidised surface fixed particles hinder further film retraction, see Fig. 1. We discuss and compare the results obtained to analogous ones related to both aqueous sys tems and to metallic foams made from the same alloys by injecting air or Ar into a mel...|$|E
