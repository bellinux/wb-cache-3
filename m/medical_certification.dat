White died of heart failure on June 2, 1944 at 1 p.m. {{at the age of}} 75 at his summer camp near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The <b>medical</b> <b>certification</b> of White's death stated the cause of his heart failure was due to age and overexertion. White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was {{residing}} at 610½ Capitol Street in Charleston.|$|E

25|$|Denver was {{not legally}} {{permitted}} to fly {{at the time}} of the accident. In previous years, Denver had a number of drunk driving arrests. In 1996, nearly a year before the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration learned that Denver had failed to maintain sobriety by failing to refrain entirely from alcohol, and was compelled to revoke his <b>medical</b> <b>certification.</b> However, the accident was not influenced by alcohol use, as an autopsy found no sign of alcohol or other drugs in Denver's body.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sent {{a team to}} {{the site}} of the {{accident}} to investigate the cause of the crash. The team returned an inconclusive report in May 2011. They speculated that the pilot, a recovered stroke victim, may have fallen asleep or had a seizure, but there was no direct evidence to support these theories. The report was critical of the Federal Aviation Administration's re-certification process, stating:The Federal Aviation Administration's internal guidance for <b>medical</b> <b>certification</b> of pilots following stroke is inadequate because it is conflicting and unclear, does not specifically address the risk of recurrence associated with such an event, and does not specifically recommend a neuropsychological evaluation (formal cognitive testing) to evaluate potential subtle cognitive impairment.|$|E
500|$|Several {{days after}} {{receiving}} his Ph.D, Andrić wrote the Foreign Minister {{asking to be}} reinstated and submitted {{a copy of his}} dissertation, university documents and a <b>medical</b> <b>certification</b> that deemed him to be in good health. In September, the Foreign Ministry granted his request. Andrić stayed in Graz until 31 October, when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's Belgrade headquarters. During the two years he was in Belgrade, Andrić spent much of his time writing. His first collection of short stories was published in 1924, and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy (of which he became a full-fledged member in February 1926). In October 1926, he was assigned to the consulate in Marseille and again appointed vice-consul. On 9 December 1926, he was transferred to the Yugoslav embassy in Paris. Andrić's time in France was marked by increasing loneliness and isolation. His uncle had died in 1924, his mother the following year, and upon arriving in France, he was informed that his aunt had died as well. [...] "Apart from official contacts," [...] he wrote Alaupović, [...] "I have no company whatever." [...] Andrić spent much of his time in the Paris archives poring over the reports of the French consulate in Travnik between 1809 and 1814, material he would use in Travnička hronika (Travnik Chronicle), one of his future novels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the completion of}} <b>medical</b> death <b>certifications</b> in Belém, state of Pará, Brazil in 2010. MethodsIn the present study, 800 <b>medical</b> <b>certifications</b> of non-violent death, randomly chosen, and produced in 2010 were analyzed. Regarding correct completion, all fields of the document were evaluated, except for fields I (reserved for civil registries), V (stillbirth or death under age of 1 year), and VIII (external causes/violent death). Each field was analyzed regarding the following parameters: incomplete fields, fields left blank, illegibility, and incorrect completions. ResultsBased on the data collected, very high rates of errors in completion were observed; 98. 7 % of the certifications {{had at least one}} mistake. The most remarkable and important mistakes were found in field VI, intended for the cause of death, with a frequency of error of 71. 5 %, especially due to vagueness. ConclusionThe very high rates of poorly completed <b>medical</b> death <b>certifications</b> highlights a significant failure in the medical schools’ curriculum, as well as a lack of continuing medical education programs addressing such topic of paramount importance. The results demonstrated neglect or lack of knowledge on the pathophysiology of diseases by physicians...|$|R
