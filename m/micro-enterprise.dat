40|$|Abstract__ Privatization {{of urban}} {{services}} focuses {{often on the}} involvement of foreign enterprises. This contribution deals with micro-privatization, the partial transfer of government responsibility for solid waste collection to <b>micro-enterprises.</b> It tries {{to shed light on}} whether the current private sector participation (PSP) of <b>micro-enterprises</b> in solid waste collection service {{is the best way to}} capture the expected advantages of private sector involvement. The article examines the relations of the <b>micro-enterprises</b> with beneficiaries and the public sector by focusing on the contract procedure, the tariff-setting process, the cost recovery mechanism and institutionalizing of market principles for <b>micro-enterprises.</b> The research was carried out using secondary and primary data sources. Primary data were collected through the interviewing of public sector officials at different levels, focus group discussions with community groups and <b>micro-enterprises,</b> and observation. A survey was conducted among 160 <b>micro-enterprises</b> in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, using a standard questionnaire. What are some of the factors contributing to the results of PSP in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia? Policies at higher levels of government definitely produced an overall climate conducive to micro-privatization and recognized the need to develop <b>micro-enterprises,</b> but it is not clear what role the <b>micro-enterprises</b> are to play in solid waste management. New opportunities were created by formalization and taken up by communities and <b>micro-enterprises.</b> Coverage and waste collected both increased. The initiation and institutionalization of the formalization process was not without problems. The public sector over-stressed the autonomy of <b>micro-enterprises.</b> The fate of the <b>micro-enterprises</b> is largely determined by the reforms undertaken at local government level. The rapid changes in policies at the local level made waste-collecting <b>micro-enterprises</b> lose confidence and more dependent on the public sector. The study shows the continued power of the state and its agents in shaping developments in this domain...|$|R

In particular, <b>micro-enterprises</b> stand to benefit the most by using IT to achieve better access to new markets, knowledge and information and enable their businesses to become more competitive. While various researchers have conducted studies {{on the effects of}} IT adoption in <b>micro-enterprises,</b> little research has been conducted to explain critical aspects of an effective IT intervention for <b>micro-enterprises</b> from a theoretical perspective. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating four cases of <b>micro-enterprises</b> undergoing changes relating to their businesses and adoption of IT that is seen to assist them. The empirical investigation relates to IT interventions that can effectively facilitate the process of IT adoption by <b>micro-enterprises.</b> Following an analysis of four <b>micro-enterprises</b> using a theoretical lens developed from Actor Network Theory, this paper provides insight into the ways in which IT interventions can improve the ability of <b>micro-enterprises</b> to adopt IT to benefit and grow their businesses. The key contribution of this study is {{in the use of the}} Actor Network perspective to address the contextual factors that affect the ability of <b>micro-enterprises</b> to adopt IT. The resulting analytical model may assist researchers and practitioners in examining the effects of their IT interventions.

40|$|Abstract In a {{world that}} is {{shrinking}} with distant markets becoming more accessible and at a lower cost, this enables even smaller businesses such as <b>micro-enterprises</b> the opportunity to invest and establish abroad. In recent years there has been a rise in interest of business networking as {{a major part of the}} internationalization process regarding how a new business is to establish itself as a newcomer in a foreign market. Although both internationalization and business networking has been studied thoroughly during many years, there has been only limited attention given to the study of <b>micro-enterprises</b> and their internationalization processes. This thesis intends to investigate how foreign <b>micro-enterprises</b> become business network insiders when they enter Shanghai. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand <b>micro-enterprises</b> internationalization process in terms of how they reach their business network insider positions. The study is based on interviews with the founders of eight individual foreign <b>micro-enterprises</b> who have all established themselves in Shanghai, China. The conclusion is that in order to become business network insiders the foreign <b>micro-enterprises</b> need to spend significant amount of effort in informal and formal forms of networking. The result of this thesis suggests that the business network position as suggested by the revisited Uppsala model is highly relevant when foreign <b>micro-enterprises</b> are establishing in Shanghai. We argue that a network insider position is reached when other actors are recommending the company further to other contacts and therefore developing personal relationships and strong connections are key aspects...|$|R

This may be because the forms of innovation undertaken by <b>micro-enterprises</b> are “hidden” from official statistics and do not correspond to “conventional” expectations. If innovation is occurring in <b>micro-enterprises</b> it is likely to involve the personal change of owner-managers and the organisational change of their business and teams.

The study used mixed methods, where data were collected by conducting semi-structured personal interviews and from self-administered questionnaires.
