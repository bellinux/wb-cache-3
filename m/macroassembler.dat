50|$|In late 1981, Tandy {{inquired about}} {{possible}} openings at Microsoft and was invited up to interview and {{was offered a}} position by Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's then acting HR manager, to join the company. At that time there were about 90 employees. He joined {{as part of a}} new product marketing team which included Jeff Raikes, Chris Larson, Carl Stork, Mark Deutsch, and Mark Ursino. The team was assigned responsibility for marketing all of the various BASIC products which included an OEM version of BASIC that IBM was shipping with their new PC, known as GW-BASIC. It also included a variety of BASIC interpreters for 6800, 6809, 6502, Z-80, 8080, and 8086 processors as well as BASIC compilers. In addition, he was responsible for the few games (Microsoft Decathlon, Adventure); educational products (Typing Tutor); a couple of hardware products including the already shipping Z-80 based SoftCard and RAMCard for the Apple II computers; muMath (a symbolic equation processor); and muLisp (a LISP interpreter). His first manager at Microsoft was Nigel Smith. Within 3 months, responsibility for marketing COBOL and Microsoft Sort 80, a file sorting utility, were also transferred to him. About 6 months later he was also given responsibility for marketing Microsoft Pascal, FORTRAN, <b>MacroAssembler,</b> and the responsibility for launching the first Microsoft C compiler for MS-DOS. At this time he shed responsibility for the hardware products, and the games and educational products, but not before managing the release of the very first version of Microsoft Flight Simulator which was created for Microsoft by Bruce Artwick.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} system consisting of several PDP- 11 minicomputers {{linked to a}} CII 10070 computer is used at CERN to acquire and check data {{from a series of}} high energy physics experiments. All program preparation for the minicomputers is carried out on the large machine. A <b>macroassembler,</b> a compiler for an intermediate level language and a linkage editor are provided. The data links are used for loading programs into the minicomputer and are also used by systems for editing source programs. remote job submission and for access to the CII 10070 permanent file system. Some examples of the use of these facilities and the benefits they provide are given. (7 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{programming}} language {{widely used in}} education when learning the object-oriented is Java. While this language has proven as being good for industry, some drawbacks make it less appropriate for education. We the authors think that probably better languages can be designed exclusively for education, as, Pascal was designed for lecturing in structured programming. This would allow students to concentrate in the important issues of object-oriented programming. In this article, an ongoing research project held in the Computer Science departament of the University of Vigo is described. It currently consists of a virtual machine, an assembler, and a <b>macroassembler,</b> although, in the near future, a true programming language will be developed for it, as long as an integrated development environment. The simplicty of the prototype-based model of object orientation, the drammatic decrease in complexity for programs due to the direct support of persistence, and all facilities naturally provided by the feature of multiplatform support makes it the ideal tool for learning, allowing the educator to stress on the actually important issues of object oriented programming. 1...|$|E
40|$|An OMEGA {{navigation}} receiver with {{a microprocessor}} as the computational component was investigated. A {{version of the}} INTEL 4004 microprocessor <b>macroassembler</b> suitable for use on the CDC- 6600 system and development of a FORTRAN IV simulator program for the microprocessor was developed. Supporting studies included development and evaluation of navigation algorithms to generate relative position information from OMEGA VLF phase measurements. Simulation studies were used to evaluate assumptions made in developing a navigation equation in OMEGA Line of Position (LOP) coordinates. Included in the navigation algorithms was a procedure for calculating a position in latitude/longitude given an OMEGA LOP fix. Implementation of a digital phase locked loop (DPLL) was evaluated on the basic of phase response characteristics over a range of input phase variations. Included also is an analytical evaluation {{on the basis of}} error probability of an algorithm for automatic time synchronization of the receiver to the OMEGA broadcast format. The use of actual OMEGA phase data and published propagation prediction corrections to determine phase velocity estimates was discussed...|$|E
