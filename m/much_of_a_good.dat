2500|$|The end of {{the decade}} brought {{professional}} setbacks for Brahms. The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in Hamburg on 22 January 1859, with the composer as soloist, was poorly received. Brahms wrote to Joachim that the performance was [...] "a brilliant and decisive – failure...t forces one to concentrate one's thoughts and increases one's courage...But the hissing was too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing..." [...] At a second performance, audience reaction was so hostile that Brahms had to be restrained from leaving the stage after the first movement. As a consequence of these reactions Breitkopf and Härtel declined to take on his new compositions. Brahms consequently established a relationship with other publishers, including Simrock, who eventually became his major publishing partner. Brahms further made an intervention in 1860 in the debate on the future of German music which seriously misfired. Together with Joachim and others, he prepared an attack on Liszt's followers, the so-called [...] "New German School" [...] (although Brahms himself was sympathetic to the music of Richard Wagner, the School's leading light). In particular they objected to the rejection of traditional musical forms and to the [...] "rank, miserable weeds growing from Liszt-like fantasias". A draft was leaked to the press, and the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik published a parody which ridiculed Brahms and his associates as backward-looking. Brahms never again ventured into public musical polemics.|$|E

40|$|Here, I solve {{a general}} equilibrium, stochastic, dynamic control problem. In it, an agent {{who owns a}} {{productive}} asset decides how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-storable <b>good</b> to consume {{and how much to}} invest in research and development. Combined, two features distinguish this from previous work. First, the agent maximizes lifetime expected utility (instead of profits or income). Second, the investment level affects the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> research and development innovation which would make future dividends jump. Dividend evolution is represented by a continuous time Poisson process with the jump probability depending on the investment level. In equilibrium, the agent chooses the investment level to give an optimal expected innovation rate. This results in endogenously chose, stationary growth rates in asset dividends and prices. These non-stationary price and dividend paths are <b>of</b> <b>a</b> type that Marsh and Merton (1986) predict will violate variance bounds tests such as Shiller's (1981).

6000|$|On {{returning}} to his native village, Bob Massey found that his successor as coxswain had died, and that another man {{had not yet been}} appointed to the lifeboat--he was therefore installed, with much rejoicing, in his old position as <b>a</b> rescuer <b>of</b> human lives. Joe Slag, naturally and pleasantly, also fell into his old post at the bow. Nellie found that Aunt Betty had had what the villagers called [...] "a stroke" [...] during her absence; which crushing blow had the effect of opening her eyes to many things regarding herself and others, to which she had been particularly blind before. It also had the effect--indirectly--of subduing <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the evil in her character and bringing out <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good.</b> <b>As</b> evil begets evil, so good begets good; and one result of this law was, that the seven children, whom she had brought--or banged--up, became seven repentant and sympathetic and reasonably good creatures when they saw the old mother, whom they used to think so harsh and so physically strong, reduced to amiable helplessness. Thus it came to pass that there was not in all the village an old woman who was so well looked after by her progeny as Aunt Betty.|$|R
