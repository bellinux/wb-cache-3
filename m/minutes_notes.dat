From a larger perspective, the study considers the TEI encoding as adding to the original text a “material” layer that further supports both machine and human interpretation (decoding). In this sense, this study may move closer to the concept of “material hermeneutics,” by understanding code, and digital technology in general, as an instrument we can use in hermeneutic ways to produce knowledge...|$|E

The collection includes brochures, booklets, clippings, correspondence, financial and immigration documents, <b>minutes,</b> <b>notes,</b> photographs, photo collages and as examples of his advertisement work, printed materials and writings. Documents comprising the collection reflect various aspects of Otto Ehrlich’s personal and professional life, teaching, research and writings {{in the fields of}} economics, {{and to a lesser extent}} his involvement with the field of advertisement and music. Otto H. Ehrlich was born in Vienna in 1892. He studied law and economics and received his Ph. D. During WW I Otto Ehrlich served in the Austrian army and advanced from the rank of cadet officer to 1 st lieutenant. After the war Otto Ehrlich became a junior officer at the Allgemeine Depositen Bank where he remained until 1925. After that he was teaching and got involved in the advertising and public relations business. He left Vienna with his wife, Rosa, in 1939 and immigrated to the US. The couple did not receive an affidavit for their sixteen year old daughter Hildegard, who stayed with her aunt in London. After they arrived in New York, they were able to obtain a visa for their daughter. She was on board the Athenia, when it was torpedoed by a German submarine, and was killed. Ehrlich first taught at Brooklyn College, where he met his second wife, Edna. He later taught at the City College of New York and then at New York University, where he taught economics for nearly 10 years before retiring. He was the founder and editor of Economics Abstracts, a publication of the school's Economics Department. He also wrote several economic studies. He died in 1979. digitize...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{and benefits of}} involving community members in health policy making-­-from {{the first step of}} needs assessment through to actual policy development [...] are increasingly being recognized. This thesis describes the evaluation of a community consultation process which was part of a needs assessment conducted by Saskatoon District Health, in Saskatchewan, Canada. In September 1995, a Children and Youth Working Group was formed, made up of volunteers representing service providers, users, and families. Their mandate was to develop and priorize recommendations on ways to improve the health status of children and youth in the District, which has a total population of approximately 300, 000. In addition to a comprehensive epidemiological assessment, the Working Group engaged in a community consultation process which solicited input from the general community, with a specific emphasis on key groups such as youth, Aboriginal, immigrant/refugees, and service providers in health, education, social services, and justice. In this process, information on perceived needs of children and youth was collected through 20 focus groups (n= 213) and a questionnaire (n= 1, 985). Based on a synthesis of the quantitative and qualitative data, the Working Group drafted a set of recommendations, which were then discussed at a community meeting for input and feedback. This research evaluates the effectiveness of the consultation process in facilitating community participation using three sources of data: the entire consultation process was observed (from January 1996 until February 1997), including the focus groups, Working Group meetings, and the final community meeting; interviews (2) were held with the Working Group (n= 9), with selected individuals who had participated in the consultation (n= 7), and with non-participants (n= 2); and documentation produced by the Working Group (i. e., <b>minutes,</b> <b>notes,</b> background material) was reviewed. These data were analyzed thematically according to criteria established jointly by the representatives of the member groups of the Population Health Project (Working Group, Coordinating Group, Research Advisory Group) and the researcher. The effectiveness was gauged by comparing the findings with the criteria and with the components of meaningful community consultation as defined by the Working Group (appropriateness, timeliness, completeness, accuracy, representativeness, relevance). The themes which emerged from the analysis deal with the participants' feelings about their participation or non­participation, the success of the consultation process, the nature of the data collected; by-­products of the process, and the consultation's influence on the outcome of the needs assessment. The results of this analysis are presented and conclusions drawn regarding factors that contribute to or impede effective public participation in health needs assessment...|$|E
40|$|The Adolf Leschnitzer Collection {{documents}} {{the life and}} professional activities of Adolf Leschnitzer, researcher, historian, and teacher. The collection includes brochures, booklets, clippings, correspondence, financial, vital, and immigration documents, <b>minutes,</b> <b>notes,</b> photographs, printed materials, and writings, by Adolf Leschnitzer {{as well as other}} authors. Additionally, there are materials dealing {{with other members of the}} Leschnitzer family, namely his wife, Maria Leschnitzer, née Bratz, her mother, Elly Bratz, née Michael, Adolf and Maria Leschnitzers' son, Michael Lesch, also known as Michael Leschnitzer, and Adolf and Albertt Frank. Adolf Leschnitzer, scholar, historian, and teacher was born on February 3, 1899 in Posen, Germany (now Poznań, Poland). He was the son of the pharmacist Dr. phil. Oscar Leschnitzer and Natalie Leschnitzer, née Fuchs. He began his schooling at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium in Posen. He then continued his studies at the Kaiserin Auguste Gymnasium, Berlin, Charlottenburg, which he graduated with honors in 1917. Upon graduation Leschnitzer served in the German Army until 1918 He resumed his studies in 1918 at the Universities of Berlin and Heidelberg, concentrating on German philology, history, philosophy, and education and in 1923 received his Doctoral degree from the University of Heidelberg. By 1926 Leschnitzer also passed First and Second State Examination for High School Teachers. Between 1925 and 1933 he was an instructor, and later a professor in a number of municipal high schools in Berlin. IIn 1933 Adolf Leschnitzer was asked by Leo Baeck, then the head of the Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland (National Federation Of Jews in Germany), to head the Department of Education, one of the most important positions there. The following six years, until his immigration in 1939, Leschnitzer dedicated his work to organizing and supervising Jewish schools throughout Germany in addition to collaborating with other agencies involved in organizing teacher’s seminars and adult education. In 1939, Adolf Leschnitzer and his wife Maria Leschnitzer, née Bratz left Germany and after a brief stay in England arrived in the United States in 1940. Upon arrival to the United States, Prof. Leschnitzer organized the American Institute of Modern Languages, an organization aimed at helping immigrants from Central Europe, mostly from Germany, to learn the language and to get acclimated to the new environment. In 1943 he became an instructor in the German Section of the Foreign Area and Language Curriculum of the Army Specialized Training Program at Rutgers University and in 1944 he got a position of a field representative of the Office of the War Information and also became a consultant to the War Department. In 1946 Dr. Leschnitzer became an instructor at the Department of German and Slavic Languages at City College of New York, of which he was elected chairman in 1958. He retired from City College in 1966. In addition to his work at City College, starting in 1952 and until 1972, Prof. Leschnitzer taught one term each year at the Freie Universität Berlin. Professor Leschnitzer was one of the first German-Jewish academicians to realize the importance of the dialogue between the new post-war Germany and the German Jews, who lived in Germany as well as those who were forced to leave. He was immediately involved with the reconstruction of the German school system right after the war ended and authored, in 1945, a memorandum entitled An Immediate Program for the Reconstruction of the German School System. He recognized the importance of bringing the next generation of German students closer to understanding German history in relation to Jewish history and culture as a way for bringing the two peoples together. Adolf Leschnitzer died on July 24, 1980, in Centerport, Long Island, NY. His wife Maria was born in Berlin in 1909. She was among the last Jewish women to receive a Ph. D. from the University of Berlin. In New York, she taught at Hunter and Queens Colleges and, like her husband, was actively involved in the Leo Baeck Institute. She died in 2005. The couple had one son, Michael Lesch. digitize...|$|E

40|$|The Guido Kisch Collection {{documents}} {{the life and}} professional activities of Guido Kisch, teacher, researcher, and scholar {{in the field of}} Legal History. It also documents personal and to a lesser degree professional lives of some of {{the other members of the}} Kisch family, most notably his brother, Bruno Kisch, a cardiologist, and their father, Alex Kisch, who was a rabbi and a writer. The collection includes brochures, booklets, clippings, correspondence, financial documents, <b>minutes,</b> <b>notes,</b> off prints, photographs, printed materials, and writings. Guido Kisch, scholar, jurist, historian, and collector was born on January 22, 1889, in Prague, Austria-Hungary, (now Czech Republic) into a prominent family of rabbis, physicians and scholars. He was the son of Rabbi Alex Kisch and his wife Charlotte, née Polatschek. His father, Alex Kisch, was a rabbi and a writer who in the late 1870 s became the first rabbi of Zurich. In 1886 Rabbi Alex Kisch succeeded Dr. Stein at the Meisel Synagogue, and became a leader of the Jewish community in Prague. Guido Kisch’s earlier schooling took place at the Altstädter Staatsgymnasium in Prague. He then continued his studies at the University of Prague and later at the University of Leipzig, where he studied jurisprudent, political science, history and philosophy. While at the University of Prague, between 1909 and 1912 he passed three State Examinations in Law and Political Studies required for the qualification of judge. In 1915 Kisch began his distinguished career as a teacher and scholar of legal history when he was appointed Privatdozent and became an instructor in legal history at the University of Leipzig. In 1920 he was appointed Professor Ordinarius of History of Law and Political Theory at the University of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), where he taught until 1922. In 1922 Kisch became Professor Ordinarius of History of Law and Political Theory at the University of Halle, where in 1925 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Law and Political Science. He held this position until 1933, when he was dismissed by the Nazi Government. After his dismissal from the University of Halle he briefly taught at the University of Prague and at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). Unable to find a permanent academic position, Professor Kisch immigrated to the United States in 1935. After his immigration Professor Kisch settled in New York, where he taught Jewish History at the Jewish Institute of Religion/Hebrew Union College. During this period he also lectured at a number of universities in the United States as well as abroad. Among others, he was a visiting professor at Lund University, Sweden (1949, 1952 - 1959) and University of Basel, Switzerland (1954). He was also a research associate at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana (1953 - 1959), Columbia University, and briefly at the Leo Baeck Institute, New York. In 1962, he returned to Europe. He settled in Basel, Switzerland and taught at the Law School at the University of Basel. Guido Kisch was a member of several professional organizations, such as Mediaeval Academy of America, American Historical Association, International Congress of Historical Sciences, American Numismatic Society, and American Numismatic Association. Additionally, he was involved with a number of Jewish cultural and historical institutions. Most notably, Professor Kisch was a founding member of the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, of which he was elected Honorary President in March, 1962 and also served as Vice President of the American Academy for Jewish Research (1953 - 1959). Guido Kisch wrote extensively on the subjects of humanism, medieval and German jurisprudence, history and German-Jewish relations. He published over four hundred titles, including academic works, essays, articles, and reviews. Many of his articles and reviews were published in Historica Judaica, a scholarly journal that he started in 1938 and remained its editor until 1961. Before his immigration in 1935 his research was focused on the history of medieval German law. During his American period he shifted the focus of his research towards the history of German-Jewish relationship seen through the prism of the German-Jewish jurisprudence. In his later period, Guido Kisch became interested in the humanistic aspect of jurisprudence. He dedicated a number of works to explore this little known characteristic of jurisprudence. Guido Kisch remained active after retiring from his position at the Basel University. He kept close contact with scholars and students and continued writing for scholarly journals and other publications. He died in 1985, at the age of 96 in Basel, Switzerland.
