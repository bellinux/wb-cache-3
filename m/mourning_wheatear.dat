25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked scrub warbler, <b>mourning</b> <b>wheatear</b> and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E
50|$|Panov (Wheatears of Palearctic, 2005) {{discusses}} the latest taxonomy for the <b>mourning</b> <b>wheatear</b> superspecies. The <b>mourning</b> <b>wheatear</b> is split from Abyssinian wheatear (Oenanthe lugubris), {{which is the}} species found south of the Sahara.|$|E

50|$|The <b>mourning</b> <b>{{wheatear}}</b> (Oenanthe lugens) is a bird, one of 14 {{species of}} wheatear found in northern Africa and the Middle East. It {{is a small}} passerine in a group formerly classed {{as members of the}} thrush family Turdidae, but now more generally considered {{to be part of the}} Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.|$|E
50|$|The north African {{subspecies}} halophila, {{considered by}} some to be a separate species, western <b>mourning</b> <b>wheatear,</b> occurs from Morocco east to western Egypt. The Egyptian populations are discussed in Baha El Din and Baha El Din (2000). These birds differ from typical halophila in exhibiting less sexual dimorphism, and displaying a prominent white wingbar, and thus are closer to the nominate race.|$|E
