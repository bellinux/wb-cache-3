40|$|Background: Aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>inspectors</b> spend {{many hours}} searching for defects in aircraft. Vision {{guidelines}} exist for NDI/NDT personnel, {{but not for}} visual inspectors. A detailed task analysis is required before job-relevant vision guidelines can be developed. This study is a descriptive investigation of the visual tasks of aviation visual inspectors. Methods: Visual <b>inspectors</b> at aircraft <b>maintenance</b> facilities were observed performing inspections on commercial aircraft. Various measures of the visual tasks were recorded. Results: On over 900 fixations during inspection procedures, working distances of 50 cm or less were recorded 60. 6 % of the time. Intermediate distances (> 50 cm to 1 m) comprised 27. 7 % of the working distances. The mean age of inspectors at these locations was 44. 7 years. Conclusions: The primary duty of visual inspectors is the identification of defects in aircraft when viewed at near and intermediate distances. Data from this study support the need for nearpoint visual acuity requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of the incident was as follows: The omission of all the O-ring seals on the magmetic chip detectorassemblies leading {{to the loss of}} lubrication and damage to the airplane's three engines {{as a result of the}} failure of mechanics to follow the established and proper procedures for the installation of master chip detectors in the engine lubrication system, the repeated failure of supervisory personnel to require mechanics to comply strictly with the prescribed installation procedures, and the failure of Eastern Air Lines management to assess adequately the significance of similar previous occurrences and to act effectively to institute corrective action. Contributing to the cause of the incident was the failure of Federal Aviation Administration <b>maintenance</b> <b>inspectors</b> to assess the significance of the incidents involving master chip detectors and to take effective surveillance and enforcement measures to prevent the recurrence of the incidents.

40|$|Purpose – This article aims {{to provide}} {{details of the}} process {{involved}} in preparing a comprehensive maintenance audit of school buildings and facilities in a state government education department. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents the framework and logistics of the survey or audit, which relied on integrating a property management system with a consistent approach {{to the definition of}} maintenance and its costing. The use of visual illustrations of maintenance categories is a feature of the process and this study. Findings – The work was completed in three months and drew upon the department’s two computerized property management and asset systems, the physical resource management system (PRMS) and the school asset management system (SAMS). The department adopted an IT-basedapproach that integrated the building element-based maintenance items with electronic plans and a standard costing approach using hand-held pen-activated computers {{under the control of the}} maintenance auditors. The process of conducting the maintenance audit has resulted in the mostcomprehensive review and updating of all the maintenance requirements in school buildings. It has provided real and accurate costing of this work on a fair, methodical and consistent basis. The size of the final costs in each maintenance category has allowed funding to be refined, targeted and focused on many key and important areas. Research limitations/implications – Whilst categories of different maintenance work are provided in broad terms, for confidentiality reasons the client organization would not permit the financial values of these categories to be published. Practical implications – Examples of the categorization and analysis of maintenance items are included to illustrate and demonstrate the method of approach. Details of the extensive auditing process described provide insights for any large organization with widespread facilities and property assets to adopt a similar approach. Originality/value – The process is an exemplar for an integrated property management and maintenance auditing system using IT and the practical skills of <b>maintenance</b> <b>inspectors...</b>|$|R
30|$|After all {{the failure}} modes have been identified, the risk analysts begin to {{investigate}} what, {{how and why}} a failure happened, thus preventing recurrence. The failure root causes can be determined by interviewing experts including designers, train operators, <b>inspectors,</b> <b>maintenance</b> technicians, etc. and using some analytical techniques like Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Fault-Tree Analysis (FTA) [19]. RCA is a useful process that helps analysts identify and understand the initiating causes of a failure. FTA is a top-down and deductive failure analysis method through which all undesired events {{that may lead to}} system failure are analysed.|$|R

40|$|Task {{analysis}} of maintenance activities has revealed aircraft inspection to be a complex activity requiring above average coordination, communication and cooperation between <b>inspectors,</b> <b>maintenance</b> personnel, supervisors {{and various other}} sub-systems to be effective and efficient. A {{large portion of the}} work done by <b>inspectors</b> and <b>maintenance</b> technicians is accomplished through teamwork. One of the areas requiring the use of effective team skills is shift change. In response to this need, this research looked at the entire shift change process to identify human factors interventions that can be applied to develop a standardized shift change process that will help minimize shift change errors. The paper outlines the task analytic methodology used to analyze the shift change process at representative aircraft maintenance sites, the taxonomy of errors developed and the human factors interventions to prevent errors. Finally, the paper documents a standardized shift change process detailing the shift change protocol...|$|R
40|$|The Aloha Airlines B- 737 {{accident}} in 1989 prompted a general evaluation of avia-tion maintenance and inspection practices. A consistent {{finding from the}} Aloha analyses was that human-factors-related issues played a sigmficant role in the accident.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{augmented}} reality (AR) strategy {{in which a}} Lamb waves based impact detection methodology dynamically interacts with a head portable visualization device allowing the inspector to see the estimated impact position (with its uncertainty) and impact energy directly on the plate-like structure. The impact detection methodology uses a network of piezosensors bonded on the structure to be monitored and a signal processing algorithm (the Warped Frequency Transform) able to compensate for dispersion the acquired waveforms. The compensated waveforms yield to a robust estimation of Lamb waves difference in distance of propagation (DDOP), used to feed hyperbolic algorithms for impact location determination, and allow an estimation of {{the uncertainty of the}} impact positioning {{as well as of the}} impact energy. The outputs of the impact methodology are passed to a visualization technology that yielding their representation in Augmented Reality (AR) is meant to support the inspector during the on-field inspection/diagnosis as well as the <b>maintenance</b> operations. The <b>inspector,</b> in fact, can see interactively in real time the impact data directly on the surface of the structure. To validate the proposed approach, tests on an aluminum plate are presented. Results confirm the feasibility of the method and its exploitability in maintenance practice...|$|R
40|$|Life {{extension}} of safety critical systems is gaining popularity in many industries {{due to the}} increasing demand in world's energy consumption and the strong desire to reduce carbon emissions by different countries. Identification and implementation of a suitable life extension strategy enables safety critical systems to perform their intended functions under stated condition {{for an extended period}} of time beyond original design life. In the past, the viability analysis of life extension strategies has been undertaken based on the accumulated knowledge and experience of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), <b>maintenance</b> engineers and <b>inspectors.</b> These approaches involving expert judgement are qualitative in nature and based on conservative assumptions, which may lead to inaccurate conclusion or misleading recommendations to asset managers. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an approach consisting of methods to determine the technical condition of components, estimate the cost of life extension interventions and to analyze carbon footprints. “Remanufacturing” is considered as a suitable end-of-life strategy that can help reduce the overall environmental burden from the product by processing waste materials while at the same time keeping reliability high. Due to the advantages of remanufacturing, it is widely applied for life extension purposes in safety critical industries such as offshore oil and gas, nuclear power, petrochemical, renewable energy, rail transport, aviation, shipping, and electricity distribution and transmission. In this paper, a multi-stage approach is presented to analyze the impact of remanufacturing of safety critical systems on the performance of industrial operations in terms of total cost and carbon footprint. In this approach, the equipment health status is determined by modelling the degradation of the system and then the maintenance costs and carbon footprint are calculated. For the purpose of clarity, the proposed model is applied to an air compressor system and the results are discussed...|$|R
