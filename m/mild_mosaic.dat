40|$|AbstractThe {{variability}} {{and genetic}} structure of tobacco <b>mild</b> green <b>mosaic</b> tobamovirus (TMGMV) was analyzed {{in a collection}} of isolates fromNicotiana glaucaplants from Australia, California, Spain, and the east Mediterranean Basin. Ribonuclease protection was assayed on 53 isolates with six probes representing 85 % of the TMGMV genome. Results showed that conserved domains in the TMGMV genome were different for each geographic population. The nucleotide sequence of two regions of the TMGMV genome was determined for 33 isolates. Nucleotide diversity values were smaller than those reported for other RNA genomes. For each population, genetic diversity was not related {{to the size of the}} area from which the isolates were collected, and was particularly small for Australia and Spain. Diversity values indicated population differentiation, which was largest between the less diverse Spanish and Australian populations. Nucleotide diversity values for nonsynonymous vs synonymous positions indicate moderate negative selection, except for the Spanish population for which it gave evidence of positive selection. On the whole, our data indicate that the low genetic diversity for this plant virus may be due to different factors such as positive and negative selection or the recent colonization of new areas or host plants. The intensity of these factors appears to be different for the various TMGMV geographical populations...|$|R

Other species of Hordeum have been {{experimentally}} innocultated and exhibited similar symptoms, but this has since been categorized as a different strain of disease called barley <b>mild</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus. When dealing with viruses, {{it is important to}} understand that symptoms are not reliable in diagnosing the specific virus. That being said, the signature symptom exhibited by the barley from the virus is a yellowing and mosaic flecking of the youngest leaves that often appears in the winter or early spring. Early on the plant leaves begin to show a pale green color, and over time the changes become more drastic with severe yellowing and mosaic patterns. In addition, leaf curl, stunting, and necrosis can all be observed.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that the PVY has {{different}} isolates according to the symptoms they induce in various potato plant species. Extensive biological, serological and molecular variability of PVY isolates makes the classification of isolates as particular strains particularly difficult. Occurrence of a variety of symptoms and the emergence of the necrotic PVYNTN has led to a search for more reliable classification tools than simple serological identification. Traditionally three chief strains of PVY are recognized: PVYC, PVYN and PVYO. PVYC, originally known as Potato Virus C, was the first to be recognized and was identified in the 1930s. PVYC induces hypersensitive responses {{in a wide range of}} potato cultivars. These reactions include the formation of <b>mild</b> <b>mosaic</b> patterns or stipple streak. Unlike the other strains of PVY, some PVYC strains are non-aphid transmissible. Previous studies by Visser et al. did not identify any of the local isolates as being PVYC but it has been reported to occur to in South Africa. A second strain of PVY is PVYN. Some notes on suspected variant of Solanum virus 2 (Potato virus Y). This strain was described in tobacco plants growing close to potato plants. PVYN results in leaf necrosis and mild or even no damage to the tubers. The ordinary strain of PVY is denoted as PVYO. Infection of a potato plant with the PVYO strain results in mild tuber damage and does not cause leaf necrosis. Both PVYN and PVYO are aphid transmissible and occur in South Africa. In Europe these two strains have been shown to have recombined to form PVYNTN. The PVYNTN has been accredited with the ability to induce potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD). Tubers damaged by PTNRD become unmarketable and infection by PVYNTN thus results in a larger economic impact than infection by the other strains.|$|E

40|$|New {{symptoms}} of systemic mosaic on radish (Raphanus sativus) were noticed by {{farmers in the}} middle of Iraq in 2009. This led to think that the causal agent may be a new virus. An isolate of the causal agent has been isolated and characterized as a Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) from the infected Radish. Leaves from radishes showing systemic mosaic were collected from several locations that cultivate radish in Iraq in 2011. The virus was identified by symptoms on indicator plants, immunochromatography and the molecular weight of viral coat protein. The virus caused systemic severe mosaic on Cucumis sativus, Cucumis melo, Cucurbita pepo, <b>mild</b> systemic <b>mosaic</b> on Raphanus sativus, Nicotiana tabaccum and induced the formation of leaf strip and filliforme shaped on tomato mechanically inoculated by an extract from symptomatic radish leaves.

Positive reaction were developed on the immunostrip containing anti-CMV polyclonal antibodies treated with extracts from infected radish leaves by immunochromatography. One protein of 24. 5 kd was detected by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel containing SDS.

The CP sequence differed by no more than one amino acid for the two types, and the Small type was identical to that published for TMGMV. Thirty-six of the isolates had a double-stranded (ds) RNA profile that matched that of type TMGMV, and the nucleotide sequence of the 3 « untranslated region (3 «UTR) of six of these isolates was similar to the published sequence of TMGMV. Twenty-two isolates had a larger dsRNA for the CP subgenomic RNA. Six of these were sequenced and all had a repeat sequence of between 147 and 165 bases in the part of the 3 «UTR that is involved in the formation of pseudoknots. These novel but common isolates are predicted to have six rather than three pseudoknots. Small types (three pseudoknotsfl type TMGMV) yielded twice as much virus after purification as Large types (six pseudoknots). The two groups of isolates could be distinguished in N. rustica (Large type, but not Small type gave a systemic infection), and N. clevelandii (Small type but not Large type induced systemic lethal necrosis).

40|$|The genomic RNA {{sequence}} of tobamovirus Ob (Ob), which can spread systemically in tobacco carrying the N gene, was determined. It consists of 6507 nucleotides and contains four open reading frames, exactly cor-responding to the genomic organization of tobamo-viruses known so far, i. e. encoding the 130 K, 180 K, 30 K and coat proteins. There were no nucleotide overlaps between any open reading frames.

40|$|Any {{individual}} virus can infect only {{a limited}} range of hosts, and most plant species are “nonhosts” to a given virus; i. e., {{all members of the}} species are insusceptible to the virus. In nonhost plants, the factors that control virus resistance are not genetically tractable, and how the host range of a virus is determined remains poorly understood. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a nonhost species for Tobacco <b>mild</b> green <b>mosaic</b> virus (TMGMV) and Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), members of the genus Tobamovirus. Previously, we identified Tm- 1, a resistance gene of tomato to another tobamovirus, Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), and found that Tm- 1 binds to ToMV replication proteins to inhibit RNA replication. Tm- 1 is derived from a wild tomato species, S. habrochaites, and ToMV-susceptible tomato cultivars have the allelic gene tm- 1. The tm- 1 protein can neither bind to ToMV replication proteins nor inhibit ToMV multiplication. Here, we show that transgenic tobacco plants expressing tm- 1 exhibit resistance to TMGMV and PMMoV. The tm- 1 protein bound to the replication proteins of TMGMV and PMMoV and inhibited their RNA replication in vitro. In one of the tm- 1 -expressing tobacco plants, a tm- 1 -insensitive TMGMV mutant emerged. In tomato protoplasts, this mutant TMGMV multiplied as efficiently as ToMV. However, in tomato plants, the mutant TMGMV multiplied with lower efficiency compared to ToMV and caused systemic necrosis. These results suggest that an inhibitory interaction between the replication proteins and tm- 1 underlies a multilayered resistance mechanism to TMGMV in tomato...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{over the}} past century of two tobamoviruses infecting populations of the immigrant plant Nicotiana glauca in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, has been studied. This plant species probably entered Australia in the 1870 s. Isolates of the viruses were obtained from N. glauca specimens deposited in the NSW Herbarium between 1899 and 1972, and others were obtained from living plants in 1985 and 1993. It was found that the NSW N. glauca population was infected with tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) and tobacco <b>mild</b> green <b>mosaic</b> tobamovirus (TMGMV) before 1950 but only with TMGMV after that date. Half the pre- 1950 infections were mixtures of the two viruses, and one was a recombinant. Remarkably, sequence analyses showed no increase in the genetic diversity among the TMGMV isolates over the period. However, for TMV, the genetic diversity of synonymous (but not of nonsynonymous) differences between isolates varied and was correlated with their time of isolation. TMV accumulated to smaller concentrations than TMGMV in N. glauca plants, and in mixed experimental infections, the accumulation of TMV, but not of TMGMV, was around 1 / 10 that in single infections. However, no evidence was found of isolate-specific interaction between the viruses. We conclude that although TMV may have colonized N. glauca in NSW earlier or faster than TMGMV, the latter virus caused a decrease of the TMV population below a threshold at which deleterious mutations were eliminated. This phenomenon, called Muller's ratchet, or a "mutational meltdown," probably caused the disappearance of TMV from the niche...|$|R
