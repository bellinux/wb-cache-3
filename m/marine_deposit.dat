5000|$|Atocetus is an extinct genus of kentriodontid dolphin {{found in}} Miocene-age <b>marine</b> <b>deposits</b> in Peru and California.

The Miocene delphinidan [...] "Champsodelphis" [...] fuchsii from <b>marine</b> <b>deposits</b> in Austria was initially tentatively referred to Atocetus based on the discovery of partial skeletons from the Carpathian region with earbones {{similar to those of}} Atocetus but was eventually re-assigned to Kentriodon following the discovery of additional earbones from Austria and Romania.|$|R

50|$|In general, the {{upstream}} Yaquina River {{source material}} is more quartz dominated (more silica) than downstream source material. Some {{of the heavy}} minerals upstream include micas (biotite and muscovite made of potassium, aluminum, and silica), hematite (iron), and limonite (iron oxides). Near the coastal shoreline and mouth of the Yaquina Bay estuary, the sand grains are mostly feldspars and chert (silica), and volcanic fragments (most likely high in silica, potassium, aluminum, sodium, and calcium). In nearshore <b>marine</b> <b>deposit</b> sediment, the source material is less quartz (less silica) compared to upriver sources; heavy minerals include pyroxene (a group of silicate minerals), hypersthene (magnesium iron silica), and diopside (magnesium calcium silica).|$|E

It mainly composed of mudrocks with nodules of sandstones and limestones, that are interpreted {{as part of a}} marginal <b>marine</b> <b>deposit,</b> with anoxic zones, in the warm and shallow sea that covered most of the Colombian territory during the Cretaceous.

5000|$|Diandongosuchus {{was found}} in a Ladinian-age marine {{limestone}} formation that has preserved many marine reptiles including thallatosaurs, nothosaurs, pistosaurs, and some protorosaurs. The closely related pseudosuchian Qianosuchus {{was found in}} a <b>marine</b> <b>deposit</b> about 50 km northwest of the Diandongosuchus locality that is slightly older (Anisian in age) and possesses many features consistent with a marine lifestyle. However, Diandongosuchus shows no features that are clear adaptations to a marine lifestyle. Possible adaptations include nostrils that are positioned slightly farther back on the skull than most terrestrial pseudosuchians and a greater number of premaxillary teeth (a feature seen in possible semiaquatic archosaurs such as Chanaresuchus and spinosaurids). Fish bones within its stomach contents are additional evidence that it was a marine archosaur. Diandongosuchus may have had a similar lifestyle to modern marine crocodylians like the saltwater crocodile that live along coastlines yet are not fully marine.|$|E
50|$|The Bishop's Frome Limestone (or Bishops Frome Limestone) is a rock unit {{within the}} Raglan Mudstone Formation of the Old Red Sandstone {{occurring}} in the border region between England and South Wales. This limestone is a calcrete, {{that is to say}} it originated as a soil during a break in deposition rather than being an original <b>marine</b> <b>deposit.</b> It is perhaps the most significant of all of the calcretes which occur within the uppermost Silurian and lower Devonian sequence of rocks which constitute the Old Red Sandstone of the Anglo-Welsh Basin. It defines the boundary within the basin between the Silurian and the Devonian periods. The rock was formerly known as the Psammosteus Limestone after a characteristic fossil fish recorded from it; Psammosteus anglicus. The fossil remains were subsequently shown to have been wrongly identified and belong in fact to Traquairaspis symondsi. Its modern name derives from the Herefordshire village of Bishop's Frome. Its thickness is variable ranging from 2m up to 8m.|$|E
