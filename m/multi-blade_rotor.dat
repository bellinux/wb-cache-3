40|$|The {{increasing}} demand {{of energy in}} the world is driving the search for more renewable and sustainable energy sources. Renewable sources of energy are being explored globally to overcome the depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting energy crisis. Moreover, use of fossil fuels has significant negative effects on the environment. Therefore, the focus is currently on both to ensure long-term energy supply, as well as to monitor and minimise the negative effects of these sources on the environment. In order to meet renewable energy targets, harnessing energy from all available resources such as wind, (through wind turbine), is necessary. Wind energy is one of the important sources of renewable energy. Wind turbine technology has been developed continuously, but the maintenance of wind turbines is still a topic of interest. Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) have dominated the wind energy and high power generation characteristics. However, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) are also gaining wide acceptance owing to being capable of producing power even at low speeds. The present study focuses on the quantification of the effect of steady wind flow conditions on the performance of Savonius type vertical axis wind turbine. The Savonius vertical axis wind turbine considered in this study comprises of <b>multi-blade</b> <b>rotor</b> and stationary inlet guide vanes, with the arrangement most suitable for a low wind speed application. Advanced numerical modeling tools within ANSYS–Fluent have been used in the present work to simulate the flow in and around the Savonius vertical wind turbine in order to quantify the flow behavior. Sliding mesh technique has been incorporated to simulate the rotation of the rotor blade, which capture the flow phenomenon caused by the stator and the rotor interaction, and hence providing more accurate results. A critical analysis of the flow across vertical axis wind turbine has been conducted through investigating the static pressure and velocity magnitude variations {{in the vicinity of the}} wind turbine. Furthermore, the present study has also focused on the performance of a vertical axis wind turbine under unsteady flow conditions whereby the flow is accelerated and decelerated as characterised by the change in the wind velocity. The torque and power generation capabilities of the turbine have been characterised and in particular the rotor contribution has been quantified. The effect of transient phenomena under varying torque outputs during accelerating and decelerating flows has also been highlighted. Overall performance of the turbine has also been quantified...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainable}} energy sources becomes greater each year {{due to the}} continued depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting energy crisis. Solutions to this problem are potentially {{in the form of}} wind turbines, for sustainable urban environment, that have been receiving increased support. At present, a number of wind turbines have been developed that show significant increase in performance compared to existing technologies. From an extensive literature review, a number of key issues have been highlighted which are concerned with the design, optimisation and diagnostics of Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) that have been used to formulate the scope of this research. A design procedure for a vertical axis wind turbine, that features both <b>multi-blade</b> <b>rotor</b> and fixed outer stator guide vanes, has been derived, in which both rotor and stator blade profiles have been generated for a low wind speed application. In the presented work, numerical investigations have been carried out extensively to determine the optimised design of the VAWT. Sliding mesh technique has been used for the rotation of rotor blades. This new technique captures the transient flow phenomena that occur when the rotor and the stator blades interact with each other. Hence, the results predicted by CFD using this technique are much superior in accuracy. Furthermore, a detailed flow field analysis of the VAWT has highlighted large asymmetries in both pressure and flow velocity about the central axis of the VAWT in both the stationary and the rotating frames of references. Various geometric parameters associated with the design of the VAWT have been investigated over a wide range in order to analyse the effect of these parameters on the performance output of the VAWT. These geometric parameters are the blade angles, the number of blades in the VAWT {{and the size of the}} rotor/stator sections of the VAWT. It has been shown that all these parameters considerably affect the performance output of the VAWT and hence have been optimised in the present study for maximum performance output of the VAWT. One of the key elements of this study is the development of a performance prediction model of the VAWT that takes into account the effects of the aforementioned geometric parameters of the VAWT. This novel prediction model is both robust, user-friendly and has shown to predict the performance output of the VAWT with reasonable accuracy. Hence, the prediction model can be used by the designers of the VAWT. Nowadays, condition based health monitoring of mechanical systems is topic of vast research. Most of the studies in this field use experimental facilities and conventional toolboxes to handle the output data from the sensors. With the advent of advanced CFD tools, it has now become possible to use CFD as an effective tool for fault detection in VAWTs. An attempt has been presented in this study regarding condition monitoring of VAWTs for sustainable urban environment. Various faults like missing blade and slits in blade have been investigated and analysed. It has been shown that CFD can detect these faults and show the effects of these faults on local flow parameters such as pressure and velocity...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainable}} energy sources becomes greater each year {{due to the}} continued depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting energy crisis. Solutions to this problem are potentially {{in the form of}} wind turbines which have been receiving increased support at a micro level. At present a number of wind turbines are being developed that are of cross-flow vertical axis operation which have shown significant increases in performance compared to existing technologies. From an extensive literature review a number of key issues have been highlighted which are concerned with design, operation and diagnostics of this new wind power technology which have been used to formulate the scope of this research. A design procedure for a cross-flow machine that features both a <b>multi-blade</b> <b>rotor</b> and fixed outer stator guide vanes has been derived in which both rotor and stator blade profiles have been generated for a low wind speed urban application. Using these blade profiles a prototype wind turbine has been fabricated and used for full scale development testing. In the presented work both experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out to determine the operational characteristics of this new technology. The experimental data obtained under controlled laboratory conditions has been used to validate a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model which has been used throughout. A flow field analysis of the machine has highlighted large asymmetries in both pressure and velocity about the central axis of the machine in both stationary and rotating frames of reference. This has identified primary inefficiencies within the design which limit the torque generating capability of the rotor due to blockage effects and downstream blade interactions. This asymmetry has been quantified in the form asymmetry ratio and used to determine downstream rotor effects and the optimum location of multiple wind turbines which is seen to be x/D > 10 in order to minimize performance reductions. The torque and power generation capabilities of the machine have been characterised at both 'design' and ‘offdesign' conditions in which individual blade torque contributions have been quantified. This has highlighted specific energy transfer zones within the turbine namely at a few key blades on the windward side of the rotor. It has also shown counter-rotating torques generated on the leeward side of the machine at specific blade positions during the cycle. Overall performance has been quantified in which a maximum CT = 1. 7 and CP = 0. 24 has been observed which has some similarities to the Savonius rotor. Geometric effects on torque and power response have been quantified in which a strong dependence on stator blade number is noticed. Further, maximum performance output of the machine is generated at the baseline design condition. Using torque response data a multiple regression model has been developed in which a design equation for crossflow rotor torque has been derived which can be used during the conceptual design phase. Finally, the effectiveness of a two-dimensional transient CFD model to predict cross-flow wind turbine rotor blade loss has been evaluated against full scale experimental data. It has shown that from analysis in the frequency domain specific blade faults can be recognised which agrees well with experimental data obtained. The use of this model for wind turbine performance emulation has been described...|$|E
5000|$|The main {{design feature}} of a <b>multi-bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> is [...] "high {{starting}} torque", which {{is necessary for}} cranking a piston pump operation. Once started a <b>multi-bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> runs at too high a tipspeed ratio at less than its best efficiency of 30% [...] On the other hand, modern wind rotors can operate at an aerodynamic efficiency of more than 40% at higher tipspeed ratio for a smaller swirl added and wasted to the wind. But they would need a highly variable stroke mechanism rather than just a crank to piston pump.|$|R
50|$|Before {{development}} of powered helicopters {{in the mid}} 20th century, autogyro pioneer Juan de la Cierva researched and developed many of the fundamentals of the rotor. De la Cierva is credited with successful {{development of}} <b>multi-bladed,</b> fully articulated <b>rotor</b> systems. This system, in its various modified forms, {{is the basis of}} most <b>multi-bladed</b> helicopter <b>rotor</b> systems.|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} in {{instrumentation}} {{was developed by}} engineers at NASA Lewis Research Center to collect vibration data from <b>multi-bladed</b> <b>rotors.</b> This new concept, known as the optical data acquisition system, uses optical transducers to measure bladed tip deflections by reflection of light beams off {{the tips of the}} blades as they pass in front of the optical transducer. By using an array of transducers {{around the perimeter of the}} rotor, detailed vibration signals can be obtained. In this study, resonant frequencies and mode shapes were determined for a 56 bladed rotor using the optical system. Frequency data from the optical system was also compared to data obtained from strain gauge measurements and finite element analysis and was found to be in good agreement...|$|R
30|$|Above studies {{indicate}} that both the shape and the relevant position affect the efficiency of VAWT obviously, <b>multi-bladed</b> Savonius <b>rotors</b> have a more stable torque along the rotation and therefore present a better starting ability, {{and the reason for}} the lower power efficiency of three-blade Savonius turbine than two-blade rotor is due to the “shading effect”.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA full-span free-wake {{method is}} {{coupled with an}} {{unsteady}} panel method to accurately predict the unsteady aerodynamics of helicopter rotor blades in hover and forward flight. The unsteady potential-based panel method is used to consider aerodynamics of finite thickness <b>multi-bladed</b> <b>rotors,</b> and the full-span free-wake method is applied to simulating dynamics of rotor wake. These methods are tightly coupled through trailing-edge Kutta condition and by converting doublet-wake panels to full-span vortex filaments. A velocity-field integration technique is also adopted to overcome singularity problem during {{the interaction between the}} rotor wake and blades. Helicopter rotors including Caradonna–Tung, UH- 60 A, and AH- 1 G rotors, are simulated in hover and forward flight to validate the accuracy of this approach. The predicted aerodynamic loads of rotor blades agree well with available measured data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and the unsteady dynamics of rotor wake is also well simulated. Compared to CFD, the present method obtains accurate results more efficiently and is suitable to rotorcraft aeroelastic analysis...|$|R
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{understand}} the whirl flutter phenomenon in flapped blade rotor systems and also to shed some light in bridging the existing gap between theoretical and experimental results, the equations of motion of an idealised mathematical model of a <b>multi-bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> system were formulated. Generalised aerodynamic forces were obtained from quasi-steady blade element theory. These 13; equations were linearised and solved for a symmetric case of the system. The stability boundaries for different hinge offsets of the blades are presented as nacelle frequency parameter for neutral instability against blade flapping frequency parameter. It was found that for a particular value of the flapping frequency parameter, which {{is a function of}} blade hinge offset and restraint spring constant at the flapping hinge, the nacelle frequency parameter required for neutral instability is minimum. From these results it can be shown that an optimum flapping hinge position from the whirl flutter point of view can be determined. Low speed wind tunnel experiments were performed on a simplified model with different hinge offset conditions. Both 10 per cent and 13. 6 per cent hinge offsets resulted in backward whirl flutter as predicted by theory...|$|R
40|$|Even {{research}} {{models of}} helicopter dynamics {{often lead to}} {{a large number of}} equations of motion with periodic coefficients; and Floquet theory is a widely used mathematical tool for dynamic analysis. Presently, three approaches are used in generating the equations of motion. These are (1) general-purpose symbolic processors such as REDUCE and MACSYMA, (2) a special-purpose symbolic processor, DEHIM (Dynamic Equations for Helicopter Interpretive Models), and (3) completely numerical approaches. In this paper, comparative aspects of the first two purely algebraic approaches are studied by applying REDUCE and DEHIM to the same set of problems. These problems range from a linear model with one degree of freedom to a mildly non-linear <b>multi-bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> model with several degrees of freedom. Further, computational issues in applying Floquet theory are also studied, which refer to (1) the equilibrium solution for periodic forced response together with the transition matrix for perturbations about that response and (2) a small number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unsymmetric transition matrix. The study showed the following: (1) compared to REDUCE, DEHIM is far more portable and economical, but it is also less user-friendly, particularly during learning phases; (2) the problems of finding the periodic response and eigenvalues are well conditioned...|$|R

It showed that <b>multi-bladed</b> Savonius <b>rotors</b> have a more stable torque along the rotation and therefore present a better starting ability, their power coefficient can also be higher than the standard Savonius rotors if the right parameters are used. Design parameters such as blade number and dimensions have a strong influence on the aerodynamic efficiency [8].|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic loads on a <b>multi-bladed</b> {{helicopter}} <b>rotor</b> in {{forward flight}} at transonic tip conditions are calculated. The unsteady, three-dimensional, time-accurate compressible Reynolds-averaged thin layer Navier-Stokes equations are solved in a rotating coordinate system on a body-conformed, curvilinear grid of C-H topology. Detailed boundary layer and global numerical comparisons of NACA- 0012 symmetrical and CAST 7 - 158 supercritical airfoils are made under identical forward flight conditions. The rotor wake effects are modeled by applying a correction to the geometric {{angle of attack}} of the blade. This correction is obtained by computing the local induced downwash velocity with a free wake analysis program. The calculations are performed on the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation Cray 2 and the VPS 32 (a derivative of a Cyber 205 at the Langley Research Center) for a model helicopter rotor in forward flight...|$|R

The unknowns in the problem are the strengths of prescribed singularity distributions on the boundaries of the flow. For the body (fuselage) a surface of constant strength source panels is used. For the rotor blades and rotor wake a surface of constant strength doublet panels is used. The mean camber line of the rotor airfoil is partitioned into surface panels. The no-flow boundary condition at the panel centroids is modified at each azimuthal step to account for rotor blade cyclic pitch variation. The geometry of the rotor wake is computers at each time step of the solution. The code produces rotor and fuselage surface pressures, as well as the complex geometry of the evolving rotor wake...|$|R
