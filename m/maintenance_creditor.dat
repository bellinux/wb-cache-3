40|$|Objectives: Recently {{entered into}} force, the Romanian Civil Code, systematized on the stable and steady {{values of the}} former civil law, reforms {{the matter of the}} {{maintenance}} obligation, regardless of the source and the legal nature of this obligation. Prior Work: This is the reason why we have chosen this topic and the analysis of the typology to which such an obligation adapts and, of course, the correlative right to which it gives birth. Approach: In our current system of law there are provided different forms of exercising this obligation, preserving, improving, but also innovating, in some aspects, the previous regulation. Specifically, we will relate in this study to a brief analysis of all types of maintenance obligations, generated by two distinct sources: the law and the will of the parties (contract), in this case we are speaking of an obligation based on the law or a contractual obligation. The angle from which we are analyzing this type of obligational relationship between the <b>maintenance</b> <b>creditor</b> and the maintenance debtor also allows us to recall both the passive or active patrimonial side, and also the analysis of the legal characters that it presupposes each of the two above-mentioned generic types of maintenance obligations. Value: Starting from the conceptualization of the maintenance obligation, the present study will be oriented towards the analysis in the current legal context of the doctrinal points of view expressed in the specialized literature, using as a method the documentary research, the interpretative method and the comparative method...|$|E

In recent years new measures have been adopted in order to promote the compatibility of the rules concerning conflicts of jurisdiction and some proposals are still pending. However, those measures are far from being coherent and consistent, since each one emphasizes different principles and values. While the EC regulation No. 44 / 2001 is mostly concerned with legal certainty and predictability of the head of jurisdiction, the EC regulation No. 2201 / 2003 and the EC regulation No. 4 / 2009 are intended to foster substantive values, such as favor divortii or protection of <b>maintenance</b> <b>creditors.</b> Recent proposals are going to develop at least a uniform rule about jurisdictional competence, based on the mechanism of the forum necessitatis, already envisaged by article 7 of the EC regulation No. 4 / 2009.

In recent years new measures have been adopted in order to promote the compatibility of the rules concerning conflicts of jurisdiction and some proposals are still pending. However, those measures are far from being coherent and consistent, since each one emphasizes different principles and values. While the EC regulation No. 44 / 2001 is mostly concerned with legal certainty and predictability of the head of jurisdiction, the EC regulation No. 2201 / 2003 and the EC regulation No. 4 / 2009 are intended to foster substantive values, such as favor divortii or protection of <b>maintenance</b> <b>creditors.</b> Recent proposals are going to develop at least a uniform rule about jurisdictional competence, based on the mechanism of the forum necessitatis, already envisaged by article 7 of the EC regulation No. 4 / 2009. That innovation isalso a consequence of the proposed abolition of national exorbitant fora. The paper describes the general characteristics of the mechanism, that can be used only on a subsidiary and exceptional basis, i. e. when no provision would otherwise confer jurisdiction on a Member State. Accordingly, such a mechanism departs from the principles of predictability and proximity of the head of jurisdiction, because it applies when the dispute is closely connected to a third State. In that context the use of forum necessitatis is required in order to prevent or to remedy a denial of justice that could take place (or has already taken place) in the third State. When the denial of justice would affect procedural or substantive fundamental human rights of the claimant, the forum necessitatis mechanism allows him/her to bring his/her action before the courts of the Member States. More detailed requirements as to the existence of a denial of justice are envisaged in the proposal to revise EC regulation No. 44 / 2001. In addition, the dispute must have a «sufficient connection» to the Member State of the forum; such a requirement is needed in order to provide the allocation of jurisdictional competence between Member States...|$|R
