40|$|Some {{requirements}} {{which an}} ideal {{geographic information system}} (GIS) must meet {{to cope with the}} challenges of the future are described. We look at data modeling, the integra-tion of geographic information science and photogrammetry, update and refinement of a geospatial database, and data integration. We claim that data modeling needs to be carried out in 3 D based on a topologic data structure with the possi-bility for incorporating change. Photogrammetric operations such as the generation of digital terrain models or the manual and automatic acquisition of vector data from imagery should be considered as modules of future GIS, which should also have efficient mechanisms for incremental updating and versioning. Finally, the integration of all types of data should be possible, e. g., various vector data sets as well as DTMs and images. We illustrate the requirements with the help of three examples, one describing data acquisition and <b>modeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> project, one dealing with quality control and update using imagery, and the last one presenting an algorithm for the integration of a 2 D data set and a DTM. This paper discusses GIS from a photogrammetric point of view with an emphasis on imaging and data acquisition. While we believe that the discussed requirements are vital for the development of GIS, we are {{aware of the fact that}} other issues such as database design, software architecture, visual-ization, geospatial data infrastructure, and web mapping, only briefly mentioned or not discussed at all in this paper, are of similar importance for the field...|$|R
40|$|This article {{it shows}} the role of {{services}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly <b>interdisciplinary</b> context: promoting cooperation between organizations in the life sciences industry and in the engineering and automation industry. It provides insights on how required offerings of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) are developed systematically based on a simple service engineering process <b>model.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the content-related view of new service development, findings from a meta-view are presented. Cooperating researchers and practitioners in the new-service development process observed their own collaboration and how the applied service engineering model had to be modified dynamically {{to the requirements of}} the use case. The results show that an easy-to-use service engineering <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly <b>interdisciplinary</b> context has benefits, but success is dependent on the joint efforts of <b>an</b> accordingly <b>interdisciplinary</b> team of engineers and natural scientists; a close communication with the customers both from the life sciences industry and the engineering and automation industry; and a more agile approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{difficult}} {{for the students to}} transfer concepts, ideas and procedures learned <b>in</b> mathematics to <b>a</b> new and unanticipated situation in science. An alternative to this traditional transfer method stresses the importance of <b>modelling</b> activities <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> context between mathematics and science. In the paper we introduce a modelling approach to the concept of function in upper secondary school is introduced. We discuss pedagogical and didactical issues concerning the interplay between mathematics and science. The discussion is crystallized into a didactical model for interdisciplinary instruction in mathematics and science. The model is considered as an iterative movement with two phases: (1) the horizontal linking of the subjects: Situations from science are embedded in contexts which are mathematized by the students, (2) the vertical structuring in the subjects: The conceptual anchoring of the students’ constructs from the horizontal linking in the systematic and framework of mathematics and science respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the creation of}} a comprehensive conceptualization of object <b>models</b> used <b>in</b> medical image simulation, suitable for major imaging modalities and simulators. The goal is to create an application ontology {{that can be used to}} annotate the <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> repository integrated <b>in</b> the Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP), to facilitate their sharing and reuse. Annotations make the anatomical, physiological and pathophysiological content of the object <b>models</b> explicit. <b>In</b> such <b>an</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> context we chose to rely on a common integration framework provided by a foundational ontology, that facilitates the consistent integration of the various modules extracted from several existing ontologies, i. e. FMA, PATO, MPATH, RadLex and ChEBI. Emphasis is put on methodology for achieving this extraction and integration. The most salient aspects of the ontology are presented, especially the organization <b>in</b> <b>model</b> layers, as well as its use to browse and query the model repository...|$|R
40|$|Energy is {{a unifying}} concept that cuts across physics, chemistry, and biology. However, {{students}} who study all three disciplines {{can end up}} with a fragmented understanding of energy. This dissertation sits at the intersection of two active areas of current research: the teaching and learning of energy, and interdisciplinary science education (particularly the intersection of physics and biology). The context for this research is an introductory physics course for undergraduate life sciences majors that is reformed to build stronger interdisciplinary connections between physics, biology, and chemistry. An approach to energy that incorporates chemical bonds and chemical reactions is better equipped {{to meet the needs of}} life sciences students than a traditional introductory physics approach that focuses primarily on mechanical energy, and so we present a curricular thread for chemical energy in the physics course. Our first set of case studies examines student reasoning about ATP hydrolysis, a biochemically significant reaction that powers various processes in the cell. We observe students expressing both that an energy input is required to break a chemical bond (which they associate with physics) and that energy is released when the phosphate bond is broken in ATP (which they associate with biology). We use these case studies to articulate <b>a</b> model of <b>interdisciplinary</b> reconciliation: building coherent connections between concepts from different disciplines while understanding each concept in its own disciplinary context and justifying the <b>modeling</b> choices <b>in</b> deciding when to use each disciplinary model. Our second study looks at ontological metaphors for energy: metaphors about what kind of thing energy is. Two ontological metaphors for energy that have previously been documented include energy as a substance and energy as a location. We argue for the use of negative energy <b>in</b> <b>modeling</b> chemical energy <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> context, and for the use of a blended substance/location ontology in reasoning about negative energy. Our data show students and experts using the blended ontology productively when the two ontologies are combined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coherent structure, as well as students getting confused when the ontologies are not coherently combined...|$|R
