40|$|The thermal {{properties}} of the lithium ceramics pebble beds {{have a significant impact}} on the temperature profile of the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed blanket and the extraction of heat from the pebble beds to the coolant. The literature review showed a lack of experimental data on the interface thermal conductance (h) of lithium <b>metatitanate</b> pebble beds, therefore the objective of this study is to present experimental values of h. The measuring technique is based on the principles of steady state and axial heat flow methods. The lithium <b>metatitanate</b> pebble bed is single size (Ø 1. 7 - 2. 0 mm pebbles) with a packing fraction of 61 %. The values of h were measured at the interface of the pebbles with their container’s wall (made of stainless steel 316). The results showed that h increased from 1800 to 5300 W/m 2. K with the increase of the wall temperature from 24 to 570 qC. The theoretical values of h, calculated by three models, were compared with the experimental values. The theoretical and experimental values of h showed similar behavior with the increase of temperature.

40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{progress}} in mobile and satellite communication systems {{has increased the}} demand {{for the development of}} dielectric materials for microwave frequencies. Zinc titanates have possible application as microwave resonator. In the present work, zinc <b>metatitanate,</b> ZnTiO 3, and zinc metatitanate-rutile mixtures (ZnTiO 3 + 0, 25 TiO 2) were prepared via the conventional mixed oxide method with zinc borate addition. The investigation of reaction sequence revealed that ZnTiO 3 and Zn 2 Ti 3 O 8 phases formed at around 600 °C and these phases decomposed to Zn 2 TiO 4 at 940 °C. The phase development in ZnTiO 3, and ZnTiO 3 + 0, 25 TiO 2 mixtures between 800 - 1000 °C were similar. Around 95 % of theoretical density was obtained after firing at 1050 °C for 2 h...|$|E

The paper deals with an experimental method for the evaluation of the thermal conductivity of ceramic pebble beds versus the temperature and compressive strain, based on a steady state heat flux through a material (alumina) of known conductivity. The alumina thermal conductivity is determined by means of the hot wire method. To assess the experimental method, a thermo-mechanical characterization of alumina pebble beds (a material largely available), having different diameters, considering a wide range of temperatures and compression forces has been carried out...|$|E

The envisaged solution called Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) breeding blanket foresees the use of lithium orthosilicate (Li 4 SiO 4) or lithium <b>metatitanate</b> (Li 2 TiO 3) pebble beds. The thermal mechanical properties of the candidate pebble bed materials are presently extensively investigated because they are critical for the feasibility and performances of the numerous conceptual designs which use a solid breeder.

This study is aimed at the investigation of mechanical properties of the lithium orthosilicate and at the characterization of the main chemical, physical and thermo-mechanical properties {{taking into account the}} production technology.

The related lithium ion-sieve (H 2 TiO 3), obtained by acid pickling of Li 2 TiO 3, with a specific surface area of 45. 35 m(2) g(- 1) and a pore volume of 0. 166 cm(3) g(- 1) possessed a maximum adsorption capacity of 76. 7 mg g(- 1) in LiOH solution (similar to 2 g L- 1 of Li+ ions) at 30 degrees C for 24 h, which was much higher than those reported for other lithium ion-sieves. Adsorption isotherms and kinetic analysis indicated that the adsorption of Li+ ions onto H 2 TiO 3 followed the Langmuir isotherm model and a pseudo-second order kinetics equation.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the thermal conductivity of breeder materials {{is one of the}} main goals to find the best candidate material for the fusion reactor technology. The aim of this paper is to evaluate experimentally the thermal conductivity of a ceramic material by applying the hot wire method at different temperatures, ranging from 50 to 550 °C. The updated experimental facility available at the Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering (DICI) of the University of Pisa, which was used to evaluate the thermal conductivity of a ceramic material (alumina), will be described along with the measurement acquisition system.

Due {{to the specific}} way of energy transfer during {{mechanical treatment}} using a high-energy ball mill, the system passes through low temperature ZnTiO 3 <b>metatitanate</b> phase formation. Mechanical activation was performed on an equimolar ratio mixture of ZnO and TiO 2. The anatase phase was previously submitted to heat treatment for achieving a starting mixture rich in a rutile phase. Milling conditions were preset for observing {{the formation of a}} low temperature ZnTiO 3 phase with a perovskite structure. The powder microstructure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. A nitrogen gas sorption analyzer with the BET method was used to determine the specific surface area and porosity, indicating changes of powder sample properties during mechanical activation. Also, X ray powder diffractometry was applied to obtain the phase composition. Powders were then pressed into pellets and their compressibility was observed through density changes. According to microstructures obtained by scanning electron microscopy analysis, the system underwent a primary and secondary agglomeration process. Specific surface area measurements supported that conclusion. Compressibility investigations established the difference between compressibility of the non-activated mixture and activated powders.

40|$|The {{abnormal}} {{influence of}} potassium <b>metatitanate</b> on {{the rate of}} the deposition of tin from stannate electrolyte is discussed: introduction of 1 mmol/L К 2 ТiО 3 into working solution causes a fivefold increase of partial current Sn(VI) → Sn 0 and, respectively, the current output of tin. The analysis of the correlation of potentials' values which are installed during the process of electrodeposition of microcomposite material was carried out. The correctness between the potentials' values and sustainable forms of precipitated component at a specified pH value was determined. The possibility of formation the titanium hydride is shown in these conditions. A sharp change in morphology of the tin sediment surface in the presence of additive К 2 ТiО 3 in the tinning electrolyte is reviewed. The single-phase nature of the obtained micro-composite material including tin and titanium is proved. To explain these facts a scheme of electrode process is proposed, whereby SnO 3 2 – and TiO 3 2 – ions are reduced with hydrogen at the cathode, where the product of metatitanate-ions reduction is titanium hydride which is capable of catalysing SnO 3 2 – reduction. The suggested scheme also explains the changes in the morphology of the sediment surface. The growth of the needle crystals of tin which segregate in the presence of TiO 3 2 – ions takes place on titanium hydride active centers. </p...|$|E
