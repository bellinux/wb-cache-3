2500|$|Dana {{describes}} Kevin: [...] "He was an unusual-looking white man, {{his face}} young, almost unlined, but his hair completely gray {{and his eyes}} so pale as to be almost colorlessâ€¦.I looked away startled, wondering whether I had really seen anger there. Maybe he was {{more important in the}} warehouse than I had thought. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> some authority..." [...] (Kindred, p.54) ...|$|E
2500|$|Arnold flew {{on to an}} {{air show}} in Pendleton, Oregon, not knowing that {{somebody}} in Yakima had phoned in ahead to say that Arnold had seen some strange new aircraft. It was {{at this time that}} Arnold studied his maps, determined the distance between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and calculated the rather astonishing speed. He told a number of pilot friends, and wrote in his account to AAF intelligence that they did not scoff or laugh. Instead they suggested that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen guided missiles or something new, though Arnold felt this explanation to be inadequate. He also wrote that some former Army pilots told him that they had been briefed before going into combat [...] "that they might see objects of similar shape and design as I described and assured me that I wasn't dreaming or going crazy." [...] (See Foo fighter.) ...|$|E
60|$|It {{did just}} occur {{to him that}} <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not made that descent quite as {{successfully}} as he had thought he had; that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come down on his head; that in consequence he had done with the experiences of Flight Commander Raffleton and was now about to enter on a new and less circumscribed existence. If so, the beginning, to an adventuresome young spirit, seemed promising. It was Malvina's voice that recalled him from this train of musing.|$|E
5000|$|JEROME: I {{have never}} met him, but there is good wine here, so <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> drunk here.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, but we've got {{to locate}} him first. Now that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been {{discovered}} <b>he</b> will do {{his best to}} keep shady. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> already left the city." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] he thought, [...] "perhaps {{the silly}} chap's doing his best. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{forgotten}} where <b>he</b> really did put it, {{and is trying}} to remember. I'll give him another chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A tall, slim feller, with reddish hair. He had sech shifty eyes I couldn't {{help but}} think that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> stolen them things jest to raise some {{spending}} money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} {{must have}} gone there on business-- the business that has been bothering him so long," [...] he mused. [...] "But would that cause him to disappear? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an accident, or was waylaid for his money." ...|$|E
60|$|She kept on sobbing then {{without any}} noise, and Almayer {{stared at her}} in {{boundless}} astonishment. The idea that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done wrong by confiding in her, upset him so much {{that for a moment}} he could not find a connected thought in his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubtna ye may say true in the main, neighbour," [...] {{replied the}} beggar; [...] "but <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> <b>had</b> some hard play in his younger days, Francis, and that whiles unsettles folk sair." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the ending}} scene, Hashem sits weeping over his son's body and {{looking to the}} skies. You can {{hear the sound of}} a {{woodpecker}}, and Mohammed's fingers slowly start to move; perhaps he is [...] "reading" [...] the sound with his fingers as if they are Braille dots. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> thinks the woodpecker is giving clues about [...] "the color of God". Or <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> finally touched God.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. Except <b>maybe</b> Maggie. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> no {{idea what}} a {{remarkable}} woman Maggie is.|$|R
6000|$|At {{two in the}} {{afternoon}} referee Roop's Court opened and Roop appeared throned among his sheriffs, the witnesses, and spectators, and wearing upon his face a solemnity so awe-inspiring {{that some of his}} fellow-conspirators had misgivings that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not comprehended, after all, that this was merely a joke. An unearthly stillness prevailed, for at the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the command: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{as he was}} any {{particular}} friend. You see, he asked {{about some of the}} other places around here too--about Jed Wallop's place, and those shacks belonging to Tony Duval, and about the old Hunker cabin and the deserted Parkingham house, and the old Crosby camp, and those shacks down at Miller's saw mill, and a lot of places like that. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an idea of buying some place and locating here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} one case," [...] {{one of the}} others said, [...] "in which the blacks did spare one of the party, in a station which they attacked. It was a little girl of about three years old. Why they did so I don't know; perhaps the chief took a fancy to her. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost a child of the same age, and thought his gin would take to the little one. Anyhow, he carried her off.|$|E
60|$|Jamesy took to drink, and I took to Jesus. I'm {{not saying}} {{anything}} against Him. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> His life, but I wanted mine. <b>Maybe</b> <b>He</b> would <b>have</b> understood.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{is going}} to be a good midfield player, there is no {{question}} about that. After scoring two against Tranmere, I thought he showed what a good player he is in this game. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> too many touches at times and gives the ball away, but he keeps wanting it and he wants to learn." [...] Mark Grew speaking of Morsy in September 2008.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aunt Pen is so near-sighted she won't mind, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> will <b>have</b> another tail pretty soon, or {{she will}} think he is moulting. If she asks of course I shall tell her.' ...|$|R
60|$|I ran to {{the door}} to meet him, feeling that I would have given a deal to have him back in Edinburgh again. He came running, waving a paper over his head; and I thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a note from Edie, and that it was all known to him. But as he came up I saw that it was a big, stiff, yellow paper which {{crackled}} as he waved it, and that his eyes were dancing with happiness.|$|E
60|$|Little doubt had she {{as to the}} acceptance. The mere words 'going to Hiltonbury,' had {{power by}} force of {{association}} to make her heart bound. She was a little disappointed {{that he had not}} included the children; she feared that it looked as if he were really ill; but it might be on account of the Savilles, or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> that to say to her which--oh, nonsense! Were that the case, Humfrey would not reverse the order of things, and make her come to him. At any rate, the children should be her first condition. And then she concentrated her anxieties on his most unusual confession of having been unwell.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{got off the}} trail. About Don Carlos I'll {{say right}} out, not what Nels and Nick think, but what I know. Don Carlos hoped to make off with you for himself, the same {{as if you had}} been a poor peon slave-girl down in Sonora. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a deeper plot than my rebel friend told me. Maybe he {{even went so far as}} to hope for American troops to chase him. The rebels are trying to stir up the United States. They'd welcome intervention. But, however that may be, the Greaser meant evil to you, and has meant it ever since he saw you first. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say nowt to no one," [...] Luke {{said as he}} started. [...] "Till t' master cooms round there ain't no {{saying what}} he'd loike done. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> won't <b>have</b> nowt said aboot it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure, ma'am, if I {{had thought}} I was {{particularly}} wrang, I wadna hae made ony answer when Sir Arthur challenged me. I hae been lang in his service, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{been a kind}} master, and you a kind mistress, and I wad like ill ye should think I wad start for a hasty word. I am sure it was very wrang o' me to speak about wages to his honour, when <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> something to vex him. I had nae thoughts o' leaving the family in this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nix on {{the rough}} stuff, Mamie," [...] pleaded the embarrassed pugilist. [...] "How was I {{to know what}} kids feed on? And <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> passed up the lobster at that and stuck to the sardines." ...|$|R
60|$|Besides his marksmanship the Kid {{had another}} {{attribute}} {{for which he}} admired himself greatly. He was /muy caballero/, as the Mexicans express it, where the ladies were concerned. For them he had always gentle words and consideration. He could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman. He might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers, {{but he could not}} have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman. Wherefore many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief in the stories circulated about Mr. Kid. One shouldn't believe everything one heard, they said. When confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the /caballero's/ deeds of infamy, they said <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been driven to it, and that he knew how to treat a lady, anyhow.|$|E
6000|$|THEM awful words froze us solid. We couldn't move hand or {{foot for}} as much as half a minute. Then we kind of come to, and lifted the old man up and got him into his chair, and Benny petted him and kissed him and tried to comfort him, and poor old Aunt Sally she done the same; but, poor things, they was so broke up and scared and knocked out of their right minds that they didn't hardly know what they was about. With Tom it was awful; it 'most petrified him to think <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> got his uncle into a {{thousand}} times more trouble than ever, and maybe it wouldn't ever happened if he hadn't been so ambitious to get celebrated, and let the corpse alone the way the others done. But pretty soon he sort of come to himself again and says: ...|$|E
60|$|But all lesser sin {{sinks into}} insignificance beside the {{lawlessness}} of George. The bicycle incident had thrown us all into confusion, {{with the result}} that we lost George altogether. It transpired subsequently that he was waiting for us outside the police court; but this at the time we did not know. We thought, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone on to Baden by himself; and anxious to get away from Carlsruhe, and not, perhaps, thinking out things too clearly, we jumped into the next train that came up and proceeded thither. When George, tired of waiting, returned to the station, he found us gone and he found his luggage gone. Harris had his ticket; I was acting as banker to the party, so that he had in his pocket only some small change. Excusing himself upon these grounds, he thereupon commenced deliberately a career of crime that, reading it later, as set forth baldly in the official summons, made the hair of Harris and myself almost to stand on end.|$|E
5000|$|Osasuna's {{first goal}} of the 2010-11 season only came in the fourth matchday, and the 34-year-old Pandiani scored it through a header as the team came from behind to win it 3-1 against Real Sociedad, at home. On 30 January 2011, during half-time of a 1-0 home win against Real Madrid, he was {{involved}} in a [...] "verbal spat" [...] with Cristiano Ronaldo, suggesting afterwards that [...] "As a footballer he is a phenomenon but to do the things <b>he</b> does, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a screw loose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Na, na, {{these are}} Scotch dragoons," [...] said mine host,--"our ain auld caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again, <b>maybe,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the lang ten in his hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! if I'd {{only been}} as thin when Kit carried me as I am now, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> died; but I was heavy, {{he was hurt}} worser than we knew, and so it killed him; and I didn't see him, to say good bye." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{closed his}} eyes and held his aching head in his hands. What had happened? Slowly the dreadful thought arose in his mind. He fought against it, strove to drive it away, but it persisted: he had killed somebody. That alone could explain why he was in an open boat {{drifting}} down the Yukon. The law of Red Cow that he had so long administered had now been administered to him. He had killed some one and been set adrift. But whom? He racked his aching brain for the answer, but all that came was a vague memory of bodies falling upon him and of striking out at them. Who were they? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> killed more than one. He reached to his belt. The knife was missing from its sheath. He had done it with that undoubtedly. But there must have been some reason for the killing. He opened his eyes and in a panic began to search about the boat. There was no grub, not an ounce of grub. He sat down with a groan. He had killed without provocation. The extreme rigour of the law had been visited upon him.|$|E
6000|$|Even old Marsh {{began to}} have suspicions that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been a trifle too [...] "brash," [...] {{as he called it}} in the privacy of his soul, and he pulled himself {{together}} and started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes; but Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and eloquent. Then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever been known in that house at that time of day. It was so still, and so solemn withal, that when somebody's cup slipped from his fingers and landed in his plate the shock made people start, and the sharp sound seemed as indecorous there and as out of place as if a coffin and mourners were imminent and being waited for. And at last when Brady's feet came clattering down the stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable. Everybody rose softly and turned toward the door, where stood Tracy; then with a common impulse, moved a step or two in that direction, and stopped. While they gazed, young Brady arrived, panting, and put into Tracy's hand,--sure enough--an envelope. Tracy fastened a bland victorious eye upon the gazers, and kept it there till one by one they dropped their eyes, vanquished and embarrassed. Then he tore open the telegram and glanced at its message. The yellow paper fell from his fingers and fluttered to the floor, and his face turned white. There was nothing there but one word-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A greaser {{is just a}} Mexican. Why {{they call}} them so I don't know; but that has been their name always as long as I came in the country. Well, we ran down and came sudden upon two greasers who were {{kneeling}} by a man lying in the road, {{and seemed to be}} searching his pockets. We let fly with our Colts; one of them was knocked over, and the other bolted. Then we went to look at the man in the road; he wur a greaser too. He had been shot dead. 'I wonder what they shot him for?' says I. 'Maybe it is a private quarrel; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> struck it rich, and has got a lot of gold in his belt. We may as well look; it is no use leaving it for that skunk that bolted to come back for.' He had got about twenty ounces in his belt, and we shifted it into our bag, and were just going on when 'Zekel--that is one of my mates--said, 'I know this cuss, Dave; it's the chap that lived in that village close to where we were working six months ago; they said he had been fossicking all over Arizona, and that {{he was the only one}} who ever came back out of a party who went to locate a wonderful rich spot it was said he knew of.|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between Levinas and Kierkegaard is controversial. In his writings, especially Difficult Freedom and Proper Names, the former strongly criticizes the latter: he {{goes against the}} submission of ethics to religion of Fear and Trembling and the view of subjectivity coming out from the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Singularity and relation to God are then the principal points of collision between the two philosophers. Since Kierkegaard, for chronological reasons, has never replied to Levinas, one only knows {{the opinion of the}} latter. One will never know what the former would have said on his own behalf. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> exacerbated the debate or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> tried to solve it. Perhaps <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> done both with two different pseudonyms, ironically making a fool of Levinas...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just a fancy of mine, gal, such a fancy as {{comes into}} {{the head of a}} man at the last. When you get back send Luke here. It is late and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone to bed, but tell him I must speak to him. And now, goodby, Polly. God bless you! I don't know as I hasn't been wrong about all this business, but it didn't seem so to me afore. Just try and think that, will you, when you hear about it. I thought as I was a-acting {{for the good of the}} men." ...|$|R
50|$|In the film, Manjunath {{is shown}} {{watching}} {{what happens after}} he dies. He is starting to {{feel that it is}} all pointless. He cannot watch his parents' tears any more: What was their fault? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> should <b>have</b> compromised. But how can people not see what <b>he</b> <b>has?</b> What <b>he</b> fought was something very big and very important.|$|R
