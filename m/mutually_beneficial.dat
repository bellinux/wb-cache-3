5|$|Although spiders are {{generally}} regarded as predatory, the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90% of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias {{as part of a}} <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship with a species of ant.|$|E
5|$|Such exchanges can be <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial.</b> For instance, 23 to 28 {{percent of}} all {{physicians}} in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada received their training at medical schools outside {{of the country in}} which they currently practice.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} involves mediation among {{a range of}} self-interested stakeholders engaged {{in the production of}} the built environment. Such mediation can encourage a joint search for <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> outcomes or integrative development. Integrative development aims to produce sustainable solutions by increasing stakeholder satisfaction with the process and with the resulting urban development.|$|E
5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> {{association between}} individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} grow {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), {{but it has also}} been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} of his posting, Clarke {{had to deal with}} issues {{regarding}} land and labour. The latter was of major significance at this time in Southern Rhodesia. In response to questioning by the African Association and the Manchester Society for the Protection of Native Races, Chamberlain in 1898 responded that forced labour was not permitted. A year later, Chamberlain was concerned by a chief native commissioner instructing chiefs at an indaba that it was their duty to supply labour. Clarke's subsequent report accused officials of the administration of requisitioning labour by 'pressure only short of force', causing 'discontent amongst the natives'. Clarke's view was that a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship between capital and labour was possible through market forces alone, without additional pressure. Chamberlain agreed, although Milner was in favour of compulsory labour even to the extent of 'recommending the corvée'.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E
5|$|Vedic Brahminism {{was popular}} in the 6th and 7th centuries when {{inscriptions}} refer to grants made to Srotriya Brahmins. These inscriptions also describe the gotra (lineage) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as asvamedha (horse sacrifice) and hiranyagarbha. Brahmins and kings enjoyed a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship; rituals performed by the brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society {{to the level of}} wealthy landowners. Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause. Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the Narayanaswami temples at Nanjangud, Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district. The deity Vishnu was depicted with four arms holding a conch (sanka), discus (cakra), mace (gada) and lotus (padma).|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Amanita species, A.bisporigera {{is thought to}} form {{mycorrhizal}} relationships with trees. This is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and giving the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Fruit bodies of Amanita bisporigera are found on the ground growing either solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests; they tend to appear during summer and early fall. The fruit bodies are commonly found near oak, but {{have been reported in}} birch-aspen areas in the west. It is most commonly found in eastern North America, and rare in western North America. It is widely distributed in Canada, and its range extends south to Mexico. The species has also been found in Colombia, where it may have been introduced from trees exported for use in pine plantations.|$|E
5|$|Like other Lactarius species, L.repraesentaneus {{is thought}} to form {{mycorrhizal}} relationships with trees. This is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, forming a sheath of tissue. This enables the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affords the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The fruit bodies of L.repraesentaneus are found scattered or in groups on the ground under spruce from August to September. The fungus is distributed in higher elevations in the northern USA and southern Canada where spruce is present. It has also been reported from Alaska, California, and the Rocky Mountains. The frequency of its appearance is described as occasional to fairly common. In Europe, where it is fairly rare, it is found mainly underneath sallows (Salix capraea) in forests {{at the foot of}} mountains on non-calcareous soil. It has been collected in Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, the French Alps and England; overall, it is widely distributed throughout the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. The fungus has also been collected under birch (B.pubescens, B.nana, and B.glandulosa) in Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests {{on the underside of}} leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} A.abrupta grow on the ground, {{typically}} solitary, in mixed conifer and deciduous forests, usually during autumn. The {{frequency with which}} fruit bodies appear depends on several factors, such as season, location, temperature, and rainfall. The mushroom {{has been described as}} common in the Southeastern United States; in Texas, it has been called both infrequent, and common in the Big Thicket National Preserve. Like most other Amanita species, A.abrupta is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Amanita abrupta is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, where it has been found as far north as Quebec, Canada, and as far south as Mexico. Orson K. Miller claims to have found it in the Dominican Republic where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with pine trees. Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both hardwoods and conifers, while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as beech, birch, fir, tsuga, oak, and poplar. However, A.abrupta has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with Virginia Pine.|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E
25|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} {{evolved from}} a parasitic interaction that developed into a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship.|$|E
25|$|This <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> relationship, {{characterized}} {{as one of}} the most successful and influential business partnerships in the early American West, endured until 1963.|$|E
25|$|The earthballs (Scleroderma species), dyeballs (Pisolithus species), {{and many}} false {{truffles}} are ectomycorrhizal, forming a <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> {{relationship with the}} roots of living trees.|$|E
25|$|This is {{also called}} <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> {{cooperation}} as both actor and recipient depend on direct fitness benefits, which are {{broken down into}} two different types: by-product benefit and enforcement.|$|E
25|$|Enforcement {{can also}} be <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial,</b> and is often called {{reciprocal}} cooperation because the act of cooperation is preferentially directed at individuals who have helped the actor in the past (directly), or helped those who have helped the actor in the past (indirectly).|$|E
25|$|The United States and China {{affirm that}} both {{countries}} will, based on common interest, promote more extensive economic cooperation, from a strategic, long-term, and overarching perspective, {{to work together}} to build a comprehensive and <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> economic partnership, add to prosperity and welfare in the two countries, and achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth of the world economy.|$|E
25|$|SEACAT is a {{means of}} {{contributing}} to the capabilities of our friends and allies. The security of all waterways is vital to peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, and we applaud the ongoing efforts of regional nations in combating maritime threats. Additionally, we feel that personal relationships built during these types of opportunities are <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both China and Africa {{proclaim}} a new, <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> economic, political, {{and regional}} alliance.

25|$|McKay {{enjoyed a}} long, {{personal}} friendship with John F. Fitzpatrick, {{publisher of the}} Salt Lake Tribune (1924–1960). They met weekly for breakfast to discuss the betterment of Utah. Fitzpatrick organized of the Newspaper Agency Corporation, a joint operating agreement between the Salt Lake Tribune (Kearns Corporation) and the church-owned Deseret News, and consulted extensively with McKay to form this <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> business in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Elric (along with Stormbringer) {{was listed}} in the first {{printing}} of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) Deities & Demigods rule book. However, Chaosium already had a role playing series in the works based on Elric & Stormbringer and the initial AD printing was not fully authorised. A <b>mutually</b> <b>beneficial</b> deal was worked out between Chaosium and TSR, yet TSR chose to remove Elric from later printings of Deities & Demigods.|$|E
