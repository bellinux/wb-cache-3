25|$|Sheriffs in Kentucky {{are elected}} for {{four-year}} terms {{and are not}} term limited. Kentucky sheriffs are not the chief law enforcement officials of their respective counties.

In addition, sheriffs in Kentucky are responsible for court security, serving court papers and transporting prisoners. They are also responsible for collecting taxes on real estate and tangible property. Also, Kentucky law states that only the county coroner, also an elected peace officer, can serve the sitting sheriff with a state criminal court process or place him/her under arrest (any peace officer, however, can arrest the coroner).|$|E
