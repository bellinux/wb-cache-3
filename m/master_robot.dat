40|$|Applications like robots {{which are}} {{employed}} for shopping, porter services, assistive robotics, etc., require a robot to continuously follow a human or another robot. This paper presents a mobile robot following another tele-operated mobile robot {{based on a}} PID (Proportional–Integral-Differential) controller. Here, we use two differential wheel drive robots; one is a <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> {{and the other is}} a follower robot. The <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> is manually controlled and the follower robot is programmed to follow the <b>master</b> <b>robot.</b> For the <b>master</b> <b>robot,</b> a Bluetooth module receives the user’s command from an android application which is processed by the master robot’s controller, which is used to move the robot. The follower robot receives the image from the Kinect sensor mounted on it and recognizes the <b>master</b> <b>robot.</b> The follower robot identifies the x, y positions by employing the camera and the depth by using the Kinect depth sensor. By identifying the x, y, and z locations of the <b>master</b> <b>robot,</b> the follower robot finds the angle and distance between the master and follower robot, which is given as the error term of a PID controller. Using this, the follower robot follows the <b>master</b> <b>robot.</b> A PID controller is based on feedback and tries to minimize the error. Experiments are conducted for two indigenously developed robots; one depicting a humanoid and the other a small mobile robot. It was observed that the follower robot was easily able to follow the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> using well-tuned PID parameters...|$|E

This controller is designed so the dynamic behaviors of the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> and the slave robot are functions of each other. This paper first describes the!". e functions, which the designer chooses based upon the application, and then proposes a control architecture to achieve these functions. To guarantee that the specified functions and proposed architecture govern the system behavior, H (X) control theory and model reduc-tion techniques are used. Several experiments were conducted to verify the theoretical derivadons. This control method is unique, {{because it does not}} require any transfer of either position or velocity information between the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> and the slave robot; it only requires the transfer of forces. Although this property leads to a wider communication bandwidth between the master and slave robots, the entire system may still sufTer from a positional error buildup between the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> and slave ~fs environmen...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 36 - 38). This is multi swarm optimization robot where present one <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> and other robots thosefollow the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> called coordinator robots. Here <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> transmits signal and follower robots receive that signal and get optimized. By optimization there arises group working concept among the coordinator or follower robots. Then they follow the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> until it working. Hence here use an optical sensor for localization. In this multi swarm optimization process xbee is used for communication among the robots. Moreover, xbee is used for its high range of distance capacity in communication. By this project, optimization way is developed. All coordinator robots work as optimized way. As robots follow and maintain a constant distant, they can carry also heaviest things and this type of work can help our daily life also. Moreover, multiswarm optimization robotics {{is based on the}} use of local rules, and simple robots compared to the complexity of the task to achieve, and inspired by social insects. Large number of simple robots can perform complex tasks in a more efficient way than a single robot, giving robustness and flexibility to the group. In this paper, an overview of multi swarm optimized robotics is given, describing its main properties and characteristics and comparing it to general multi-robotic systems.

Observability of this master-salve system is theoretically analyzed. The conditions of slave robot trajectory under which observability is guaranteed are evaluated by a slave robot in real-time. The slave takes appropriate action to control its heading to achieve observability if observability is lost on the current trajectory.

In a subclass of telefunctioning called telepresence, all of the relationships between the master and the slave are specified as unity so that all of the master and slave variables (e. g., position and velocity) are dynamically equal. To create telefunctioning, a minimum number of functions relating the robots' variables is identified.

40|$|Specific {{issues of}} force-reflected telemanipulating systems are {{addressed}} in this article. Our approach that might be used in robotic assisted surgery is based on combination {{of the best and}} complementary characteristics of a human operator and of a robot.

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} {{autonomous}} and collaborative behaviour of robots through communications, {{which could be}} useful in battlefield or emergency situations. At present, roadside bombings in Iraq mostly involve the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). The current scenario of IED clearance and disposal are by using remote-controlled operational robots to search and defuse the IED. In {{the event of a}} pre-detonation or error in defusing, a highly functional robot is lost. This project hopes to reduce cost and display a proof of concept, where complementary capabilities amongst robots could assist in completing a task or mission. To demonstrate the implementation of autonomous and collaborative behaviour, a pair of autonomous robots was built. The advantage of designing a pair of robots rather than a single robot was because it is cost-effective in the long-run. The <b>Master</b> <b>robot,</b> serving as a full featured robot would be fully operational whereas the sacrificial robot could be made at low-cost with minimal features. The robotics platform for prototyping these robots was Lego Mindstorms NXT 2. 0. The simulation of a search and destroy of IEDs using robots was prototyped. The scenario was to locate and destroy an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). The <b>Master</b> <b>robot</b> will search for the IED in a simulated environment, which is divided into four different colour zones for the purpose of localisation. Once the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> has found the IED, it will inform the sacrificial robot of the zone where the IED was found. Subsequently, the sacrificial robot would go to the destination to locate the IED at the specified zone. Once the sacrificial robot has found the IED, it is assumed the IED is destroyed. This scenario reflects how the robots would likely be used in Iraq or an urban war zone...|$|E

40|$|A {{challenging}} problem presently {{being addressed}} by the Department of Energy (DOE) is the extraction of large volumes of hazardous waste from underground waste storage facilities. The nature of the material {{requires the use of}} robotic and teleoperated systems. Furthermore, the constraints of the storage tanks require the use of long reach manipulators. These robots are characterized by their large workspace and reduced mass. Unfortunately, this reduction in mass increases structural compliance, making these robots susceptible to vibration. Until recently, no attempt has been made to provide the operator any type of force reflection due to the compliance of the slave robot. This paper addresses the control of bilateral teleoperation systems that use long-reach, flexible manipulators. Analysis and experiments show that the compliance of the slave robot directly affects the stability of the teleoperation system. This study suggests that this may be controlled by increasing the damping on the <b>master</b> <b>robot.</b> However, this increase in target damping increases the energy an operator must exert during the execution of a task. A new teleoperation strategy adapts the target impedance of the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> to variations in the identified impedance of the remote environment coupled to the slave robot. Experiments show increased performance due to a decrease in the energy the operator must provide during task execution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a controller design framework for a telerobotic {{system in which}} the dynamic behaviors of the <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> and the slave robot are functions of each other. These functions, which are set by the designer based upon the application, are described. 1. Telerobotic Performance Specifications A telerobotic system (Figure 1) consists of a <b>master</b> <b>robot</b> and a slave robot. One may want the dynamic behavior in which the operator perceives scaled-down values of forces that the slave robot perceives when maneuvering an object. Therefore, a controller must be designed such that the ratio of the forces on the slave to the forces on the master equals a number greater than unity. If fm and f 5 represent the forces on the master and on the slave, then the desired relationship will be fs =- cx fm, where a is a scalar greater than unity. (The negative sign, originating from the convention used in Figure 1, implies the opposite directions of fs and fm.) In another example, suppose the slave is holding pneumatic jackhammer, the objective may be to both attenuate and filter the jackhammer forces so, the human operator perceives only the low-frequency scaled-down components of the forces that the slave perceives. This means a low-pass filter-equivalen...|$|E
