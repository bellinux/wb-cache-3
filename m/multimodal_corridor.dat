40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes four pricing {{models for}} a <b>multimodal</b> <b>corridor</b> {{transportation}} system with trip-chain costs. The transportation system comprises a subway parallel to a bottleneck-constrained highway between a residential {{area and a}} workplace. Commuters can get their destination by either auto mode or transit mode only; besides these, they can first drive to the bottleneck, park there and then take subway to the destination. The solutions of these four models correspond to the hierarchical logit-based stochastic equilibria among travel costs and trip benefits with different optimization objectives. It is shown that when transit and park-and-ride place are operated by government and parking lot at working area belongs to the private enterprise, lower transit fares and higher parking fee in the central area can effectively encourage P&R mode choice, increase transit attraction and maximize the total net benefit of the system. Numerical results support the on-going differentiated parking charge policy in Beijing...|$|E
40|$|Frequently, urban {{transportation}} {{infrastructure and services}} are operated in a suboptimal manner with respect to key policy objectives such as enhancing mobility, avoiding severe congestion, improving public transit ridership, reducing fuel consumption, and emisions. To overcome this problem, a hybrid simulation-optimization methodology was developed for identification of values of demand management variables that result in the most favorable travel condition in a <b>multimodal</b> <b>corridor</b> regarding a policy objective. This methodology was applied to a bus rapid transit-based major travel corridor in Ottawa (Canada). The travel simulation part of the model is implemented within the EMME/ 2 modeling framework, supported by a transitway simulation technique. The optimization part of the methodology is based on direct search method that identifies the optimal values of key demand management variables for policy responsiveness. Optimization results are presented for bus modal split, in-vehicle travel time, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emission...|$|E

30|$|In {{the study}} area, the railroads run {{parallel}} to the primary roads, thus the distribution of wildfires along the railroad buffer zones are similar to that observed for the roads. Thus, such analysis does not explain the interaction of railroads with wildfires accurately. To evaluate the effect of railroads, the study region was divided in quadrats, and the wildfire events per unit length of the railroad and roads were computed. The results, excluding the quadrats with small railroad lengths, show that there are 30  % more wildfire events in the <b>multimodal</b> transportation <b>corridors</b> than the road corridors alone, as shown in Fig.  4 b. Note that, the presence of railroads leads to 30  % higher wildfire events, but the fires due to railroads is only 0.53  %. This is because, the length of railroads are significantly {{lower than that of}} the roads. The European Commission report (EC 2012) suggests that the additional fires due to railroads are expected due to sparks emitted by train brakes, fall of catenaries, or linked to the operations of the trains, such as smoking by railway employees or passengers.|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} {{transportation planning}} models, {{it was always}} assumed that the population density is given and fixed in the study areas. Therefore, the effects of population density on travel choice have not been explicitly incorporated into these existing models for long-term transportation planning. Meanwhile, travel choice models in previous studies are usually developed by using discrete choice theories or user equilibrium principle. Thus, many significant characteristics of travelers' behaviors, such as risk preference and learning process over time, cannot be considered in these conventional models. This article proposes a convex prospect theory-based model to investigate the effects of population density on the travelers' mode-choice behavior under an advanced transportation information system (ATIS) in a <b>multimodal</b> transportation <b>corridor.</b> It is shown that population density is closely co-related to the modal split results and dependent {{on the performance of}} the railway mode in the study corridor. The park-and-ride mode may not be suitable for areas with high population density. This article also investigates the travelers' reference points on the generalized travel costs by modes. A numerical example is given to illustrate the properties of the proposed model together with some insightful findings. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Bluetooth {{technology}} applications {{have improved}} travel time data collection efforts and allowed for collection of large data sets {{at a low}} cost per data unit. Mean travel times between pairs of points are available, but the primary value of this technique is {{the availability of the}} entire distribution of travel times throughout multiple days and time periods, allowing for a greater understanding of travel time variations and reliability. The use of these data for transportation planning, engineering and operations continues to expand. Previous applications of similar data sources have included travel demand and simulation model validation, work zone traffic patterns, transit ridership and reliability, pedestrian movement patterns, and before-after studies of transportation improvements. This thesis investigates the collection and analysis of Bluetooth-enabled travel time data along a <b>multimodal</b> arterial <b>corridor</b> in San Luis Obispo, California. Five BlueMAC devices collected multimodal travel time data in January and February 2016 along Los Osos Valley Road. These datasets were used to identify and process known sources of error such as occasions where vehicles using the roadway turn off and make an intermediate stop and multiple reads from the same vehicle; quantify travel time performance and reliability along arterial streets; and compare transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facility performance. Additionally, a travel time model was estimated based on segment characteristics and Bluetooth data to estimate average speeds and travel time distributions...|$|R
40|$|The four papers {{featured}} in this report were presented at a policy forum on the University of Delaware campus in 2007. The dynamics and productivity of the Northeast Corridor (NEC) are recognized as key drivers of the United States’ economy {{as well as for}} the eastern part of the nation. Especially important, in this context, is the capacity of the NEC’s multimodal transportation system to efficiently move people and freight into, around, and out of the Corridor. This is especially important for its central portion linking Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D. C. The papers that follow are written as part of a project undertaken by the University of Delaware’s Institute of Public Administration that focuses on the factors that will influence the likely attributes of the transportation infrastructure for moving people and freight into, around, and out of the NEC in 2025.

40|$|Truck {{operations}} have recently {{become an important}} focus of academic research not only because road freight transport is {{a key part of}} logistics, but because trucks are usually associated with negative externalities including pollution, congestion and traffic accidents. While the negative environmental impacts of truck activities have been extensively analyzed, comparatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the role of trucks in road accidents. A review of the literature identifies various truck-traffic safety related issues: frequency of accidents and their determinants; risk factors associated with truck driver behavior (including cell phone use, fatigue, alcohol and drugs consumption); truck characteristics and facilities (roadway types, specific lanes and electronic stability programs) to improve performance of vehicle maneuvering; and the safety characteristics of heavy and large trucks. However, to date, there seems to have been developed few studies evaluating the complex coexistence of trucks and cars on roads and that may support the implementation of differential road safety strategies applied to them. This paper focuses on the impact on the traffic fatalities rate of the interaction between trucks and cars on roads. We also assess the efficiency of two stricter road safety regulations for trucks, as yet not harmonized in the European Union; namely, speed limits and maximum blood alcohol concentration rates. For this, econometric models have been developed from a panel data set for European Union during the years 1999 ? 2010. Our findings show that rising motorization rates for trucks lead to higher traffic fatalities, while rising motorization rates for cars do not. Furthermore, we also find that lower maximum speed limits for trucks are effective and maximum blood alcohol concentration rates for professional drivers are only effective when they are strictly set to zero. Therefore, our results point to that the differential treatment of trucks is not only adequate for mitigating an important source of congestion and pollution, but that the implementation of stricter road safety measures in European countries for the case of trucks also contributes significantly to reducing fatalities. In summary, and as a counterpoint to the negative impact of trucks on road traffic accidents, we conclude the effectiveness of efforts made in road safety policy (based on specific traffic regulations by vehicle type imposed by member States) to counteract the safety externalities of freight transportation in the European Union. In certain sense, our study might provide indirect support to public policies implemented at the macro European level to promote <b>multimodal</b> transport <b>corridors.</b> In this respect, there is an increasing focus at the European level on how freight transport can be moved from trucks on roads to more environmentally-sustainable modes, such as rail and ship...|$|R
40|$|The {{inland waters}} of Ghana have a {{considerable}} {{potential for the}} operation of inland water transport (IWT) services. These services {{could be part of}} a <b>multimodal</b> transport <b>corridor,</b> to connect the northern regions and the northern landlocked countries with the industrial southern part of the country, which also includes the port of Tema, one of the gateways of the landlocked countries. However, despite the many advantages of IWT, these waters are currently barely used for freight transportation. The absence of a high quality IWT service is mainly unfortunate, as Ghana suffers from the consequences of the unilateral road transport market: the many trucks leads to congestions, traffic hazards and long (and unreliable) transport times. Besides this, the freight transportation by road is rather expensive. An IWT service on the Ghanaian inland waters could be able to improve the cost and time performances of the Ghanaian transit corridor. The Ghanaian inland waters are mainly formed by Lake Volta and the upstream Volta Rivers. The water levels of these waters are subject to the local climate, which results in (very) low water levels during the dry season (from November to July). The water levels of Lake Volta allow year round navigation, but that does not hold for the Volta Rivers. In fact, Buipe Port, along the Black Volta, is probably the most upstream location that can be reached for most part of the year, while a year round accessibility can be guaranteed after dredging a shoal, a bit downstream of the port. The potential container market for the IWT service is quite small, being about 8, 000 TEUs per year. Nearly all these containers are currently transported by road from Tema Port to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Due to the congestions and (bad) conditions of roads and trucks, the northbound journey (about 1, 000 km) takes about four days. The corresponding price for transport is also very high, being about USD 2, 600 for a 20 ft. container. The only commercial IWT service at Lake Volta, is not able to deliver better performances, due to bad and inappropriate equipment. The feasibility of three different IWT services is investigated: roll-on/roll-off of truck/trailer combinations or roll trailers on the one hand, and lift-on/lift-off of containers on the other hand. All the alternatives are based on the concept of barges being pushed by push tugs, as this is the most promising concept from a financial point of view. It can be concluded that the potential transit container market of 8, 000 TEU/year, for which the IWT service has to compete for, is too small to result in a profitable service. However, when relocating the transit traffic (clearance) procedures from Tema Port to Buipe Port, the yearly container throughput via Lake Volta will be much higher, making an IWT service viable and profitable. Besides, this relocation will result in extra space in the port of Tema, and can result in more efficient clearance procedures, thereby decreasing the total door-to-door time of transit traffic. <br/...|$|R
3000|$|However, {{the above}} {{approaches}} only work when the pedestrian is moving within a building with relatively small rooms or corridors, as explained in [12]. With {{the use of}} known building layouts to constrain the error in these approaches, particles are being given extremely low weight {{when they try to}} cross a wall in the map, and this process helps to constrain the particles to walkable areas. However, during the estimation process it may happen that the particle cloud is split into two or more modes due to a wall--so they enter two different rooms. If the room size differs, then the bigger room has the advantage that particles will not run into walls as often as inside the smaller room. For example, let us now consider the two competing groups (modes or [...] "clouds") of particles, one in an unconstrained area (e.g., a very large room or even outside the building) and one in an area with strong constraints such as walls, and that the second group is actually close to the pedestrian's true location and following her track. Both groups of particles will generally follow the relative motion of the person but the second group of particles will suffer a significant reduction in its population--those of its members that explore the entire PDR error state space but run into walls. The first group, however, will suffer no such losses and eventually dominate, in particular as a result of resampling. This kind of failure is probably relatively unlikely in typical indoor scenarios because the first (erroneous) cloud--if such a cloud exists at all, which can sometimes be the case--will more often run into a wall before it has a chance to dominate the particle population. However, in a long-term usage scenario {{it is only a matter}} of time before such events may occur, resulting in very large and probably permanent position errors until a second source of location can be obtained (e.g., GNSS, wireless localization). An example is when a pedestrian is walking in areas that exhibit very differently sized rooms and structures (such as a conference center) and our indoor/outdoor example (see Section 2.1) could be replicated in a situation where a large conference hall is close to more constraining rooms and <b>corridors.</b> <b>Multimodal</b> situations arise when a person walks past a door at an angle and a certain fraction of the particles walk through the door as well. We have also observed it occasionally in practice when a cloud of particles followed the user's path into a building but not all particles went through the door or were eliminated directly by the building walls.|$|R
