She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family.

The album's final tracks are Smith's [...] "Somalia" [...] and an acoustic rendition of [...] "Yellow" [...] (2000) by Coldplay. Turlington said of [...] "Somalia": Patti told <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wrote this song years ago, after seeing a segment {{on the news}} in which a child literally died {{in the arms of}} its mother. That memory was still very present to her in 2011 during the crisis in the Horn of Africa, so she thought, [...] "If I could give this mother what I have — fruit on the trees, a healthy child — I would."

After Duchess Friederike's death, the family left Leineschloss for Herrenhausen, sometimes called a [...] "miniature Versailles".

500|$|Two Swedish {{models were}} {{cast as the}} Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams.

Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because [...] "she was elegant and beautiful {{that it seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was the perfect Bond girl". When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for The Man with the Golden Gun, she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role, as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's [...] "generous looks" [...] made her a good contrast to Adams. Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on Diamonds Are Forever, to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga {{at the start of the}} film, because he found it an interesting idea to [...] "put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand".|$|E
