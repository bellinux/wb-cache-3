5|$|Following Mangini's departure, New York {{hoped to}} lure former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher out of retirement, {{suggesting}} that Cowher might be given control of football operations {{in addition to}} serving as coach. However, Cowher decided to remain retired for the season. On January 20, 2009, the Jets offered the position to Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, who accepted. Tannenbaum engineered a draft-day trade with Cleveland, which enabled New York to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> select highly regarded USC quarterback Mark Sanchez.|$|E
5|$|Of the two {{theories}} on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the older is the Norwegian Cyclone Model, developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones develop as they <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> along a frontal boundary, eventually occluding and reaching a barotropically cold environment. It was developed completely from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries. This theory still retains merit, {{as it is}} a good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E
25|$|Particles of the E Ring tend to {{accumulate}} on moons that orbit within it. The equator {{of the leading}} hemisphere of Tethys is tinted slightly blue due to infalling material.

25|$|Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) {{and similar}} methods take {{advantage}} of this kind of logic but uses more sophisticated statistics, because component genes in real processes display more complex behavior than simply moving up or down as a group, and the amount the genes <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down is meaningful, not just the direction. In any case, these statistics measure how different the behavior of some small set of genes is compared to genes not in that small set.|$|E
25|$|Noise {{barriers}} {{force the}} pollution plumes {{coming from the}} road to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> over the barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical dispersion of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the noise barrier force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly turbulent shear zone characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created {{in the lee of}} the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.|$|E

25|$|TRE made {{a number}} of minor {{suggestions}} and upgrades, and placed an order for 2,900 of these SCR-720B's under the name AI Mk. X. However, Western Electric had been concentrating on the SCR-520 for mounting in the P-61 Black Widow, an enormous purpose-designed night fighter large enough to carry it. By this time the P-61 was greatly delayed and the USAAF had begun using Beaufighters and Mosquitoes for their own needs. This led to demands by both the USAAF and RAF for the SCR-720 production to <b>move</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> Western Electric responded by stating initial units would be available in May 1943, with production quantities available in August.|$|E

25|$|Most mesopelagic fish make daily {{vertical}} migrations, {{moving at}} night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, {{and returning to}} the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances, and are undertaken {{with the assistance of}} a swimbladder. The swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to <b>move</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and,</b> given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between 10 and 20Â°C, thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.|$|E
25|$|Weaving is the {{technique}} of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down a range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique means more than two bells can be rung in short succession, using the table to damp and free the hand {{to pick up the}} next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often reach across his or her body for the next bell.|$|E
25|$|After a solid 9â€“6 {{performance}} in January 2008, {{in the following}} tournament he produced his best-ever top-division result, a 12â€“3 score from the rank of maegashira 5, which earned him joint runner-up honours and his second Fighting Spirit prize. However, in the May 2008 tournament he could only manage three wins from the maegashira 1 ranking. Demoted to maegashira 10 for July, he struggled again, winning only five bouts. He was disqualified from his final match against Kimurayama after his was judged to have pulled his opponent's topknot, which is a kinjite, or foul. Kokkai maintained it was accidental as the tape on his fingers had stuck to Kimurayama's hair. He continued to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the maegashira rankings in 2009, alternating between 8â€“7 and 5â€“10 records.|$|E

25|$|Fishery {{scientists}} {{of the late}} 19th century believed that successful spawning was the most significant factor in the productivity of fisheries, and the Fish Commission had placed the fisheries research ship USFC Fish Hawk in service in 1880 {{to serve as a}} floating fish hatchery that could <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the coast in accordance with the timing of American shad runs. Grampus was constructed to fill a need the Fish Commission perceived for a ship with a well in which marine fishes could be kept alive and transported from the fishing grounds to fish hatcheries on the coast of the United States, where fisheries researchers could collect their eggs for use in the hatcheries and further ensure productive fisheries. Grampus also was to bring back fish for biological study of the fish themselves.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Coast League {{plays by}} the same rules listed in the Official Baseball Rules {{published}} by Major League Baseball. One exception {{is the use of}} Designated hitter (DH). Whereas the application of the DH rule in Major League Baseball is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams, PCL pitchers hit when both clubs are National League affiliates and they have agreed to have their pitchers hit. Two National League affiliated clubs may agree to use the DH instead. The {{reason for this is that}} as players <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> get closer to reaching the majors, teams prefer to have the rules follow (as closely as possible) those of the major leagues. The DH is always used when one or both teams are American League affiliates.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low-power}} engines {{have been}} built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. A displacer type stirling engine has one piston and one displacer. A temperature difference is required between {{the top and bottom}} of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the low-temperature difference (LTD) stirling engine, the temperature difference between one's hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The power piston in the displacer type stirling engine is tightly sealed and is controlled to <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down as the gas inside expands. The displacer, on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The displacer moves up and down to control the heating and cooling of the gas in the engine.|$|E
