40|$|Clp ATPases are {{powerful}} ring shaped nanomachines which {{participate in the}} degradation pathway of the protein quality control system, coupling the energy from ATP hydrolysis to threading substrate proteins (SP) through their narrow central pore. Repetitive cycles of sequential intra-ring ATP hydrolysis events induce axial excursions of diaphragm-forming central pore loops that effect the application of mechanical forces onto SPs to promote unfolding and translocation. We perform Langevin dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model of the ClpY ATPase-SP system to elucidate the molecular details of unfolding and translocation of an α/β model protein. We contrast this mechanism with our previous studies which used an all-α SP. We find conserved aspects of unfolding and translocation mechanisms by allosteric ClpY, including unfolding initiated at the tagged C-terminus and translocation via a power stroke mechanism. Topology-specific aspects include the time scales, the rate limiting steps in the degradation pathway, the effect of force directionality, and the translocase efficacy. Mechanisms of ClpY-assisted unfolding and translocation are distinct from those resulting from non-allosteric <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling.</b> Bulk unfolding simulations, which mimic Atomic Force Microscopy-type pulling, reveal multiple unfolding pathways initiated at the C-terminus, N-terminus, or simultaneously from both termini. In a non-allosteric ClpY ATPase pore, <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling</b> with constant velocity yields larger effective forces for SP unfolding, while pulling with constant force results in simultaneous unfolding and translocation...|$|R

Using the movable nanoelectrodes in a mechanically controlled break-junction at low temperature, currentâ€“voltage measurements at cryogenic temperatures support the hypothesized switching mechanism based on the spin-crossover behavior.

40|$|SummaryNotch {{signaling}} {{induced by}} cell surface ligands {{is critical to}} development and maintenance of many eukaryotic organisms. Notch and its ligands are integral membrane proteins that facilitate direct cell-cell interactions to activate Notch proteolysis and release the intracellular domain that directs Notch-specific cellular responses. Genetic studies suggest that Notch ligands require endocytosis, ubiquitylation, and epsin endocytic adaptors to activate signaling, but the exact role of ligand endocytosis remains unresolved. Here we characterize a molecularly distinct mode of clathrin-mediated endocytosis requiring ligand ubiquitylation, epsins, and actin for ligand cells to activate signaling in Notch cells. Using a cell-bead optical tweezers system, we obtained evidence for cell-mediated mechanical force dependent on this distinct mode of ligand endocytosis. We propose that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling</b> force produced by endocytosis of Notch-bound ligand drives conformational changes in Notch that permit activating proteolysis.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{critique}} and {{extension of the}} mean-field approach to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling</b> transition in bound polymer systems. Our model is motivated by the theoretically and experimentally important examples of adsorbed polymers and double-stranded DNA, and {{we focus on the}} case in which quenched disorder in the sequence of monomers is unimportant for the statistical mechanics. We show how including excluded volume interactions in the model affects the phase diagram for the critical pulling force, and we predict a re-entrancy phase at low temperatures which has not been previously discussed. We also consider the case of non-equilibrium pulling, in which the external force probes the local, rather than the global structure of the dsDNA or adsorbed polymer. The dynamics of the pulling transition in such experiments could illuminate the polymer's loop structure, which depends on the nature of excluded volume interactions.
