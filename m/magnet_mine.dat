The Little Long Lac Mine (1934-1953) produced 605,449 ounces of gold, besides producing scheelite. J.M. Wood and W.T. Brown developed the Sturgeon River Gold Mine (1936-1942), which produced 73,438 ounces of gold. James and Russell Cryderman found and Karl Springer incorporated {{what became known as}} the Leitch Gold Mine (1936-1968), which produced 861,982 ounces of gold from 0.92 grade ore. The Bankfield Gold Mines produced 66,416 ounces by 1942. Tomball Mines (1938-1942), started by Tom and Bill Johnson, produced 69,416 ounces. The <b>Magnet</b> <b>Mine</b> (1938-1942) produced 152,089 ounces. The Hard Rock Mine (1938-1951) produced 269,081 ounces, while the MacLeod-Cockshutt (1938-1970) produced 1,516,980 ounces.|$|E
50|$|The {{areas of}} Corinna - Long Plains, {{as well as}} the Savage, Donaldson and Whyte rivers were {{important}} early goldfields, exploited since the 1870s, and Tasmania's two largest gold nuggets, of 7.6 and 4.4 kg, were found near the confluence of the Whyte and Rocky rivers. Tin mining was prominent in both the Mt Bischoff - Waratah area starting in the 1870s, {{as well as the}} Meredith Range - Stanley River - Wilson River area. The Mt. Bischoff mine in Waratah was in its heyday one of the richest tin deposits in the world. From the 1880s onwards, osmiridium was extensively mined in many creeks and rivers in the catchments of the Savage, Haezlewood and Wilson rivers, and particularly the Bald Hill area. Tin, copper and tungsten were mined at Balfour, and the <b>Magnet</b> <b>mine</b> was exploited for silver since the 1890s, and continues to be an important amateur fossicking area for mineral specimens to this day.|$|E
50|$|The coating was {{a barrier}} that {{prevented}} direct contact of magnetic mines with metal surfaces of vehicles The magnetostatic field decreases very rapidly, with the cube of distance; the non-magnetic coating holds the <b>magnet</b> of the <b>mine</b> {{too far from the}} steel of the vehicle for it to adhere. The coating was normally ridged to increase overall thickness, the high points on the pattern increasing the average thickness without adding more weight.|$|R
40|$|The modal {{analysis}} of a superconducting magnet subsystem designed by General Atomics (GA) has been performed to determine the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. GA subsystem {{is a part of}} ALISS (Advanced Lightweight Influence Sweep System), which uses a superconducting <b>magnet</b> for magnetic <b>mine</b> sweeping. Any resonance condition must be avoided in an operational environment to ensure the no-quenching in the subsystem.

50|$|Magnetic {{separation}} {{is a process}} in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a <b>magnet.</b> In <b>mines</b> where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite, such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores. At these mines a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844-1906)1 was used. In this machine the raw ore, after calcination was fed onto a moving belt which passed underneath two pairs of electromagnets under which further belts ran at right angles to the feed belt. The first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day.This process of separating magnetic substances from the non-magnetic substances in a mixture {{with the help of a}} magnet is called magnetic separation..|$|R
40|$|THE name bellite was {{introduced}} by W. F. Petterd (1905) for a 'chromo-arsenate of lead' from the <b>Magnet</b> <b>mine,</b> Russell County, Tasma-nia. The mineral was described as occurring as delicate tufts and velvet-like coated surfaces thickly lining and clustering in drusy cavities in somewhat soft iron-manganese gossan, as well as bright red to crimson hexagonal crystals up to three millimetres in length. A chemical analysis reported by Pettered is shown in Table 1. In the seventh edition of Dana's System of Mineralogy (Palache etal., 1951) bellite is regarded as being 'identical with or near mime-rite', based on an examination which showed that the interracial angles of crystals were close t...|$|E

"In your eyes, I mean, {{and those}} of Pathfinder; {{not in the least}} in <b>mine,</b> <b>Magnet.</b> Now you might set me down out yonder, {{in the middle of this}} bit of a pond, and that, too, in the darkest night that ever fell from the heavens, and in the {{smallest}} canoe, and I could tell you it was only a lake. For that matter, the Dorothy" [...] (the name of his vessel) [...] "would find it out as quick as I could myself. I do not believe that brig would make more than a couple of short stretches, at the most, before she would perceive the difference between Ontario and the old Atlantic. I once took her down into one of the large South American bays, and she behaved herself as awkwardly as a booby would in a church with the congregation in a hurry. And Jasper sails that boat? I must have a cruise with the lad, Magnet, before I quit you, just for the name of the thing. It would never do to say I got in sight of this pond, and went away without taking a trip on it." ...|$|R
