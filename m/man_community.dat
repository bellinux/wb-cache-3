50|$|According to the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>community</b> website:From the Black Hut, {{the walker}} must first ascend {{the peak of}} Clagh Ouyr, a short climb which should take no more than 20 minutes to complete. From there, it is a {{moderate}} walk along the ridge of hills to the summit of North Barrule. For a walker of average fitness, and at a leisurely pace, {{it should be a}} walk of approximately 1.5 - 2 hours. The terrain comprises mostly short, tussocky grass and is marshy in places.From the Hibernian, follow the footpath signs up the tarmac road until it leads off the road and onto a rough track which winds steadily upwards {{to the left of the}} summit, between farm fields. Follow the track round for 40-50 minutes until you are facing the south slopes, above the Corrany Valley (it is also possible to make a longer ascent from the valley floor - turn off the A2 at the foot of the steep hill immediately after Dhoon Village; The Corrany is signposted). Begin to climb up through the fields, passing a ruined farmstead called Park Llewellyn on your left. A vertical dry stone wall winds upwards to the right, guiding towards the summit. Follow this until you meet the ridge path from Clagh Ouyr; after this, the path to the summit is clear. This route offers a shorter but more demanding walk.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{proceeds from}} the premise that reflecting on the structures of traditional societies can aid us in understanding of contemporary technological society. The goal is to determine whether traditional gifting relations are present in online-networked communities. A further objective is to investigate modes of gifting in order to offer insight into the procedures and infrastructures of Open Source communities and Social Networks. Utilizing Social Network theory as an overarching framework, this work identifies and extracts a pattern of gifting relations from diverse discourses on the gift. This is followed by an exploration of contemporary technological developments including Open Source, and Free Software movements, Web 2. 0, and social networks, in order to ascertain if the elements of this pattern appear. This examination {{is supported by a}} case study of the Burning <b>Man</b> <b>community.</b> The research concludes with implications of the significance of a gift-based approach to networked society...|$|E
