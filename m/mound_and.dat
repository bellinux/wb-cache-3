5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> {{ended the}} inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz grounded out on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a double play, ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on the <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{earliest}} (excavated) windmill is in Great Linford. The large oak beams {{forming the}} base supports still survived in the mill <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> were shown by radio carbon dating to {{originate in the}} first half of the 13th century. (The present stone tower mill at Bradwell was built in 1815, on a site convenient to the new Grand Junction Canal).|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E

50|$|Three {{significant}} {{archaeological sites}} {{are located in}} the township: the Hubele <b>Mounds</b> <b>and</b> Village Site southeast of Maunie; the Wilson <b>Mounds</b> <b>and</b> Village Site at Rising Sun; and the Bieker-Wilson Village Site east of New Haven.|$|R
40|$|The {{toppling}} {{of trees}} forms mounds of disturbed sediment and pits {{from which the}} mound removes sediment, rocks, and organic matter. Sites of uprooted trees in Puerto Rico and Colorado were examined (1) to compare areas <b>and</b> volumes of <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits relative to tree size, (2) to compare areas <b>and</b> volumes of <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits formed during catastrophic events at the landscape scale, and (3) to consider decay of <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits after formation. For a given basal area, the analyses found no difference among sites in area and volume of freshly formed individual <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits. For landscape-level catastrophic uprooting, the percent of toppled trees in a plot can explain 85 % and 87 % of the areas and volumes, respectively, of the quantity of soil uplifted. Exponential decay coefficients developed by monitoring mound/pit complexes indicate that <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits at the humid tropical site in Puerto Rico decay in about 74 % and 57 % of the time, respectively, of <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits at a temperate Colorado site. Decay coefficients developed for the Colorado site indicate that <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> pits are reduced to 10 % of their original volume within 30 and 78 years, respectively. Coefficients for Puerto Rico suggest that a similar reduction in volume requires 17 years, whereas pits generally fill within a decade...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to various Mainland {{sites such as}} Knowes of Trotty, Kirbuster Hill and the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday, Warness on Eday, the remains of two houses on Holm of Faray, and a burnt <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> farmstead on Auskerry.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Loughor Castle is {{controlled}} by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction. The ruined tower and fragments of the curtain wall still survive on top of the ringwork's earthwork defences, which now resemble a motte, or <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> are part of the Loughor Castle Park.|$|E
5|$|Locus 122 and Locus 123 are groups {{located on}} the {{floodplain}} south of the river. Locus 122, although unexcavated, is a compound consisting of a pyramidal <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> a NE–SW oriented plaza, similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands, for which reason it is presumed to date from that period.|$|E

He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana (6.18.3-6) lists Varuna and Mitra {{as having}} {{children}} through ayoni or non-vaginal sex. For example, Varuna fathered the sage Valmiki when his semen fell upon a termite <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> Agastya and Vasistha were born from water pots after Mitra and Varuna discharged their semen {{in the presence}} of Urvasi. This account is similar to Gay couples having children through surrogate mothers in modern days.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Bragan {{replaced}} Farrell {{as manager}} {{to begin the}} 1958 season. During a spring training game in March, Garcia slipped on a wet pitcher's <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> injured his back. He did not make his first regular season appearance until April 27 and he underwent surgery in June for a herniated disc. He finished {{the season with a}} 1–0 record in six appearances and eight innings of work. That same month, Bragan was fired as manager. He was replaced by former Indians player Joe Gordon, and the Indians finished 77–76.|$|E
50|$|The {{group of}} <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> {{enclosures}} is located alongside Paint Creek. Today, {{most of the}} <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> earthworks have been destroyed due to cultivation.

50|$|The {{valleys of}} the Scioto and Miami rivers were rich with prehistoric {{earthworks}} when whites settled Ohio. Champaign County lies midway between these rivers, and accordingly its earthworks are fewer {{than those of}} the counties located along those two rivers. A 1914 study observed only six <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> a total of eighteen archaeological sites countywide, in contrast to thirty-three <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> a total of fifty-nine sites in Logan County to the north, <b>and</b> twenty-two <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> a total of ninety-six sites in Miami County to the west. Unknown to this survey was the Carl Potter Mound: although it is one of several <b>mounds</b> <b>and</b> many burial sites that have been recorded on a single farm in Union Township, the only sites observed by the survey were located {{in the western part of}} the township.|$|R

5|$|Brownhills is {{situated}} on the ancient Watling Street and {{there is evidence of}} early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.|$|E
5|$|De Fratus has a two-pitch {{repertoire}} {{that consists}} of a fastball and a slider, the latter of which is his out pitch. He embraces a propensity to work quickly on the <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> use a lower arm slot. Off the field, De Fratus {{is a member of}} the Roman Catholic church, and uses baseball to strengthen his faith. He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians, and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman period, Erbil {{was part}} of the {{province}} of Baghdad, which was established in 1535. In 1743, the city was held for a short time by the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah after a siege lasting 60 days. An engraving from 1820 shows that at that time both the citadel <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> the plain at its southern foot were occupied. Mohammed Khor, a local Kurdish beg of Rowanduz, controlled Erbil for a short period in 1862. In 1892, the town had approximately 3,200 inhabitants, including a sizeable Jewish minority.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparations}} {{for his next}} campaign, Germanicus sent Publius Vitellius and Gaius Antius to collect taxes in Gaul, and instructed Silius, Anteius, and Caecina to build a fleet. A fort on the Lippe called Castra Aliso was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions {{in honor of his}} father. New barriers and earthworks were put in place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a <b>mound</b> <b>and</b> an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte.|$|E
5|$|Mingulay boasts {{three large}} sea stacks: Arnamul (Old Norse: Erne mound), Lianamul (Old Norse: Flax <b>mound)</b> <b>and</b> Gunamul, {{which has a}} natural arch in 150m (490ft) cliffs through which boats can sail on rare days when the restless sea is calm. There are several {{outlying}} islets including the twin rocks of Sròn a Dùin to the south-west, Geirum Mòr and Geirum Beag to the south between Mingulay and the nearby island of Berneray, and Solon Mòr ('Big Gannet'), Solon Beag ('Little Gannet'), Sgeirean nan Uibhein, Barnacle Rock and a smaller stack called The Red Boy, all to the north between Mingulay and Pabbay.|$|E

5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the <b>mound,</b> <b>and</b> they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E
5|$|The memorial's {{components}} were delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September14, 1867, {{and it was}} erected at its present location {{by a group of}} Romney volunteers. Bob Fisher was paid $5.00 USD for raising the earthen mound around the monument's location and $4.11 USD for providing lodging to one of the Gaddes brothers at his residence.

50|$|During the Lake Jackson I phase {{the site}} {{consisted}} of small village possibly with {{the beginnings of}} Mound 2 started. During the Early Lake Jackson II phasethe population and the habitation areas of the site expanded greatly. Many of the areas that would later become mounds were village areas at this time, including the locations of <b>Mounds</b> 3 <b>and</b> 4, as well as areas north of <b>Mounds</b> 2 <b>and</b> 4. <b>Mound</b> 5 was begun <b>and</b> <b>Mound</b> 2 was started during this time. <b>Mounds</b> 3, 4, <b>and</b> 6 were probably not yet started. No evidence exists for occupation {{in the vicinity of}} Mound 6. A small area around Mound 5 continued to be occupied during early Lake Jackson II. The areas north of <b>Mound</b> 4 <b>and</b> between <b>Mounds</b> 2 <b>and</b> 4 show evidence of dense occupation during this time. During the Late Lake Jackson II phase, all 7 mounds had been started and most had seen numerous construction episodes. <b>Mound</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Mound</b> 6 were possibly finished, <b>and</b> <b>Mounds</b> 2, 3, <b>and</b> 4 were under way but had not had their final stages reached yet. The area to the south <b>and</b> west of <b>Mound</b> 4 <b>and</b> the area between <b>Mounds</b> 2 <b>and</b> 4 continues to be occupied. There is dense occupation north of Mound 2. In the Lake Jackson III phase, {{the central part of the}} site is occupied more intensively especially around <b>Mound</b> 2 <b>and</b> spreading north. <b>Mounds</b> 4, 5, <b>and</b> 6 are completed before the beginning of the phase, <b>and</b> <b>Mounds</b> 2 <b>and</b> 3 are finished during the phase. After this point at about 1500, the site is virtually abandoned. There is occasional evidence that the site is still visited in the succeeding Velda phase (1500-1633), but very few artifacts or evidence of habitation from this time period have been found.|$|R
