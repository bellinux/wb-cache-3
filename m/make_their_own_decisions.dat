5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E

25|$|Another {{perspective}} {{includes the}} idea that sexuality is individual morality; this encourages girls to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions,</b> {{as long as their}} decision is to say no to sex before marriage. This education encourages self-control and chastity.|$|E

25|$|Autonomy {{can come}} into {{conflict}} with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict {{in a wide range}} of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions,</b> even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.|$|E
50|$|Boredom {{was a major}} problem, some internees were {{permitted}} to undertake paid work outside camp.

25|$|In February 2009, {{under the}} auspices of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Eric Horvitz chaired a meeting of leading {{computer}} scientists, artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists at Asilomar in Pacific Grove, California. The goal was to discuss the potential impact of the hypothetical possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions.</b> They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to pose threats or hazards.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the ruling, Diane Duke, CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, stated,While this {{intermediate}} decision allows that condoms may be mandated, it doesn’t {{mean they}} should be. We {{have spent the}} last two years fighting for the rights of adult performers to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> about their bodies, and against the stigma against adult film performers embodied in the statute. Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate pushes a legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.|$|E
25|$|Bud Selig (then-Commissioner of Baseball) said in 2014 that he {{had never}} {{received}} a complaint about the logo. He has heard that there are some protesting mascots, but individual teams such as the Indians and Braves should <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions.</b> Native Americans protested Chief Wahoo on Opening Day 2015, as they have for many years, making note that this is the 100th anniversary of the team becoming the Indians.

25|$|In April 2014, the United States Senate {{debated the}} Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to {{increase}} the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour {{over the course of}} a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Portman opposed the bill, arguing that Ohio already had a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum wage, indicating that the states should be able to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 2007–08 Shmita, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel {{attempted}} to avoid taking a potentially divisive {{position on the}} dispute between Haredi and Modern Orthodox views about the correctness of the heter mechirah leniency by ruling that local rabbis could <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> {{about whether or not}} to accept this device as valid. The Israel Supreme Court, however, ordered the Chief Rabbinate to rescind its ruling and to devise a single national ruling. The Israel Supreme Court opined that divergent local rulings would be harmful to farmers and trade and could implicate competition. The issue of secular courts ordering the rabbinate to rule in particular ways on religious matters aroused a debate within the Knesset. Israeli wineries often address this issue by making separate batches of Shmita wine, labeled as such, and giving away bottles of Shmita wine as a free bonus to purchasers of non-Shmita wine.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{election}} as BNP leader, Griffin {{was invited to}} participate in debates at several universities. In November 2002, the Cambridge Union Society invited him {{to take part in a}} debate the following January. Titled [...] "This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west", the resolution was controversial; alongside more moderate speakers, one of those invited was Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric. Some participants threatened to withdraw, and several official bodies criticised the invitations. The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by Rod Liddle, then editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. The venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event. Paley called the decision an [...] "own goal" [...] for the values of free speech, and Öpik criticised it, emphasising his belief in [...] "people's right to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> in a democracy".|$|E
30|$|Reputation/{{recommendation}}: a cloud user may trust a cloud service, {{based on}} a trusted cloud broker’s recommendation. Similar to PKI trust, recommendation may be handled in two ways: one regards the “recommendation” as the broker’s trust in that recommended service, and then derives indirect trust on that service through using trust in belief relation with the broker; another is (as in PKI practice) that the broker only certifies that that cloud service has certain attributes or conforms to certain policies, and cloud users to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> whether to trust that service.|$|R
5000|$|In The Glass Menagerie, Tennessee Williams {{explains}} to the readers {{that the character}} Laura has grown up with a disability. [...] "A childhood illness has left her crippled, one leg slightly shorter than the other, and held in a brace. This defect need not be more than suggested on the stage." [...] This character description is vague enough to allow the director of this production to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> {{as to how they}} want to portray Laura. There is enough ambiguity for the director to take the responsibility of showcasing disability as they see fit.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the film}} depicts the Alliance as an all-powerful, authoritarian-style regime, Whedon {{is careful to}} point out that it is not so simple as that. [...] "The Alliance isn't some evil empire", he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not. What the crew of Serenity represent—specifically Mal and his lifestyle—is the idea that people {{should have the right to}} <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions,</b> even if those decisions are bad.|$|E
2500|$|Christians {{have always}} been free to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that {{practice}} specific dietary restrictions for various reasons. The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited {{as one of the}} Ebionites' [...] "errors".|$|E

Architecture of agent application is peer to peer, that makes it able to initiate direct host to host communication at any time and also make it open for an incoming connection form any other agent. Agents can tolerate ambiguity arises due to conversation among agents. An agent also updates its rules through learning and become adaptive to dynamic system [13].|$|R
40|$|Differences {{between white}} and Black, Asian and other {{minority}} ethnic (BAME) local election candidates in Britain are examined using survey data.

He saw the appointment of Ian MacGregor {{as chair of the}} National Coal Board as a [...] "declaration of war". James Cowan, then deputy chairman of the NCB, claims that McGahey warned him to retire in 1983 and protect his health, as he feared that a [...] "bloody" [...] strike was inevitable with the appointment of Ian MacGregor and that there would be conflict between different regions in the NUM.|$|E

MacNeil said few front-line supervisors were trained to take control of such situations at the time, that no officers had put on body armour, and that at the time of the incident, Mounties in Moncton had only been trained with pistols.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|R

50|$|Adler {{had many}} areas of focus, {{but there are some}} key {{components}} that contributed to classical Adlerian psychotherapy (a.k.a. individual psychology). Children are born with an inborn force, which enables people to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision,</b> and develop <b>their</b> <b>own</b> opinions. He stated that individuals aren't just a product of their situations. They are creators of their situations. A person's feelings, beliefs and behaviors all work together to make each individual unique.Another area of focus on was the concept of fictions. It is believed that fictions are conscious and non-conscious ideas that are not necessarily aligned with reality, but serve as a guide to cope with reality. People create fictions as ways of seeing themselves, others around them and their environments and that people do this to guide their feelings, thoughts, and actions.|$|R
