50|$|In 1970, Hach was {{manufacturing}} and selling {{a line of}} instruments designed to determine specific water impurities. It was also manufacturing a <b>manometric</b> apparatus that measured the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of sewage and industrial wastes in lakes, rivers, and streams.|$|E
50|$|Koenig's <b>manometric</b> flame {{apparatus}} was {{a laboratory}} instrument invented in 1862 by the German physicist Rudolph Koenig, {{and used to}} visualize sound waves. It was the nearest equivalent of the modern oscilloscope {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.|$|E
5000|$|A {{millimeter}} {{of mercury}} is a <b>manometric</b> unit of pressure, formerly defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one millimetre high and now defined as precisely [...] pascals. It is denoted by the symbol [...] "mmHg".|$|E
5000|$|Although {{no longer}} preferred, these <b>manometric</b> units are still {{encountered}} in many fields. Blood pressure {{is measured in}} millimetres of mercury (see torr) {{in most of the}} world, and lung pressures in centimeters of water are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in inches of water, expressed as [...] "inches W.C." [...] Scuba divers often use a <b>manometric</b> rule of thumb: the pressure exerted by ten meters depth of sea water ("10 msw") is approximately equal to one atmosphere. In vacuum systems, the units torr (millimeter of mercury), micron (micrometer of mercury), and inch of mercury (inHg) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.|$|E
50|$|As esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis is also {{associated}} with motility disturbances of the esophagus, manometry testing of esophageal pressures may provide information {{to assist in the}} diagnosis. Irregularity in the contractions of the esophagus, prominent tertiary contractions of the esophagus, or lack of esophageal contraction (aperistalsis) have all been reported on <b>manometric</b> testing of the esophagus.|$|E
50|$|As {{changes in}} {{temperature}} or pressure can also affect {{the displacement of}} the <b>manometric</b> fluid, a second respirometer identical to the first except with a dead specimen (or something with the same mass as the specimen {{in place of the}} organism) is sometimes set up. Subtracting the displacement of the second respirometer from the first allows for control of these factors.|$|E
5000|$|A type of Fourier {{analyzer}} can {{be constructed}} by connecting a number of <b>manometric</b> flame capsules each to a Helmholtz resonator tuned to either the fundamental frequency of the sound to be analyzed, or one of its harmonics. The flames produced from each capsule are then {{an indication of the}} strength of each of the Fourier components of the sound.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the second}} method, water vapor is {{compressed}} {{by means of}} a mechanical device, electrically driven in most cases. This form is designated mechanical vapor compression (MVC). The MVC process comprises two different versions: vapor compression (VC) and vacuum vapor compression (VVC). VC designates those systems in which the evaporation effect takes place at <b>manometric</b> pressure, and VVC the systems in which evaporation takes place at sub-atmospheric pressures (under vacuum).|$|E
50|$|Since {{almost all}} adsorptive {{separation}} processes are dynamic -meaning, {{that they are}} running under flow - testing porous materials for those applications for their separation performance has to be tested under flow as well. Since separation processes run with mixtures of different components, measuring several breakthrough curves results in thermodynamic mixture equilibria - mixture sorption isotherms, that are hardly accessible with static <b>manometric</b> sorption characterization. This enables the determination of sorption selectivities in gaseous and liquid phase.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{techniques}} include manometry, balloon expulsion test, evacuation proctography (see defecating proctogram), and MRI defecography. [...] Diagnostic criteria are: {{fulfillment of}} criteria for functional constipation, <b>manometric</b> and/or EMG and/or radiological evidence (2 out of 3), evidence of adequate expulsion force, {{and evidence of}} incomplete evacuation. [...] Recent dynamic imaging {{studies have shown that}} in persons diagnosed with anismus the anorectal angle during attempted defecation is abnormal, and this is due to abnormal (paradoxical) movement of the puborectalis muscle.|$|E
50|$|Scott de Martinville {{managed to}} sell several phonautographs to {{scientific}} laboratories {{for use in}} the investigation of sound. It proved useful in the study of vowel sounds and was used by Franciscus Donders, Heinrich Schneebeli and Rene Marage. It also initiated further research into tools able to image sound such as Koenig's <b>manometric</b> flame. He was not, however, able to profit from his invention and spent the remainder of his life as a librarian and bookseller at 9 Rue Vivienne in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|This example {{demonstrates}} {{why there}} is some confusion surrounding pressure head {{and its relationship to}} pressure. Scientists frequently use columns of water (or mercury) to measure pressure (<b>manometric</b> pressure measurement), since for a given fluid, pressure head is proportional to pressure. Measuring pressure in units of [...] "mm of mercury" [...] or [...] "inches of water" [...] makes sense for instrumentation, but these raw measurements of head must frequently be converted to more convenient pressure units using the equations above to solve for pressure.|$|E
50|$|In {{assessment}} of distal esophageal pH, the sensor is placed 5 cm above upper {{border of the}} lower esophageal sphincter (LES) determined by esophageal manometry. To measure proximal esophageal acid exposure the second sensor is placed 1-5 below the lower border of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). The Bravo pH capsule is placed either transnasally based on <b>manometric</b> measurements, or following endoscopy. In transnasal placement the capsule is placed 5 cm above upper border of the LES, and in endoscopic placement 6 cm above gastroesophageal junction. The same applies to OMOM pH monitoring capsule.|$|E
50|$|Koenig {{will also}} {{be remembered as the}} {{inventor}} and constructor of many other beautiful pieces of apparatus for the investigation of acoustical problems, among which may be mentioned his wave-sirens, the first of which was shown at Philadelphia in 1876. His original work dealt, among other things, with Wheatstone's sound-figures, the characteristic notes of the different vowels, a <b>manometric</b> flame apparatus, a vibration microscope, among others; but perhaps the most important of his researches are those devoted to the phenomena produced by the interference of two tones, in which he disputed the views of Helmholtz as to the existence of summation and difference tones.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{pressure}} was once commonly measured by {{its ability to}} displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., inches of water). <b>Manometric</b> measurement {{is the subject of}} pressure head calculations. The most common choices for a manometer's fluid are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure. The abbreviation [...] "W.C." [...] or the words [...] "water column" [...] are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>manometric</b> flame {{apparatus}} {{consisted of}} a chamber which acted {{in the same way}} as a modern microphone. Sound from the source to be measured was concentrated by means of a horn or tube into one half of the capsule chamber. The chamber was divided in two by an elastic diaphragm, usually rubber. The sound caused the diaphragm to vibrate which modulated a flow of flammable illumination gas passing through the other half of the chamber. The illumination gas was passed to a Bunsen burner, the flame of which would then increase or decrease in size at the same frequency as the sound source.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{units are}} used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre; similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi) is the {{traditional}} unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems. Pressure may also be {{expressed in terms of}} standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as [...] of this. <b>Manometric</b> units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre of mercury, and inch of mercury {{are used to}} express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the WFEB {{sponsored}} a Pre-Collegiate Science Summer Program, similar to, but shorter-lived than, the Jackson Laboratory's Summer Student Program in Maine. Selected high school {{juniors and seniors}} spent several weeks living in the dormitories of nearby Saint Mark's School and doing advanced biochemical lab work {{under the guidance of}} St. Mark's teachers, Frederick R. Avis and Anna Pliscz. After studying the anatomy of mice in Avis' textbook, About Mice and Men, they performed surgery on them, using anesthesia and sterile techniques similar to those used in human surgery; transplanted tumors from one mouse to another; isolated 17-ketosteroids from their own urine; and did blood counts and <b>manometric</b> oxygen consumption measurements on bovine livers and kidneys maintained in a perfusion apparatus; among other experiments.|$|E
5000|$|During {{these first}} {{investigations}} he co-signed a paper with Donald Van Slyke on an improved <b>manometric</b> method for carbon analysis. Using this newly developed method, he characterized the isolated [...] "cephalin" [...] fraction from brain tissue that after Johannes Thudichum (the nineteenth-century {{founder of the}} field of structural neurochemistry) was considered as pure phosphatidyl ethanolamine. Folch showed that the amount of carbon and of amines were not consistent with Thudichum's formula. This research led to Folch's first publication on brain lipids in 1941 and was followed {{over a period of several}} years by a series of famous papers showing that cephalin was not a single lipid but rather a mixture of three lipids (phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl serine, and inositol). Folch was the first to have elucidated the structure of phosphatidyl serine. Furthermore, he isolated subsequently mono-, di- and triphosphoinositides.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969-1970, Devyatkov {{with his}} colleagues {{designed}} the world's first industrial model of pH probe, which measured the acidity {{of the two}} points of the gastrointestinal tract and apparatus for recording the pH. Also he created the original versions of pH-probes with 3, 4 and 5 sensors, intraoperation, endoscopic, children's pH-probes for different age groups, dentistry and gynecology pH-probes, as well as equipment, recording pH with multisensor pH-probes. With the direct participation Devyatkov the NPC [...] "Istok" [...] were organized serial production {{of the first in}} the USSR pH-probes for gastrointestinal pH-metry. Method of complex study of the functional state of the stomach and duodenum, providing simultaneous measurement of pressure and acidity {{in different parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract and is called at that time [...] "ionomanometry" [...] has been applied in medical practice since 1974. Under the guidance of Devyatkov was made probe with 4 pH sensors, and 4 plastic <b>manometric</b> catheters.|$|E
5000|$|In most {{liquid column}} {{measurement}}s, {{the result of}} the measurement is the height, h, expressed typically in mm, cm, or inches. The h is also known as the pressure head. When expressed as a pressure head, pressure is specified in units of length and the measurement fluid must be specified. When accuracy is critical, the temperature of the measurement fluid must likewise be specified, because liquid density is a function of temperature. So, for example, pressure head might be written [...] "742.2 mmHg" [...] or [...] "4.2 inH2O at 59 °F" [...] for measurements taken with mercury or water as the <b>manometric</b> fluid, respectively. The word [...] "gauge" [...] or [...] "vacuum" [...] may be added to such a measurement to distinguish between a pressure above or below the atmospheric pressure. Both mm of mercury and inches of water are common pressure heads which can be converted to S.I. units of pressure using unit conversion and the above formulas.|$|E
50|$|Because {{pressure}} is commonly measured by {{its ability to}} displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., centimetres of water, millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury). The most common choices are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) {{to be used to}} measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height h and density ρ is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation p = ρgh, where g is the gravitational acceleration. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units. One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one torr. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These <b>manometric</b> units are still encountered in many fields. Blood {{pressure is}} measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{telescoping}} types use the <b>manometric</b> {{property of}} water to provide a seal. The whole tank floats in a circular or annular water reservoir, held up by the roughly constant pressure of a varying volume of gas, the pressure determined {{by the weight of}} the structure, and the water providing the seal for the gas within the moving walls. Besides storing the gas, the tank's design serves to establish the pressure of the gas system. With telescoping (multiple-lift) tanks, the innermost tank has a ~1 ft wide by 2 ft high (30x60 cm) lip around the outside of the bottom edge, called a cup, which picks up water as it rises above the reservoir water level. This immediately engages a downward lip on the inner rim of the next outer lift, called a dip or grip, and as this grip sinks into the cup, it preserves the water seal as the inner tank continues to rise until the grip grounds on the cup, whereupon further injection of gas will start to raise that lift as well. Holders were built with as many as four lifts. An extra flying lift could be retrofitted into column or frame gas holders. This was an additional inner tank that extended above the standards, when the infrastructure would support the extra shear forces and weight. Though not exclusively, spiral guides were used.|$|E
50|$|Biofeedback {{is a major}} {{treatment}} for anismus (paradoxical contraction of puborectalis during defecation). This therapy directly evolved from the investigation anorectal manometry where a probe that can record pressure {{is placed in the}} anal canal. Biofeedback therapy is also a commonly used and researched therapy for fecal incontinence, but the benefits are uncertain. Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered. It is also unknown if one type has benefits over another. The aims have been described as to enhance either the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), rectal sensitivity (by discrimination of progressively smaller volumes of a rectal balloon and promptly contracting the external anal sphincter (EAS)), or the strength and endurance of the EAS contraction. Three general types of biofeedback have been described, though they are not mutually exclusive, with many protocols combining these elements. Similarly there is variance of the length of both the individual sessions and the overall length of the training, and if home exercises are performed in addition and how. In rectal sensitivity training, a balloon is placed in the rectum, and is gradually distended until there is a sensation of rectal filling. Successively smaller volume reinflations of the balloon aim to help the person detect rectal distension at a lower threshold, giving more time to contract the EAS and prevent incontinence, or to journey to the toilet. Alternatively, in those with urge incontinence/ rectal hypersensitivity, training is aimed at teaching the person to tolerate progressively larger volumes. Strength training may involve electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, <b>manometric</b> pressures, intra-anal EMG, or endoanal ultrasound. One of these measures are used to relay the muscular activity or anal canal pressure during anal sphincter exercise. Performance and progress can be monitored in this manner. Co-ordination training involves the placing of 3 balloons, in the rectum and in the upper and lower anal canal. The rectal balloon is inflated to trigger the RAIR, an event often followed by incontinence. Co-ordination training aims to teach voluntary contraction of EAS when the RAIR occurs (i.e. when there is rectal distension).|$|E
5000|$|Claude Bernard {{proposed}} in 1865 {{that the body}} strives to maintain a steady state in the internal environment (milieu intérieur), introducing the concept of homeostasis. [...] In 1885, J.R. Tarchanoff showed that voluntary control of heart rate could be fairly direct (cortical-autonomic) and did not depend on [...] "cheating" [...] by altering breathing rate. In 1901, J. H. Bair studied voluntary control of the retrahens aurem muscle that wiggles the ear, discovering that subjects learned this skill by inhibiting interfering muscles and demonstrating that skeletal muscles are self-regulated. [...] Alexander Graham Bell attempted to teach the deaf to speak {{through the use of}} two devices—the phonautograph, created by Édouard-Léon Scott's, and a <b>manometric</b> flame. The former translated sound vibrations into tracings on smoked glass to show their acoustic waveforms, while the latter allowed sound to be displayed as patterns of light. [...] After World War II, mathematician Norbert Wiener developed cybernetic theory, that proposed that systems are controlled by monitoring their results. The participants at the landmark 1969 conference at the Surfrider Inn in Santa Monica coined the term biofeedback from Wiener's feedback. The conference resulted in the founding of the Bio-Feedback Research Society, which permitted normally isolated researchers to contact and collaborate with each other, as well as popularizing the term [...] "biofeedback." [...] The work of B.F. Skinner led researchers to apply operant conditioning to biofeedback, decide which responses could be voluntarily controlled and which could not. In the first experimental demonstration of biofeedback Shearn used these procedures with heart rate. The effects of the perception of autonomic nervous system activity was initially explored by George Mandler's group in 1958. In 1965, Maia Lisina combined classical and operant conditioning to train subjects to change blood vessel diameter, eliciting and displaying reflexive blood flow changes to teach subjects how to voluntarily control the temperature of their skin. In 1974, H.D. Kimmel trained subjects to sweat using the galvanic skin response.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Perfused {{miniature}} <b>manometric</b> assemblies with lumina of 0. 4 - 0. 5 mm i. d. {{have been}} developed. Reduced luminal size offers {{the advantages of}} reduced assembly bulk and increased assembly complexity with greater numbers of lumina and lower <b>manometric</b> infusion volumes because of a slower perfusion rate. This study investigated the recording fidelity of miniature <b>manometric</b> assemblies in the measurement of esophageal peristalsis. METHODS: Four miniature <b>manometric</b> assemblies, each containing <b>manometric</b> lumina of either 0. 4 or 0. 5 mm i. d., were evaluated at 100 and 180 cm lengths. The fidelity of miniature <b>manometric</b> luminal recordings were evaluated in vivo during esophageal peristalsis by using a simultaneous comparison with the standard lumina and an intraluminal strain gauge. RESULTS: During esophageal peristalsis, miniature <b>manometric</b> lumina recorded the peak amplitude of pressure waves, with an accuracy at perfusion rates of 0. 04 mL/min (0. 4 mm, i. d.) and 0. 15 mL/min (0. 5 mm, i. d.).

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the recording fidelity of a water-perfused micromanometric catheter with incorporated sleeve combined with a newly developed portable water-perfused <b>manometric</b> system for pharyngeal, oesophageal and lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure recording. The system's performance was assessed in prolonged recordings in ambulant gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) patients. Eighty 24 -h studies in GORD patients, carried out with the perfused portable <b>manometric</b> system, were evaluated. Twelve of these recordings were analysed in detail in order to compare oesophageal and LOS motor patterns with those described previously. Paired 2 -h <b>manometric</b> recordings of the pharynx, oesophagus, LOS and stomach, using the new system and a conventional perfused stationary <b>manometric</b> system, were performed in eight healthy subjects. With the portable <b>manometric</b> system oesophageal contractions, transient LOS relaxations, swallow-associated prolonged LOS relaxations and LOS pressures were recorded with equal fidelity to the conventional <b>manometric</b> system. Recordings obtained with the portable system showed meal-related and diurnal variations in oesophageal and LOS variables that were similar to these found in studies using conventional equipment.

The propulsive force and <b>manometric</b> pressure waves had a simultaneous onset and were of similar duration. Peak values of propulsive force for wet swallows increased significantly as measurements were made progressively more distally within the oesophagus and were greatest in the distal oesophagus.
