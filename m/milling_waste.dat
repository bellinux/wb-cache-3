30|$|Examining Table  4 carefully, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that the compost pile that has the highest biodegradability is the grain dust with a reaction rate constant of 0.0055 d− 1, followed by coffee-processing waste and fresh olive <b>milling</b> <b>waste</b> with reaction rate constants of 0.0039 and 0.0015 d− 1, respectively. On the other hand, among the co-composting piles, the grain dust with coffee-processing waste had the highest biodegradability with reaction rate constant of 0.0045 d− 1, followed by grain dust with dry olive-processing waste that had a rate constant of 0.0036 d− 1, and coffee-processing waste plus fresh olive <b>milling</b> <b>waste</b> with rate constant of 0.0024 d− 1 and finally the grain dust with fresh olive <b>milling</b> <b>waste</b> of 0.0022 d− 1. This is also evident by the higher value of temperature that was achieved in the grain dust piles, which resulted from the microbial respiration during the biodegradation process. This implies that the grain dust is a much easier biodegradable substrate than the others, while the olive cake both old and fresh had the lowest biodegradability. This is in agreement with other researchers who reported a relatively slow biodegradation rate of olive waste (Alburquerque et al. 2006). This is expected since the olive residues contain phenolic and complex lipids which are phytotoxic and stable compounds that inhibit microbial activity and slow the biodegradation process.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the production of flavor compounds from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> by microbial fermentation of Rhizopus oryzae and Candida tropicalis. Olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> fermentations were performed in shake and bioreactor cultures. Production of flavor compounds from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> was followed by Gas Chromatography–Mass spectrometry, Gas chromatography- olfactometry and Spectrum Sensory Analysis®. As a result, 1. 73 -log and 3. 23 -log cfu/mL increases were observed in the microbial populations of R. oryzae and C. tropicalis during shake cultures, respectively. C. tropicalis can produce a higher concentration of d-limonene from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> than R. oryzae in shake cultures. The concentration of d-limonene was determined as 185. 56 and 249. 54 μg/kg in the fermented olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> by R. oryzae and C. tropicalis in shake cultures respectively. In contrast, R. oryzae can produce a higher concentration of d-limonene (87. 73 μg/kg) d-limonene than C. tropicalis (11. 95 μg/kg) in bioreactor cultures. Based on sensory analysis, unripe olive, wet towel, sweet aromatic, fermented aromas were determined at high intensity in olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> fermented with R. oryzae meanwhile olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> fermented with C. tropicalis had only a high intensity of unripe olive and oily aroma...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the generation of}} low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) and high-level waste (HLW) from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles. The closed fuel cycle reflects the development and deployment of fast reactors and pyroprocessing from 2013 to 2100, while the open fuel cycle only considers pressurized water reactors. The closed fuel cycle hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60 % space of interim storage compared with the open fuel cycle. Compared with the open fuel cycle, the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the closed fuel cycle up to over 95 % in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in decay storages for a few hundred years. Mining and <b>milling</b> <b>waste</b> in the closed fuel cycle decreases by about 31 %. In contrast, the closed fuel cycle generates 3. 0 %- 4. 5 % more LILW than the open fuel cycle because fast reactors and pyroprocessing produce more LILW and conversion, enrichment, and fabrication produce less LILW.

The study utilized batch-anaerobic digesters in initial stages to find optimum conditions for long-term studies which were conducted in 9 -liter bottles with periodic removal of digested waste and addition of fresh waste. Seed was composed of digested domestic sewage sludge, bottom sediment from a canal used for disposal of pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste,</b> and fermented pineapples and pineapple juice. Principal studies involved three digesters maintained at ambient temperature as controls, two digesters with 75 mg/l of phosphorus added, two digesters heated to 90 °F, and one digester whose contents were mixed by recirculation of digester gases. The digesters were operated for sixty days. Analytical parameters were COD, sugar, pH, ORP, volatile acids, gas production, gas composition, alkalinity, and total bacteria by the Breed Counting Method. The results of the study showed that pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> undergoes a rapid initial decomposition. A reduction in COD occurred along with a rapid drop in sugar concentration and subsequent formation of volatile acids. Following initial activity, there is a period of inactivity after which recovery from the acid stage occurs and a steady reduction of waste material begins. The test data collected indicated that raw pineapple waste liquor is unsuitable for anaerobic digestion unless it is heated, stirred, or treated with phosphate. After sixty days of operation, digesters at ambient temperature, those with added phosphorus, and those that were stirred produced a COD reduction of 40, 51, and 53 percent, respectively. There was strong evidence that pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> may be satisfactorily treated anaerobically if it is heated and optimum conditions exist.

The compressive test result of mortar samples will be compared between conventional mortar (0 % WBFA) and waste Bakelite mortar (WBM) as well as comparing with the mortar standard. From an analysis of the sample test data found that the WBFA content in cement mortar mixture can predict the strength of WBM. The compressive strength of WBM at 28  days age with the fraction of WBFA is not exceeded 11. 03 %, and 23. 08 % respectively can be met the mortar standard according to the equation. The utilization of WBM to develop mortar non-structural mortar product can be usable from a technical point of view...|$|E

Singer em substratos cuja principal fonte de carbono fosse o resíduo do beneficiamento têxtil do algodão. Foram avaliadas duas composições de substrato: C 1 (resíduo do beneficiamento têxtil do algodão, farelo de trigo, gesso e calcário) e C 2 (resíduo do beneficiamento têxtil do algodão, farelo de trigo, palha de feijão, gesso e calcário). O experimento foi estabelecido em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com nove repetições por tratamento e os dados de produção e eficiência biológica foram analisados utilizando-se o procedimento ANOVAG do pacote estatístico SAEG. O resíduo do beneficiamento têxtil do algodão, como principal ingrediente do substrato, mostrou-se eficiente para a produção do cogumelo P. sajor-caju, apresentando valores satisfatórios de produtividade (0, 56 e 0, 55 kg/kg substrato) e eficiência biológica (55, 76 e 55, 39 %), respectivamente para C 1 e C 2, podendo ser recomendado como alternativa menos onerosa de substrato comercial para a espécie Pleurotus sajor-caju.

A DIC experimental design was used, with nine repetitions for treatment and the production data and biological efficiency were analyzed being used the procedure ANOVAG of the statistical package SAEG. The cotton textille <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> improvement, as the main ingredient of the substrate, was shown efficient for the production of the mushroom P. sajor-caju, presenting satisfactory values of productivity (0, 56 and 0, 55 kg/kg substratum) and biological efficiency (55, 76 and 55, 39 %), respectively for C 1 and C 2. These results showed us that cotton textille <b>mill</b> <b>waste,</b> could be recommended as less onerous alternative of commercial substrate for the species Pleurotus sajor-caju...|$|R
