40|$|Abstract The thesis {{looks at}} Rushdie s three first major novels (<b>Midnight</b> <b>s</b> <b>Children,</b> Shame and The Satanic Verses) as a loose-knit trilogy and {{examines}} the way Rushdie uses literary techniques belonging to postmodern and postcolonial aesthetics {{in order to}} deconstruct {{the whole idea of}} divine revelation and thereby subverting the authority of any religion which claims a divine origin and a transcendent understanding of the human condition. Although the carnival theme is the most central to the discussion, literary techniques and constructions such as Menippean satire, rhizome, simulacrum, inversion, historiographic metafiction and leitmotif are also examined. The aim is to show how Rushdie s treatment of central themes such as identity, history and religion is consistent throughout the novels, with special attention to the theme of religion. Although all the novels deal with the same central themes, the thesis shows how the themes of identity and religion are intensified in each subsequent novel and that The Satanic Verses is to be considered an amalgamation of the two and the dénouement of the first movement of Rushdie s works. The thesis concludes that the complex literary discourse which is The Satanic Verses has largely been misunderstood by critics who do not appreciate or disregard the conventions of the Western novel, and that when viewed in context with the two preceding works should be regarded as a serious attempt to do battle with and raise debate about the central issues facing modern man {{from the perspective of a}} modern migrant. Having said this, the thesis questions the efficacy of the use of the carnival theme in relation to the subversion of religion and the pragmatics of the suggestions that emerge from the novels of how to consolidate the predicament of the complex postmodern condition...|$|E

40|$|Peer {{reviewed}} article. Salman Rushdie {{has been}} the epitome of diasporic writing since his seminal work in Midnight's Children. While it is arguable {{that the question of}} what constitutes the identity of an immigrant (in an already existing diaspora) is first fully articulated in The Satanic Verses, it is already in his Booker Prize Winning novel that Rushdie tackles the questions typical for diasporic individuals and communities. The novel indeed takes place in the subcontinent, but it was written at the time when Rushdie was heavily negotiating the terms of his own identity in relation to his double cultural heritage. His character, Saleem Sinai, is something of an immigrant when he moves to Pakistan, but then when he goes back to Bombay, the sense of being-out-of-place remains. The most pertinent question for him seems to be that of authentic identity. In fact, as a writer in diaspora, Rushdie seems quite influenced by variegated European philosophies on selfhood and identity, in particular some Existentialist thought that constituted a part of a certain Zeitgeist in the 60 s and 70 <b>s.</b> <b>Midnight's</b> <b>Children</b> indeed explores the issue of authenticity in the culturally specific setting of post-Partition Bombay, but the influences from European culture on Rushdie are hardly negligible. The novel puts in dialogue Existentialism's discourse on individual authenticity and subcontinental nativism, or communalism...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Injuries are {{the leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} for U. <b>S.</b> <b>children,</b> but little research exists on injury in the home environment. The purpose of this study was to estimate the rate and severity of and trends in unintentional residential injury for U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> 9 years (p< 0. 0001). Males had a higher rate of visits than females (p= 0. 01). Falls were the leading mechanisms, resulting in 1. 5 million ED visits per year (95 % CI 1. 3 million, 1. 8 million). Residential injury rates decreased by 28 % over time (p< 0. 02), from 6. 3 per 100 (95 % CI 3. 4, 9. 2) in 1993 to 4. 5 per 100 (95 % CI 2. 3, 6. 7) in 1999. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant location of injury for U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> is the home, accounting for 4. 01 million ED visits and more than 70, 000 hospitalizations each year.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{reviewed}} {{the sources of}} lead in the environments of U. <b>S.</b> <b>children,</b> contributions to children’s blood lead levels, source elimination and control efforts, and existing federal authorities. Our context is the U. S. public health goal to eliminate pediatric elevated blood lead levels (EBLs) by 2010. DATA SOURCES: National, state, and local exposure assessments over {{the past half century}} have identified risk factors for EBLs among U. <b>S.</b> <b>children,</b> including age, race, income, age and location of housing, parental occupation, and season. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Recent national policies have greatly reduced lead exposure among U. <b>S.</b> <b>children,</b> but even very low exposure levels compromise children’s later intellectual development and lifetime achievement. No threshold for these effects has been demonstrated. Although lead paint and dust may still account for up to 70 % of EBLs in U. <b>S.</b> <b>children,</b> the U. <b>S.</b> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ≥ 30 % of current EBLs do not have an immediate lead paint source, and numerous studies indicate that lead exposures result from multiple sources.

40|$|BACKGROUND : We {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} dental disease among U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years, {{as well as the}} impact of unmet dental needs on school absenteeism because of illness/injury within the past 12 months. METHODS : Data were from the 2011 / 2012 National Survey of Children's Health (n = 65, 680). Unmet dental need was defined as lack of access to appropriate and timely preventive or therapeutic dental healthcare when needed within the past 12 months. The impact of unmet dental needs on school absenteeism was measured using a multivariate generalized linear model with Poisson probability distribution (p b 0. 05). RESULTS : Within the past 12 months, 21. 8 % (10. 8 million) of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years had “a toothache, decayed teeth, or unfilled cavities. ” Of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years, 15. 8 % (7. 8 million) reported any unmet dental need (i. e., preventive and/or therapeutic dental need) within the past 12 months. The mean number of days of school absence because of illness/injury was higher among students with an unmet therapeutic dental need {{in the presence of a}} dental condition compared to those reporting no unmet dental need (β= 0. 25; p b 0. 001).

40|$|Background : No {{research}} has estimated the cumulative risk of paternal or maternal incarceration {{in any country}} other than the U. S., so it remains unclear how much more likely U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> are {{to be exposed to}} parental incarceration than children living in other countries. Objective : To estimate the cumulative risks of paternal and maternal incarceration (including even very short jail stays of less than 24 hours) by age 14 for the 1990 Danish birth cohort. We then compare these estimates to equivalent estimates for the 1990 U. S. birth cohort. Methods : We use birth cohort life tables and Danish registry data, which provide administrative records on all incarcerations in Denmark, to estimate the cumulative risks of paternal and maternal incarceration. We follow the full 1990 Danish birth cohort (N = 62, 982) up to age 14 to see whether each child has ever experienced different lengths of paternal and maternal incarceration. Results : We estimate that 1. 54 <b>Š</b> of Danish <b>children</b> experienced paternal imprisonment and that 8. 78 <b>Š</b> of Danish <b>children</b> experienced any paternal incarceration (including jail stays less than 24 hours), indicating that U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> are almost as likely to have their fathers sent to prison (which usually results from a sentence of at least one year in the U. <b>S.)</b> as Danish <b>children</b> are to have their fathers spend less than one day in jail. Results for maternal imprisonment are similar. Conclusions : U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> {{are far more likely to}} be exposed to parental incarceration than Danish children, suggesting that imprisonment contributes not only to inequality among children within the U. S., but also to inequality between children in the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>children</b> in other developed democracies...|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the composition and stability of the human distal gut microbiota is based largely on studies of infants and adults living in developed countries. In contrast, {{little is known about}} the gut microbiota and its variation over time in older children and adolescents, especially in developing countries. We compared the diversity, composition, and temporal stability of the fecal microbiota of healthy children, ages 9 to 14 years, living in an urban slum in Bangladesh with that of children of the same age range in an upper-middle class suburban community in the United States. We analyzed > 8, 000 near full-length 16 S rRNA gene sequences and over 845, 000 pyrosequencing reads of the 16 S rRNA V 1 -V 3 region. The distal gut of Bangladeshi children harbored significantly greater bacterial diversity than that of U. <b>S.</b> <b>children,</b> including novel lineages from several bacterial phyla. Bangladeshi and U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> had distinct fecal bacterial community membership and structure; the microbiota of Bangladeshi children was enriched in Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Oscillospira and depleted in Bacteroides relative to U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> (although similar to Bangladeshi adults). Furthermore, community membership and structure in Bangladeshi children was significantly less stable month-to-month than U. <b>S.</b> <b>children.</b> Together, these results suggest that differing environmental or genetic factors may shape the microbiota of healthy children in the two countries. Further investigation is necessary to understand the mechanisms and factors that underlie these differences, and to incorporate these findings into new strategies for the prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent diseases...|$|R
40|$|From the 1940 s to {{the late}} 1960 s, {{approximately}} 86 % of U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> were born to married parents and lived with these parents throughout childhood and adolescence. From 1970 to 2000, however, the percentage of children living in two parent families decreased from 86. 5 % in 1970 to 69. 1 % in 2000 (Hernandez 1993; U. S. Bureau of the Census 2006). One of the trends related to the decreased number of children living in two parent families occurred because {{of changes in the}} divorce rate. In 1960, less than 500, 000 U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> were affected by divorce while in 1980 close to 1. 2 million children had experienced the divorce of their parents. From 1980 to 1990, the number of U. <b>S.</b> <b>children</b> living in a divorced family decreased from slightly less than 1. 2 million to 1 million. Predications regarding the percentage of American children who will live in a single parent family before reaching the age of eighteen suggested that more than 50 % of those born after 1992 would, at some time between their birth and reaching the age of 18, live in a single parent family (McLanahan & Sandefur 1994). Clearly, divorce is an event affecting a large number of U. <b>S.</b> <b>children.</b> Research reported that divorce is a perceived as a highly stressful life event for most adults and children.
