40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the project was}} to {{optimize}} a new ceramic material (Reaction Bondel Aluminum Oxide) taking into consideration design constraints of an actual application. The most important characteristics of this technology are easy green machining, cheap raw materials and high sintered strength. Furthermore, the final machining and therefore the manufacturing costs could be reduced because of low shrinkage and good shape and dimensional stability of this material. The processing steps for the material development with respect to ceramic-merited design as well as preparation for mass production were worked out for a bearing plate in an axial piston machine. At the same time, the potential of the newly developed RBAO materials was investigated through comparison with available materials (e. g. sintered alumina and hot isostatically pressed silicon nitride). By optimization of powder processing and shaping, the strength of RBAO materials was increased up to > 700 MPa in the 'as fired' state and > 1 GPa after HIPping and polishing. This was combined with a decrease in powder costs by a factor of 7 to about 8 Dollar/kg. Combining a high performance attrition mill with a spray dryer allows environmentally friendly processing of RBAO precursor powders. Recycling of the organic <b>milling</b> <b>liquid</b> increases the economy of the process. Test samples were produced demonstrating that manufacturing of this complex shape via green machining using conventional tools and shaping techniques is possible. The results show that the average strength of RBAO samples is about {{the same as that of}} isostatically pressed HIPRBSN samples suggesting that RBAO is suited as a material for bearing plates.

40|$|Ultra-fine grained {{materials}} are presently thoroughly investigated {{due to their}} enhanced mechanical properties. Cryogenic milling {{is one of the}} severe plastic deformation methods, which allow production of these materials. Titanium powder was processed by cryogenic <b>milling</b> in <b>liquid</b> nitrogen and argon and consequently consolidated via spark plasma sintering method. In this work, the influence of <b>milling</b> conditions (<b>liquid</b> nitrogen vs. liquid argon, material of balls, duration and speed of milling, usage of stearic acid) on size and shape of powder particles, contamination and mechanical properties was investigated. Particle size reduction was generally not observed, while their morphology changed significantly. Using liquid nitrogen as a cooling medium leads to strong contamination of prepared material and consequently to its hardening and embrittlement. Stearic acid supresses cold welding of particles during milling and enhances its efficiency. It is possible to eliminate stearic acid from powder by cleaning in acetone before sintering, to prevent contamination of processed material.

40|$|Kinetic {{analysis}} {{is a novel}} approach for understanding and improving processes during sintering of hard metals or other hard materials. With {{the determination of the}} kinetics using experimental results of property changes during heating, it is possible to obtain information about the specific mechanisms and to optimise the time-temperature atmosphere-profiles. Other new developments in the field of in-situ characterisation of processes during sintering are the application of macro devices for investigation of components instead of small material samples and the advancement of simultaneous techniques. The following processes are discussed: (1) desorption or vaporisation (and cracking respectively) of air, water, residues of <b>milling</b> <b>liquids</b> and lubricants; (2) melting of lubricants and WC-Co eutectics; (3) decomposition of residual hydrocarbons related to <b>milling</b> <b>liquids</b> and lubricants; (4) reduction of oxidic impurities and (5) mass transport phenomena and densification during sintering. These reactions result in length changes, mass changes, thermal effects and gas formation. They are characterised by means of thermoanalytical methods (Thermodilatometry, Differentia! Thermal Analysis, and Mass Spectrometry). Examples for the kinetic analysis of the results are presented. Kinetic {{analysis is}} a tool to model complex thermal behaviour with few parameters. The model can then be used for predictions and for process optimization. Simultaneous complex thermal analysis of outgassing, melting of the binder phase and sintering gives accurate insights into the relationship between these processes. This knowledge is important because with increasing temperatures of outgassing the sensitivity of product quality to process parameters also increases. If the outgassing takes place at unfavourable temperatures (where the shrinkage rates are too high if active surfaces are created or gasses are entrapped) pores or disturbances of the carbon balance may occur. This knowledge may also be used for the optimisation of technical processes. The thermoanalytical data are a key to understanding critical temperature ranges for product quality (initiation of reactions and ranges with high reaction rates). Thermoanalytical methods are particularly powerful for the determination of the influence of changes in material or process parameters...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to study the effect of agitation rate on butanol and ethanol production from palm oil mill effluent by Clostridium acetobutylicum. This study also investigated the type of sugar that contain in POME, the profile growth rate of C. acetobutylicum and then to investigate consumption of glucose by C. acetobutylicum during fermentation. The experiment works were conducted in schott bottle in anaerobic chamber to maintain anaerobic condition. Fermentation were carried out for 72 hours at 35 oC and maintain the concentration of POME (90 %) and inoculums concentration (10 %) using palm oil mill effluent and reinforced clostridia medium as a substrate in batch culture. The speed that used in this investigation are, 100, 150, 175 and 200 rpm. The result showed that the yield of butanol and ethanol production will increase as the speed increase until it reaches the optimum point (200 rpm). From this study, it was observed that optimum condition for butanol and ethanol fermentation by C. acetobutylicum is at 200 rpm. The concentration of butanol and ethanol from POME for 200 rpm at optimum time (72 hours) is 0. 137 g/l and 68. 958 g/l respectively. The result of this experiment showed that fresh POME is a viable media for butanol and ethanol fermentation by C. acetobutylicu...|$|R
