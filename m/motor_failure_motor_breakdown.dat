40|$|Induction motors {{plays the}} most {{important}} role in any industry. Induction motor faults results in <b>motor</b> <b>failure</b> causing <b>breakdown</b> and great loss of production due to shutdown of industry and also increases the running cost of machine with reduction in efficiency. This needs for early detection of fault with diagnosis of its root cause. In this research paper a wavelet based fault classification method has been developed for rolling element bearing in induction motor using vibration signal. Wavelet based vibration analysis {{is one of the}} most successful techniques used for condition monitoring of rotating machines. This paper describes a new condition monitoring method for induction motors based on wavelet transform. A robust bearing fault detection scheme has been developed by time-frequency domain feature extraction from vibration signals of healthy and defective machine.

The fault is diagnosed using a non linear Super-Twisting sliding mode observer. The octorotor is recovered after a <b>motor</b> <b>failure</b> by controlling its dual motor. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by numerical simulations on an octorotor simulator...|$|R

A motor plan allows decisions to be made in advance of <b>motor</b> <b>failure,</b> and increases the options available. By contrast, most motor decisions are made at the time of <b>motor</b> <b>failure,</b> and the quickest option to get a working motor is chosen with limited regard to the short or long-term cost.

40|$|Alternating current {{electric}} motors rotate at a nearly constant speed that {{is determined by}} motor design and line frequency. Energy savings of 50 % or more may be available when fixed speed systems are modified to allow for variable load requirements of a centrifugal fan or pump. 1 Loads that vary by 30 % of full load over time offer good opportunities for cost-effective adjustable speed drive (ASD) retrofits. Market assessment studies indicate that in light and medium industries, 26 % of motors exhibit fluctuating loads; 22 % of these are in process industries and 35 % are in other heavy industries. However, industrial ASD installations remain relatively low. The majority of ASD-equipped industrial motor systems are 20 horsepower (hp) or less—and often the ASD is installed to improve control over the production process versus energy savings. 2 Thus potential energy and costs savings from ASD installations are significant. Variable Frequency Drives The electronic pulse-width-modulated variable frequency drive (VFD) {{is the most common}} type of ASD and is the state-of-the-art speed control. Because of energy efficiency and control capabilities, VFD and motor combinations have replaced constant speed motors in virtually every type of industrial plant. Although VFDs have been available for many years, they are not suited for all applications. Many industrial plants use medium voltage (> 600 to 6, 600 volts [V]) to supply power to motors rated as low as 150 hp. Semiconductors for medium voltage motor applications are particularly expensive. Depending on the situation, other factors that can discourage the use of VFDs include: • Creation of harmonics, which requires installation of line reactors or harmonic filters • Voltage spikes that can lead to early <b>motor</b> <b>failure</b> • <b>Motor</b> bearing <b>failures</b> caused by induced shaft currents that flow to ground through the bearing’s rolling elements • Nuisance tripping • Limitations on the distance between the motor and VFD...|$|R
40|$|Stator inter-turn faults {{are among}} the most {{important}} electric <b>motor</b> <b>failures</b> as they progress fast and lead to catastrophic <b>motor</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Inter-turn faults are caused due to the windings’ insulation degradation. The main stress which deteriorates the insulation is the thermal one. Proper understanding of how this stress influences the electrical properties of insulation over time may lead to reliable prognosis and estimation of the motor’s remaining useful life. In transport applications where reliability and safety come first it is a critical issue. In this paper, extensive experimental testing and statistical analysis of thin film insulation for traction motor windings has been performed under fixed thermal stress. The results indicate that for high thermal stress the electrical properties of the insulation material present a non-monotonic behavior thus proving the well-known and established Arrhenius law inadequate for modelling this type of problems and estimating the remaining useful life of thin film insulation materials...|$|R

This 'bootstrapping' effect between grain radial movement and internal flow resistance is conducive to causing a rapid <b>motor</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} field study investigating {{the impact of}} single wheel hub <b>motor</b> <b>failures</b> on the dynamic behavior of a vehicle and the corresponding driver reaction is presented in this work. The experiment is performed at urban speeds on a closed off test track. The single wheel hub <b>motor</b> <b>failure</b> is emulated with an auxiliary brake system in a modified electric vehicle. Driver reaction times are derived from the measured data and discussed in their experimental context. The failure is rated and evaluated objectively based on the dynamic behavior of the vehicle. Findings indicate that driver reactions are more apparent for the accelerator pedal compared to the steering wheel response. The controllability evaluation of the vehicle behavior shows that no critical traffic situation occurs for the tested failure conditions. However, even small deviations of the vehicle can impair traffic safety, specifically for other traffic participants like bicyclist and pedestrians. QC 20150520 </p...|$|R
