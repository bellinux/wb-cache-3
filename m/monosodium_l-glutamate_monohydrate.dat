40|$|A {{solid-state}} 17 O NMR 1 H-decoupled {{double angle}} rotation (DOR) study of <b>monosodium</b> <b>l-glutamate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (l-MSG) is reported. It is shown that all eight inequivalent sites {{can be resolved}} with DOR line widths (65 Hz) 120 times narrower {{than those in the}} MAS spectrum. The lines are tentatively assigned {{on the basis of their}} behavior under proton decoupling and the isotropic chemical shift and the quadrupole interaction parameter for each extracted by a combination of DOR and 3 Q MAS at variable magnetic fields. With a shift range of 45 ppm for these similar oxygen sites and spectral resolution under DOR comparable to that for spin- 1 / 2 nuclei, solid-state 17 O NMR should have tremendous potential in the study of biomolecules...|$|E
40|$|<b>Monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> a {{multiple}} oxygen site (eight) compound, {{is used to}} demonstrate {{that a combination of}} high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopic techniques opens up new possibilities for (17) O as a nuclear probe of biomolecules. Eight oxygen sites have been resolved by double rotation (DOR) and multiple quantum (MQ) NMR experiments, despite the (17) O chemical shifts lying within a narrow shift range of < 50 ppm. (17) O DOR NMR not only provides high sensitivity and spectral resolution, but also allows a complete set of the NMR parameters (chemical shift anisotropy and electric-field gradient) to be determined from the DOR spinning-sideband manifold. These (17) O NMR parameters provide an important multi-parameter comparison with the results from the quantum chemical NMR calculations, and enable unambiguous oxygen-site assignment and allow the hydrogen positions to be refined in the crystal lattice. The difference in sensitivity between DOR and MQ NMR experiments of oxygen in bio/organic molecules is also discussed. The data presented here clearly illustrates that a high resolution (17) O solid-state NMR methodology is now available for the study of biomolecules, offering new opportunities for resolving structural information and hence new molecular insights...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{consumption}} by Bordetella pertussis growing in broth containing casein hydrolysate was examined. Serine, proline, alanine, glycine, aspartate, and glutamate were rapidly consumed, {{in a manner}} which suggested that they supplied the energy requirements of the organism; exhaustion of the energy source {{appeared to be the}} main factor limiting the yield of cells. There was no correlation between the utilization of individual amino acids and the phase of growth; uptake appeared to depend only upon relative concentrations. Consumption of threonine, phenylalanine, histidine, leucine, and methionine was slight; consumption of valine and lysine was variable, and isoleucine was excreted. The addition of <b>monosodium</b> <b>l-glutamate</b> (3 mg/ml) to the broth in shaken flasks increased the cell yield by an average of 43. 5 %. It had no detectable adverse effect upon the agglutin-producing capacity, agglutinability in antisera versus smooth and rough growth phases, mouse-lethal toxicity, histamine-sensitizing factor potency, or intracerebral protective potency of the culture. Broth supplemented with <b>monosodium</b> <b>l-glutamate</b> has been used over a 2 -year period to prepare experimental vaccines by both batch and continuous cultivation methods at controlled pH; the cell yields obtained from the supplemented broth have been up to 52 % higher than those from the basal broth. The use of glutamate to replace a proportion of casein hydrolysate in the broth caused a reduction in the cell yield, an alteration in cell morphology, and reduction in the mouse-lethal toxicity, the histamine-sensitizing factor potency, and the intracerebral protective potency of the cells...|$|R

40|$|Oral {{ingestion}} of <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate,</b> particularly when {{used as a}} seasoning in Chinese restaurant meals, has been implicated in {{a growing number of}} adverse reactions. These range from the classic Chinese Restaurant Syndrome triad of symptoms (facial pressure, chest pain, and a burning sensation) to documented cases of MSG-induced asthma. A number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have confirmed a relationship between MSG dose and CRS symptom duration and intensity, with a challenge threshold around 2. 5 gm. Studies have also confirmed MSG-provoked asthma attacks in susceptible individuals, which exhibit a reproducible time delay. While the existing data are not overwhelming, they do suggest the existence of certain subgroups within the general population that are predisposed to MSG-induced symptoms, both the CRS and asthma. Current mechanisms under consideration involve the effects of elevated serum glutamate level mediated through central and/or peripheral glutamate receptors. Much research remains to be done...|$|R

Among them, umami substances play {{an important}} role with regard to the perception of the taste of food, but, few studies have examined the taste characteristics of representative umami substances other than <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG). By conducting mouse behavioral studies (the 48 -h 2 -bottle preference test and the conditioned taste aversion test) and assessing gustatory nerve responses, we investigated the taste characteristics of unique umami substances, including sodium succinate, L-theanine, betaine, and the enantiomer of MSG, D-MSG. Furthermore, we examined the synergy of umami with inosine 5 ′-monophoshate (IMP). In the case of the mice, sodium succinate had an umami taste and showed strong synergy with IMP. L-Theanine showed synergy with IMP but did not have an umami taste without IMP. In contrast, betaine did not have an umami taste or synergy with IMP. D-MSG might have weak synergy with IMP...|$|R
40|$|The {{involvement}} of sympathoadrenal axis activity in obesity onset was investigated using the experimental model of treating neonatal rats with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate.</b> To access general {{sympathetic nervous system}} activity, we recorded the firing rates of sympathetic superior cervical ganglion nerves in animals.

The nerve firing rate of obese rats was decreased compared to the rate for lean rats. Basal catecholamine secretion decreased whereas catecholamine secretion induced by carbachol, elevated extracellular potassium, and caffeine in the isolated adrenal medulla were all increased in obese rats compared to control. Both glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinaemia were observed in obese rats. Adrenaline strongly inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion in obese animals.

40|$|<b>Monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG), {{the sodium}} salt of glutamic acid, is a widely used flavor enhancer. Early reports have claimed {{that it is the}} causal agent for adverse {{reactions}} experienced after consumption of MSG-containing meals. In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration approved MSG as "generally recognized as safe. " Still, there have been much skepticism and controversy over its potential effects. Recently, numerous well-designed studies have been conducted to investigate the existence of the MSG symptom complex. Clinical studies of MSG ingested with food have demonstrated no difference in symptoms between placebo and MSG-treated groups (6) (9). Clinical studies of MSG ingested in the absence of food have suggested {{that there may be a}} MSG-sensitive subpopulation (1). Contrary to early experimental results, the relationship between MSG and asthmatic reactions could not be demonstrated (12) (13). Finally, dietary MSG consumption would not elevate plasma glutamate concentration enough to induce neural cell death.

40|$|Actually {{this account}} {{is the story}} of the genesis of an invention[1]. The inven-tative process is not clearly understood, but one factor that seems to be im-portant is to have a heavy {{infusion}} of naivety. That is why so frequently it is not the experts that do the inventing, but they are the ones who, that once the lead is established, come in and exploit the area. Our work is an excellent illustration of this phenomenon. In the study of any of the life sciences, chiral compounds are important. In the past when chiral compounds were needed, chemists have had to use bio-chemical processes or make racemic mixtures followed by laborious resolu-tions. In industry the problem is particularly severe since resolution with its numerous recycle loops and fractional crystallizations, is an inherently ex-pensive process. Thus, large volume products like <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate,</b> L-lysine and L-menthol have been made traditionally by biochemical routes even though efficient procedures are available to make their racemic forms.

40|$|Electrochemically {{synthesized}} polypyrrole {{thin films}} doped with glutamic ions were investigated as interesting materials for potential use as molecularly selective surfaces. Pyrrole and glutamate interact in aqueous solution, {{resulting in the}} formation of a prominent band at 240 nm in the absorption spectra of the solution. This feature was assigned to the formation of a complex, which significantly influences the electrochemical deposition of polypyrrole films doped with glutamate. It was also detected that oxidation of these complexes leads to the appearance of a shoulder in the absorption spectrum at 270 nm, which corresponds to the yellowish color of pyrrole aged under influence of air. A mechanism is proposed for polymer film growth in aqueous solutions containing <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> and pyrrole.

The L-glutamic acid is produced by the genetically modified Corynebacterium glutamicum EA- 12 strain. The recipient strain Corynebacterium glutamicum  strain 2256  has been recommended for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) status. No antibiotic resistance genes were left in the genome and neither the production strain nor its recombinant DNA were detected in the final product. The Panel considered there were no safety concerns for consumers from the genetic modification. The proposed uses or use levels of L-glutamic acid and its salt derivatives produced with the current strain and the new genetically modified microorganism (GMM) strain will be identical and thus the Panel considered that the exposure to the food additive will remain unaffected. Provided that the L-glutamic acid and its salts both produced with the current strain and with the GMM strain are equal in the specifications and physicochemical characteristics, the biological and toxicological data for the L-glutamic acid and its salts produced with the current strain are considered by the Panel to support the safety of the food additives produced with the GMM strain.

We explored {{the effect of}} an oral low dose of metformin treatment in male MSG rats on adipoinsular axis and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) dysfunctions, in both basal (nonfasting) and endotoxemia conditions. MSG rats, treated or not treated with metformin (30 days prior to experimentation), and control litter-mates (CTR) were studied at 90 days of age. Peripheral concentrations of glucose, lipids, and hormones were determined in basal and post-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment conditions. Food intake and body weight (BW) were recorded and VAT mass and leptin mRNA levels were evaluated. Data indicated that MSG rats were lighter and displayed hypercorticosteronemia, hypophagia, adipoinsular axis hyperactivity, and enhanced VAT mass {{associated with an increased}} leptin gene expression. Interestingly, metformin-treated MSG rats corrected BW catch-up and counteracted VAT (mass and leptin mRNA level) and adipoinsular axis (basal and post-LPS) dysfunctions. Thus metformin treatment in MSG rats is able to correct several VAT and metabolic-endocrine dysfunctions. Our study suggests that a low-dose metformin therapy is effective to correct, at least in part, adipoinsular axis dysfunction in hypertrophic obese phenotypes, such as that of the human Cushing syndrome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM: We have {{reported}} that neonatal treatment with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG), which causes damage to the arcuate nucleus, leads to severe hyperleptinemia and reduced adrenal leptin receptor (ob-Rb) expression in adulthood. As a result, rats given MSG neonatally display corticoadrenal leptin-resistance, a defect that is overridden by normalization of corticoadrenal hyperfunction. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether negative energy conditions could correct corticoadrenal cell dysfunction in rats given MSG neonatally. METHODS: Normal (CTR) and MSG-treated female rats were subjected to food removal for 1 - 5 days, or prolonged (24 - 61 days) food restriction (FR). Plasma levels of several biomarkers and in vitro corticoadrenal function were evaluated following starvation or FR. RESULTS: Fasting for 1 - 5 days reduced plasma leptin levels in CTR and MSG rats, compared to levels in the respective groups fed ad libitum(p < 0. 05), but adrenal leptin-resistance was unchanged. With prolonged FR, isolated adrenal cells from MSG rats became sensitive to leptin, which lowered ACTH-induced glucocorticoid release. This restoration of leptin response was associated with normalization of adrenal ob-Rb gene expression. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction in some leptin-resistant obese phenotypes may normalize adrenocortical function...|$|R

We studied {{the consequences of}} MSG treatment during the acute phase response of inflammatory stress. Neonatal male rats were treated with MSG or vehicle (controls, CTR) and studied at age 90 days. Pituitary, adrenal, adipo-insular axis, immune, metabolic and gonadal functions were explored before and up to 5 h after single sub-lethal i. p. injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 150 microg/kg). Our results showed that, during the acute phase response of inflammatory stress in MSG rats: (1) the corticotrope-adrenal, leptin, insulin and triglyceride responses were higher than in CTR rats, (2) pro-inflammatory (TNFalpha) cytokine response was impaired and anti-inflammatory (IL- 10) cytokine response was normal, and (3) changes in peripheral estradiol and testosterone levels after LPS varied as in CTR rats.

In liver we assessed (a) OS (GSH and protein carbonyl groups) and inflammatory (IL- 1 b, TNFa, and PAI- 1) biomarkers and (b) carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. MSG rats displayed degenerated optic nerves, hypophagia, low body and liver weights, and enlarged adipose tissue mass; higher peripheral levels of glucose, triglycerides, insulin, uric acid, leptin, corticosterone, transaminases and TBARS, and peripheral and liver insulin resistance; elevated liver OS, inflammation markers, and glucokinase (mRNA/activity) and fructokinase (mRNA). Additionally, MSG liver phosphofructokinase- 2, glucose- 6 -phosphatase (mRNA and activity) and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, Chrebp, Srebp 1 c, fatty acid synthase, and glycerol- 3 -phosphate (mRNAs) were increased. In conclusion adult MSG rats developed an insulin-resistant state and increased OS and serious hepatic dysfunction characterized by inflammation and metabolic signs suggesting increased lipogenesis. These features, shared by both metabolic and Cushing’s syndrome human phenotypes, support that a chronic glucocorticoid-rich endogenous environment mainly impacts on hepatic glucose cycle, displacing local metabolism to lipogenesis.

We aimed to characterize the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) M 1 -M 4 subtypes in isolated pancreatic islets from pre-diabetic obese rats that had been treated neonatally with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG). Methods: At 90 days of age, both the MSG and the control groups underwent biometric and biochemical evaluation. Anti-muscarinic drugs were used to study mAChR function either in vivo or in vitro. Results: The results demonstrated that atropine treatment reduced insulin secretion in the MSG-treated and control groups, whereas treatment with an M 2 mAChR-selective antagonist increased secretion. Moreover, the insulinostatic effect of an M 3 mAChR-selective antagonist was significantly higher in the MSG-treated group. M 1 mAChR and M 3 mAChR expression was increased in the MSG-obese group by 55 % and 73 %, respectively.

We showed that l-Arg can enhance the bitterness intensity of PROP, whilst others have demonstrated a suppression of the bitterness of quinine. Here, we analyze the taste perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami and the modifications caused by l-Arg supplementation, as a function of PROP-taster status. Taste perception was assessed by testing the ability to recognize, and the responsiveness to, representative solutions of the five primary taste qualities, also when supplemented with l-Arg, in subjects classified as PROP-tasting.

OBJECTIVE: We explored whether adrenal manipulations {{could result in the}} reversion of this phenotype of hypothalamic obesity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS: Newborn male rats, treated with MSG or vehicle (CTR), were submitted to sham operation, bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX) or bilateral adrenal enucleation (AE) on day 120 of age. Animals were examined 21 days after ADX, combined or not with corticosterone (B) substitution (ADX+B), and on days 21 and 35 after AE.

The mean serum TC levels of all the treated groups were also significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than those of the control group on days 14 and 28. No lesions were observed on sections of the testes. It was concluded that MSG administration for 14, 28 and 42 days led to significantly lower serum levels of GnRH, LH, testosterone and TC, and significantly lower CESR...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the capacity of chiglitazar to improve insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG) obese rats and to determine whether its lipid-lowering effect is mediated through its activation of PPARα. Chiglitazar is a PPARα/γ dual agonist. The compound improved impaired insulin and glucose tolerance; decreased plasma insulin level and increased the insulin sensitivity index and decreased HOMA index. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies showed chiglitazar increased the glucose infusion rate in MSG obese rats. Chiglitazar inhibited alanine gluconeogenesis, lowered the hepatic glycogen level in MSG obese rats. Like rosiglitazone, chiglitazar promoted the differentiation of adipocytes and decreased the maximal diameter of adipocytes. In addition, chiglitazar decreased the fibrosis and lipid accumulation in the islets and increased the size of islets. Chiglitazar reduced plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol (TCHO), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels; lowered hepatic triglyceride and TCHO contents; decreased muscular NEFA level. Unlike rosiglitazone, chiglitazar showed significant increase of mRNA expression of PPARα, CPT 1, BIFEZ, ACO and CYP 4 A 10 in the liver of MSG obese rats. These data suggest that PPARα/γ coagonist, such as chiglitazar, affect lipid homeostasis with different mechanisms from rosiglitazone, chiglitazar may have better effects on lipid homeostasis in diabetic patients than selective PPARγ agonists...|$|R
40|$|N-(1 -Carboxyethyl) - 6 -hydroxymethyl-pyridinium- 3 -ol {{inner salt}} (alapyridaine), {{recently}} identified in heated sugar/amino acid mixtures {{as well as}} in beef bouillon, has been shown to exhibit general taste-enhancing activities, although tasteless on its own. Differing from other taste enhancers reported so far, racemic (R/S) -alapyridaine and, to an even greater extent (+) -(S) -alapyridaine, the physiologically active enantiomer, are able to enhance more than one basic taste quality. The threshold concentrations for the sweet taste of glucose and sucrose, for the umami taste of <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG) and guanosine- 5 ′-monophosphate (GMP), as well as the salty taste of NaCl, were significantly decreased when alapyridaine was present. In contrast, perception of the bitter tastes of caffeine and L-phenylalanine, as well as of sour-tasting citric acid, was unaffected. Furthermore, alapyridaine was shown to intensify known taste synergisms such as, for example, the enhancing effect of L-arginine on the salty taste of NaCl, {{as well as that of}} GMP on the umami taste of MSG. The activity of (+) -(S) -alapyridaine could be observed not only in solutions of single taste compounds, but also in more complex tastant mixtures; for example, the umami, sweet and salty taste of a solution containing MSG, sucrose, NaCl and caffeine was significantly modulated, thus indicating that alapyridaine is a general taste enhancer...|$|R
40|$|Neonatal {{treatment}} of rats with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate,</b> which destroys hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neuronal bodies, induces several metabolic abnormalities; as a result, rats develop a phenotype of pseudoobesity. This {{study was designed}} to explore, in the monosodium L-glutamate-treated female rat, the influence of chronic hyperleptinemia on adrenal cortex functionality. For this purpose, we evaluated in control and hypothalamic-damaged rats: (a) in vivo and in vitro adrenocortical function, (b) adrenal leptin receptor immunodistribution and mRNA expression, and (c) whether the inhibitory effect of leptin on adrenal function remains. Our results indicate that, compared to normal counterparts, pseudoobese animals displayed (1) hyperadiposity, despite being hypophagic and of lower body weight, (2) in vivo and in vitro enhanced adrenocortical response to ACTH stimulation, (3) an in vitro adrenal fasciculata-reticularis cell hyper-sensitivity to ACTH stimulus, (4) hyperplasia of their adrenal zona fasciculata cells, and (5) adrenal fasciculata-reticularis cell refractoriness to the inhibitory effect of leptin on ACTH-stimulated glucocorticoid production due, at least in part, to decreased adrenal leptin receptor expression. These data further support that increased hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function, in the adult neurotoxin-lesioned female rat, is mainly dependent on the development of both hyperplasia of adrenal zona fasciculata and adrenal gland refractoriness to leptin inhibitory effect. Our study supports that adrenal leptin resistance could be responsible, at least in part, for enhanced glucocorticoid circulating levels in this phenotype of obesity...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{objective}} of the current work was to test the effect of metformin on the tumor growth in rats with metabolic syndrome. Methods: We obtained pre-diabetic hyperinsulinemic rats by neonatal treatment with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG), which were chronically treated every day, from weaning to 100 day old, with dose of metformin (250 mg/kg body weight). After the end of metformin treatment, the control and MSG rats, treated or untreated with metformin, were grafted with Walker 256 carcinoma cells. Tumor weight was evaluated 14 days after cancer cell inoculation. The blood insulin, glucose levels and glucose-induced insulin secretion were evaluated. Results: Chronic metformin treatment improved the glycemic homeostasis in pre-diabetic MSG-rats, glucose intolerance, tissue insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and decreased the fat tissue accretion. Meanwhile, the metformin treatment did {{not interfere with the}} glucose insulinotropic effect on isolated pancreatic islets. Chronic treatment with metformin was able to decrease the Walker 256 tumor weight by 37 % in control and MSG rats. The data demonstrated that the anticancer effect of metformin is not related to its role in correcting metabolism imbalances, such as hyperinsulinemia. However, in morphological assay to apoptosis, metformin treatment increased programmed cell death. Conclusion: Metformin may have a direct effect on cancer growth, and it may programs the rat organism to attenuate the growth of Walker 256 carcinoma...|$|R

We aimed to study whether a diet supplemented {{with a mixture}} of n- 6 /n- 3 PUFAs, during perinatal life, attenuates outcomes of long-term metabolic dysfunction in prediabetic and obese mice. Seventy-day-old virgin female mice were mated. From the conception day, dams were fed a diet supplemented with sunflower oil and flaxseed powder (containing an n- 6 /n- 3 PUFAs ratio of 1. 2 [*]:[*] 1. 0) throughout pregnancy and lactation, while control dams received a commercial diet. Newborn mice were treated with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG, 4 [*]mg[*]g− 1 body weight per day) for the first 5 days of age. A batch of weaned pups was sacrificed to quantify the brain and pancreas total lipids; another batch were fed a commercial diet until 90 days of age, where glucose homeostasis and glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) as well as retroperitoneal fat and Lee index were assessed. MSG-treated mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, pancreatic islet dysfunction, and higher fat stores. Maternal flaxseed diet-supplementation decreased n- 6 /n- 3 PUFAs ratio in the brain and pancreas and blocked glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, GIIS impairment, and obesity development. The n- 6 /n- 3 essential PUFAs in a ratio of 1. 2 [*]:[*] 1. 0 supplemented in maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation prevent metabolic dysfunction in MSG-obesity model...|$|R
40|$|VARIVAX * [Varicella Virus Vaccine Live] is a {{preparation}} of the Oka/Merck strain of live, attenuated varicella virus. The virus was initially obtained from a child with natural varicella, then introduced into human embryonic lung cell cultures, adapted to and propagated in embryonic guinea pig cell cultures and finally propagated in human diploid cell cultures (WI- 38).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} effects of {{transient}} correction of enhanced corticoadrenal activity in <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG) -damaged female rats on peripheral insulin sensitivity and in vitro retroperitoneal (RP) adipocyte function. DESIGNS: A dose of 4 mg/g body weight (BW) of MSG or vehicle (CTR) was i. p. injected, once every 2 days, between days 2 and 10 of age, in female rats. Intact and 21 day-operated (sham or adrenal enucleation (AE)) rats from both (CTR and MSG) groups were used for experimentation on day 120 of age. Circulating levels of several hormones, in basal and after i. v. high-glucose load conditions, and RP adiposity morphology and function were then evaluated. RESULTS: MSG rats developed increased adrenocortical function, hyperadiposity, hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia and decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity. These characteristics were fully reversed after transient correction of corticoadrenal hyperactivity induced by AE. In addition, in vitro experimentation with isolated RP adipocytes indicated that cells from intact MSG animals displayed decreased sensitivity to insulin and dexamethasone stimulation of leptin secretion. Interestingly, adipocyte dysfunction in MSG rats was fully abrogated after AE-induced transient correction of insulinemia, leptinemia and adrenocortical activity. Importantly, the reversion of these metabolic abnormalities, induced by AE for 21 days, in MSG animals did occur, despite no significant changes in BW values. CONCLUSION: Our results support that the changes in adipocyte characteristics and peripheral insulin resistance, developed in this pseudo-obese female rat model, are mainly due to increased glucocorticoid production. Importantly, appropriate correction of the enhanced adrenocortical activity fully reversed these abnormal functions...|$|R
40|$|Maternal obesity {{programmes}} a {{range of}} metabolic disturbances for the offspring later in life. Moreover, environmental changes during the suckling period can influence offspring development. Because both periods significantly affect long-term metabolism, we aimed to study whether cross-fostering during the lactation period was sufficient to rescue a programmed obese phenotype in offspring induced by maternal obesity following <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG) treatment. Obesity was induced in female Wistar rats by administering subcutaneous MSG (4  mg/g body weight) for the first 5  days of postnatal life. Control and obese female rats were mated in adulthood. The resultant pups were divided into control second generation (F 2) (CTLF 2), MSG-treated second generation (F 2) (MSGF 2), which suckled from their CTL and MSG biological dams, respectively, or CTLF 2 -CR, control offspring suckled by MSG dams and MSGF 2 -CR, MSG offspring suckled by CTL dams. At 120 days of age, fat tissue accumulation, lipid profile, hypothalamic leptin signalling, glucose tolerance, glucose-induced, and adrenergic inhibition of insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets were analysed. Maternal MSG-induced obesity led to an obese phenotype in male offspring, characterized by hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperleptinaemia, dyslipidaemia, and impaired leptin signalling, suggesting central leptin resistance, glucose intolerance, impaired glucose-stimulated, and adrenergic inhibition of insulin secretion. Cross-fostering normalized body weight, food intake, leptin signalling, lipid profiles, and insulinaemia, but not glucose homeostasis or insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Our findings suggest that alterations during the lactation period can mitigate the development of obesity and prevent the programming of adult diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} mechanism-based anti-anxiety {{effects of}} Shudihuang (Radix Rehmanniae Preparata) polysaccharides (RRPPs) through two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) analysis with mass spectrometry (MS) of hippocampus proteins in rats treated with <b>monosodium</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> (MSG). MethodsMSG (4 g/kg) or normal saline (NS) was injected subcutaneously into infant male rats on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 after birth. MSG-treated rats at 8 weeks old were given NS, diazepam, or RRPPs daily for seven consecutive days by intragastric administration, while NS-treated rats {{given the same}} volume of NS. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark transition (LDT) tests were used to observe anti-anxiety effects of RRPPs at 1 h after the last administration. After EPM and LDT tests, hippocampus tissues were excised on ice rapidly from the brains of rats. Thereafter, 2 -DE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) were used for detecting differential proteins in hippocampus of rats so as to explore the potential mechanisms. ResultsRRPPs (200, 400 mg/kg) could significantly inhibit MSG-induced decrease of time and entries percentages in open zones in EPM test and numbers of light-dark transition in LDT test. Further analysis of 2 -DE and MALDI-TOF/MS indicated that β-synuclein, protein DJ- 1, peroxiredoxin- 2, peroxiredoxin- 6, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH- 1) and iron-sulfur proteins were all found to be down-regulated significantly in MSG-treated rats, while such down-regulation was significantly inhibited after treatment with RRPPs. ConclusionRRPPs showed anti-anxiety effects and potential mechanisms {{might be related to}} inhibiting MSG-induced down-regulation of β-synuclein, DJ- 1, peroxiredoxin- 2, peroxiredoxin- 6, DDAH- 1 and iron-sulfur proteins in hippocampus of rats...|$|R
