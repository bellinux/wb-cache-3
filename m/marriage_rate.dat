25|$|Patai {{states in}} his other book The Myth of the Jewish Race that {{percentage}} of cousin marriage among Jews varies extensively with geographic location. Among Israeli Ashkenazi Jews, who originate mainly from Europe, the first-cousin <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> was measured in a 1955-7 study at 1.4% and other cousin marriages at 1.06% of all marriages. But among non-Ashkenazim the first-cousin <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> was 8.8% and an additional 6.0% of marriages were between more distant cousins. Thus a total 14.6% of marriages between non-Askenazim were consanguineous compared with only 2.5% for Ashkenazim. The highest frequencies of cousin marriages were found among Jews from Iraq (28.7%) and Iran (26.3%). High rates were also found among couples from Yemen (18.3%), Aden (17.8%), Tunisia (13.4%), and among Oriental Jews from the USSR (6.9%). Jews from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey saw rates of 7–10.7%. A later 1969–70 study rated the first-cousin <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> among Ashkenazim at 0.3% and other cousin marriages at 1.0%, while for non-Askenazim the respective figures were 6.2% and 8.1%. Among the Habbani Jews in Israel, 56% of marriages are between first cousins. The Samaritans also had very high rates of inbreeding, with 43% of marriages between first cousins and 33.3% between other cousins.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of professional women, notably in America, were attempting to live outside the traditional parameters of society. Between 1870 and 1910 the <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> among educated women in the United States fell to 60% (30% lower than the national average), while, by 1893, in the state of Massachusetts alone, some 300,000 women were earning their own living in nearly 300 occupations.

25|$|The social {{composition}} of Soviet society changed drastically during the war.

For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honours and money benefits if they had a sufficient number of children—mothers could earn around 1,300 roubles for having their fourth child and earn up to 5,000 roubles for their 10th.|$|E
25|$|Barth {{finds in}} his study of {{southern}} Kurdistan that in tribal villages 57% of all marriages were cousin marriages (48% bint 'amm marriages) while in a nontribal village made up of recent immigrant families only 17% were cousin marriages (13% bint 'amm). In the South Palestinian village of Artas in the 1920s, of 264 marriages 35, or 13.3%, were paternal male cousin marriages; 69, or 26.1%, were cousin marriages. In the oasis-village of Sidi Khaled, some 170 miles south of Algiers, among the Mzabites further south, among the Chaamba, and among the Moors of the extreme western Sahara, cousin marriage is preferred. In the town of Timbuctoo, a field investigator found that among the Arabs one third of marriages are with first cousins. Half of these are with the father's brother's daughter and slightly fewer with the mother's brother's daughter. It is possible that the high MBD <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> is the result of Songhoi influence, one group of which prefers the MBD type and shuns the FBD type, and another group of which have a preference for both. The third ethnic group of Timbuctoo are the Bela, who are Tuareg slaves, and among whom marriage between cross cousins is preferred in principle, though in practice FBD marriage also occurs. In Lebanon first-cousin marriage rates differs among religious affiliation as it is found to be 17% for Christians and 30% for Muslims throughout the past century, however first-cousin marriage is declining among all marriages in Lebanon.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{suggested}} that individuals who develop paraphrenia later in life have premorbid personalities, and {{can be described as}} “quarrelsome, religious, suspicious or sensitive, unsociable and cold-hearted.” Many patients were also described as being solitary, eccentric, isolated and difficult individuals; these characteristics were also long-standing rather than introduced by the disorder. [...] Most of the traits recognized prior to the onset of paraphrenia in individuals can be grouped as either paranoid or schizoid. [...] Patients presenting with paraphrenia were most often found to be living by themselves (either single, widowed, or divorced). [...] There have also been reports of low <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> among paraphrenics and these individuals also have few or no children (possibly because of this premorbid personality).|$|E
2500|$|In the Victorian era, {{fertility}} rates increased in every decade until 1901, when the rates started evening out. [...] There {{are several reasons}} for the increase in birth rates. One is biological: with improving living standards, {{the percentage of women}} who were able to have children increased. Another possible explanation is social. In the 19th century, the <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> increased, and people were getting married {{at a very young age}} until the end of the century, when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly. The reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain. One theory is that greater prosperity allowed people to finance marriage and new households earlier than previously possible. With more births within marriage, it seems inevitable that marriage rates and birth rates would rise together.|$|E
2500|$|Ireland ranks {{fifth in}} {{the world in terms of}} gender equality. In 2011, Ireland was ranked the most {{charitable}} country in Europe, and second most charitable in the world. Contraception was controlled in Ireland until 1979, however, the receding influence of the Catholic Church has led to an increasingly secularised society. In 1983, the Eighth Amendment recognised [...] "the right to life of the unborn", subject to qualifications concerning the [...] "equal right to life" [...] of the mother. The case of Attorney General v. X subsequently prompted passage of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, guaranteeing the right to have an abortion performed abroad, and the right to learn about [...] "services" [...] that are illegal in Ireland but legal abroad. The prohibition on divorce in the 1937 Constitution was repealed in 1995 under the Fifteenth Amendment. Divorce rates in Ireland are very low compared to European Union averages (0.7 divorced people per 1,000 population in 2011) while the <b>marriage</b> <b>rate</b> in Ireland is slightly above the European Union average (4.6 marriages per 1,000 population per year in 2012).|$|E
40|$|<b>Marriage</b> <b>rates</b> have {{declined}} {{dramatically over the}} last 30 years. This paper studies to what extent divorce laws have changed incentives to marry. Using US state level panel data I provide evidence that after the adoption of unilateral divorce, <b>marriage</b> <b>rates</b> declined significantly and permanently in adopting states. This decline accounts for half of the initial gap in <b>marriage</b> <b>rates</b> between adopting and non-adopting states. The effect of unilateral divorce law is greatest for <b>marriage</b> <b>rates</b> amongst younger age cohorts, those marrying for the first time, and whites. The duration of marriages that take place under unilateral divorce is also {{found to be significantly}} greater than those that occur under mutual consent. Taken together the results suggest unilateral divorce law reduces incentives to marry, but those couples that do marry are better matched than under mutual consent. This is argued to be consistent with a model of search in marriage markets, where individuals learn the true gains of marriage over divorce before and during marriage...|$|R

2500|$|The Persian king Ardesher advised his lawyers, secretaries, officers, and husbandmen to [...] "marry near {{relatives}} for {{the sympathy}} of kinship is kept alive thereby." [...] The same motivation {{is given in}} ancient Arabic sources referring {{to the practice of}} marriage between paternal cousins prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. The Kitab al-Aghani similarly features the story of Qays ibn Dharih, who was not allowed by his father to marry a beautiful maiden from another tribe because, {{in the words of the}} father felt that as rich and wealthy man he did not want his son to take the side of a stranger. There is the related consideration that a man who grows up with a cousin in the intimate setting of one extended family knows her and so may develop his own liking or love for her. There is also the benefit of knowing the qualities of the spouse: a Syrian proverb reads, [...] "Ill luck which you know is better than good luck with which you get acquainted." [...] Keeping property in the family is a final reason for cousin marriage. One of the earliest examples of this is the five daughters of Zelophehad from ancient Israel (...) who upon inheriting from their father all married their father's brother's sons. The Quranic law dictating that daughters receive a portion of the inheritance appears to have had the effect of increasing cousin <b>marriage</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In 1957 {{the state}} of Mississippi amended its {{marriage}} law. Changes included raising the minimum age for men and women, parental consent, compulsory blood tests and proof of age. As a result, the number of marriages performed in Mississippi fell by more than 60 percent in 2 years. This paper examines {{the impact of the}} change in marriage law on <b>marriage</b> <b>rates,</b> fertility and educational attainment of women. We find that black <b>marriage</b> <b>rates</b> were affected more than white <b>marriage</b> <b>rates.</b> Among blacks women there was a decline in fertility and greater educational attainment in the group that was affected by the law. For whites, the results are mixed. There is weak evidence towards a decline in fertility and increase in educational attainment.

In the case of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, this paper explores how much of the change in female first <b>marriage</b> <b>rates</b> can be attributed to tempo effects caused by changes in the mean age and variance, and how much of it is due to quantum effects, i. e., the proportion of women who ever marry from 1970 to 2000.
