50|$|The first Sahrawi pesetas were minted in 1990, {{but they}} were not adopted as the {{national}} coin of Western Sahara until 1997. As this territory is mostly controlled by Morocco, the circulating currency {{in that part of the}} country is the Moroccan dirham, with Algerian dinars and <b>Mauritanian</b> <b>ouguiyas</b> circulating alongside the Sahrawi peseta in the Sahrawi refugee camps and the SADR-controlled part of Western Sahara.|$|R

50|$|Mauritania and Madagascar {{theoretically}} retain currencies with units whose {{values are}} in the ratio five to one: the <b>Mauritanian</b> <b>ouguiya</b> (MRO) is equivalent to five khoums, and the Malagasy ariary (MGA) to five iraimbilanja.|$|E
50|$|The only current non-decimal {{currencies}} are the Malagasy ariary (equal to five iraimbilanja) and the <b>Mauritanian</b> <b>ouguiya</b> (equal to five khoums), {{though in}} practice both {{just have one}} currency unit and no sub-unit because khoums and iraimbilanja are no longer minted.|$|E
5000|$|The ariary (sign: Ar; ISO 4217 code MGA) is the {{currency}} of Madagascar. It is subdivided into 5 iraimbilanja {{and is one of}} only two non-decimal currencies currently circulating (the other is the <b>Mauritanian</b> <b>ouguiya).</b> The names ariary and iraimbilanja derive from the pre-colonial currency, with ariary being the name for a silver dollar. Iraimbilanja means literally [...] "one iron weight" [...] and was the name of an old coin worth [...] of an ariary.|$|E
5000|$|Mauritania and Madagascar are {{the only}} {{remaining}} countries that do not use the decimal system; instead, the <b>Mauritanian</b> <b>ouguiya</b> is in theory divided into 5 khoums, while the Malagasy ariary is theoretically divided into 5 iraimbilanja. In these countries, words like dollar or pound [...] "were simply names for given weights of gold." [...] Due to inflation khoums and iraimbilanja have in practice fallen into disuse. (See non-decimal currencies for other historic currencies with non-decimal divisions.) ...|$|E
