Both components are powerful ozone destroyers. Recently, it has been inferred from observations that the direct effect of energetic particle precipitation (EPP) causes significant long-term <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> variability. Satellites observe a decrease in <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> by up to 34  % between EPP maximum and EPP minimum. Here, we analyze the climate impact of polar mesospheric and polar stratospheric ozone losses due to EPP in the coupled climate model MPI-ESM. Using radiative transfer modeling, {{we find that the}} radiative forcing of a <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> loss during polar night is small. Hence, climate effects of a <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> loss due to energetic particles seem unlikely. A stratospheric ozone loss due to energetic particles warms the winter polar stratosphere and subsequently weakens the polar vortex. However, those changes are small, and few statistically significant changes in surface climate are found...|$|E

The model reproduced most features, of the observed 27 -day sensitivity and phase lag of the profile ozone response in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, with a maximum sensitivity of + 0. 51 % per 1 % change in 205 nm flux. The model also reproduced the observed transition to a negative phase lag above 2 rob, reflecting the increasing importance with height of the solar modulated HOx chemistry on the ozone response above 45 km. The model revealed the general anti-correlation f ozone and solar UV at 65 - 75 km, and simulated strong UV responses of water vapor and HOx species in the mesosphere.

MIPAS observations of NO(x) (NO+NO 2) and O 3 of the period from 25 October to 14 November 2003 are the first global measurements of NO(x) species, covering both the summer (daylight) and winter (dark) polar regions during an SPE. Very large values of NO(x) in the upper stratosphere of 180 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) have been measured, and a large asymmetry in Northern and Southern polar cap NO(x) enhancements was found. Arctic mean polar cap (> 60 deg) NO(x) enhancements of 20 to 70 ppbv between 40 to 60 km lasted for at least two weeks, while the Antarctic mean NO(x) enhancement was between 10 and 35 ppbv and was halved after two weeks.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the activities of}} NASA grant NAG 5 - 11068, "Dynamicai Studies of the Middle Atmosphere Using High Resolution Doppler Imager Observations. " The High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) has been providing direct measurements of the Earth's horizontal wind field in the stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere. <b>Mesospheric</b> temperatures, <b>ozone,</b> and O((sup 1) D) densities, and stratospheric aerosol extinctions coefficients, are also retrieved. The goal of HRDI is to measure the vector winds in the stratosphere (10 - 40 km), mesosphere, and lower thermosphere (approximately 50 - 120 km) during the day, and the lower thermosphere at night (approximately 95 km) to an accuracy of 5 m/s. The horizontal wind vector is measured by observing the Doppler shift of rotational lines of molecular oxygen along two lines of sight. In addition to winds, temperatures and volume emission rates are determined in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, from which ozone and O((sup 1) D) concentrations can be derived, and aerosol scattering coefficients are determined in the stratosphere. UARS was launched on September 12, 1991, into a 585 -km circular orbit inclined 57 degrees to the equator HRDI was activated September 28, 1991 and following a period of checkout and adjustment of the instrument parameters, scientific observations began November 2, 199 1. HRDI operated nearly continuously from launch until April 1995. At that time the UARS solar array drive failed, forcing the instruments to time-share the available power. From July 1995 to July 1996 HRDI operated approximately 50 % of the time. At that point, {{one of the three}} spacecraft batteries failed and from then until September 1998 the duty cycle was less than 20 % per month, At that time it was determined that HRDI could operate during each daytime pass, which increased the daytime duty cycle to close to l 00 %, while nighttime operations were limited to about a week per month. In the fall of 1999, the second tape recorder failed requiring a real time contact with a TRDSS satellite to retrieve that data. This resulted in about 60 % data collection efficiency. Finally, in the summer of 2000, the second star sensor failed requiring the spacecraft attitude to be controlled by a three axis magnetometer and sun sensor. This resulted in a loss of attitude knowledge but operations continue with the anticipation of correcting the attitude.

This represents the first full-wavelength SATIRE-S reconstruction to cover the last three solar cycles without data gaps and with an uncertainty estimate. SATIRE-S is compared with the NRLSSI model and SORCE/SOLSTICE ultraviolet (UV) observations. SATIRE-S displays similar cycle behaviour to NRLSSI for wavelengths below 242 nm and almost twice the variability between 242 and 310 nm. During the decline of last solar cycle, between 2003 and 2008, SSI from SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 and 10 typically displays {{more than three times}} the variability of SATIRE-S between 200 and 300 nm.

40|$|Energetic {{particle}} precipitation (EPP) enhances odd nitrogen (NOx) in {{the polar}} upper atmosphere. Model {{studies have reported}} a solar cycle response in <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> (O 3) caused by EPP-related NOx enhancements which are included by applying a vertical NOx flux at around 80 km. However, {{it is not clear}} how O 3 can be affected when the main chemical catalyst of odd oxygen (Ox = O + O(1 D) + O 3) loss in the mesosphere is odd hydrogen (HOx). Here we use a 1 -D atmospheric model and show how enhanced NOx affects mesospheric chemistry and changes HOx partitioning, which subsequently leads to increase in Ox loss through standard HOx-driven catalytic cycles. Another, smaller increase of Ox loss results from HOx storage in HNO 3 during night and its release by daytime photodissociation. Our results suggest that EPP, through NOx enhancements, could have a longer-term effect on mesospheric HOx and Ox in polar winter...|$|E
40|$|In its motion {{through the}} Galaxy the sun may have {{suffered}} a number of encounters with dense interstellar clouds for which the number density of molecular hydrogen is in excess of 1000 per cu cm. Several authors have shown that this is sufficient density to stop the solar wind inside earth's orbit. Earth's atmosphere would be subjected to an interstellar H 2 flux of more than 7 billion per sq cm/sec for periods {{of the order of}} 100, 000 years. Simple scaling arguments are used to examine several consequences for earth's atmosphere: (1) the ionospheric F region would largely disappear; (2) the water-vapor content of the middle atmosphere would be greatly enhanced, reducing the <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations and thereby lowering the average temperature and altitude of the mesopause; (3) as a result of (2), widespread mesospheric ice clouds would occur, increasing the planetary albedo; and (4) the resultant radiative cooling at the surface may have been sufficient to 'trigger' an ice age...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{photochemical model}} of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere is compared with three extensive sets of ozone observations: Atmospheric Explorer-E backscattered ultraviolet experiment (BUV), Nimbus- 4 BUV, and rocket flights from Wallops Flight Center (ROCOZ). The Nimbus- 4 and rocket observations are most sensitive to ozone between 30 and 50 km, whereas observations from AE-E measure the abundance of ozone up to 70 km. The photochemical model accurately reproduces the observed relationship between BUV intensity and local solar zenith angle, although the absolute calibration on AE-E {{appears to be in}} error. The AE-E observations and the model both exhibit a morning-afternoon asymmetry, with more ozone in the morning owing to the build up of HO x  species in the afternoon. Seasonal changes in atmospheric temperature produce an annual maximum in tropical <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> during June-July-August. The amplitude of the observed effect is somewhat larger than calculated by the model. Some problems appear to remain with the presently accepted kinetic rates for HO x  species in the atmosphere...|$|E
3000|$|On the TLE, the night-time <b>mesospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is well mixed {{from the}} equator to the poles (Fig. 10 e). The day side ozone is visibly {{depleted}} {{due to the}} tidal locking, with O_ 2 and O_ 3 constantly photodissociated towards odd oxygen. Due to its long lifetime, odd oxygen is then transported through the horizontal circulation, as shown in Fig. 6, from the day to the night side where it recombines to form ozone. The ozone is further enhanced by the transportation of odd oxygen-rich air to the night side through the vertical circulation, {{by means of an}} upwelling centred over the subsolar point and then a downwelling centred on the antisolar point, where it recombines to form ozone. Consequently, the POC appears enhanced on the night side compared to its PDE counterpart. From Fig. 10 e, we determined that on the TLE the mean night side POC is 0.40 DU and the mean day side POC is 0.28 DU. Therefore, the TLE mesospheric day–night side variation is ∼ 43 [...]...|$|E
