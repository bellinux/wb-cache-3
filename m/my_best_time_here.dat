5000|$|This {{performance}} qualified {{her for the}} World Half Marathon Championships in Birmingham, {{where she}} outpaced Aberu Kebede to win her first world championship, set a new personal best of 1:06:36, and broke the championship record. She won a second gold medal {{as part of the}} winning Kenyan squad in the team competition. Reflecting on the win, she noted, [...] "It's <b>my</b> <b>best</b> ever <b>time,</b> so I'm so happy.... I had a baby just 1 year and 3 months ago." [...] Her 15 kilometre interval time, 46:51 minutes, was faster than the world record of 46:55 held by Kayoko Fukushi of Japan; however, Keitany's time was not ratified as a new world record because of the lower elevation of the 15 kilometre mark compared to the race start. Her time was the second fastest ever in the half marathon (after Lornah Kiplagat). The half marathon time was a new African record, with the previous record of 1:06:44 hours set by Elana Meyer of South Africa in 1999. Keitany also beat the previous Kenyan record of 1:06:48 that she set in Udine two years earlier. The director of the New York City Marathon, Mary Wittenberg, suggested that she could become a world-beater over the full marathon distance in the coming years.|$|R
