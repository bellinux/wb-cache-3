5|$|Chandru keeps {{following}} Rekha; one {{day when}} she goes to visit her friend, he makes her unconscious and takes her away to a bungalow in Ooty. When she regains consciousness, he tells {{her that he had}} purchased this house in Ooty only for her, and again asks her to marry him. When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at least a month so that she can understand him better, and then reduces it to a week. He <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> the arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away. However, he catches and imprisons her in the garage of his house, but is hospitalised for his injury.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Kennard {{was among}} twenty-one legislators who toured areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. The lawmaker said: [...] "To me, {{it just looks}} like swampland. There's not even the {{remnants}} of homes for blocks ... I think it should <b>make</b> <b>all</b> of us humble. It should <b>make</b> <b>all</b> of us sympathetic. It should <b>make</b> <b>all</b> of us thankful for {{what we have been}} spared." [...] The legislators toured the area three days before they convened for a special session called by Democratic Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco to consider hurricane-recovery issues.|$|R

5|$|Free updates to {{the game}} were {{released}} to provide fixes and updates {{to the game}}, some based on community feedback. These included: a Big Head mode, which <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> characters in the game have disproportionate heads; a photo mode, which allows players to edit photos taken during gameplay; {{the ability to use}} the original voice cast, with localized subtitles; and updates to the game's AR challenges. These included the ability to select all playable characters from the game and its downloadable content (DLC) to be used in all combat and predator challenge maps. Previously, each map had predefined character selection; the addition of a harder difficulty setting on combat challenges; more round-based challenges as well as interior map locations; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges, which players found distracting.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> {{decisions by}} itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
