In early April, Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues, dropping more rainfall in 24hours than the average <b>monthly</b> <b>total.</b> Later, Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone, but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island. The final storm of the season, Jenna, formed in the Australian region, briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean, and proceeded to exit the basin on May4 to end the season. In addition to the named storms, several tropical depressions were tracked, one of which in December dropped heavy rainfall on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. In the two years since he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest <b>monthly</b> <b>total</b> of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E

The record began Oli 1 st May 1930. There were few gaps in the record: {{in the second half of}} 1939 (from August to December), in 1945 and in January 1946. They all were connected with beginning and endirig of The Second World War. In analysed period mean annual precipitation was 560. 2 mm (fab. 1). In annual course the maximum was in July (83. 8 mm on average) and minimum in February (29. 3 mm). Minor maximum was in October (37. 2 mm) just before minor minimum in November (45. 7 mm). The variability of <b>monthly</b> <b>totals,</b> defined by extremal values and standard deviation was the largest in July and the lowest in March. However the relative variability, described by coefficient of variation, was the highest in October (80 %) and the lowest in March and April (48 %).

40|$|We use the {{principle}} of maximum entropy to propose a parsimonious model for the generation of simulated rainfall during the wettest three-month season at a typical location {{on the east coast}} of Australia. The model uses a checkerboard copula of maximum entropy to model the joint probability distribution for total seasonal rainfall and a set of two-parameter gamma distributions to model each of the marginal <b>monthly</b> rainfall <b>totals.</b> The model allows us to match the grade correlation coefficients for the checkerboard copula to the observed Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the monthly rainfalls and, hence, provides a model that correctly describes the mean and variance for each of the <b>monthly</b> <b>totals</b> and also for the overall seasonal total. Thus, we avoid the need for a posteriori adjustment of simulated <b>monthly</b> <b>totals</b> in order to correctly simulate the observed seasonal statistics.

25|$|The {{most serious}} {{omissions}} {{were in their}} underestimations related to the strategic sphere. OKL had vastly underestimated Soviet production capabilities. This reflected a lack of training of the German General Staff in strategic and economic warfare matters. Though a war of attrition and the realisation of total Soviet military potential was the worst-case scenario, it was left out of any planning considerations. The relationship between the civilian sector, Soviet air rearmament, and {{the morale of the}} Soviet people were also underestimated. Civilian requirements were considered too high for production to be efficient, and Soviet determination to restrict civilian needs in favour of the war effort was underrated. The Soviet ability to switch production to the Urals, a region which the Germans considered as underdeveloped, was critical to Soviet war materiel production. The Germans did not believe this to be possible. The Luftwaffe's assessment that the rail transport system was primitive also proved to be ill-founded. Reinforcements steadily reached the front during Barbarossa. Production itself was also understimated. In 1939, the Soviet Union produced 2,000 more aircraft than Germany per year (Germany was producing just over 10,000). A <b>monthly</b> <b>total</b> of 3,500 to 4,000 aircraft were built by the Soviets; Schmid and Ernst Udet, the Luftwaffe's director of air armaments, gave figures of 600 per month, a serious underestimation.

40|$|Abstract: We propose {{and justify}} {{a model for}} {{seasonal}} rainfall using a copula of maximum entropy to model the joint distribution and using gamma distributions to model the marginal monthly rainfalls. The model allows correlation between individual months and thereby enables a much improved model for seasonal variation. A central theme is the principle of maximum entropy which we use {{to find the most}} parsimonious representation for the underlying distributions—using the minimum possible number of parameters to model the relevant physical characteristics. A particular emphasis is the use of the gamma distribution to model the marginal monthly rainfalls. We wish to simulate monthly and seasonal rainfall at Kempsey, NSW during February–March–April. Our first task is to explain why we choose to model <b>monthly</b> rainfall <b>totals</b> using the gamma distribution. The principle of maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1957 a, 1957 b) states that, subject to precisely stated prior data, the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy. We will use this principle to argue that the gamma distribution is the best distribution to represent <b>monthly</b> rainfall <b>totals</b> provided the means of the observed <b>monthly</b> <b>totals</b> and the natural logarithm of the observed <b>monthly</b> <b>totals</b> are both well-defined and finite. This is true if the observed totals are always strictly positive. Our second task is to devise a graphical representation that displays the gamma distribution in the simplest possible way—a...|$|R

Additionally, this study aimed to assess the incremental and relative economic and healthcare resource burden of new-onset epilepsy compared with those without newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods: Arizona Medicaid claims data years 2008 through 2010 were used for this analysis. Patients who were at least 65 years of age as of January 1, 2009 and were continuously enrolled in any coverage group pertaining to Arizona Medicaid for at least 12 months during 2008 and 2009 were considered eligible for the 2009 cohort; patients who were continuously enrolled during 2008 but not at all during 2009 were excluded. In addition to meeting the criteria for the 2009 cohort, incident cases of 2009 must also have epilepsy-related healthcare claims, a one-year clean period during which they cannot have any epilepsy-related healthcare claim, and that their first epilepsy-related healthcare claim in 2009 cannot have with a diagnosis code of 345. x 1.
