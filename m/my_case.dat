25|$|Growing up in {{southern}} California, Hill was asthmatic {{as a child}} and, as a result, missed several years of school.Despite the discomfort, it made you comfortable being alone with yourself. You weren't as surrounded by your peers as everybody else your age was... In <b>my</b> <b>case</b> it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it enabled me {{to live in an}} imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.|$|E
25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In <b>my</b> <b>case</b> to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E

500|$|Walsh was {{partnered with}} new-signing Paul Stewart for the 1988–89 season, whilst fellow new arrival Paul Gascoigne boosted both the club's attacking {{potential}} and drinking culture. Spurs had a poor {{start to the}} season and were in a relegation battle by December, and only Gascoigne and Chris Waddle were creating and scoring goals. Walsh felt that manager Terry Venables was too easy on the players, and particularly too easy on Walsh himself who [...] "needed someone on <b>my</b> <b>case</b> a bit more". He later described the season as [...] "just a blur" [...] as Spurs turned their campaign around to finish in sixth place despite Walsh scoring just six goals from 32 starts and five substitute appearances.|$|E
500|$|About a week later, the {{original}} page of Valor por Tamaulipas reopened, but the administrator issued a communiqué {{in which he}} indicated that the page was going to close permanently after 8 days. On Facebook the administrator explained {{that he could not}} continue collaborating at Valor por Tamaulipas because of his inability to properly manage the page. [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> organized crime won, but it has defeated me and not society; it has defeated me and my family, but it has not defeated that thousands of contributors who trusted this page and reported despite their fears", the administrator said. He also talked about his experience and the lessons he learned as head of the page, and then thanked those who supported and trusted him for over a year. The administrator concluded by asking his followers to forgive him.|$|E

500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed. I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|It is {{also stated}} that my name, my real name, {{that is the one}} I am known by, is not my real name. Now one is given one's name—one's {{authentic}} ones—at some such ceremony as baptism, Christening, or the like, on the occasion of one's formal reception into a certain religious Faith. In the ancient Zarathustrian Parsi community to which, on my father's side, I have the honour to belong, this ceremony is normally performed, as in other Faiths, in childhood, or owing to special circumstances as in <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> later in life, when I assumed my name as it now is or, {{in the words of the}} legal document in which this is mentioned [...] "...received into the Parsi community and in accordance with the custom and tradition thereof, is now and will be henceforth known as..."

500|$|Otto Frank {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, [...] "It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In <b>my</b> <b>case</b> the role is reversed." [...] He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, [...] "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because [...] "people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this." ...|$|E
40|$|International {{science and}} {{technology}} cooperation has become increasingly important when facing the global challenges such as climate change, food security and health issues. Both Norwegian and EU strategies {{stress the importance of}} pooling our financial, infrastructure and knowledge resources together. The Joint Programming Initiatives (JPI) are bottom-up, member state driven initiatives set up to coordinate national efforts and pooling together resources to handle the challenges. This thesis is an explorative case study of Norwegian participation in three of the JPIs, with a focus on national motives and funding structures. The central issues from the principal-agent framework, goal conflict, moral hazard and adverse selection, have been used to highlight some of the governance challenges. I used document studies and semi structured interviews of representatives from the Ministry and Agency level to collect my empirical data. My studies show that the motives for participation are linked to social, scientific and economical drivers. For one of <b>my</b> <b>cases</b> economic return and strengthening the competitiveness of national research communities was an important driver, for two of <b>my</b> <b>cases</b> the chance to influence the European research agenda is an important motive, and access to knowledge and facing the grand challenges together is important for all <b>my</b> <b>cases.</b> There are slight differences in the governance structures of each JPI, and the funding arrangements mirror this. The case with the strongest strategic influence motive intends to use mostly institutionalized funding, while the two others have only just started to tackle this issue. Key words: ERA, EU, international STI cooperation, JPI, funding models, principal-agen...|$|R
5000|$|Deprogramming {{has often}} been {{associated}} with kidnapping, which has in some cases {{been part of the}} procedure. The percentage stated of cases involving kidnapping varies considerably, depending on the source. Joseph Szimhart, a deprogrammer and self-described former cult member, says [...] "until 1992, in a low percentage of <b>my</b> <b>cases,</b> included situations in which families elected to confine and sometimes abduct a 'cultist' to a deprogramming." ...|$|R

500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 May 2012, Chen {{published}} {{an editorial in}} the New York Times criticizing the Chinese government and the Communist Party for the [...] "lawless punishment inflicted on (himself) and (his) family over the past seven years." [...] He said that [...] "those who handled <b>my</b> <b>case</b> were able to openly flout the nation’s laws in many ways for many years." [...] In an April 2013 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Chen said that Chinese authorities had failed to deliver on promises to investigate allegations of mistreatment against him and his family. Chen issued a statement in June saying NYU is forcing him to leave at the end of June because of pressure from the Chinese government. This claim was denied by the university, as well as by professor Jerome A. Cohen, Chen's mentor who arranged for his placement at NYU. Chen's close association with conservative Christian and pro-life figures since coming to the United States, including representative Chris Smith, pastor Bob Fu, and media consultant Mark Corallo, has concerned old supporters like Cohen.|$|E
500|$|Despite being married, Beatrice {{fulfilled}} {{her promise}} to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Queen Victoria warmed to Henry, as she often did with other handsome, strong men. However, the Queen criticised Beatrice's conduct {{during her first}} pregnancy. When Beatrice stopped coming to the Queen's dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her physician, Dr James Reid, that, [...] "I [...] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in her own room, which is very bad for her. In <b>my</b> <b>case</b> I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day." [...] Beatrice, aided by chloroform, gave birth the following week to her first son, Alexander. Despite suffering a miscarriage {{in the early months}} of her marriage, Beatrice gave birth to four children: Alexander, called [...] "Drino", was born in 1886; Ena in 1887; Leopold in 1889 and Maurice in 1891. Following this, she took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues, such as conditions in the coal mines. However, this interest did not extend to changing the conditions of poverty, as it had done with her brother, the Prince of Wales.|$|E

500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in <b>my</b> <b>case</b> it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That had never occurred to me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E
