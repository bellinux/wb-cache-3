Other examples include <b>micrograft</b> surgery, which involves the deposition of adipose tissue, previously taken from the waist, into the buttocks.

40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Micrograft</b> {{transplantation}} {{is accompanied}} by a transient induction of telogen in transplanted hair follicles (HF), which might be avoided by supporting the metabolic pathways of the <b>micrograft</b> during the ex vivo period. Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) has been suggested to influence HF growth and cycling in humans, but the mechanisms are unclear. Method: HFs were obtained from patients undergoing routine <b>micrograft</b> transplantation and were cultured for 5 days in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles Medium, supplemented with different amounts of vitamin B 12. Hair shaft elongation (HSE) of the isolated HFs as well as quantitative changes of mRNA for beta-catenin, glykogensynthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) and TCF/Lef- 1 in HF cells were determined. Results: In vitro HSE demonstrated a dose dependent induction of HSE after stimulation with 2. 5 ug/ml and 25 ug/ml vitamin B 12 (6. 2 +/- 2. 1 % and 15. 4 +/- 3. 8 % respectively). A dose dependent induction of beta-catenin-mRNA could be demonstrated in cultured HFs after stimulation with 2. 5 ug/ml and 25 ug/ml vitamin B 12 (fold change compared to DMEM: 9. 5 +/- 2. 7, p < 0. 05 and 23. 1 +/- 7. 4, p < 0. 01; respectively). Concomitantly the amounts of GSK- 3 were significantly reduced after stimulation with 25 ug/ml vitamin B 12 (fold change compared to DMEM: 0. 76 +/- 0. 12, p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a hair growth promoting effect of vitamin B 12 in vitro. This effect {{is accompanied by}} the modulation of intracellular signal transduction molecules of the wnt-pathway and might promote hair growth after <b>micrograft</b> transplantation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The atrial {{appendages}} are {{a tissue}} reservoir for cardiac stem cells. During on-pump {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery, part of the right atrial appendage can be excised upon insertion of the right atrial cannula of the heart-lung machine. In the operating room, the removed tissue can be easily cut into <b>micrografts</b> for transplantation. This trial aims to assess the safety and feasibility of epicardial transplantation of atrial appendage <b>micrografts</b> in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Methods/design Autologous cardiac <b>micrografts</b> are made from leftover right atrial appendage during CABG of 6 patients. Atrial appendage is mechanically processed to <b>micrografts</b> consisting of atrial appendage-derived cells (AADCs) and their extracellular matrix (ECM). The <b>micrografts</b> are epicardially transplanted in a fibrin gel and covered with a tissue-engineered ECM sheet. Parameters including echocardiography—reflecting cardiac insufficiency—are studied pre- and post-operatively as well as at 3 and 6  months of the follow-up. Cardiac functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed preoperatively and at 6 -month follow-up. The primary outcome measures are patient safety in terms of hemodynamic and cardiac function over time and feasibility of therapy administration in a clinical setting. Secondary outcome measures are left ventricular wall thickness, change in the amount of myocardial scar tissue, changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, New York Heart Association class, days in hospital, and changes in the quality of life. Twenty patients undergoing routine CAGB surgery will be recruited to serve as a control group. Discussion This study aims to address the surgical feasibility and patient safety of epicardially delivered atrial appendage <b>micrografts</b> during CABG surgery.

40|$|The {{surgical}} treatment of alopecia is essentially based on minigraft and <b>micrograft</b> techniques in which grafts are inserted into a slit or punch recipient site. To facilitate the transplantation {{of large numbers}} of these small grafts, the Calvitron automated hair transplant system has been developed. We report a case of Norwood type V alopecia who received three sessions of hair transplantation (400 - 500 grafts per session) over 18 months with satisfactory results. During surgery, with one technician operating the machine, one surgeon and an assistant took 3. 5 to 4 hours per session to accomplish the whole procedure from harvesting the grafts to implantation and closure of the donor scalp wound. This new automated minigraft and <b>micrograft</b> transplant technique is significantly timesaving for large numbers of grafts per session without altering the aesthetic results. It offers a good choice for hair replacement surgery to save manpower and cost.

Furthermore in vitro grafted plants may constitute a suitable tool for ex situ conservation. On-going research on different species of Cactaceae is testing if this method is suitable for other endangered species. The micrografting technique fulfils the definition of artificial propagation as requested by CITES and does not cause damage to the wild populations of the species and therefore can be considered “non detrimental” for the wild populations.|$|E

A maior porcentagem de microenxertos com fenda aberta ocorreu nas microenxertias realizadas no hipocótilo. As maiores porcentagens de microenxertos sobreviventes foram obtidas nas microenxertias realizadas no caule, e o tipo de enxertia mais eficiente foi a garfagem de topo sem fenda. A presença de calo aparente foi resultado da interação dos três fatores testados, com maior presença de calo nas enxertias realizadas no hipocótilo.

The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design (CRD) with two factors. The first factor was the rootstock type, i. e. rooted planlet from the germination of quartered seed, and rooted planlet from the germination of undivided seeds. The second factor was the developmental phase of scion, i. e. dormant buds, and flush (had new leaf more than 2 - 4 mm). The results showed that rootstock derived from the germination of undivided seed had a higher success rate than other treatments on all variables, except for number of new leaves. The use of flush as scion was better than dormant buds; flush resulted in a higher percentage of successful <b>micrograft</b> and longer shoots.

This paper proposes a {{protocol}} of rejuvenation of four Sahelian ligneous species : Acacia senegal, Faidherbia albida, Tamarindus indica and Ziziphus mauritian. It consists in aseptically removing a small scion (5 - 10 mm in length) and in micrografting {{it on to}} a seeding grown in vitro used as rootstock. The main elements of success are {{the age of the}} rootstock (two to six weeks depending on species), the level of grafting (on hypocotyl instead of epicotyl) and the origin of the scion (apex have higher growth after micrografting than axillary buds). The method developed was applied to the restoration of juvenile traits of adult trees. The main criterion is the rooting ability of microcuttings sampled on scions, after micrografting. Rooting competence restoration depends on the species, the nature of the first copy of the donor tree and the number of cycles of micrografting. The rejuvenation was more definite for F. albida, mobilised by root cuttings. In this case, one third of the microcuttings rooted after the first cycle of micrografting and 75 % after the second.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that intrastriatal transplants of {{dopamine}} (DA) -rich fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue can correct denervation-induced changes in the cellular expression of neuropeptide and receptor mRNAs in the rat Parkinson model. However, with the standard transplantation approach normalization of all cellular parameters has not been obtained. This may be due either to the incomplete striatal reinnervation achieved by these transplants, or to the ectopic placement of the grafts. In the present study we have used a microtransplantation approach to obtain a more complete reinnervation of the denervated striatum (20 <b>micrograft</b> deposits spread over the entire structure). Neurons were also implanted directly into the substantia nigra. In rats with multiple intrastriatal VM transplants the lesion-induced upregulation of mRNAs encoding for preproenkephalin (PPE), the D 2 -type DA-receptor, and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 67) was normalized throughout the striatum, whereas the lesion-induced downregulation of preprotachykinin mRNA was unaffected. Intranigral grafts of either fetal DA-rich VM tissue or GABA-rich striatal tissue did not induce any changes in striatal neuropeptide and D 2 -receptor mRNA expression despite significant behavioral improvement. Comparison of the behavioral data with levels of neuropeptide expression showed that in rats with intrastriatal VM transplants a complete normalization of striatal PPE and GAD 67 mRNA expression did not translate into a complete recovery of spontaneous motor behaviors. The results show that extensive DA reinnervation of the host striatum by multiple VM microtransplants is insufficient to obtain full recovery of all lesion-induced changes at both the cellular and the behavioral level. A full reconstruction of the nigrostriatal pathway or, alternatively, modulation of basal ganglia function by grafting in non-striatal regions may be required to further improve the functional outcome in the DA-denervated brain...|$|E

Secondly, we compared the <b>micrograft's</b> behavior with respect to biomaterial alone, including Bio-Oss® and PLGA/HA, commercially named Alos. Sinus lift procedure was performed on 24 patients who required dental implants and who, according to the study design and procedure performed, were divided into three groups: group A (Alos + periosteum-derived micrografts); group B (Alos alone); and group C (Bio-Oss® alone). Briefly, in group A, a small piece of periosteum was collected from each patient and mechanically disaggregated by Rigenera® protocol using the Rigeneracons medical device. This protocol allowed for the obtainment of autologous <b>micrografts,</b> which in turn were used to soak the Alos scaffold. At 6 months after the sinus lift procedure and before the installation of dental implants, histological and radiographic evaluations in all three groups were performed. In group A, where sinus lift augmentation was performed using periosteum-derived <b>micrografts</b> and Alos, the bone regeneration was much faster than in the control groups where it was performed with Alos or Bio-Oss® alone (groups B and C, respectively).

From: Bois et Forêts des Tropiques, 2002, N° 272 With {{a variety of}} uses in dry areas, the jujube tree (Ziziphus mauritania Lam.) is always a candidate for propagation, and now <b>micrografting</b> techniques are offering prospects of massive production...|$|R
40|$|In vivo <b>micrografting</b> of Santalum {{album was}} {{achieved}} (50 %) by grafting 4 - to 5 -cm-long scions, collected from a candidate plus tree (CPT) of 50 - 60 years of age, onto 90 -day-old nursery-grown rootstock. Scion size, rootstock age, and scion collection season {{were found to}} influence graft success. Grafted plants were incubated under greenhouse conditions for 6 - 8 weeks during the graft union process. In vitro <b>micrografts</b> were achieved by placing 1 - to 2 -cm-long scions derived from nodal shoot segments (collected from CPT) onto the hypocotyl of 45 -day-old in vitro rootstocks. Use of in vitro grown shoots {{as a source of}} scion gave better graft success (60 %) than scions collected directly from field-grown trees. In vitro grafting was also influenced by scion size and rootstock age. Under favorable conditions, scions and hypocotyls unite to form complete plants that produced two to four leaves after 6 - 8 weeks. This is the first report on in vivo and in vitro <b>micrografting</b> of S. album having potential for production of disease-free clonal plants for conservation and improvement targets...|$|R
50|$|Today’s {{prevailing}} {{technique is}} a follicular unit transplant (FUT). Follicular unit transplants require {{the separation of}} follicles in their natural groupings. Under a microscope the hair in the donor area can be seen growing in patterns of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hairs. Most common are the 1, 2 and 3 hair groupings. <b>Micrografts</b> or single hair grafts are placed in the frontal hairline while FU Grafts containing 2 to 4 hairs are placed behind the hairline. Results with this technique are generally very natural but can lack density and require more than one surgery for satisfying results. For some doctors, using <b>micrografts</b> and follicular units only is not enough. Instead, they choose to use a mixture of micro grafts, FU grafts and “Multiple Follicular Unit Grafts”.|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} an eyebrow, either partial or total, has been {{observed}} in patients with craniofacial clefts, such as the Tessier 9 to 13 cleft. Several techniques {{have been used to}} improve the appearance of the region, such as island scalp flaps and scalp strip grafting, with limited or marginally satisfactory aesthetic results. The authors report 2 patients with craniofacial clefts in whom a novel technique combining 2 separate surgical approaches, <b>micrografting</b> and tattooing, was used. The use of <b>micrografting</b> with single or double hair units, properly angulated, produces natural-looking and satisfactory results with a minimum of morbidity. Excellent volume and appearance of the eyebrow may be achieved in a single session using this technique. Tattooing performed subsequently over the microimplanted hairs provides the illusion of greater density to the eyebrow, resulting in an appearance closer to normal...|$|R

40|$|Background: Melanocytes {{transplant}} {{for treatment}} of vitiligo is a common therapy using different surgical procedures. But there was no interest in repigmentation of grayness of hair in the treated vitiliginous area. Objective: To do melanocytes transplant from donor area into the recipient vitiliginous area with associated gray hair. Patient and Methods: This is a case interventional study was done in Department of Dermatology/Baghdad Teaching Hospital from February 2011 -March 2012. Eleven patients were enrolled in this study, six males and five females with vitiligo in as-sociation of gray hair. Their ages ranged from 8 - 35 years with a mean ± SD of 20. 90 ± 7. 006. Melanocytes transplant in patients with vitiligo using needling <b>micrografting</b> technique for twelve patches and direct melanocytes transplant from normal donor area into vitiliginous recipient area by dermabrasion technique for eleven patches. Dressing was applied and patients were seen every two weeks for the first month and monthly for one year. Results: Repigmentation of the vitiliginous area was started after two weeks and was obvious at one month that progressed over time. The repigmentation of hair appeared usually after few months and was obvious after four months and the repigmentation of gray hair was quicker in patients with <b>micrografting</b> technique than those with dermabrasion technique. The mean rate of repigmentation was 18. 3 % at six months and 37. 5 % at twelve months in <b>micrografting</b> technique while the mean rat...|$|R

40|$|The {{inability}} to induce rooting of in vitro-established Protea cynaroides microshoots has prevented {{the production of}} complete plantlets. A successful shoot-tip <b>micrografting</b> technique was developed using in vitro-germinated P. cynaroides seedlings as rootstocks and axenic microshoots established from pot plants as microscions. Thirty-day old seedlings, germinated on growth-regulator-free, half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium, were decapitated and a vertical incision made from the top end. The bottom ends of microshoots established on modified Murashige and Skoog medium were cut into a wedge (‘V’) shape, and placed into the incision. The <b>micrografted</b> explants were cultured in a growth chamber with the temperature adjusted to 25 ± 2 °C, with a 12 -h photoperiod. Best results were obtained by placing the microscions directly onto the rootstock without any pre-treatments. Dipping the explants in anti-oxidant solution or placing a layer of medium around the graft area led to the blackening of the microscion.

30|$|Several taxa of Cactaceae are {{endangered}} by overcollection for commercial purposes, {{and most of}} the family is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). Micropropagation may play a key role to keep the pressure off wild populations and contribute to ex situ conservation of endangered taxa. One of the limits of micropropagation is the species-specific requirement of plant regulators for each taxon and sometimes even for different genotypes. With the <b>micrografting</b> technique the rootstock directly provides the scion with the necessary hormonal requirements. In this paper we present data on in vitro grafting of Pelecyphora aselliformis Ehrenberg, an Appendix I CITES listed species critically endangered and sought after by the horticultural trade, on micropropagated Opuntia ficus-indica Miller. Apical and sub-apical scions of P. aselliformis were used to perform <b>micrografting</b> with a successful rate of 97 and 81  % respectively. Survival rate after ex vivo transfer was 85  %. We hypothesize that this method could be applied to other endangered, slow growing taxa of Cactaceae thus contributing to the conservation of this endangered family.|$|R
40|$|Use of biotechnological {{tools in}} avocado (Persea {{americana}} Mill.) is hampered by difficulties in obtaining mature somatic embryos with an acceptable germination capacity. Use of semi-permeable cellulose acetate membranes {{on top of}} maturation medium has improved the quality of obtained embryos and their germination rate; however, {{in the case of}} transgenic embryos the conversion rate is still rather low. In this investigation, a protocol for recovery of transgenic plants has been developed. Mature avocado somatic embryos, over cellulose acetate membranes, were obtained and induced to germinate following the protocol described in Palomo-Ríos (2012). Some transgenic embryos developed buds ≤ 2 mm, which failed to elongate. For shoot recovery, cotyledons were partially removed and the embryonic axis cultured over 4 weeks in MS medium supplemented with either 1 mg/l BA, 1 mg/l TDZ or 1 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l TDZ. Highest shoot recovery was obtained in medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l TDZ, 53. 6 ± 6. 7 % versus 23. 2 ± 5, 7 % and 39. 6 ± 6. 4 % in media supplemented with 1 mg/l BA or 1 mg/l TDZ, respectively. Afterwards, sprouted embryos were cultured over 4 additional weeks in MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BA. In some cases, resulting shoots could be induced to proliferate in GD medium (Gamborg et al., 1968) supplemented with 0. 3 mg/l BA, while in other cases, they had to be recovered through <b>micrografting</b> onto in vitro germinated seedlings as described in Pliego-Alfaro and Murashige (1987). MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BA and solidified with 6 g/l Sigma A- 1296 agar, was used for <b>micrografts.</b> Shoots derived from <b>micrografts</b> were either induced to proliferate in GD medium with 0. 3 mg/l BA or further grafted and cultured in liquid MS medium supplemented with 0. 1 mg/l BA, using perlite as substrate. After 8 - 12 weeks, <b>micrografts</b> could be transferred to ex vitro conditions. References: Gamborg O. L., Muller, R. A., Iojima, K., (1968).
