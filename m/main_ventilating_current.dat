30|$|Initially, {{the rock}} dusting {{standard}} in US coal mines was mandated that 65 % incombustible content (IC) in non-return airways and 80 % IC in return airways (Harris et al. 2010). When methane {{is present in}} any <b>ventilating</b> <b>current,</b> it requires adding an extra 1 % of incombustible material per 0.1 % methane for air in intakes and adding 0.4 % incombustible per 0.1 % methane in the returns (Man and Teacoach 2009). To face the finer coal dust particle size produced by modern coal mining machines, MSHA increased the rock dusting standard on September 23, 2010.

40|$|Abstract. Performance {{test for}} {{operating}} mine’s ventilators are generally on-line, hence the test effect mainly {{depend on a}} full-prepared anemometry that should find a section where <b>ventilating</b> <b>current</b> is relatively still. While in the condition of on-line test, the only appropriate test site is in the annular contraction section of the leading device; but this section {{does not have an}} enough sectional area to fixate Pitot tubes. Therefore, the key to measure the performance of the ventilator is to develop a special equipment to transmit the wind pressure, and replace old Pitot tubes to install in the leading device. This paper introduce the design principle and manufacture method of this independently-developed wind-pressure measuring equipment, meanwhile calibrate the pressure transmission’s effect with standard Pitot tube and put this equipment in practical. After field measurement, the equipment can effectively transmit wind pressure, and its characteristic performance curve tallies with the standard one, therefore attain the final goal of measuring a ventilator’s wind pressure. Furthermore, in different specifications of ventilator, the equipment can adapt itself to different physical dimensions of annular contraction section. All in all, the equipment is scientific, reasonable and easy to be popularized in the mechanical ventilation mines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sedatives and analgesics are {{administered}} to provide sedation and manage agitation and pain in most critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. Various sedation administration strategies including protocolized sedation and daily sedation interruption {{are used to}} mitigate drug pharmacokinetic limitations and minimize oversedation, thereby shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation. At present, it is unclear which strategy is most effective, as few have been directly compared. Our review will use network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare and rank sedation strategies to determine their efficacy and safety for mechanically ventilated patients. Methods We will search the following from 1980 to March 2016 : Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. We will also search the Cochrane Library, gray literature, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We will use a validated randomized control trial search filter to identify studies evaluating any strategy to optimize sedation in mechanically ventilated adult patients. Authors will independently extract data from eligible studies in duplicate and complete the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Our outcomes of interest include duration of mechanical ventilation, time to first extubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, re-intubation, tracheostomy, mortality, total sedative and opioid exposure, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. To inform our NMA, we will first conduct conventional pair-wise meta-analyses using random-effects models. Where appropriate, we will perform Bayesian NMA using WinBUGS software. Discussion There are multiple strategies to optimize sedation for mechanically <b>ventilated</b> patients. <b>Current</b> ICU guidelines recommend protocolized sedation or daily sedation interruption.

40|$|Optimal {{transparency}} and daylight {{combined with the}} possibility to apply natural ventilation and a shading device in the cavity in high-rise buildings are <b>main</b> advantages of <b>ventilated</b> double façades over single skin façades. Application of a fully glazed single skin façade often used to result in high energy consumption due to the poor thermal properties of the glazing. The concept of a ventilated double façade is invented {{with the intention of}} improving the thermal qualities of a fully glazed façade. In low-rise buildings the performance of a ventilated double façade can also be achieved with a much cheaper single skin façade, although the costs of glazing rise quickly if a higher sound insulation is needed. It is therefore important to determine which performance has to be achieved in order to choose between a ventilated double façade and a single skin façade. Besides this new concept of ventilated double façade, the properties of the single glazed façade have improved over the years. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare different ventilated double facades to a state of the art single skin façade and determine which façade has the best overall performance.

40|$|In Australian legal education, 'public law' is {{understood}} as an umbrella concept, covering both constitutional and administrative law subjects. More expansively, public law {{is understood}} as the analysis and evaluation of the state structures of power and control between governments and their people, and between governments, at both the formal and substantive levels. Thus 'public law' readily accommodates topics such as statutory construction, human rights, state sovereignty, electoral law, legal philosophy, {{and the rule of}} law. While increasingly observation is made of the weakening of the traditional distinction between public and private law, that is probably a discussion best <b>ventilated</b> elsewhere. For <b>current</b> purposes, the traditional distinction is a useful point of departure for a more expansive view of public law and public law teaching – an idea that we seek to develop here. The expansive view aligns with the broader conceptualisation of the law curriculum ushered in by the Discipline Standards for Law, while retaining the law's doctrinal integrity. The practice of public law education in this mold requires a more critical and authentic approach, giving scope for student engagement in the broader contexts of law. Together these approaches represent a more contemporary and potentially enlivened public law curriculum. The question is how this might be achieved in a way that cohesively invokes the elements of academic practice. In this article we explore the dimensions of digitally-mediated, collaborative, academic practice in public law. We are interested {{in the way in which}} the pursuit of education in public law reflects the domains of academic practice. Notably, integral to our understanding of teaching is broader community engagement and promotion of an educated citizenry', conscious of the operation of power within the structures of the state. We therefore focus on the extent to which we engage diverse audiences: colleagues in the academy and the profession, our students and the general public. As communicators of law we reflect on our methods of communication through the prism of digital literacies as a means both of modelling effective use of digital media and exploring its meaning and potential in learning public law. This article is part of a wider series that aims to advance discussion about the utility of social media as a democratizing form of communication of scholarly work. Accordingly, this article offers a collaborative auto-ethnographic account, explicitly exposing how the authors have embraced social media as an extension of scholarly work in the public law domain...|$|R

All pneumonia types had similar mortality (community-acquired pneumonia 33 %, hospital-acquired pneumonia 37 % and ventilator-associated pneumonia 24 %, P = 0. 15) with no inter-hospital differences (P = 0. 08 - 0. 91).

Bronchoscopy did not predict outcome (P = 0. 11) or appropriate antibiotic selection (P = 0. 69). Inappropriate antibiotic prescription was similar for all pneumonia types (11 - 13 %, P = 0. 12) and hospitals (0 - 16 %, P = 0. 25). Blood cultures were taken in 51 % of cases. For community-acquired pneumonia, 70 % received a third generation cephalosporin and 65 % a macrolide. Third generation cephalosporins were less frequently used for mild infections (OR 0. 38, CI 95 % 0. 16 - 0. 90, P = 0. 03), hospital-acquired pneumonia (OR 0. 40, CI 95 % 0. 23 - 0. 72, P < 0. 01), ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR 0. 04, CI 95 % 0. 02 - 0. 13, P < 0. 001), suspected aspiration (OR 0. 20, CI 95 % 0. 04 - 0. 92, P = 0. 04), in one regional (OR 0. 26, CI 95 % 0. 07 - 0. 97, P = 0. 05) and one tertiary hospital (OR 0. 14, CI 95 % 0. 03 - 0. 73, P = 0. 02) but were more commonly used in older patients (OR 1. 02, CI 95 % 1. 01 - 1. 03, P = 0. 01).

40|$|The common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Lacepède, 1802) is an {{important}} commercially and recreationally fished species in Australia. This thesis examined {{a number of factors}} that may affect the suitability of this species for aquaculture including ectoparasite fauna and stress physiology. Examination of the ectoparasite fauna of P. leopardus revealed one new species, Hatschekia (Species A), and new host records for the copepods Peniculisa bellwoodi and Sagum epinepheli. Other ectoparasites recorded included Dissonus manteri, Hatschekia plectropomi, Lepeophtheirus plectropomi, Dentigryps litus, Trochopus plectropomi, Diplectanum plectropomi, Aega lethrina, Argathona macronema and turbellarians. There were significant differences between the ectoparasite communities of P. leopardus from Heron Island Reef and a population from the Cairns region of the Great Barrier Reef with absence of some parasites from certain sites and variations in the intensity of infection of other parasites. Dissonus manteri, H. plectropomi and P. bellwoodi were associated with the most severe pathology as determined by gross examination, histology, scanning electron microscopy and vascular casting techniques. This pathology was considered unlikely to cause a significant threat to host fish survival at the infection intensities observed on wild fish. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that levels of ectoparasite infection of wild fish were insufficient to initiate a stress response, as determined by blood parameter analysis. Detailed examination of the distribution of H. plectropomi on the gills of P. leopardus revealed a site preference for holobranchs 2 and 3. Filaments near the ends of gill arches and those around the bend in the gill arch were rarely occupied. The chance of coming into contact with a suitable attachment site along with the ability to withstand ventilation forces at that site may be the major factors affecting the distribution of this species. Two H. plectropomi morphotypes were identified based on the direction of body curvature. Regardless of morphotype, 98 % of individuals were attached such that the convex side of the body was oriented towards the oncoming <b>ventilating</b> water <b>currents.</b> Further, 94 % of individuals attached to the posterior faces of filaments leading to a predictable pattern of attachment for this species. Baseline concentrations of 12 blood parameters were determined for 30 fish species representing 12 families from Heron Island Reef, Great Barrier Reef, including P. leopardus (Serranidae), in addition to one estuarine species, the fork-tailed catfish Arius graeffei Kner & Steindachner, 1867 (Ariidae), from the Brisbane River. Baseline physiological status was determined via rapid blood sampling via caudal puncture of wild caught fish and analysis of a range of blood parameters. The validity of this method was evaluated via analysis of blood samples taken from hussar Lutjanus adetii (Castelnau, 1873). There were no significant changes in any of the measured blood parameters during the first two minutes following a stressful stimulus supporting the use of rapid blood sampling for baseline blood parameter determination. The measured baseline values provided a basis for comparison of post-stress values with differences between species in baseline and post-stress physiological condition discussed in relation to differences in lifestyle such as activity level and diet. Examination of the response of coral trout to hook-and-line capture over a 3 -day period revealed an initial elevation of cortisol from a median baseline concentration of 0. 40 nM (n = 17) to a peak of 19. 01 nM (n = 7) 2 h post-hooking. Plasma osmolality, glucose and lactate also rose significantly and all parameters had returned to near baseline levels within 24 h of capture. Cortisol, glucose and lactate were identified as the best indicators of acute physiological disturbance in P. leopardus. Cortisol, glucose, lactate, osmolality and haematocrit were the best indicators of acute physiological stress in A. graeffei. An acute temperature increase of approximately 5 oC over a period of 15 minutes was stressful to P. leopardus as indicated by an elevation of plasma cortisol. In contrast, an acute temperature drop did not have any significant effect on the physiological parameters measured. In an acute handling and air exposure experiment fish were rapidly hand-netted from holding tanks, subjected to a period of air exposure (0, 2, 4 or 6 minutes) and returned to the water for two hours prior to being blood sampled. Air exposure time did not significantly affect the resultant physiological parameters, suggesting that netting and transfer was the most stressful part of the experimental protocol. The potential commercial applications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
