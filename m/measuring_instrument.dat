5|$|Until {{the ascent}} of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, {{each of the}} regions of Spain {{retained}} its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control {{and with it the}} system of measurement. There were debates regarding the desirability of retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Science to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.|$|E

25|$|One must {{be careful}} when {{measuring}} temperature {{to ensure that the}} <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} {{research}} project {{is to determine the}} validity of <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> for the purpose of selecting successful learners in the airline industry. It is not a complete exposition of all available <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> - but gives an indication if the assessments used to determine success - are indeed successful assessment instruments for the purpose thereof. In applying <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> today, such assessment contributes to a commercial environment which may well find the information outcomes produced future performance indicators that may determine the success of learners for future measuring, more scientific and financially viable. Evaluating the methods of measurement and applicable <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> subsequently, relies on well researched data information and appropriate analysis. The study’s objective is to determine if the outcome of the performance assessment of successful learners in the airline industry may be contributed to the validity of those <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> that were used to select those learners. Evaluating any training success, implies the acquisition of knowledge and skills by learners. Optimising future training will depend on the assessment of the validity of the <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> used. The ultimate aim {{of this study is to}} assess the validity of the <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> - prior to learning - on intended outcomes of learners in the airline industry...|$|R

25|$|A {{multimeter}} or a multitester, {{also known}} as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Analog multimeters use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings. Digital multimeters (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. Digital multimeters are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermocouple}} produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low {{input offset voltage}} and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.|$|E
25|$|Any real <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> has {{a limited}} range over {{which it can}} {{accurately}} measure absorbance. An instrument must be calibrated and checked against known standards if the readings are to be trusted. Many instruments will become non-linear (fail to follow the Beer–Lambert law) starting at approximately 2 AU (~1% transmission). It is also difficult to accurately measure very small absorbance values (below 10−4) with commercially available instruments for chemical analysis. In such cases, laser-based absorption techniques can be used, since they have demonstrated detection limits that supersede those obtained by conventional non-laser-based instruments by many orders of magnitude (detections have been demonstrated {{all the way down}} to 5 × 10−13). The theoretical best accuracy for most commercially available non-laser-based instruments is in the range near 1 AU. The path length or concentration should then, when possible, be adjusted to achieve readings near this range.|$|E

For on-site calibration of multi- channel <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments,</b> the portable voltage calibrators structures are suggested and their metrological properties while automatic errors adjusting are analysed. It was experimentally envisaged that unadjusted error value does not exceed ± 1 mV that satisfies most industrial applications.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare three subject didactic <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> (the SOM, LEMOSS(II) and LCH {{questionnaires}}) with regard to validity. These questionnaires are diagnostic <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments,</b> which teachers can use as an aid in certain didactic situations within the classroom. This includes the specialist planning of a specific learning opportunity, and as point of departure for the discussion of a learner’s learning competency in order to master specific and critical outcomes. High Pearson correlations between the different fields of the three <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments,</b> as well as between the <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> as a whole, were found for grade nine learners in the Tzaneen and Phalaborwa areas. None of the questionnaires can be used as autonomous predictors of respective subject marks. However, the SOM, LEMOSS(II) and LCH questionnaires are diagnostic <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> and therefore it is not of such critical importance for these questionnaires to be extremely accurate predictors of subject marks. </p...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{thermodynamic}} instruments, the meter and the reservoir. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a thermodynamic system. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument.</b> For example, the zeroth law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by James Maxwell in 1872, asserts {{that it is possible to}} measure temperature. An idealized thermometer is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the ideal gas law pV=nRT, the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a barometer may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A calorimeter is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system.|$|E
500|$|Ideally, {{at least}} one of the methods {{utilized}} for confirming tracheal tube placement will be a <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument.</b> Waveform capnography has emerged as the gold standard for the confirmation of tube placement within the trachea. Other methods relying on instruments include the use of a colorimetric end-tidal carbon dioxide detector, a self-inflating esophageal bulb, or an esophageal detection device. The distal tip of a properly positioned tracheal tube will be located in the mid-trachea, roughly [...] above the bifurcation of the carina; this can be confirmed by chest x-ray. If it is inserted too far into the trachea (beyond the carina), the tip of the tracheal tube is likely to be within the right main bronchus — a situation often referred to as a [...] "right mainstem intubation". In this situation, the left lung may be unable to participate in ventilation, which can lead to decreased oxygen content due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch.|$|E

It is noted that, in contrast to the verification procedure used in the legal metrology, the verification procedure for calibrated <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> has to take into account the uncertainty of measurements into account. In this regard, a large number of <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments,</b> considered as those that are in compliance after verification in the legal metrology, turns out to be not in compliance after calibration.

2500|$|These {{are either}} open or closed mode {{instruments}} that are portable or semi-portable. They measure CO2 soil respiration variability at different locations and at different times. With {{this type of}} instrument, soil collars that can {{be connected to the}} survey <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> are inserted into the ground and the soil is allowed to stabilize for a period of time. The insertion of the soil collar temporarily disturbs the soil, creating measuring artifacts. For this reason, it is common to have several soil collar inserted at different locations. Soil collars are inserted far enough to limit lateral diffusion of CO2. [...] After soil stabilization, the researcher then moves from one collar to another according to experimental design to measure soil respiration.|$|E
2500|$|An octant, {{also called}} [...] "reflecting quadrant", is a <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> used {{primarily}} in navigation. It {{is a type}} of reflecting instrument that uses mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in doing so, doubles the angle measured. This allows the instrument to use a one-eighth circle arc to measure a quarter circle or quadrant. The octant was invented in 1730 by Thomas Godfrey, a glazier in Philadelphia, and independently {{at the same time in}} England by the mathematician John Hadley, who began work on a similar version of the octant. Both men have an equal and legitimate claim to the invention of the octant. Originally this instrument was referred to as [...] "Hadley's quadrant", after the English inventor. These days it is now known as an octant, the name given to it by its American inventor, Thomas Godfrey.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Benoit Mandelbrot found {{recurring}} patterns {{at every}} scale in data on cotton prices. Beforehand {{he had studied}} information theory and concluded noise was patterned like a Cantor set: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy. Mandelbrot described both the [...] "Noah effect" [...] (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the [...] "Joseph effect" [...] (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards). This challenged the idea that changes in price were normally distributed. In 1967, he published [...] "How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension", showing that a coastline's length varies with {{the scale of the}} <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument,</b> resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an infinitesimally small measuring device. Arguing that a ball of twine appears as a point when viewed from far away (0-dimensional), a ball when viewed from fairly near (3-dimensional), or a curved strand (1-dimensional), he argued that the dimensions of an object are relative to the observer and may be fractional. An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a fractal (examples include the Menger sponge, the Sierpiński gasket, and the Koch curve or snowflake, which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a fractal dimension of circa 1.2619). In 1982 Mandelbrot published The Fractal Geometry of Nature, which became a classic of chaos theory. Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.|$|E

6000|$|... 1180. Electrometer.--The <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> I have {{employed}} {{has been the}} torsion balance electrometer of Coulomb, constructed, generally, according to his directions[A], but with certain variations and additions, which I will briefly describe. The lower part was a glass cylinder eight inches in height and eight inches in diameter; the tube for the torsion thread was seventeen inches in length. The torsion thread itself was not of metal, but glass, according to the excellent suggestion of the late Dr. Ritchie[B]. It was twenty inches in length, and of such tenuity that when the shell-lac lever and attached ball, &c. were connected with it, they made about ten vibrations in a minute. It would bear torsion through four revolutions or 1440°, and yet, when released, return accurately to its position; probably it would have borne considerably more than this without injury. The repelled ball was of pith, gilt, and was 0.3 of an inch in diameter. The horizontal stem or lever supporting it was of shell-lac, according to Coulomb's direction, the arm carrying the ball being 2.4 inches long, and the other only 1.2 inches: to this was attached the vane, also described by Coulomb, which I found to answer admirably its purpose of quickly destroying vibrations. That the inductive action within the electrometer might be uniform in all positions of the repelled ball and in all states of the apparatus, two bands of tin foil, about an inch wide each, were attached to the inner surface of the glass cylinder, going entirely round it, at the distance of 0.4 of an inch from each other, and at such a height that the intermediate clear surface {{was in the same}} horizontal plane with the lever and ball. These bands were connected {{with each other and with}} the earth, and, being perfect conductors, always exerted a uniform influence on the electrified balls within, which the glass surface, from its irregularity of condition at different times, I found, did not. For the purpose of keeping the air within the electrometer in a constant state as to dryness, a glass dish, of such size as to enter easily within the cylinder, had a layer of fused potash placed within it, and this being covered with a disc of fine wire-gauze to render its inductive action uniform at all parts, was placed within the instrument at the bottom and left there.|$|E
