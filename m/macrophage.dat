5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar <b>macrophage.</b> The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} <b>macrophage</b> are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrophages</b> can be {{classified}} on basis of the fundamental function and activation. According to this grouping there are classically activated <b>macrophages,</b> wound-healing <b>macrophages</b> (alternatively activated <b>macrophages)</b> and regulatory <b>macrophages</b> (Mregs).|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Macrophages</b> play an {{important}} role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI), being involved in both damage and repair. The divergent effects of <b>macrophages</b> might be explained by their different activation status: classically activated (CA/M 1), pro-inflammatory, <b>macrophages</b> and alternatively activated (AA/M 2), growth promoting, <b>macrophages.</b> Little is known about the effect of <b>macrophages</b> with these phenotypes in the central nervous system (CNS) and how they influence pathogenesis. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the characteristics of these phenotypically different <b>macrophages</b> in the context of the CNS in an in vitro setting. Results: Here we show that bone marrow derived CA and AA <b>macrophages</b> have a distinct migratory capacity towards medium conditioned by various cell types of the CNS. AA <b>macrophages</b> were preferentially attracted by the low weight (< 10 kD) fraction of neuronal conditioned medium, while CA <b>macrophages</b> were attracted in higher numbers by astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte conditioned medium. Intrinsic motility was twice as high in AA <b>macrophages</b> compared to CA <b>macrophages.</b> The adhesion to extracellular matrix molecules (ECM) was significantly enhanced in CA <b>macrophages</b> compared to control and AA <b>macrophages.</b> The actin cytoskeleton was differentially organized between CA and AA <b>macrophages,</b> possibly due to greater activity of the GTPases RhoA and Rac in CA <b>macrophages.</b> Phagocytosis of myelin and neuronal fragments was increased in CA <b>macrophages</b> compared to AA <b>macrophages.</b> The increase in myelin phagocytosis was associated with higher expression of CR 3 /MAC- 1 in CA <b>macrophages.</b> Conclusion: In conclusion, since AA <b>macrophages</b> are more motile and are attracted by NCM, they are prone to migrate towards neurons in the CNS. CA <b>macrophages</b> have a lower motility and a stronger adhesion to ECM. In neuroinflammatory diseases the restricted migration and motility of CA <b>macrophages</b> might limit lesion size due to bystander damage. © 2011 Vereyken et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Monoblasts, promonocytes, and <b>macrophages</b> in {{in vitro}} {{cultures}} of murine bone marrow were studied ultrastructurally, with {{special attention to}} peroxidatic activity. Monoblasts show peroxidatic activity in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope {{as well as in}} the granules. The presence of peroxidatic activity in the Golgi apparatus could not be determined. Promonocytes have peroxidase-positive rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear envelope, and granules, as previously reported. During culture, cells are formed with peroxidatic activity similar to that of monocytes or exudate <b>macrophages</b> (positive granules; negative Golgi apparatus, RER, and nuclear envelope); we call these cells early <b>macrophages.</b> In addition, transitional <b>macrophages</b> with both positive granules and positive RER, nuclear envelope, negative Golgi apparatus (as in exudate- resident <b>macrophages</b> in vivo), and mature <b>macrophages</b> with peroxidatic activity only in the RER and nuclear envelope (as in resident <b>macrophages</b> in vivo) were found. A considerable number of cells without detectable peroxidatic activity were also encountered. Our finding that <b>macrophages</b> with the peroxidatic pattern of monocytes (early <b>macrophages),</b> exudate-resident <b>macrophages</b> (transitional <b>macrophages),</b> and resident <b>macrophages</b> (mature <b>macrophages),</b> develop in vitro from proliferating precursor cells deriving from the bone marrow, demonstrates once again that resident <b>macrophages</b> in tissues originate from precursor cells in the bone marrow. Therefore, this conclusion can no longer be challenged on the basis of a cytochemical difference between monocytes and exudate <b>macrophages</b> on the one hand and resident <b>macrophages</b> on the other...|$|R

40|$|Inhibition of the {{intracellular}} {{growth of}} Histoplasma capsulatum by murine resident red pulp splenic <b>macrophages</b> was examined. Splenic <b>macrophages,</b> unlike resident peritoneal <b>macrophages,</b> required a prolonged preincubation (18 h) with recombinant murine gamma interferon (rMuIFN-gamma) for activation. To be fully activated, the splenic <b>macrophages</b> required incubation with rMuIFN-gamma {{in combination with}} 0. 1 microgram of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) per ml. Splenic <b>macrophages</b> stimulated with rMuIFN-gamma, LPS, or rMuIFN-gamma and LPS produced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), but recombinant murine TNF-alpha (rMuTNF-alpha) did not activate <b>macrophages</b> when used alone or as a second signal with rMuIFN-gamma. Anti-TNF-alpha antibody did not block IFN-gamma-LPS activation of splenic <b>macrophages</b> to any significant extent. One hundred micromolar ferrous sulfate antagonized IFN-gamma-LPS activation of splenic <b>macrophages,</b> indicating that iron {{was involved in the}} fungistatic activity of cytokine-stimulated phagocytes.

25|$|Two {{theories}} dominate – that in vivo uptake of DNA occurs non-specifically, in {{a method}} similar to phago- or pinocytosis, or through specific receptors. These might include a 30kDa surface receptor, or <b>macrophage</b> scavenger receptors. The 30kDa surface receptor binds specifically to 4500-bp DNA fragments (which are then internalised) and is found on professional APCs and T-cells. <b>Macrophage</b> scavenger receptors bind {{to a variety}} of macromolecules, including polyribonucleotides and are thus candidates for DNA uptake. Receptor-mediated DNA uptake could be facilitated by the presence of polyguanylate sequences. Gene gun delivery systems, cationic liposome packaging, and other delivery methods bypass this entry method, but understanding it may be useful in reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the requirement for cytofectins), which could be important in animal husbandry.|$|E

40|$|Alveolar hypoxia {{produces}} widespread systemic inflammation in rats. The inflammation {{appears to}} be triggered by activation of mast cells by a mediator released from alveolar <b>macrophages,</b> not by the reduced systemic partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2). If this is correct, the following should apply: (1) neither mast cells nor tissue <b>macrophages</b> should be directly activated by hypoxia; and (2) mast cells should be activated when in contact with hypoxic alveolar <b>macrophages,</b> but not with hypoxic tissue <b>macrophages.</b> We sought here to determine whether hypoxia activates isolated alveolar <b>macrophages,</b> peritoneal <b>macrophages,</b> and peritoneal mast cells, and to study {{the response of the}} microcirculation to supernatants of these cultures. Rat mesenteric microcirculation intravital microscopy was combined with primary cultures of alveolar <b>macrophages,</b> peritoneal <b>macrophages,</b> and peritoneal mast cells. Supernatant of hypoxic alveolar <b>macrophages,</b> but not of hypoxic peritoneal <b>macrophages,</b> produced inflammation in mesentery. Hypoxia induced a respiratory burst in alveolar, but not peritoneal <b>macrophages.</b> Cultured peritoneal mast cells did not degranulate with hypoxia. Immersion of mast cells in supernatant of hypoxic alveolar <b>macrophages,</b> but not in supernatant of hypoxic peritoneal <b>macrophages,</b> induced mast cell degranulation. Hypoxia induced release of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, a mast cell secretagogue, from alveolar, but not peritoneal <b>macrophages</b> or mast cells. We conclude that a mediator released by hypoxic alveolar <b>macrophages</b> activates mast cells and triggers systemic inflammation. Reduced systemic PO 2 and activation of tissue <b>macrophages</b> do not play a role in this phenomenon. The inflammation could contribute to systemic effects of diseases featuring alveolar hypoxia...|$|R

Monocytes from smokers and nonsmokers were not different. The cytotoxic properties of these <b>macrophages</b> and mono. cytes were assessed by an In vitro 3 H-thymidlne release assay against various aliogeneic target cells. <b>Macrophages</b> and monocytes exposed to LPS were rendered tumoricidal. <b>Macrophages</b> from nonsmokers appeared to generate greater cytotoxic activity than <b>macrophages</b> from smokers. <b>Macrophages</b> from both smokers and nonsmokers were cytotoxic for three different tumorigenic cell lines but not for a nontumorigenic cell line.

25|$|Once {{inside the}} human host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Inside the cells they {{transform}} {{back into the}} smaller amastigote form. The amastigotes replicate in the most hostile part of the <b>macrophage</b> cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response {{they are able to}} prevent. After repeated multiplication, they break down their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the exocytosis response of the <b>macrophage.</b> The daughter cells protozoans then migrate to fresh cells or through the bloodstream to find new hosts. In this way the infection is progressive, spreading to the host's mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly the spleen and liver.

50|$|The key {{association}} between IFNγ and granulomas is that IFNγ activates <b>macrophages</b> {{so that they}} become more powerful in killing intracellular organisms. Activation of <b>macrophages</b> by IFNγ from Th1 helper cells in mycobacterial infections allows the <b>macrophages</b> to overcome the inhibition of phagolysosome maturation caused by mycobacteria (to stay alive inside <b>macrophages).</b> The first steps in IFNγ-induced granuloma formation are activation of Th1 helper cells by <b>macrophages</b> releasing IL-1 and IL-12 {{in the presence of}} intracellular pathogens, and presentation of antigens from those pathogens. Next the Th1 helper cells aggregate around the <b>macrophages</b> and release IFNγ, which activates the <b>macrophages.</b> Further activation of <b>macrophages</b> causes a cycle of further killing of intracellular bacteria, and further presentation of antigens to Th1 helper cells with further release of IFNγ. Finally, <b>macrophages</b> surround the Th1 helper cells and become fibroblast-like cells walling off the infection.|$|R
30|$|<b>Macrophages</b> play pivotal {{roles in}} renal {{fibrosis}} (Vernon et al., 2010; Wang and Harris, 2011), as depletion of <b>macrophages</b> ameliorates murine renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) (Kitamoto et al., 2009), suggesting that <b>macrophages</b> {{could serve as}} a therapeutic target. However, extensive observations have suggested that some <b>macrophages</b> exhibit pro-fibrotic activities, while others play an anti-fibrotic role (Kluth et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007; Henderson et al., 2008). This controversial is reminiscent of recent findings unveiling the ontogenic heterogeneity and functional plasticity of <b>macrophages</b> (Wynn and Vannella, 2016). <b>Macrophages</b> in adult tissues are constituted by resident <b>macrophages</b> established during embryogenesis, and monocytes-derived <b>macrophages</b> recruited from bone marrow (BM). Most resident <b>macrophages</b> persist in tissues life-long and replenish themselves through self-renewal. Monocytes, on the other hand, are mobilized after tissue injury depending on chemotaxis signaling, and recruited to the inflammatory sites, where they differentiate into <b>macrophages.</b> <b>Macrophages</b> in tissues are activated and polarized into different subpopulations depending on local immunological milieu (Ginhoux and Guilliams, 2016). In response to IFN-γ and/or LPS, <b>macrophages</b> adopt the M 1 activation and produce TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and NO, leading to enhanced inflammation, Th 1 -biased immune response and exacerbated tissue injury. In contrast, upon treatment with IL- 4 /IL- 13, <b>macrophages</b> are polarized into M 2 activation characterized by the up-regulated expression of IL- 10, TGF-β, ARG 1, and YM 1. M 2 <b>macrophages</b> exhibit anti-inflammatory activities and Th 2 response, which promote tissue repair and remodeling (Vernon et al., 2010; Wynn and Vannella, 2016). In renal fibrosis, {{it has been reported that}} M 1 <b>macrophages</b> exert pro-fibrotic role whereas M 2 <b>macrophages</b> are anti-fibrotic (Nishida et al., 2005; Wang and Harris, 2011). Nevertheless, M 2 <b>macrophages</b> express high level of TGF-β, a pro-fibrotic cytokine which promotes ECM deposition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to renal fibrogenesis (Miyajima et al., 2000). Unveiling the role of these different populations of <b>macrophages</b> in renal fibrosis is a prerequisite of macrophages-targeted therapy.|$|R
