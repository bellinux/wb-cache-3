40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the relationship between}} gender role conflict, help-seeking attitudes, and alcohol abuse {{among a group of}} 64 undergraduate males from a northeastern state university, who were seen for treatment at a substance abuse education and treatment program. This research is unique because the sample includes students who were voluntary as well as <b>mandatory</b> <b>referrals</b> for treatment. ^ Utilizing the Gender Role Conflict Scale (GRCS; O 2 ̆ 7 Neil, Helms, Gable, and Wrightman 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) in conjunction with the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale, (ASPPH; Fischer and Turner, 1970), this study examined the relationships among gender role conflict and help-seeking attitudes among two groups of men who were <b>mandatory</b> and voluntary <b>referrals</b> for alcohol abuse treatment. Two one-way analyses of variance were performed to examine differences between gender role conflict, help-seeking attitudes respectively among males who were self or <b>mandatory</b> <b>referrals.</b> Two discriminant function analysis were performed to assess, first, the relative importance of gender role conflict, help seeking attitudes, and the interaction of these two variables in predicting <b>referral</b> status (<b>mandatory</b> and voluntary), and second, to assess the relative importance of help seeking attitudes, and the subscales of the Gender Role Conflict Scale in predicting referral status. ^ The present study did not find significant differences among the groups with respect to attitudes toward help seeking, gender role conflict variables, or their interaction, individually, or interactively, suggesting that <b>mandatory</b> and self <b>referrals</b> are more alike than different concerning these variables. Post hoc analyses revealed that in terms of its research questions, the group of voluntary referrals differed from the mandatory group in terms of age and semester in college. The average semester in school for voluntary males was fifth semester, while the average semester for <b>mandatory</b> <b>referrals</b> was third semester. This difference was significant at the. 01 level. The average age for voluntary males was 21. 05 and the average age for mandatory males was 19. 40. This difference was significant at the. 01 level. Future research efforts are suggested in the area of alcohol abuse and gender role conflict among college-aged men. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{principles of}} the Swedish health care structures are that the public sector is responsible for providing and financing health services for all citizens. Local health centers, which employ several categories of medical professionals, provide primary health and community care services. For patients requiring hospital treatment, medical services are available at county, regional and municipality levels. Since last decades the resources allocated to health care have been constantly reduced, a trend {{that is expected to}} continue along with the increased service costs. Initially, the discussion about medical services was restrained to structural matters. Examples of implemented changes are the closing of hospitals, separating of emergency care as well as caring responsibilities, supporting collaboration between and among various hospitals, and increasing cooperation between hospitals {{and other parts of the}} health care system. With the help of economic directives and <b>mandatory</b> <b>referrals,</b> patients are guided to primary and community based health care providers instead of the more expensive hospital care providers.

40|$|D. Comm. The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} an insourced Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) over a one year period in terms of impact evaluation (utilisation and client's satisfaction with the programme) and efficiency evaluation (cost-effectiveness). Such evaluation studies are becoming increasingly important in the current era of organisational downsizing and coping with resource constraints. A client satisfaction survey was used to assess client's satisfaction with the program, while data obtained from the management information system of the company was used to compute both the utilisation rate as well as the cost-effectiveness of the programme. The utilisation rate was computed to be 5. 2 % which is within the acceptable range as posited by the available literature. The utilisation rate was further examined in terms of the demographics of the client population as well as that of the EAP. The demographic information revealed that the most common problem addressed by the EAP was marital problems (37. 8 %). Another finding of note was the very high percentage of management / <b>mandatory</b> <b>referrals.</b> Supervisor feedback reports indicated that the most common problem amongst employees that resulted in referral was absenteeism and morale. Supervisors rated involvement in incidents /accidents and absenteeism as being the constructs that improved the most with EAP intervention. The survey of EAP clients (self-referrals) suggested that the majority of clients were satisfied with the overall quality of EAP services. Computation of the cost-benefit ratio revealed that for every R 1. 00 invested in the EAP between R 5 and R 8 was saved in terms of recovered lost productivity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Greece is {{hit hard}} by the state debt crisis. This calls for {{comprehensive}} reforms to restore sustainable and balanced growth. Healthcare {{is one of the}} public sectors needing reform. The European Union (EU) Task Force for Greece asked the authors to assess the situation of primary care and to make recommendations for reform. Primary healthcare is especially relevant in that it might increase the efficiency of the healthcare system, and improve access to good quality healthcare. Approach: Assessment of the state of primary care in Greece was {{made on the basis of}} existing literature, site visits in primary care and consultations with stakeholders. Results: The governance of primary care (and healthcare in general) is fragmented. There is no system of gatekeeping or patient lists. Private payments (formal and informal) are high. There are too many physicians, but too few general practitioners and nurses, and they are unevenly spread across the country. As a consequence, there are problems of access, continuity, co-ordination and comprehensiveness of primary care. Conclusions: The authors recommend the development of a clear vision and development strategy for strengthening primary care. Stepped access to secondary care should be realised through the introduction of <b>mandatory</b> <b>referrals.</b> Primary care should be accessible through the lowest possible out-of-pocket payments. The roles of purchaser and provider of care should be split. Quality of care should be improved through development of clinical guidelines and quality indicators. The education of health professionals should put more emphasis on primary care and medical specialists working in primary care should be (re-) trained to acquire the necessary competences to satisfy the job descriptions to be developed for primary care professionals. The advantages of strong primary care should be communicated to patients and the wider public. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has a rich organ-transplant history, {{and studies}} suggest that the SA public {{supports}} organ donation. In spite of this, persistently low donor numbers are a significant challenge. This may be {{due to a lack of}} contextually appropriate awareness and education, or to barriers to referring patients and families in clinical settings. It may also be due to ad hoc regulations that are not uniformly endorsed or implemented. In this article we present the findings of a study in Johannesburg that explored the attitudes and roles of nurses in end-of-life care and organ donation. A total of 273 nurses participated. Most were female and < 50 years old. The majority expressed positive attitudes towards both end-of-life care and organ donation, but there was ambiguity as to whether referring patients and families for these services was within nursing scope of practice. The vast majority of participants noted that they would refer patients themselves if there was a <b>mandatory,</b> nationally endorsed <b>referral</b> policy. These findings have implications for clinical practice and policy, and suggest that the formulation and implementation of robust national guidelines should be a priority. Because nurses would follow such guidelines, this might lead to an increase in donor rates and circumvent some uncertainty regarding referral...|$|R

This article investigates which of these e¤ects dominates the {{interaction between}} Belgian physicians, where free choice of physician applies. Estimation of a tailor-made static equilibrium entry game indicates that complementarity with GP services dominates for some specialist types (gynecologists, ENT-specialists, physiologists) while oth-ers (dermatologists, psychiatrists) are mainly used as substitutes for GP care. I argue that both short-run and long-run e ¢ ciency gains can be realized by introducing <b>mandatory</b> <b>referral</b> schemes in the Belgian health system, but that also transition costs are likely to occur...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} number of Army soldiers are sufficiently overweight to exceed the maximum weight allowances defined by the Army weight control program (AR 600 - 9). Also, the body weights of {{a substantial number of}} soldiers approach the maximum weight allowances. These soldiers should not gain additional weight if they are to meet Army weight allowances. The conventional approach to this overweight problem is assigning soldiers to remedial physical training and <b>mandatory</b> <b>referral</b> for nutrition counseling by a health care provider. An alternative to this conventional approach is to target the entire population of soldiers (population-based intervention) to promote weight loss in overweight soldiers and weight gain prevention in soldiers who are approaching overweight status. To accomplish this objective, the Healthy Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Training Headquarters (H. E. A. L. T. H.) program was developed. This article describes the rationale for developing the program, the components of the program, and the utilization promotion strategies of the program. The H. E. A. L. T. H. program includes two primary components: (1) a Web site tailored to the standards established in Field Manual 21 - 20, Physical Fitness Training, Army physical fitness test, and AR 600 - 9, the army weight control program, and (2) a health promotion program designed to promote awareness of the H. E. A. L. T. H. Web site and to facilitate use of the Web site by soldiers and their family members.

40|$|Background: The {{health care}} systems in many {{countries}} are focused on specialist care. In those countries that have recently changed to a primary care-based system, some doctors and patients were dissatisfied with the change. Objective: To explore {{the opinions of the}} general public and the doctors on the change to a family medicine (FM) -based health care system. Methods: Qualitative study with focus groups of doctors working in different practice settings. Quantitative study with questionnaires sent to all doctors registered in Hong Kong and a telephone survey targeting the general public aged > 18. Results: Doctors in the focus groups generally supported a FM-based health care system. They were concerned that there were not enough family doctors for such a system and the patients' current free choice of any doctor for primary care would impede its success. Thousand six hundred and forty-seven adults took part in the telephone survey (response rate 67. 6 %) and 2310 doctors (22. 8 %) responded to the questionnaire. Nearly 95 % of the general public respondents agreed to the FM system though only 66. 3 % of them had ever heard of the term family doctor. About 65 % of the doctors supported this system but only 33 % agreed that the system would work. The specialist-doctors were less supportive of <b>mandatory</b> <b>referral</b> than the non-specialists, while the public was equally divided on this issue. Conclusions: The public accepts the FM-based system but needs education on the benefits of primary health care. Direct access to the specialist would be the greatest barrier.

40|$|Essay 1 : Entry and Regulation - Evidence from Health Care ProfessionsAbstract: In many {{countries}} pharmacies receive high regulated markups and are protected from competition through geographic entry restrictions. We develop an empirical entry model for pharmacies and physicians with two features: entry restrictions and strategic complementarities. We {{find that the}} entry restrictions have directly {{reduced the number of}} pharmacies by more than 50 %, and also indirectly reduced the number of physicians by about 7 %. A removal of the entry restrictions, combined with a reduction in the regulated markups, would generate a large shift in rents to consumers, without reducing the availability of pharmacies. The public interest motivation for the current regime therefore has no empirical support. Essay 2 : Supplier Inducement in the Belgian Primary Care MarketAbstract: We perform an empirical exercise to address the presence of supplier-induced demand in the Belgian primary care market, which is characterized by a fixed fee system and a high density of General Practitioners (GP). Using a unique dataset on the number of contacts of all Belgian GPs, we first investigate whether we can find evidence of demand inducement. We furthermore investigate which type of contacts GPs typically use for inducing demand: consultations or visits. Our results indicate that there is a positive effect of GP density on per capita consumption of primary care. We cannot reject that GPs are responsible for part of this effect through inducing behavior. Furthermore, GPs especially employ consultations to induce demand. Essay 3 : Strategic Interaction between General Practitioners and Specialists: Implications for GatekeepingAbstract: We propose to estimate strategic interaction effects between general practitioners (GPs) and different specialist types to evaluate the viability threat for specialists associated to the introduction of a <b>mandatory</b> <b>referral</b> scheme. That is, we show that the specialists' loss of patientele when patients can only contact them after a GP referral has important consequences for the viability of the specialist types whose entry decisions are strategic substitutes in GPs entry decisions. To estimate the strategic interaction effects, we model the entry decisions of different physician types as an equilibrium entry game of incomplete information and sequential decision making. This model permits identification {{of the nature of the}} strategic interaction effects as it does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the underlying payoff functions and allows for the strategic interaction effects to be asymmetric in sign. At the same time, the model remains computationally tractable and allows for sufficient firm heterogeneity. Our findings for the Belgian physician markets, in which there is no gatekeeping, indicate that entry decisions of dermatologists and pediatricians are strategic substitutes in the entry decisions of GPs, whereas the presence of gynecologists, ophthalmologists and throat, nose and ear-specialists has a positive impact on GP payoffs of entry. Our results thus indicate that transition costs are likely upon the implementation of gatekeeping and that these costs are mainly associated to the viability of dermatologists and pediatricians. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{researcher}} {{is employed}} at Aventis Pharma as an Employee Assistance Practitioner since 2001. Employees at Aventis Pharma do not utilize the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). They wait for supervisors to refer {{them to the}} EAP for assistance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the reasons for the resistance of troubled employees to utilize the EAP at Aventis Pharma. In this study, a qualitative approach was the most appropriate because the researcher’s intention was to get information on employees’ perceptions, not numerical data. The researcher intended to ascertain the respondents’ feelings, perceptions and opinions based on their resistance to utilize EAP. The researcher utilized applied research because Royce (1991 : 19) states that its findings are used to solve problems of immediate concern. The researcher utilized applied research in order to understand the problem in detail and to generate knowledge with regard to solving the problem of resistance. The researcher utilized an exploratory design that is more qualitative in nature. The purpose of the exploratory study was to gain insight into a situation, phenomenon, community or person (Bless&Higson-Smith, 1995 : 42). The researcher explored the respondents’ perceptions, feelings and opinions of EAP to find out their reasons for not utilizing the EAP. A phenomenological strategy was utilized. The aim of the researcher was to understand perceptions, feelings and opinions about utilizing the EAP from various respondents. A literature study as well as an empirical investigation was implemented in this research project. Respondents were gathered on a sampling basis and a semi-structured interview schedule was used to gather information from the respondents at Aventis Pharma. In this study the semi-structured interview schedule helped the researcher to gain knowledge and understand the respondents’ perceptions, feelings and opinions on the utilization of an EAP. The interview schedule consisted of open and close-ended questions. A tape recorder was used to ensure that all the necessary information was recorded. After collecting information, it was analysed and interpreted and the researcher compiled a report to document the research findings. The researcher conducted a pilot test with 2 employees who were not part of the main study and this helped the researcher to check the effectiveness of the interview schedule before it could be done on a large population. The research population for this study was the employees of Aventis Pharma. The company is situated in the east of Pretoria. It consists of 215 employees. The boundary of the sample consisted of 12 employees at Aventis Pharma. The company consists of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled employees. The respondents were employees who are semi-skilled, those who have standard seven to a diploma. The respondents were between the ages of 20 and 55 years, males and females from various race groups. For the purpose of this study, the researcher utilized the non-probability purposive sampling. The in-depth interviews revealed the following: The majority of employees knew about the EAP, marketing was done within the company but some employees could not differentiate between the EAP and social work. Different types of written materials were used to introduce the programme in the company. Employees do not want supervisors to refer them to the EAP; they want to consult on their own. They believe that if a supervisor refers you to the EAP, it means you have problems. The employees’ resistance to consult on their own forces the supervisors to apply a <b>mandatory</b> <b>referral.</b> On the issue of supervisory training, employees feel that supervisors should not be trained on EAP. They believe that supervisors will not leave their jobs and became EA practitioners. For most employees, supervisory training is a waste of time.
