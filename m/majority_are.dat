5|$|Both the East Riding and Hull {{are still}} {{covered by the}} Humberside Police area and the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. Piped water is {{supplied}} by Yorkshire Water who also maintain the sewerage system. About 1% of the population use water from private supplies. They are usually in the more remote parts of the East Riding. The <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> bore holes {{but they can be}} wells or natural springs.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Classifying {{particles}} are used after numerals, {{but are not}} always obligatory {{as they are in}} Thai or Chinese, for example, and are often dropped in colloquial speech. Khmer nouns are divided into two groups: mass nouns, those which take classifiers, and specific nouns, which do not. The overwhelming <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> mass nouns.|$|E
50|$|Settlements with Serb ethnic {{majority}} are: Bela Crkva, Banatska Palanka, Banatska Subotica, Vračev Gaj, Dupljaja, Jasenovo, Kajtasovo, Kaluđerovo, Kruščica, Kusić, and Crvena Crkva.

50|$|In Switzerland, simple <b>majorities</b> <b>are</b> {{sufficient}} at {{the municipal}} and cantonal level, {{but at the}} federal level double <b>majorities</b> <b>are</b> required on constitutional issues.|$|R
50|$|This {{was one of}} the few {{occasions}} when an overall national <b>majority</b> <b>was</b> evident, albeit by a small margin, but no state <b>majority</b> <b>was</b> reached resulting in the referendum being not carried.|$|R
5|$|I {{advocate}} the industrial ballot alone when I address {{the workers in}} the textile industries of the East where a great <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> foreigners without political representation. But when I speak to American workingmen in the West I advocate both the industrial and the political ballot.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the museums}} have been {{accredited}} by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which sets {{national standards for}} museums in the UK. Several are art galleries providing space for the exhibition of art, or are philatelic, regimental, science, aviation, transport, railway, toy, religious or sports museums, but the <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> local museums. There are also several historic house museums owned or managed by the National Trust or English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, the <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> {{found in a}} halo around the galactic core, and the large <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> located in the celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used {{the positions of the}} clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
50|$|Settlements with Serb ethnic {{majority}} are: Odžaci, Bački Brestovac, Bački Gračac, Deronje, Karavukovo, Ratkovo, and Srpski Miletić.

5|$|Since {{the very}} early days of alpine {{mountaineering}} a number of high-altitude mountain refuges have been positioned strategically across the massif to give climbers easier access to the high summits by permitting an overnight stay. The <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> owned by national mountaineering clubs, and many are wardened during the summer months, although the smaller bivouac huts are unmanned and have very basic facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
5|$|The cemetery's headstones are {{oriented}} both to {{the east}} and to the west. The <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> simple in design, inscribed with birth and death dates, and consist of a combination of rounded, arched stones, rectangular stones, and pyramidal-shaped obelisks that appear to be cut from limestone. In the cemetery's southern section are several small rectangular stones that probably serve as footstones. Beginning around 1950, the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop rough-cut stone foundations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} of the Kingdom, Slovaks and Ruthenians formed an ethnic {{majority}} also, in the southern regions the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> South Slavic Croats, Serbs and Slovenes and in the western regions the <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> Germans.|$|R
50|$|The Real <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> often {{compared}} and {{contrasted with}} The Emerging Republican Majority, {{a book by}} Republican strategist Kevin Phillips which was released at the same time. Phillips concluded that the <b>majority</b> <b>was</b> inevitable, a conclusion Wattenberg and Scammon reject.|$|R

5|$|The major {{languages}} {{spoken in}} Nigeria represent three major families of languages of Africa: the <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> Niger-Congo languages, such as Igbo, Yoruba and Fulfulde; Kanuri, spoken in the northeast, primarily in Borno and Yobe State, {{is part of}} the Nilo-Saharan family; and Hausa is an Afroasiatic language.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} the {{individual}} islands reflect a complex linguistic history. The <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> Norse or Gaelic but the roots of some may have a pre-Celtic origin The earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was undertaken in the 16th century by Monro himself, which in some cases also provides the earliest written form of the island name.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> Stablest Theorem has {{numerous}} {{applications in}} hardness of approximation and social choice theory. We give a new {{proof of the}} <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> Stablest Theorem by induction on the dimension of the discrete cube. Unlike the previous proof, it uses neither the "invariance principle" nor Borell's result in Gaussian space. The new proof is general enough to include all previous variants of <b>majority</b> <b>is</b> stablest such as "it ain't over until it's over" and "Majority is most predictable". Moreover, the new proof allows us to derive a proof of <b>Majority</b> <b>is</b> Stablest in a constant level of the Sum of Squares hierarchy. This implies in particular that Khot-Vishnoi instance of Max-Cut {{does not provide a}} gap instance for the Lasserre hierarchy...|$|R

5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the <b>majority</b> <b>are</b> unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
