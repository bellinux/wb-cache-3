5000|$|The {{ruler of}} Qi {{was not a}} good speaker and could not speak clearly, and so he did not like to meet with {{governmental}} officials. He spoke nothing to anyone except his jesters and servants. He was weak in his personality and was fearful of people staring at him. Even the most honored officials or the head of the government were not allowed to look at him, and therefore the officials could only <b>make</b> <b>summary</b> reports and then withdraw in panic. He inherited the luxurious and wasteful living habits of Emperor Wucheng and thought that this was proper. All of the women and eunuchs of the palace dressed in the best silk and ate delicacies. It sometimes took 10,000 pi a measurement unit for textile to make one skirt for them. Each of them competed with each other for the newest and most wonderful things, and clothes made in the morning may be considered old and out of style that same evening. He spent much effort on building palaces and gardens of the greatest splendor, but his affections for them could not last, so all buildings were torn down and rebuilt and torn down again. These construction activities went around the clock without ceasing, with great torches used for illumination at night, and water boiled to mix with the dirt in the winter. In order to carve Buddha images in the western hills of Jinyang, over 10,000 torches were used for one night, bright enough to shine on the Jinyang Palace like it was the day. Whenever there were natural disastrous, ill omens, or agrarian rebellions, he never blamed himself, but would only hold great vegetarian feasts to treat the Buddhist and Taoist monks, believing that this would bring divine blessings so that difficulties would pass. He liked to play the pipa and sing, and he wrote a song entitled, Song of No Worries (無愁曲), with several hundred servants singing with him, leading to the people referring to him as [...] "the Son of Heaven with no worries." [...] He established [...] "the Pauper Boy's Village" [...] within the Hualin Garden (華林園), where he would put on pauper clothes and beg in the village, believing that this was great joy. He also built models of the important border cities and had soldiers act like Northern Zhou soldiers to attack them, and with him resisting the attacks with the eunuchs.|$|E

One algorithm matches a graph representing the entire topic against each sentence in the collection. The other algorithm checks, for pairs of openclass words in the topic, whether they can be connected in the syntactic graph of each sentence.

40|$|Abstract. Karloff and Shirley {{recently}} proposed “summary trees ” {{as a new}} way {{to visualize}} large rooted trees (Eurovis 2013) and gave al-gorithms for generating a maximum-entropy k-node summary tree of an input n-node rooted tree. However, the algorithm generating optimal summary trees was only pseudo-polynomial (and worked only for integral weights); the authors left open existence of a polynomial-time algorithm. In addition, the authors provided an additive approximation algorithm and a greedy heuristic, both working on real weights. This paper shows how to construct maximum entropy k-node summary trees in time O(k 2 n+n logn) for real weights (indeed, as small as the time bound for the greedy heuristic given previously); how to speed up the approximation algorithm so that it runs in time O(n+ (k 4 /) log(k/)), and how to speed up the greedy algorithm so as to run in time O(kn+ n logn).

Out of unconventional groups of livestock, the attention is devoted to birds from out superorder runners. The importace of meat in man's nutrition is widely discussed. As a part of thesis, a public inquiry was compiled and analysed. It was interpreted on samples of students and workers of educational institutions. The inquiry discovers the influence of respondents'demografic field and other circumstances upon meat consummation. As a suplement to the biology education at primary and secondary schools, a CD- ROM is made containing questions to systematic zoology of birds from among superorder runners.
