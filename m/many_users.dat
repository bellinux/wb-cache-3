Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties. Very often today a conversation in English {{anywhere in the world}} may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.|$|E
5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. <b>Many</b> <b>users</b> with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated <b>many</b> <b>users</b> who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E

United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines serve the airport with direct and connecting service. As of 2017, the airport has non-stop service to 30 destinations. Eppley is situated in East Omaha, with <b>many</b> <b>users</b> driving through Carter Lake, Iowa and getting a view of Carter Lake before getting there.

5|$|The iPad 2 {{supports}} iOS 8 {{which was}} released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). While the device is still supported, {{most of the new}} features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore, is limited in terms of performance. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. <b>Many</b> <b>users</b> predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, <b>many</b> <b>users</b> require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E
