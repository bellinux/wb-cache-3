40|$|Background: Moderate {{and high}} {{intensity}} aerobic or resistance exercise has clearly identified benefits for cardiac, muscle, and bone health. However, {{the impact of}} such exercise - either as a mitigating or an exacerbating factor - {{on the development of}} the visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) is unknown. Accordingly, our aim was to characterize the effect of an acute bout of resistance (RE), moderate-intensity continuous (CE), and high-intensity interval exercise (IE) during a cephalad fluid shift on cerebral-ocular hemodynamics and pressures. Methods: 10 male subjects (36 plus or minus 9 years) completed 4 testing days in a 15 degree head-down tilt (HDT) : (1) assessment of maximum volume of O (sub 2), (2) RE session (4 sets of 12 repetition maximum leg press exercise), (3) CE session (30 minutes of cycling at 60 percent maximum volume of O (sub 2)), and (4) IE session (4 by 4 -minute intervals of exercise at 85 percent maximum volume of O (sub 2) with 3 -minute active rest periods). During each session, blood flow (Vivid-e, GE Healthcare) in extracranial arteries (common carotid artery, CCA; internal carotid artery, ICA; external carotid artery, ECA and vertebral artery, VA), and mean blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal jugular pressure (IJP; VeinPress), and intraocular pressure (IOP; Icare PRO) were measured at rest, at the end of each resistance or interval set, and every 5 minutes during continuous exercise. Translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG) was estimated by subtracting IJP from IOP. Results: There were no differences across days in pre-exercise resting blood flows or pressures. IOP decreased slightly from HDT rest (20. 2 plus or minus 2. 3 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury)</b> to exercise (RE: 19. 2 plus or minus 2. 8 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> mercury; CE: 18. 9 plus or minus 3. 2 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> mercury; IE: 20. 1 plus or minus 2. 8 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury),</b> while IJP decreased during CE (31. 6 plus or minus 9. 5 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury)</b> and RE (32. 0 plus or minus 8. 1 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury),</b> and increased during IE (35. 1 plus or minus 9. 5 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury)</b> from HDT rest (33. 3 plus or minus 6. 5 <b>millimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury).</b> Estimated TLPG was increased during IE only. Compared to RE and CE, IE resulted in the greatest increase in MCA blood flow velocity and extracranial artery blood flow. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that high-intensity IE acutely increases cerebral blood flow, IJP, and TLPG. Alterations in TLPG is one mechanism that may contribute to optic nerve sheath edema in astronauts. Accordingly, acutely raising IOP and/or orbital pressure during exercise could optimize cerebral-ocular pressures during spaceflight...|$|R
50|$|A water {{microphone}} {{or water}} transmitter {{is based on}} Ohm's law that current in a wire varies inversely with {{the resistance of the}} circuit. The sound waves from a human voice cause a diaphragm to vibrate which causes a needle or rod to vibrate up and down in water that has been made conductive by a small amount of acid. As the needle or rod vibrates {{up and down in the}} water, the resistance of the water fluctuates which causes alternating current in the circuit. For this to work, the resistance of the water must vary substantially over the short distance the needle or rod vibrates. Acidulated water works well because only a small amount of acid is added. If one millimeter of acidulated water has a resistance of 100 ohms, two millimeters would have 200 ohms which would produce enough alternating current to transmit audio signals in thousands of feet of wire. Mercury will not work because the resistance of one <b>millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> is less than a tenth of an ohm and vibration of a needle in mercury would produce negligible alternating current.|$|E
5000|$|Portal {{hypertension}} or hypertension in the venous hepatic {{portal system}} of blood flow {{is defined as}} an increase in portal pressure above normal values of 10 <b>Millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> It is a serious, sometimes life-threatening complication of various diseases such as liver cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, massive Fatty liver, portal vein thrombosis, liver schistosomiasis, massive liver involvement in miliary tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, and obstruction of the venous circuit at any level between liver and right heart (see Portal hypertension). Vascular contraction in the portal system is mediated by several agents: nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, prostacyclin I2, and Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs). EDHFs include endothelin, angiotensin II, thromboxane A2, certain leukotrienes, and the EETs. In portal hypertension, portal vein endothelium appears to be dysfunctional in that it overproduces EDHFs. The EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, have a quite different effect on the Liver sinusoidal veins than on arteries of the systemic circulation: they constrict the sinusoids. [...] Levels of EETs in the plasma and liver of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension are reportedly elevated compared to normal subjects. [...] These and other findings {{have led to the}} proposal that portal endothelium-derived EETs, perhaps acting in cooperation with another EDHF, endothelin, contribute to portal hypertension.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To assess {{factors for}} {{progression}} in the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT), including {{the effect of}} EMGT treatment. Setting/Participants: Two hundred fifty-five open-angle glaucoma patients randomized to argon laser trabeculoplasty plus topical betaxolol or no immediate treatment (129 treated; 126 controls) and followed up every 3 months. Methods: Progression was determined by perimetric and photographic optic disc criteria. Patient-based risk of progression was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression models and was expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results: After 6 years, 53 % of patients progressed. In multivariate analyses, progression risk was halved by treatment (HR= 0. 50; 95 % CI, 0. 35 - 0. 71). Predictive baseline factors were higher intraocular pressure (IOP) (ie, the higher the baseline IOP, the higher the risk), exfoliation, and having both eyes eligible (each of the latter 2 factors doubled the risk), as well as worse mean deviation and older age. Progression risk decreased by about 10 % with each <b>millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> of IOP reduction from baseline to the first follow-up visit (HR= 0. 90 per <b>millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> decrease; 95 % CI, 0. 86 - 0. 94). The first IOP at that visit (3 months' follow-up) was also related to progression (HR= 1. 11 per <b>millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> higher; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 17), as was the mean IOP at follow-up (HR= 1. 13 per <b>millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> higher; 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 1. 19). The percent of patient follow-up visits with disc hemorrhages was also related to progression (HR= 1. 02 per percent higher; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 03). No other factors were identified. Conclusions: Patients treated in the EMGT had half of the progression risk of control patients. The magnitude of initial IOP reduction was a major factor influencing outcome. Progression was also increased with higher baseline IOP, exfoliation, bilateral disease, worse mean deviation, and older age, as well as frequent disc hemorrhages during follow-up. Each higher (or lower) <b>millimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> of IOP on follow-up was associated with an approximate 10 % increased (or decreased) risk of progression...|$|E
