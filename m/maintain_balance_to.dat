40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{adaptability}} of stiffness {{control in the}} leg during different conditions. Reflex stiffness was studied as occurs during the startle response (freezing). Unexpected auditory stimuli were presented in six phases of the step cycle during walking on a treadmill. EMG responses were observed in both flexors and extensors of the lower leg, often in coactivation. The amplitude of the reflex responses was dependent on {{the timing of the}} startle stimulus in the step cycle. The responses seem adapted to achieve extra stability dependent on the phase of the step cycle. However, even in the first trials, the changes in kinematics were small allowing a smooth progression of gait. The startle response was also studied in Parkinson patients. In these patients rigidity causes an increase in the intrinsic stiffness. Although the patients showed comparable latency, duration, and phase dependency, the habituaton rate was clearly decreased. This finding indicates that habituation of the startle response is a sensitive measure in these patients. Stiffness that is generated in anticipation to a resistance during a movement was studied with a new method using a trap door to induce ankle inversions during walking and jumping. During walking EMG activity in the lower leg showed the main response was observed {{after the end of the}} rotation of the trap door and was thereby too late to resist the induced stretch. Kinematic and EMG data of the whole body showed an avoidance of excessive stretch of the lateral structures of the lower leg by moving the body towards the side of the inversion, thereby decreasing the amount of ankle inversion. This was followed by a correcting response to <b>maintain</b> <b>balance.</b> <b>To</b> be able to study balance correcting response during quiet standing a new gravity-driven multidirectional platform was developed and teste...|$|E
40|$|Falls cause {{substantial}} {{death and}} morbidity in the elderly. Fall risk depends on {{ability to maintain}} balance during daily activities and ability to recover balance following a perturbation such as a slip or trip. To guide the design of fall prevention programs, we need an improved understanding of the biomechanical variables that govern ability to recover balance. The aims of this thesis were to determine (1) {{the relative importance of}} strength versus speed-of-response variables in explaining age differences in balance recovery performance with the ankle strategy, and (2) the association between variables related to ability to recover balance and variables related to ability to <b>maintain</b> <b>balance.</b> <b>To</b> address Aim 1, young and elderly women were supported in a forward leaning position by a horizontal tether and instructed to recover an upright vertical stance by contracting their ankle muscles. The maximum initial lean angle where they could recover balance without release of the tether (which depends primarily on strength) was 19. 6 % smaller for elderly than young. The maximum initial lean angle where they could recover balance after the tether was suddenly released (which depends on strength and speed-of-response) was 36. 1 % smaller for elderly. Moreover, between-group differences in performance were related to both strength and speed-of-response. Peak ankle torque was 7. 7 % smaller in elderly than young during tether release trials, reaction time was 27 % slower in elderly, due to a lengthened muscle response latency, and rate of ankle torque generation was 15. 6 % slower in elderly. These results suggest that exercise-based fall prevention programs should include balance and agility training, in addition to strength training. To address Aim 2, the same elderly subjects participated in postural steadiness experiments, where the amplitude, velocity, and frequency of their centre-of-pressure displacement were measured during quiet stance. Postural steadiness during quiet stance and ability to recover balance with the ankle strategy were not associated, perhaps because postural steadiness during quiet stance is controlled partly by anticipatory strategies, while balance recovery following a perturbation is governed by reactive strategies. These results support the need to measure both balance recovery and postural steadiness in balance assessments of the elderly...|$|E

When the rider is ready the boat will start to tow the skier. The water flowing past the hydrofoil wings generates lift, which can be controlled by the rider to move the board up and down or side to side above the surface of the water. The rider must be centered over the post of the hydrofoil; small body movements will cause great reactions with the hydrofoil.

40|$|Two {{functions}} of the upper limb are reaching and <b>maintaining</b> <b>balance.</b> <b>To</b> successfully perform these roles requires a mechanism for detecting and compensating for body sway. Here I investigate this possible mechanism by using vestibular stimulation to evoke responses in both {{the upper and lower}} limbs. I demonstrate that the evoked arm movements are scaled to the degree of sensed whole-body motion, and only operate when reaching within an earth-fixed reference frame. These findings suggest that vestibular signals contribute to maintaining reach accuracy during unexpected body motion which would otherwise take the limb off-target. I also show that the arm responds to vestibularly sensed body motion for balance. When firmly grasping a stationary support, upper limb forces are coordinated with ground reaction forces to produce a counteractive whole-body sway response. In contrast, during light grasp (< 1 N grip force) the arm does not actively engage in balance. Instead, it simply acts as a passive sensor to provide feedback of body motion which improves balance. Finally, even though postural control during stance has been successfully modelled as an inverted pendulum, my results suggest that the nervous system does not transform light touch feedback into a signal of rotation about the ankle joint...|$|R

30|$|Exploring {{materials}} on, {{with and}} through the body in context can allow meaning to emerge directly from interaction with the material if one remains open to the unexpected, looking to perceived “missteps” as inspiration. This approach can allow designers to design for the senses from the senses, opening the door for multisensory interactive qualities and complex interrelations between the senses. In the presented cases, in the shift from iteration 1 to 2, Open Up (which neither used the body nor context to frame the design process) lost its relation to the body entirely, shifting the focus from feeling the air around the wearer to reliance on a sensor that measured proximity to others to activate the nets. Sound Embracers (which used the body’s engagement with materials, not the context, to frame the design process) switched the focus from the touch of the fingers, to the space the knitted collar created between the arms and the body as it is stretched. Whereas, Trailblazer (which used the body in context to frame the design process) enhanced the wearer’s relationship with their running body by shifting the focus from <b>maintaining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>to</b> guiding.

40|$|The {{appropriateness}} of applying drink driving legislation to motorcycle riding {{has been questioned}} as there may be fundamental differences in the effects of alcohol on driving and motorcycling. It {{has been suggested that}} alcohol may redirect riders’ focus from higher-order cognitive skills such as cornering, judgement and hazard perception, to more physical skills such as <b>maintaining</b> <b>balance.</b> <b>To</b> test this hypothesis, the effects of low doses of alcohol on balance ability were investigated in a laboratory setting. The static balance of twenty experienced and twenty novice riders was measured while they performed either no secondary task, a visual (search) task, or a cognitive (arithmetic) task following the administration of alcohol (0 %, 0. 02 %, and 0. 05 % BAC). Subjective ratings of intoxication and balance impairment increased in a dose-dependent manner in both novice and experienced motorcycle riders, while a BAC of 0. 05 %, but not 0. 02 %, was associated with impairments in static balance ability. This balance impairment was exacerbated when riders performed a cognitive, but not a visual, secondary task. Likewise, 0. 05 % BAC was associated with impairments in novice and experienced riders’ performance of a cognitive, but not a visual, secondary task, suggesting that interactive processes underlie balance and cognitive task performance. There were no observed differences between novice vs. experienced riders on static balance and secondary task performance, either alone or in combination.

Legs are the key parts of the walking robot structure. On the one hand, exquisitely-designed legs make it possible to match the corresponding control algorithm to achieve high operating efficiency [17]. On the other hand, most of the leg designs in up-to-date researches are simply of serial structure or of pantograph mechanism [18]. The oversimplified type of legs, to a certain extent, increases difficulty in gait controlling or mechanism protecting. A specific type synthesis method of designing walking robot legs is a powerful tool for improving the operating performance.|$|R
