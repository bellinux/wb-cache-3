5|$|In 1967 Solti {{was invited}} to become music {{director}} of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.|$|E
5|$|Calleia had {{his first}} real role as a heavy in Small Miracle, and his success in the play was {{responsible}} for his move to Hollywood. Calleia's contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer permitted him a hiatus of six <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> to continue his stage work. He was not new to motion pictures—he had made three feature films on the East Coast—but when MGM put Calleia under contract they promoted his first film, Public Hero No. 1 (1935), as his screen debut. Calleia's portrayal of the gunman was listed by film critic Andre Sennwald of The New York Times {{as one of the}} year's ten best male performances.|$|E

5|$|The plaza {{operates}} as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor ice skating rink that is generally open four <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> from mid-November until mid-March, when it hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It {{is known as}} one of Chicago's better outdoor people-watching locations during the winter months.

5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E
5|$|Delta County has {{historically}} been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, there were already nine churches in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. There were a combined 998 students attending those schools, which operated 4½ <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The school did very well while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed East Texas State University, then Texas A University–Commerce. In 1896, Cooper reported to have one successful school located within the city proper.|$|E

5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two <b>months</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E
