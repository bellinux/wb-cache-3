2500|$|Guitarist Clint Lowery, who rejoined Sevendust in March 2008, commented, [...] "This record {{personally}} {{has been}} one of the most difficult, but most rewarding records I've ever worked on. I put a lot of pressure on myself to contribute good material to the guys after being gone for last three records and that helped me focus <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> had." [...] Added Witherspoon, [...] "I feel this album shows new growth for the band. We're very happy to have Clint back and are looking forward for everyone hearing the magic that's made when we're all together!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I have {{maintained}} {{for the duration}} of my time in Smackin' Isaiah/A Wilhelm Scream that when it stopped being fun, I would give it up. The bottom line here is that I just don't enjoy the day-in, day-out grind of being on tour anymore.... There are no personal or creative differences between any of us. None of that bullshit. I still love this band and everything it stands for. The six years that I've spent in SI/AWS have been the best of my life. We've accomplished <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> expected, and I take with me with more amazing memories than most people experience in a lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E

I helpa lass <b>more</b> horse <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> see on my life. I make tree tousand peso by my father's rancho." ...|$|R
60|$|For contrariness he was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> {{had to deal}} with. Now {{he crossed}} his knees and laughed.|$|R
60|$|The day {{is running}} by <b>more</b> quickly <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thought a day could run for me again. It is now three o'clock.|$|R
60|$|DON JUAN. I {{should ask}} the Devil, Senora: {{he understands the}} ways of this place, which is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you've done <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did; {{and yet we}} had it made {{thinking}} it would do for ladies. But the water looks so black." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{knows more}} than I do, then. He knows <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> shall know. Ada, {{you should not}} have said so. It {{will have to be}} all unsaid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be <b>more</b> {{happiness}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed of," [...] she murmured. [...] "Do {{you think}} we shall be safe in passing through Vienna?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have sent}} you four copies, as I have {{no less than}} eight dozen, {{which is a great}} deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>ever</b> need.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The ballad I must have,' exclaimed Sir James, {{trying to}} shake him off. 'It moves the heart <b>more</b> <b>than</b> aught <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard! How runs it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] he said distinctly. [...] "I {{want you}} to go with me to Loon Lake {{tomorrow}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> wanted any thing in my life before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Phoebe, {{taking the}} ought in a {{different}} sense from what she meant; 'he is all, and <b>more,</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thought a man wise in true wisdom should be.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps we may; {{but it is}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thought of. And as to most matters, to say the truth, {{there are}} not many that I know my own mind about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{someone else}} spoke of me {{a hundred times}} <b>more</b> disparagingly <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> do of Andor would you defend me as warmly, I wonder, as you do him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{offer to}} lend me five times <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> paid you, Mr. Hopper. Tell {{me how you}} have made this money before I accept it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Urmston's face flushed. [...] "I think I {{could have}} been capable of a good deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{probably}} <b>ever</b> shall be now, {{if you could have}} trusted me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I wish my {{collection}} were larger for your benefit {{and my own}} credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> looked into." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mercy, mercy! And that is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> asked yet of man. But it is hard," [...] growled he, [...] "that a {{man should}} lose his money, because a rogue sells him a princess in disguise." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{stopped and}} looked at him steadily. [...] "Then there will be trouble if you give way to them again. And you put in a good deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> told anybody. Now you haven't brains enough to figure out all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I haven't {{effected}} very much; I {{have only}} cared and hoped. You will do <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> done--you and Olive Chancellor, {{because you are}} young and bright, brighter <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> was; and besides, everything has got started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] and {{the girl}} leaned forward a little nearer him, resting {{one hand on the}} arm of her chair. [...] "That is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> would <b>ever</b> ask of you. Still, perhaps you could----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want any}} slave--nor any slavery. I {{want to be}} free always. Now do you see? I don't care for you, and I never could in the old way; but I should have to care for some one <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> shall {{to give up my}} work. Shall we go on?" [...] She looked at her sketch.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked up}} at him. He shook his head, {{thinking}} of his own. It seemed the very distillation of the divine. [...] "All my life," [...] she went on, [...] "I {{have been waiting for}} the one who would risk everything. Oh, if you had faltered the least little bit, I don't know what I should have done. That would have destroyed what was left of me, put out, I think, the flickering fire that remained, instead of fanning it into flame. You cannot know how I watched you, how I prayed! I think it was prayer--I am sure it was. And it was because you did not falter, because you risked all, that you gained me. You have gained only what you yourself made, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> was, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> expected to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, come,' said George, 'Cadurcis {{is always}} ashamed of being amiable. We were {{together}} much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> intended or anticipated. You know mine was a sporting tour; and therefore, of course, we were sometimes separated. But he was exceedingly popular with all parties, especially the Turks, whom he rewarded for their courtesy by writing odes to the Greeks to stir {{them up to}} revolt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, oh!" [...] {{in a tone}} of {{infinite}} surprise and content, [...] "this is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thought of. Indeed I never dreamt of her giving me anything. Sir, may I write to your bookseller, Mr. Tonson, and order a book of Mr. James Thomson's Seasons to give to my sister Harriet, who is delighted with the extracts I have copied for her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mother Anastasia was <b>more</b> {{animated}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had <b>ever</b> {{seen her}} before {{when in the}} uniform of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can understand," [...] he said. [...] "I had a partner--I owe him <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could <b>ever</b> have repaid, {{and he left}} a {{troublesome}} {{piece of}} work to me. It {{will have to be}} put through. But let me see some more; they're great." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear tutor,' said I (now, really, {{without any}} nonsense), 'to whom I owe <b>more</b> {{obligations}} already <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> can acknowledge--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am not angry, {{except with}} {{the ways of}} the world. I do like to be spoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could {{understand}} a little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> hear even from young gentlemen who have been to college." [...] Mary had recovered, and she spoke with a suppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stratten {{has just}} been here. I admire him <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did, for his admiration of my doves. By the way, I am sure he thought them the most {{agreeable}} of the whole party; for he said, what he never did before, that he could sit here for an hour! Our love to Annie--and forgive me for Baskettiring a letter to you. I mean, of course, as to size, not type.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I had {{no right}} to keep coming to your house in the way I did, unless--unless I meant <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> said." [...] Beaton added: [...] "I don't say that what you did was usual--in this country, at any rate; but I can't say you were wrong. Since you speak to me about the matter, it's only fair to myself to say that a good deal goes on in life without much {{thinking}} of consequences. That's the way I excuse myself." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was said}} with feeling; <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had <b>ever</b> seen Bulstrode {{manifest}} before, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{had given him}} credit for possessing. Anneke coloured a little; {{but there was no}} tremor in the beautiful hand, that held a highly-wrought little tea-pot suspended over a cup, at that very moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Must {{have been}} the wind, or {{something}} like that," [...] he murmured. [...] "Or else I'm getting <b>more</b> nervous <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> was before. Now that I've got used to those boys around, it seems dreadfully lonely when they are gone;" [...] and he heaved a deep sigh.|$|R
60|$|So {{that was}} the {{beginning}} of our married life. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>I</b> felt sure I could trust in Harold.|$|R
