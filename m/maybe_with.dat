5|$|Although a {{commercial}} smash, the record received initially lukewarm reviews from mainstream music critics; many contemporary reviewers deemed it inferior to Definitely <b>Maybe,</b> <b>with</b> the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. In the ensuing years, however, critical opinion towards the album reversed, {{and it is}} now generally considered a seminal record of both the Britpop era, and the 1990s in general. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. The most notable of the concerts were two Knebworth House performances in August to a combined crowd of 250,000 people. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album.|$|E

500|$|Cynewulf {{was murdered}} in 786. His {{succession}} was contested by Ecgberht, but he was defeated by Beorhtric, <b>maybe</b> <b>with</b> Offa's assistance. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Ecgberht spent three years in Francia before he was king, exiled by Beorhtric and Offa. The text says [...] "iii" [...] for three, but {{this may have been}} a scribal error, with the correct reading being [...] "xiii", that is, thirteen years. Beorhtric's reign lasted sixteen years, and not thirteen; and all extant texts of the Chronicle agree on [...] "iii", but many modern accounts assume that Ecgberht did indeed spend thirteen years in Francia. This requires assuming that the error in transcription is common to every manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; many historians make this assumption but others have rejected it as unlikely, given the consistency of the sources. [...] In either case Ecgberht was probably exiled in 789, when Beorhtric, his rival, married the daughter of Offa of Mercia.|$|E

2500|$|Henry's {{last day}} as a wiseguy was {{the hardest part of}} the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to {{properly}} show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by cocaine and amphetamines intoxication. Scorsese said to movie critic Mark Cousins in an interview the reason for Pesci shooting at the screen {{at the end of the}} film: [...] "well that's a reference right to the end of The Great Train Robbery, that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to The Great Train Robbery. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday." [...] The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, [...] "I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do—and <b>maybe</b> <b>with</b> the system which allows this." ...|$|E
