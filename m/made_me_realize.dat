The next day, she won the S10 50-metre freestyle gold medal in a record time of 28.10 seconds. Mortimer's time was [...]07 second faster than her April Trials record, and [...]14 second faster than Pascoe's time; she went into the race [...] "a bit annoyed" [...] and [...] "mad at anyone who was going to take it from me".|$|E

The sight of it, with its bloodstained and ghost-blasted reputation, would in itself have been enough to send a thrill through my nerves; but when the words of my uncle <b>made</b> <b>me</b> suddenly <b>realize</b> that this strange summons was indeed for the two men who were concerned in that old-world tragedy, and that it was the playmate of my youth who had sent it, I caught my breath as I seemed vaguely {{to catch a glimpse of}} some portentous thing forming itself in front of us. The rusted gates between the crumbling heraldic pillars were folded back, and my uncle flicked the mares impatiently as we flew up the weed-grown avenue, until he pulled them on their haunches before the time-blotched steps. The front door was open, and Boy Jim was waiting there to meet us.|$|R

60|$|However, a good rest {{helped to}} revive {{strength}} and spirit. Then I started. Once above the saddle I was out {{clear in the}} open, high above the canyons, and the vast basin still farther below, yet far indeed under the pine-fringed rim above. This climb was all over stone. The ridge was narrow-crested, yellow, splintered rock, with a few dwarf pines and spruces and an occasional bunch of manzanita. I did not hear a sound that I did not make myself. Whatever had become of the hounds, and the other hunters? The higher I climbed the more I liked it. After an hour I was sure that I could reach the rim by this route, and of course that stimulated me. To make sure, and allay doubt, I {{sat down on a}} high backbone of bare rock and studied the heave and bulge of ridge above me. Using my glasses I made sure that I could climb out. It would be a task equal to those of lion-hunting days with Jones, and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> happy to <b>realize</b> that despite the intervening ten years I was still equal to the task.|$|R
