2500|$|Pre-industrial {{machinery}} {{was built}} by various craftsmen – millwrights built water and wind mills, carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. [...] As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common. [...] Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts. [...] Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of Jan Verbruggen. In 1774 Jan Verbruggen had installed a horizontal boring machine in Woolwich {{which was the first}} industrial size Lathe in the UK. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. [...] Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe. [...] Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut <b>machine</b> <b>screws</b> of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw. [...] Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. [...] The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea, he {{was the first person to}} build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of NC, <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> diverged into two classes, {{mechanical}} and NC. This distinction continues today with mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> and CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> However, in shop-floor jargon, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> by itself is still often understood in context to imply a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> so the retronym mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is not consistently used.|$|R
2500|$|In 1876, Hartford <b>Machine</b> <b>Screw</b> {{was granted}} a charter [...] "for the purpose of {{manufacturing}} screws, hardware and machinery of every variety."

Its president was George Fairfield, who ran Weed, and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, one of Connecticut's most versatile inventors. Soon Hartford <b>Machine</b> <b>Screw</b> outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it remained until 1948.|$|R

40|$|A new basic space {{fastener}} {{has been}} developed and tested by the GSFC. The purposes of this fastener are to permit assembly and servicing in space by astronauts and/or robots and to facilitate qualification of payloads on Earth prior to launch by saving time and money during the systems integration and component testing and qualification processes. The space fastener is a rework of the basic <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> such that crossthreading is impossible; it is self-locking and will not work its way out during launch (vibration proof); it will not wear out despite repeated use; it occupies a small foot print which is comparable to its <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> equivalent, and it provides force and exhibits strength comparable to its <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> equivalent. Construction is ultra-simple and cost effective and the principle is applicable across {{the full range of}} screw sizes ranging from a # 10 screw to 2. 5 cm (1 in) or more. In this paper, the fastener principles of operation will be discussed along with test results and construction details. The new fastener also has considerable potential in the commercial sector. A few promising applications will be presented...|$|R

5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied, and the term hand <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> or manual <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|R

50|$|The {{fastener}} is an anchor, an {{expandable sleeve}} that slides {{into a hole}} drilled into the wall. A lip wider than the hole prevents it from falling behind the wall. A <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> is then screwed into the sleeve, causing the anchor to bend, expand, spread and grip against {{the inside of the}} drywall.|$|R
50|$|MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical {{fasteners}} are T-nuts and pan-head <b>machine</b> <b>screws.</b> Smooth-shank nails do {{not hold}} well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a coarse thread pitch, but sheet-metal screws also work well. Like natural wood, MDF may split when woodscrews are installed without pilot holes.|$|E

50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern screw machines. These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|E
50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} tap and dies and urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for <b>machine</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|E
50|$|Orientation {{relies on}} the shape and {{mechanical}} behaviour of an object, particular the position of its centre of mass in relation to its centre of volume. It thus works well for parts such as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> with rotational symmetry and a clear asymmetry to one heavy end. It does not work for entirely symmetrical shapes, or where orientation depends on a feature such as colour. The ramps within a bowl feeder are specifically designed for each part, although the core mechanism is re-used across different parts.|$|E
