40|$|Lithium-ion {{battery is}} {{commonly}} used for mobile power supply such as laptop and mobile telephone, because of its high energy density, but when malfunctions such as short circuit occurred inside battery, {{it could lead to}} ignition or explosion, and the battery safety is recognized as social problem. In process of battery production,metallic contaminant mix with parts of a battery can be a cause of short circuit inside battery. Therefore, it is necessary to detect at production stage. Study for detection <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> in battery using high temperature SQUID is currently in progress and by using this, 50 tm ferromagnetic metal piece can be detected successfully. However, a cooling medium or cryogenic refrigerator is necessary for SQUID operation, so that the total measurement system becomes large size and expensive. On the other hand, Hall probe is known to be cheap and high versatility magnetic field sensor. Although measurement sensitivity of magnetic field for Hall probe is much lower than SQUID, by applying an external magnetic field can increase the field generated from magnetized <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant,</b> resulting into increase for possibility to detect the <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant.</b> In this research, we measured the magnetic field distribution of <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> in electrode for lithium-ion battery using Hall probe and examined the applicability for <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> detection technology that is more simple, easier and cheaper...|$|E
40|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> {{detectors}} {{based on}} the balanced coil system are widely used in the food industry. In the balanced coil system, an excitation coil and two identical pickup coils are used {{in a way that}} the magnetic coupling of pickup coils to the excitation coil is cancelled with each other when no metallic contaminants present. In a conventional system, the excitation coil and the pickup coil are planar and are parallel, therefore the magnetic coupling is strong even if there is no <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant.</b> Such strong magnetic coupling makes balancing procedure tedious. In this paper, we introduce a new coil system in which pickup coils are set orthogonal to the excitation coil, making the magnetic coupling much small compared to conventional counterpart. Pickup coils are equipped with thin magnetic cores and placed inside the excitation coil being parallel to the excitation coil plane. The balancing method consists of two steps; the one is geometrical and the other is digital processing including down conversion. Experiments are carried out to show the detection capability of ferromagnetic contaminants and non-magnetic contaminants...|$|E

This testing simulated a contaminant particle in the low-pressure oxygen turbo pump (LPOTP) and the high-pressure oxygen turbo pump (HPOTP) of the shuttle main propulsion system. Monel(R) K- 500 and Inconel(R) 718 samples represented the LPOTP and HPOTP materials. Aluminum foil tape and titanium foil represented the contaminant particles. In both the Monel(R) and Inconel(R) material configurations, the aluminum foil tape samples did not ignite after 30 s of rubbing. In contrast, all of the titanium foil samples ignited regardless of the rubbing duration or material configuration.

40|$|In this study, the {{quantity}} of <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminants</b> extracted from grinded millet was evaluated. The millet was grinded in three different forms; wet, paste, and dry forms for up to 3 minutes using locally fabricated grinding machine with cast grinding discs. Separate grinding discs were used for different millet forms, while the same quantity of millet, 1 kg, was used throughout the experiments. The millet was soaked for 24 hours before grinding {{in order to obtain}} wet and paste forms of the millet. <b>Metallic</b> <b>contaminants</b> were carefully extracted from the grinded millet using magnetic bed along with sedimentation and decantation. The extracted materials were then quantified to ascertain the food form that produces the highest amount of <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Also, the wear rate of the grinding disc was also determined with respect to the grinding time. The results show that the wet form has the highest amount of <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminants</b> of about 1. 397 g followed by the paste form with 1. 075 g. The dry form has the least value corresponding to 0. 945 g.

40|$|Due to new memory-cell architectures, the leakage-current {{requirements}} for semiconductor memories will become less stringent with {{increased levels of}} integration. The implication of these requirements with regard to allowable metallic contamination levels is investigated with a one-dimensional model based on Shockley-Read-Hall generation-recombination. The model was developed to predict leakage-current in carrier-depleted regions {{as a function of}} basic process and <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> parameters. As device dimensions are reduced, transition metal homogeneous contamination in process chemicals can be an important source of generation-recombination centers that result in the dominant generation-current in the space-charge region. The model allows an estimation of an upper bound for transition metal contamination in advanced processes and is applied for DRAM leakage predictions. Using the model, it is demonstrated that the trend toward lower leakage-current density requirements reverses after the 64 -Mbit generation DRAM as a result of memory-cell architecture trends which significantly reduce the space-charge volume...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{fabrication}} of a magnetic <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> detector using multi-channel high-Tc RF-SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) for large packaged food.

The system described here is different from the previous systems in its permitted size for inspection, being larger at 150 mm in height × 300 mm in width. For inspection of large sized food packages, improvement of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is an important issue because the signal intensity is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between the SQUID sensor and the object.

40|$|The Chemical Time Bomb Concept (CTB) {{refers to}} “events {{resulting}} in the delayed occurrence of harmful effects due to the mobilization of chemicals stored in soils and sediments”. Why do some ecosystems accept contaminants with no (little) impact? If soils and sediments are sinks for <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminants</b> it is because their hydrogeochemical environment is favorable. Why do they release them at some point? Oversaturation of the ecosystem is often suggested as the cause. We propose here {{a new approach to}} this now well accepted concept. The soil or sediment retains its metallic pollutants as long as the controlling parameters, i. e. mostly pH and Eh, are stable.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Biosorption {{of heavy}} metal ions by {{different}} pectin rich {{materials such as}} waste citrus peels is emerging as a promising technique for <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> removal. While binding rate and capacity of citrus peels were previously investigated, {{there is a lack}} of mechanistic information about Pb-citrus pectin/peels interaction mechanisms. Present research focused on evaluating this binding mechanism by corroborating macroscopic studies with spectroscopic techniques. Citrus pectins of two different methoxylation degrees and orange peels were characterized using potentiometric titrations and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Binding mechanisms were evaluated using molecular scale FTIR analyses. The effects of particle size, pH, co-ion presence, and background electrolyte concentrations were also investigated for biosorption of Pb by orange peels. Both citrus pectin and orange peels reached their sorption equilibrium within 45 minutes. The maximum uptake capacity for orange peels was found to be 2. 32 mmol/g. Citrus peels have very similar FTIR spectra to citrus pectin, suggesting that they have similar functional groups and pectin can be used as a model for citrus peels. Furthermore, carboxylic acid groups were found to be responsible for binding of Pb by citrus pectin and orange peels...|$|E

Particles roe initially spherical and are composed of M 50 high-carbon steel powder. Their diameter ranges from 32 to 40 mu m An original lubrication system with a controlled level of contamination was built. The contaminant distribution and concentration are measured on-line by an automatic particle counter. Tests are conducted on a two-disk machine with different operating conditions. Particles may travel through the EHL contact only one time, the lubricant flow being used only once. The oil is a synthetic one qualified under the MIL-L- 23699 specification. An optical profilometer is {{used to describe the}} indent topography and a CCD video camera to count the number of dents. The test bench is described and the experimental procedure is presented.

40|$|Releases {{from the}} F and H Area Seepage Basins on the Savannah River Site (SRS) have caused {{groundwater}} plumes that contain {{a variety of}} contaminants. These plumes are releasing contaminants into Fourmile Branch, which is a small tributary of the Savannah River. The <b>metallic</b> <b>contaminant</b> releases to the branch are being controlled by base injection. The base injection targets cationic contaminants and {{was not intended to}} reduce the concentration of I- 129 in groundwater. SRS and the regulatory agencies believe it is appropriate to investigate remedial alternatives that could reduce the I- 129. The Savannah River Site Area Closures Projects (ACP) and the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) are developing an innovative in situ treatment for I- 129 using silver chloride (AgCl). The proposed AgCl amendment has a very small particle size and is designed to be injected into the contaminated aquifer to capture I- 129. The solubility of AgI is several orders of magnitude lower than the solubility of AgCl. Thus, when I- 129 comes in contact with AgCl it forms silver iodide (AgI), which is very stable and essentially insoluble in water. SRNL has been performing bench-scale column tests on the effectiveness of silver chloride to capture iodine in an aqueous solution. These initial tests evaluate silver chloride in four different particle sizes; 4 - 5 millimeters (standard reagent silver chloride), approximately 1 millimeters (sieved reagent silver chloride), approximately 2 micrometers (ultra fine grind without a grinding agent), and < 1 micrometer (ultra fine grind with a grinding agent). The first two experiments with macro-sized particles were proof of principle tests. In these the AgCl was mechanically mixed into a portion of the soil filling the columns. The last two were to test the effectiveness of injecting particles suspended in an aqueous solution [...] the ability to inject the particles, their retention in the column and their effectiveness at removing dissolved iodide from solution. The amendments for these two columns were obtained from a private company specializing in ultra-fine grinding of materials. They were ground in propylene glycol because when ground in water silver metal electroplated onto the steel grinding equipment. Table 1 shows the list of columns and the amendment characteristics. The results of these column experiments demonstrate that solid silver chloride is highly effective at removing dissolved iodine from water and should be an effective amendment for removing I- 129 from groundwater. Based on known groundwater chemistry and the reaction of AgCl with I- to produce AgI, the only interference will be natural dissolved stable iodine (I- 127). Millings et al. (2002) reported a maximum I- 127 concentration of 2. 2 ug/L in groundwater from well P- 27 D, a background water table well near F-Area. The concentration of dissolved iodide used in these experiments is approximately 4500 times this natural concentration. Therefore, a AgCl amendment in the subsurface at the same concentration used in these experiments, might effectively remove I- 129 for up to 4500 times the number of pore volumes of groundwater as observed here. This assumes homogeneous distribution of the amendment and no occlusion by other minerals in the subsurface. The only reliable way to evaluate these effects is by trial in the field. The column studies also suggest that the amendment is readily injectable into sediments, but will not be highly mobile. The fact that the effluent from Column 4 shows no iodide breakthrough after nearly 11 pore volumes indicates that some of the injected AgCl was trapped in the column. A mass balance on iodide reacted so far suggests that a minimum of 0. 056 grams of silver chloride was trapped in the column to react with the iodide. This is 5. 6 % of the mass injected. Assume the 1 -foot column represents the first foot of sediment in the subsurface into which the amendment is injected. If 5. 6 % of the AgCl particles are trapped in each subsequent foot of sediment through which the injectate moves, at 100 feet the concentration of particles will be 3 % of the injection concentration. This is the maximum possible concentration indicated by these column studies, because far more AgCl may have been trapped in the column. Continued data collection will tell how much more. Dissolved silver concentrations from the silver chloride amendment will be low. Effluent from Column 1 was analyzed for dissolved silver and the concentrations were below the detection limit of 0. 2 mg/L...|$|E
