The result of analysis showed that there are many statistically conclusive relationship between the parameters of <b>milking</b> <b>capacity</b> and the amount, composition and technological properties of cow's milk. Conclusive relationship between the length of the total milk yield and milking, cows with milk yield greater than 10. 6 kg of milk should milking time of 1. 13 minutes longer than it was in dairy cows with lower production. The length of milking had a negative correlation with the absolute average minute gain (AAMG) and total milk yield. Dairy cows have been milking within 5 minutes had an average of 1. 21 kg / min greater AAMG. These cows also had an average of 0. 20 kg less milk than cows that were milked more than 5 minutes.

Therefore, prediction of the milking robot utilization has to be done. The milking robot utilization depends on the cows visiting pattern and capacity of the milking robot. The models used for prediction were generalized multiple regression models. Behavioural data were obtained by video observations and electronic measurements. For eleven behavioural variables used in the model from all three experiments, only two (number of cows and sum of milk yields per hour in kilograms) were statistically significant (p ≤ 0. 05) and measurable on a commercial farm.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{integration}} of robotic milking in the dairy farm and focusses on the following aspects: (a) required <b>milking</b> <b>capacity</b> of robotic milking units, (b) cow traffic and visits to the milking units and (c) design of total systems. The capacity of a milking stall in milkings per hour depends on the milking time per milking, the occupation time of the milking stall and the accessability of the milking parlour. Based on milk yields of 14. 1, 10. 7 and 8. 1 and 7. 0 min per milking were established. It is expected that because of cows loitering at or obstructing the entry or exit and because of a certain daily pattern in the AMS visits, an effective occupation of about 60 % of the milking stall will be possible. The capacity is then 4. 2, 4. 5 and 5. 2 milkings per hour. It was assumed that an AMS-stall is vailable 20 h per day for milking and 4 h per day for cleaning. For a herd of 100 lactating cows, three times daily milking and an occupation time of the milking stall of 60 % of the available 20 h, four milking stalls are needed. Based on experiences gained in various experiments a lay out is suggested for an automatic milking system with automatic voluntary cow traffic. For automatic milking in a milking parlour with milking of cows in batches (human controlled cow traffic) the number of milking stalls will depend mainly on the chosen group size. For labour reasons this group size should not be too small and may vary between 50 and 100 cows. Based on the requirement {{that a group of}} cows has to be milked within approximately 1 h and an automatic milking stall with a 100 % occupation time, the required number of milking stalls for three times per day milking and for herd sizes of 50, 100 and 200 cows are respectively 6, 6 and 8.

40|$|Two cow traffic {{situations}} {{were tested}} sequentially in an {{automatic milking system}} (AMS) for effects on cow behavior, effective use of the barn, and <b>milking</b> <b>capacity.</b> The first situation was forced cow traffic: 63 cows had {{to pass through the}} AMS to go from the lying area to the feeding area. The second was semiforced cow traffic: 67 cows (60 cows from before) had free access to a forage feeding area {{at one end of the}} barn but could only access an area with concentrate feeders by passing through the AMS. Behavior of all cows was monitored as well as for two subsets of cows present in both situations: 8 cows with low frequency vs. 7 cows with high frequency of visits to the AMS. In each situation, cows were observed for 72 h. Cow locations and behavior were noted at 10 -min intervals for all cows and individually for the selected cows. In semiforced traffic, the herd readily used the freely accessible forage feeding area, ate longer (17. 4 % of the day vs. 15. 1 ± 0. 59 %), and stood less in freestalls (9. 0 vs. 11. 8 ± 0. 30 %) than when cow traffic was forced. Nonmilking visits to the AMS tended to decrease, whereas milking visits remained unchanged in the semiforced situation. The subset of cows that visited the AMS more often had fewer nonmilking visits (1. 8 vs. 4. 2 ± 0. 7) in the semiforced traffic situation whereas cows with low frequency of visits to the AMS had a nonsignificant increase (1. 5 vs. 1. 0) in nonmilking visits. Cows that visited the AMS frequently used the forage feeding area and the lying area next to it more than low frequency cows and use of those areas increased further during the semiforced situation. The semiforced cow traffic was deemed more desirable than forced cow traffic both for cows and for the capacity of the automatic milking system...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and examine the {{validity}} of using a phenotype scoring system (PTS), a new concept, in evaluating milk yield and constituents in different goat genotypes (Indigenous, British Alpines, Saanen and Toggenburg) raised in small scale production systems. Strategic decisions of small scale African farmers are mostly based on visual appraisal or body condition scoring (BCS) of their animals. BCS has been highly recommended as a means to evaluate both the energy and the health status of animals, especially in beef farming, but this method has been criticized for being too simple and too subjective because its evaluation is often done too late after the damage has already happened. Phenotype scoring (an approach which includes breed, udder size and BCS of the animal) is presented in this study as a better tool to evaluate milk yield in different goat genotypes raised under free range conditions. This has also been a good opportunity firstly to indicate which, among the three dairy breeds of goat under discussion, can adapt best to the African small scale farming system; secondly to review the relevance of some blood metabolites in characterizing milk production in different goat breeds and thirdly to study the <b>milking</b> <b>capacity</b> of the indigenous compared to the dairy goats raised under small scale production systems in South Africa. Thirty-two goats (8 Indigenous, 8 British Alpines, 8 Saanen and 8 Toggenburg) were raised in a free range system at the ARC-Irene experimental farm close to Pretoria. The experiment was a completely randomized experimental design with eight replicates per treatment group. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture into 10 ml heparinised tubes in the morning before feeding on a weekly basis over a period of two months. Blood plasma was immediately aspirated after centrifugation (3000 G), kept on ice and brought to the laboratory for the analysis of glucose, cholesterol, urea nitrogen (BUN) and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. Immediately after, all does were entirely milked (followed by 1 ml oxytocin IM injection and the kids taken away for a period of four hours) before a second milking session took place to measure the daily milk yield of the does. Milk samples were analyzed for lactose, milk proteins, milk fat, milk urea-nitrogen (MUN) and milk somatic cell count (SCC). In addition body condition score (BCS), age and data related to the goat genotype (breed, udder characteristics) were recorded. Results confirmed that milk yield from dairy goats was higher (p< 0. 001) than the milk yield of indigenous goats during the entire period of study. Milk lactose values recorded in this study (between 3. 9 and 4. 9 %) were the most stable constituent in goat’s milk. Milk protein concentration (between 3. 1 and 4. 5 %) was significantly higher in the indigenous than in dairy breeds, especially in week one and from week four onwards. Milk fat values (between 3. 3 and 7. 7 %) displayed a decline in all breeds; but as from week three, the fat in milk of indigenous does increased and from week five onwards, it remained significantly higher (p< 0. 001) compared to that of dairy breeds. In conclusion, the superiority of dairy breeds in milk yield was proven while the quality of indigenous goat milk was recognized. Studies on the characterization of milk production in different breeds revealed that the Toggenburg was superior to the other breeds, followed by the British Alpines and the Saanen; but the British Alpines showed a better adaptability to the environment followed by the Toggenburg and the Saanen. The latter could not produce milk without feed supplementation and lost most body condition as compared to the other breeds. Statistical analyses indicated that breed influenced milk yield, milk fat and the protein content of milk (especially in the Saanen and Toggenburg goats). BCS influenced fat content, lactose, milk proteins, MUN and SCC and also milk yield. Udder size influenced milk proteins and milk yield while udder attachment was associated with milk yield only. These results show that PTS, because it takes into account BCS, breed and udder size, is a better tool for predicting milk yield of goats herded in small scale farming systems. Africans interested in dairy goat farming should adopt PTS as a means to evaluate milk yield especially since milk is sold per volume and not by quality in Africa. Finally, milk from the indigenous goats is superior in terms of lactose, fat and protein content. The latter quality attributes can be used as selection criteria since the milk industry pays premiums for the fat and protein content of milk. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

In the first part of study, the effect of photoperiod on lactation performance in the goats was studied, and particularly to investigate if this response can be potentiated by prior exposure to short periods of short days elicited by melatonin treatment. Long light did not produce clear stimulatory effect on milk yield, but a small response was seen in autumn and only in goats that were not treated by melatonin. Repeated short cycles of melatonin did not sensitize lactating goats to subsequent long light effect to milk yield regardless of stage of lactation or commencement time of year. Indeed, this treatment might produce a detrimental effect on milk yield when applied in early lactation. The second part {{of the study was to}} determine the maximum metabolic capacity of cows from different genetic merit.

Firms with decreasing returns to scale (i. e., an oversized production capacity) face a higher risk of takeover. This suggests that cheese manufacturers have been seeking to expand their <b>milk</b> processing <b>capacities</b> by acquiring large firms. This proves to be an indirect consequence of the non-transferable milk quota regime affecting the scarce milk input commodity. [EconLit citations: D 24, L 25, Q 13 ]. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|We {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of the effects of energy and protein status on the immune system, with a particular focus on the periparturient dairy cow. Recent studies have shown a significant component of the leukocyte proteome is committed to energy metabolism and cell signalling machinery. The various proteins involved in enabling and maintaining leukocyte function represent a demand on the host's protein metabolism. As part of this discussion we will focus on metabolic challenges facing the transition cow and how milk production influences metabolism and immune function. We also know there is. considerable genetic control over the immune system capacity to function. There is as much genetic difference in immune function during the periparturient period between cows of average milk production capability as there is between cows of high <b>milk</b> production <b>capacity.</b> Therefore, very high milk production will not likely dictate that a cow will experience a greater magnitude or duration of immune suppression than a lower producing cow. It is more likely the inability of individual cows to adapt to the metabolic demands of milk production dictates the degree and duration of immune suppression experienced at calving...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>milk</b> {{drinking}} <b>capacity</b> of 200 adults {{was determined}} experimentally {{and the results}} correlated with their milk drinking habits and intestinal lactase activity as judged by a lactose tolerance test. Of the group 65. 5 % {{were found to have}} deficient lactase activity and 5. 3 % experienced severe gastrointestinal symptoms with 250 ml of milk; 28. 2 % with 500 ml; 26. 0 % with 750 ml; 15. 3 % with 1000 ml, and 25. 2 % tolerated the latter amount without difficulty. Of the normal individuals, 92. 7 % tolerated 1000 ml without symptoms. Intestinal lactase activity seemed to be important in determining the extremes of milk ingestion: four or more glasses per day or no milk ingestion, but had little effect in the intermediate pattern of milk consumption. It is concluded that intestinal lactase deficiency has clinical relevance and should be considered when nutritional supplementation with milk is contemplated. Am. I Clin. Nutr. 31 : 1499 - 1503, 1978. There is agreement {{that the majority of the}} world’s population has low intestinal lactase activity during adulthood (1). A past consid-eration was whether this is an adaptive or a genetic phenomenon (2), but recently severa...|$|R
40|$|Livestock farming {{forms an}} {{integral}} part in {{the economy of the}} Uttarakhand Himalaya and {{plays an important role in}} the mixed crop farming system. In addition, high diversity in livestock composition is the characteristic features of the mainland of Uttarakhand. The state obtains high potential of milk production because of availability of fodder as a form of extensive grasslands, which are locally known as bugyals or kharaks and fodder trees. Livestock, other than milk production, are widely used for manure, plowing fields and transportation of goods. The availability of extensive grasslands and feasible climatic conditions manifest a way for sustainable livestock farming in Uttarakhand, particularly in the temperate zone between 1400 m and 2200 m, where production of milk is high. Valley regions are generally known for rearing of drought animals with low <b>milk</b> producing <b>capacity.</b> This paper aims to discuss on the prospects of sustainable livestock farming and to trace the temporal changes that took place over the past years in terms of livestock population, composition, and the governmental policies and planning for developing livestock sector. It draws implications on these experiences for livestock planners and policy-makers and raises several research issues related to livestock sector development...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between serum total cholesterol levels 20 days before calving and disease occurrence rate {{in relation to}} <b>milk</b> producing <b>capacity</b> after calving was investigated. In cases where peak daily milk yield were below 30 kg, the disease occurrence rate in cows with total cholesterol levels between 120 - 170 mg/dl and those with levels below 120 mg/dl were 22. 6 % and 63. 9 %, respectively. The disease occurrence rate in cows with total cholesterol levels less than 120 mg/dl was significantly higher (P<O. Ol). Similar observation was made in cows with peak daily milk yield of over 30 kg. In this group moreover, cows with total cholesterol levels of more than 170 mg/dl have significantly lower disease occurrence rate as compared to those with total cholesterol levels less than 120 mg/dl (P< 0. 01). From these results, the prophylactic diagnosis using total cholesterol level and peak milk yield was found useful as an indicator to predict the occurrence of diseases after calving on farms with average milking yield between 5, 000 kg to 6, 500 kg/year. Key words: cattle, total cholesterol level, disease occurrence rate, calving...|$|R
40|$|Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum {{is among}} the {{dominant}} species of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and could thus have potential as probiotics. New targets such as antioxidant properties have interest for beneficial effects on health. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the bioaccessibility of antioxidants in milk fermented by selected B. longum subsp. longum strains during in vitro dynamic digestion. The antioxidant capacity of cell extracts from 38 strains, of which 32 belong to B. longum subsp. longum, was evaluated with the ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) method. On the basis of screening and gene sequence typing by multilocus locus sequence analysis (MLSA), five strains were chosen for fermenting reconstituted skim <b>milk.</b> Antioxidant <b>capacity</b> varied among the strains tested (P= 0. 0009). Two strains of B. longum subsp. longum (CUETM 172 and 171) showed significantly higher ORAC values than the other bifidobacteria strains. However, there does not appear to be a relationship between gene sequence types and antioxidant <b>capacity.</b> The <b>milk</b> fermented by each of the five strains selected (CUETM 268, 172, 245, 247, or PRO 16 - 10) did not have higher initial ORAC values compared to the nonfermented milk samples. However, higher bioaccessibility of antioxidants in fermented milk (175 – 358 %) was observed during digestion...|$|R
40|$|In todays’ pig husbandry, farmers {{strive for}} large litters and high {{production}} numbers. However, {{it is often}} forgotten that the average birth weight decreases when litters are larger. This can affect growth, mortality rate, feed conversion ratio… Because sows sometimes have more piglets than they can nurse, piglets can be raised in piglet nurseries or by ‘foster sows’. The objective {{of the present study}} was therefore to compare production results (growth and mortality rate) of piglets with the mother sow, piglets raised by a foster sow and piglets in a rescue deck. Results indicate that all three groups of piglets have similar average daily gain (ADG) during the first two weeks of life. However, during the third and fourth week piglets in rescue decks have a higher ADG than the other groups. This is probably due to the fact that piglets in rescue decks had ad libitum access to milk, while the other piglets were limited by the <b>milk</b> producing <b>capacity</b> of the (mother or foster) sow. After weaning, when all piglets have ad libitum access to feed, the difference in ADG disappears again. There were no differences in mortality rate. As a conclusion, rescue decks can give an advantage in ADG to piglets, but the advantage is temporary and disappears after weaning. status: publishe...|$|R
