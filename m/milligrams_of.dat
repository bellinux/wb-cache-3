A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> GAE and 163 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> ECE in red wine, and 165 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> GAE and 47 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E

5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.|$|E

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E

5|$|A soft, silvery-white {{radioactive}} metal, actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 {{in nearly all}} its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of {{physical and chemical properties}} of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.|$|E
5|$|Actinium {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium isotope 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium-actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with the stable lead isotope 207Pb. The isotope 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with the stable lead isotope 208Pb. Another actinium isotope (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain existed only in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E

5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (<b>milligrams)</b> <b>of</b> crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. <b>Milligrams</b> <b>of</b> einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E
5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of <b>milligrams</b> <b>of</b> lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an improved assay for microsomal heme oxygenase activity, based on the enzymic release of CO from the a-methene bridge of hemin and the quantitation of CO by gas chromatography. The within-run coefficient of variation (CV) of heme oxygenase assays in microsomes from rat tissues (liver, kidney) averaged 8 %; the between-run CV averaged 15 %. The detection limit for heme oxygenase activity was approximately 1 nmol/h per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> microsomal protein.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Because {{clinical}} {{data about}} the therapeutic consequences of polymorphic oxidation of simvastatin by CYP 2 D 6 have not been well reported, we sought to investigate the possible link between polymorphism of CYP 2 D 6 and the efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin treatment {{in a group of}} 88 patients with hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: The CYP 2 D 6 genotype was determined with use of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment analysis, whereas the CYP 2 D 6 phenotype was determined by monitoring the dextromethorphan metabolism. RESULTS: Four of 5 patients with 2 defective CYP 2 D 6 alleles discontinued the therapy at a low daily dose because of adverse events, with a significant mean decrease in the cholesterol levels of 0. 23 mmol/L per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> simvastatin in the daily dose. In the group of 28 patients with 1 mutated CYP 2 D 6 gene, 13 did not tolerate the therapy, whereas a mean decrease in the cholesterol levels of 0. 20 mmol/L per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> simvastatin was found. One patient with a multiplication of the CYP 2 D 6 gene showed a cholesterol reduction of only 0. 01 mmol/L per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> simvastatin, at a maximal daily dose of 40 mg. Only 9 patients of the group of 54 persons who were homozygous for the wild-type allele discontinued the therapy because of intolerance. In that group, a mean decrease of cholesterol of 0. 10 mmol/L per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> simvastatin was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that the cholesterol-lowering effect of simvastatin is influenced by CYP 2 D 6 polymorphism.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} oxidative-stress parameters in individuals with chronic neck or back pain after 5 weeks of treatment with high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) spinal manipulation. MethodsTwenty-three individuals aged 38. 2 ± 11. 7 years with nonspecific chronic neck or back pain verified by the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Chronic Pain Grade, with a sedentary lifestyle, no comorbidities, and not in adjuvant therapy, underwent treatment with HVLA chiropractic manipulation twice weekly for 5 weeks. Therapeutic procedures were carried out by an experienced chiropractor. Blood samples were assessed before and after treatment to determine the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the levels of nitric oxide metabolites and lipid hydroperoxides. These blood markers were analyzed by paired Student t test. Differences were considered statistically significant, when P was <. 05. ResultsThere was no change in catalase but an increase in SOD (0. 35 ± 0. 03 U SOD per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> protein vs 0. 44 ± 0. 04 U SOD per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> protein; P <. 05) and GPx (7. 91 ± 0. 61 nmol/min per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> protein vs 14. 07 ± 1. 07 nmol/min per <b>milligram</b> <b>of</b> protein; P <. 001) activities after the treatment. The nitric oxide metabolites and the lipid hydroperoxides did not change after treatment. ConclusionHigh-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation twice weekly for 5 weeks increases the SOD and GPx activities. Previous studies have shown a relationship between pain and oxidative and nitrosative parameters; thus, it is possible that changes in these enzymes might be related to the analgesic effect of HVLA spinal manipulation...|$|R

MethodsUsing a health plan database, we identified patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia treated with quetiapine monotherapy {{for at least four}} consecutive months. The stability of each patient before and after quetiapine treatment was measured by use of mental health services other than antipsychotic drug, measured primarily by charges reported on claims. Regression models controlling for patient differences measured associations between initial quetiapine dose and subsequent mental health service use. ResultsCommercially insured patients with schizophrenia (n[*]=[*] 581) or bipolar disorder (n[*]=[*] 2421) received quetiapine monotherapy at mean (SD) initial daily doses of 237 (198) [*]mg and 147 (171) [*]mg, respectively.
