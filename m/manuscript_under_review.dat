40|$|The {{systematics}} and {{taxonomy of}} tree frogs {{of the family}} Hylidae has undergone turbulent changes both at higher (subfamilies, genera) and lower (species) level during the last decades. The original approach used morphological characters to distinguish tree frogs. It has been completed by bioacoustics, since the advertisement calls of the males were in some cases found to represent an important behavioural reproductive barrier and therefore useful for systematic evaluations. However, a completely new impulse was given to systematics {{by the introduction of}} modern genetic methods. These methods have allowed to distinguish not only morphologically but even acoustically cryptic taxa. The most reliable method to distinguish tree frogs at present is a combination of data from the different disciplines. The present dissertation thesis aims to evaluate the systematics of tree frogs of the genus Hyla from Eastern Europe and the Middle East as well as the systematics of the Amazonian genus Osteocephalus using a combination of morphological, bioacoustic and molecular approaches.

40|$|My Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} {{research}} of the crayfish plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci (Oomycetes). Crayfish plague decimates whole populations of European crayfish; therefore, {{it is one of}} the main problems for conservation of these species endangered from other reasons as well. The infection is transmitted by invasive North American crayfish, which are much less susceptible to the disease and are apparently original hosts of A. astaci. The core of this thesis consists of six studies. Four of them have been already published, the remaining two are <b>manuscripts</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> The main linking motive among the presented studies is not only the crayfish plague pathogen itself, but also the use, development and verification of the reliability of molecular detection methods of A. astaci and its genotypes.

40|$|In {{healthcare}} applications, temporal {{variables that}} encode movement, health status and longitudinal patient evolution are {{often accompanied by}} rich structured information such as demographics, diagnostics and medical exam data. However, current methods do not jointly optimize over structured covariates and time series in the feature extraction process. We present ShortFuse, a method that boosts the accuracy of deep learning models for time series by explicitly modeling temporal interactions and dependencies with structured covariates. ShortFuse introduces hybrid convolutional and LSTM cells that incorporate the covariates via weights that are shared across the temporal domain. ShortFuse outperforms competing models by 3 % on two biomedical applications, forecasting osteoarthritis-related cartilage degeneration and predicting surgical outcomes for cerebral palsy patients, matching or exceeding the accuracy of models that use features engineered by domain experts.

Resident physicians and medical students (n = 69) and undergraduates (n = 99) ranked 9 different flu shots and a no-flu-shot option in 1 of 4 combinations of perspective (individual patient vs. group of 1000 patients) and uncertainty frame (probability vs. frequency). The rank of the no-flu-shot option (a measure of preference for treatment vs. no treatment) was not significantly related to perspective or participant population.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of estimating quantiles when data are received sequentially (data stream). For real life data streams, {{the distribution of the}} data typically varies with time making estimation of quantiles challenging. We present a method that simultaneously maintain estimates of multiple quantiles of the data stream distribution. The method is based on making incremental updates of the quantile estimates every time a new sample from the data stream is received. The method is memory and computationally efficient since it only stores one value for each quantile estimate and only performs one operation per quantile estimate when a new sample is received from the data stream. The estimates are realistic {{in the sense that the}} monotone property of quantiles is satisfied in every iteration. Experiments show that the method efficiently tracks multiple quantiles and outperforms state of the art methods.

40|$|Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods rely on {{asymptotic}} arguments, {{implying that}} parameter inference can be systematically biased even when sufficient statistics are available. We propose {{to construct the}} ABC accept/reject step from decision theoretic arguments on a suitable auxiliary space. This framework, referred to as ABC*, fully specifies which test statistics to use, how to combine them, how to set the tolerances and how long to simulate {{in order to obtain}} accuracy properties on the auxiliary space. Akin to maximum-likelihood indirect inference, regularity conditions establish when the ABC* approximation to the posterior density is accurate on the original parameter space in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the maximum a posteriori point estimate. Fundamentally, escaping asymptotic arguments requires knowledge of the distribution of test statistics, which we obtain through modelling the distribution of summary values, data points on a summary level. Synthetic examples and an application to time series data of influenza A (H 3 N 2) infections in the Netherlands illustrate ABC* in action.

30|$|Most {{synthetic}} ligands with anti-progestin {{properties are}} toxic and cross-react with other steroid receptors, preventing their long-term use (Horwitz 1992). In contrast, {{the majority of}} naturally occurring compounds are non-toxic. We therefore undertook studies to identify natural compounds with anti-progestin-like activities that {{might be used to}} counter the pro-tumor effects of progestins. Luteolin (LU), a flavonoid that is found in more than 300 plant species (many of which are readily available in the human diet), has recently been shown to inhibit a variety of cancers, both in vitro and in vivo, with little to minimal toxicity (Seelinger et al. 2008). Previously we have shown that LU prevents and delays medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-dependent tumor development in the 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(A)anthracene-induced tumor model, and we proposed that LU possesses long-lasting anti-cancer effects (<b>manuscript</b> <b>under</b> <b>review).</b> In the present study, we conducted studies in a xenograft model to determine whether LU might also be used to treat progestin-dependent breast cancer (Liang et al. 2007).

Isotopic ratios and concentrations of the alkaline earth metals Mg and Sr in biogenic calcite are of great importance as proxies for environmental parameters. In particular, the Mg/Ca ratio as a temperature proxy has had considerable success. It is often hard to constrain, however, which parameter ultimately controls the concentration of these elements in calcite. Here, multiple Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca transects through a belemnite rostrum of Passaloteuthis bisulcata (Blainville, 1827) are used to isolate the effect of calcite precipitation rate on incorporation of Mg and Sr into the calcite. With increasing calcite precipitation rate Mg/Ca ratios decrease and Sr/Ca ratios in the rostrum increase.

40|$|Fluidic {{maldistribution}} in microscale multichannel devices requires {{deep understanding}} to achieve optimized flow and heat transfer characteristics. A thorough computational {{study has been}} performed to understand the concentration and thermohydraulic maldistribution of nanofluids in parallel microchannel systems using an Eulerian Lagrangian twin phase model. The study reveals that nanofluids cannot be treated as homogeneous single phase fluids in such complex flow domains and effective property models fail drastically to predict the performance parameters. To comprehend {{the distribution of the}} particulate phase, a novel concentration maldistribution factor has been proposed. It has been observed that distribution of particles need not essentially follow the flow pattern, leading to higher thermal performance than expected from homogeneous models. Particle maldistribution has been conclusively shown to be due to various migration and diffusive phenomena like Stokesian drag, Brownian motion, thermophoretic drift, etc. The implications of particle distribution on the cooling performance have been illustrated and smart fluid effects (reduced magnitude of maximum temperature) have been observed and a mathematical model to predict the enhanced cooling performance in such flow geometries has been proposed. The article presents lucidly the effectiveness of discrete phase approach in modelling nanofluid thermohydraulics and sheds insight on behavior of nanofluids in complex flow domains.

40|$|Wave {{motion in}} a {{continuous}} elastic rod with a periodically attached inertial-amplification mechanism is investigated. The mechanism has properties similar to an "inerter" typically used in vehicle suspensions, however here it is constructed and utilized {{in a manner that}} alters the intrinsic properties of a continuous structure. The elastodynamic band structure of the hybrid rod-mechanism structure yields band gaps that are exceedingly wide and deep when compared to what can be obtained using standard local resonators, while still being low in frequency. With this concept, a large band gap may be realized with as much as twenty times less added mass compared to what is needed in a standard local resonator configuration. The emerging inertially enhanced continuous structure also exhibits unique qualitative features in its dispersion curves. These include the existence of a characteristic double-peak in the attenuation constant profile within gaps and the possibility of coalescence of two neighbouring gaps creating a large contiguous gap.

40|$|Responsive teaching, {{in which}} {{teachers}} adapt instruction based on {{close attention to}} the substance of students' ideas, is typically characterized along two dimensions: the level of detail at which teachers attend and respond to students' ideas, and the stance teachers take toward what they hear - evaluating for correctness vs. interpreting meaning. We propose that characterizations of progress in responsive teaching should also consider the disciplinary centrality of the practices teachers notice and respond to within student thinking. To illustrate what this kind of progress can look like, we present a case study of a middle school science teacher who implemented the "same" lesson on the motion of freely falling objects in two subsequent years. We argue that his primary shift in responsiveness stemmed from a shift in which disciplinary practices he preferentially noticed and foregrounded. He moved from a focus on causal factors or variables to a more scientifically productive focus on causal stories or explanations. We explore how participation in a professional development community, institutional constraints, and a shift in personal epistemology {{may have contributed to the}} nature and stability of this shift in responsiveness.
