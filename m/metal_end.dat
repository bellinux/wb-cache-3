The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E

2500|$|The larger baton-style prods {{are similar}} in basic design to an {{electric}} cattle prod. [...] It has a <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> split into two parts electrically insulated from each other, or two thin projecting metal electrodes about [...] apart, at an end of a shaft containing the batteries and mechanism. At {{the other end of}} the shaft are a handle and a switch. Both electrodes must touch the subject. In some types the sides of the baton can be electrified to stop the subject from grasping the baton above the electrodes.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the various}} {{additive}} processes matured, {{it became clear}} that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer. [...] The 2010s were the first decade in which <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> use parts such as engine brackets and large nuts would be grown (either before or instead of machining) in job production rather than [...] being machined from bar stock or plate. [...] It is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are more prevalent than AM in metalworking, but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads, and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing, it is clear to engineers that much more is to come.|$|E

25|$|Which {{elements}} {{start to}} be counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end. In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined transition elements as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum), therefore excluding group 11 (copper, silver and gold), and group 12 (zinc, cadmium and mercury). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed that the transition <b>metals</b> <b>ended</b> at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency. Where the post-transition <b>metals</b> <b>end</b> depends on where the metalloids or nonmetals start. Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium are commonly recognised as metalloids; other authors treat {{some or all of}} these elements as nonmetals.|$|R

40|$|Heavy metals can be {{toxic to}} humans. They {{need to be}} {{monitored}} to ensure environmental levels do not go above dangerous levels. The European Commission has set acceptable maximum levels of metals allowed in food since most <b>metals</b> <b>end</b> up in humans through their diet. But how do metals {{find their way into}} our food in the first place? Heavy metals can enter the environment in a number of ways, including through volcanism, fossil fuel burning, and antifouling paint use. The heavy metals bind with biomolecules inside living tissue, and can build up to dangerous levels. One prime example of how such <b>metals</b> <b>end</b> up in the food we eat {{can be seen in the}} case of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris). The octopus is susceptible to accumulating high levels of heavy metals due to its high ingestion rate of benthic fauna. N/...|$|R

A common problem with spark plug wires is corrosion of the <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> terminals. Better-quality spark plug wires usually have brass terminals, which are more resistant to corrosion than other metals used.|$|E

50|$|Madhouse was {{the first}} Argentine heavy metal {{magazine}} to arrange interviews with international bands, instead of translating such interviews taken from international magazines.

50|$|D-type (Diazed) fuse {{cartridges}} have a bottle-shaped {{ceramic body}} with <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> caps and are fitted in screw-in fuse holders. They {{are available in}} five different body sizes, with ratings from 2 A up to 200 A (see table). The designation of a size consists of the letter D and a Roman numeral. Higher-voltage types rated up to 750 V have increased clearance distances and are longer than lower-voltage-rated fuses.|$|E

50|$|Lastly, an {{interesting}} feature inside the temple {{are the very}} squeaky boards, {{an example of a}} nightingale floor. The wooden boards were built with <b>metal</b> <b>ends</b> that would rub against the metal joints they were attached to, created a piercing noise as people step on them. This was intentionally done so that when the Tokugawa family stayed at the temple, they could detect unwanted intruders at night.|$|R

50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> connections, or couplings, are {{attached}} to the hose. The outer portion of each coupling is slipped over the outer jacket and an inner ring is inserted into the rubber liner. A tool called an expansion mandrel is placed inside the hose and expands the ring.

5000|$|An inline {{fuel filter}} is easily {{accessible}} {{from the front}} part of the engine. The filter retains solid particles and separates water from diesel (as water is heavier than diesel, it will settle {{at the bottom of}} the filter), just before the diesel fuel enters the highly sensitive high-pressure fuel pump. Water inside diesel fuel can lead to rusting of the internals of the engine, as well as lubrication problems. The filter element is made of fluted paper with <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> caps.|$|E
50|$|A zester (also, citrus zester or lemon zester) is {{a kitchen}} utensil for obtaining zest from lemons and other citrus fruit. A kitchen zester is {{approximately}} four inches long, with a handle and a curved <b>metal</b> <b>end,</b> {{the top of}} which is perforated with a row of round holes with sharpened rims. To operate, the zester is pressed with moderate force against the fruit and drawn across its peel. The rims cut the zest from the pith underneath. The zest is cut into ribbons, one drawn through each hole.|$|E

50|$|The blade is {{removable}} and is {{secured by}} means of a wooden peg called mekugi that passes through a hole (mekugi-ana) in both the tang and the shaft.The shaft ranges from 120 cm to 240 cm in length and is oval shaped. The area of the shaft where the tang sits is the tachiuchi or tachiuke. The tachiuchi/tachiuke would be reinforced with metal rings (naginata dogane or semegane), and/or metal sleeves (sakawa) and wrapped with cord (san-dan maki). The end of the shaft has a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>end</b> cap (ishizuki or hirumaki). When not in use the blade would be covered with a wooden sheath.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes wood {{splitting}} is undesirable. Methods to prevent splitting in woodworking are the butterfly joint, truss connector plates, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed {{in the center}} to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or pilot holes drilled to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or screwing. End grain sealers are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits. <b>Metal</b> <b>end</b> plates or S-shaped pieces of metal may be driven into the butt ends of a timber. Splitting is the primary reason building codes do not allow notching {{in the bottom of}} joists and beams.|$|E
