40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} instruction formats {{were examined}} respecting their usefulness for the navigation through hierarchical menus in mobile phones. 56 middle-aged adults had to solve four mobile phone tasks twice consecutively. Before completing the first trial, they {{were supported by}} instruction formats which contained different spatial knowledge types [28]. The first form was a procedural step-by-step instruction delivering landmark and route knowledge. The second instruction consisted of a visualized <b>menu</b> <b>tree,</b> in which the menu path to be taken was marked. By this, mainly survey knowledge but also route information was provided. The third instruction format also used the visualized <b>menu</b> <b>tree.</b> However, {{in addition to the}} menu path which had to be taken, also functions ’ labels were given, conveying landmark, route and survey knowledge. Further, a condition was examined in which no help was given. Dependent variables were navigation effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the step-by-step condition, the instruction type most often used in technical leaflets, had the smallest effect, especially for users with low spatial visualization abilities. With instruction forms which use diagrammatic visualizations and provide survey knowledge, navigation performance considerably improved...|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{interactive}} voice response (IVR) based telephone routing has long been recognized as a frustrating interaction experience. This paper presents a series of experiments examining the benefits of augmenting telephone voice menus with coordinated visual displays and keyword search. The first experiment qualitatively studied callers ’ experience of having a visual menu on a screen in synchronization with the telephone voice <b>menu</b> <b>tree</b> navigation. The second experiment quantitatively measured callers ’ performance in time and accuracy with and without visual display augmentation. The third experiment tested keyword search in comparison to visual browsing of telephone menu trees. Study participants uniformly and enthusiastically liked the visual augmentation of voice menus. On average with visual augmentation callers could navigate phone trees 36 % faster with 75 % fewer errors, and made choices ahead of the voice menu over 60 % of the time. Search vs. browsing had similar navigation performance but offered different and complementary user experiences. Overall our studies conclude that telephone voice menu navigation can be significantly improved with a visual channel augmentation, resulting in both business cost reduction and user experience satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a system {{we have developed}} for improving navigation in touch-tone applications by personalizing the menu interface. Telephony applications rely heavily on hierarchically structured menus (or prompts) for creating a dialog between the user and the information being retrieved. The highly hierarchical structure to the method of retrieving information in touch-tone interfaces reduces the efficiency of navigating the various menu layers. The system we describe in this paper allows users to bookmark any given node in the menu-based system. Bookmarks provide a method for bypassing the entire hierarchy structure to access only that node {{of interest in the}} <b>menu</b> <b>tree.</b> By means of our approach, users can access personalized information more efficiently and without spending time listening to prompts before making decisions. Participants of a user evaluation expressed highly positive attitudes toward the touch-tone interface we implemented as it enables them to rapidly access nodes of interest, particularly items that are frequently retrieved.

40|$|Because {{of network}} externalities, {{the success of}} a {{software}} product may depend in part on stalled base and its conformance to industry standards. This research builds a hedonic model {{to determine the effects of}} network externalities, standards, intrinsic features and a time trend on microcomputer spreadsheet software prices. When data for a sample of products during the 1987 [...] 1992 time period were analyzed using this model, four main results emerged: 1) Network externalities, as measured by the size of a product's installed base, significantly increased the price of spreadsheet products: a one percent increase in a product's installed base was associated with a 0. 75 % increase in its price. 2) Products which adhered to the dominant standard, the Lotus <b>menu</b> <b>tree</b> interface, commanded prices which were higher by an average of 46 %. 3) Although nominal prices increased slightly during this time period, quality-adjusted prices declined by an average of 16 % per year. 4) The hedonic model was found to be a good predictor of actual market prices, despite the fact that it was originally estimated using list prices. Several variations of the model were examined, and, while the qualitative findings were robust, the precise estimates of the coefficients varied somewhat depending on the sample of products examined, the weighting of the observations and the functional form used in estimation, suggesting that the use of hedonic methods in this domain is subject to a number of limitations due, inter alia, to the potential for strategic pricing by vendors. network externalities, standards, pricing, software, hedonic regression, information technology...|$|E
40|$|As an {{economic}} good, software {{has a number}} of interesting properties. In addition to the value of intrinsic features, the creation of or conformance to industry standards may be {{critical to the success of}} a product. This research builds and evaluates econometric models to determine which product features are important in the purchase and pricing decisions for microcomputer software. A special emphasis is to identify the effects of standards and network externalities. Four main results were found for the microcomputer spreadsheet market for the time period 1987 - 1992. Hedonic regression techniques can provide sensible estimates of the value users place on intrinsic features such as the ability to sort the data or to embed charts. Network externalities measurably influence the value of products. Each one percent increase in a product's installed base enables the product to command an additional $ 3. 94 in price. Purchasers place significant value on adherence to standards. Products compatible with the Lotus <b>menu</b> <b>tree</b> interface earned a premium of approximately 305 of the average price in the sample. Shifts in technology platforms substantially change vendor premiums. Products manufactured by Lotus Development Corporation commanded a premium of $ 272 on the DOS platform, but only $ 65 on non-DOS platforms. The results of this research and the general model proposed can be used to estimate the relative values of software package features, adherence to standards, and increased market share. It also quantifies the opportunities created by changes in technology architecture. Finally, the results offer guidance into current public policy issues such as the value of intellectual property embodied in software. ...|$|E

Yet Another Menu Manager, YAMM, is an application independent menuing package, designed to remove much of the difficulty and save much of the time inherent in the implementation of the front ends for large packages. Written in C for UNIX-based operating systems, YAMM provides a complete menuing front end {{for a wide variety of}} applications, with provisions for terminal independence, user-specific configurations, and dynamic creation of menu trees. Applications running under the menu package consists of two parts: a description of the menu configuration and the body of application code. The menu configuration is used at runtime to define the menu structure and any non-standard keyboard mappings and terminal capabilities. Menu definitions define specific menus within the <b>menu</b> <b>tree.</b> The names used in a definition may be either a reference to an application function or the name of another menu defined within the menu configuration. Application parameters are entered using data entry screens which allow for required and optional parameters, tables, and legal-value lists. Both automatic and application-specific error checking are available. Help is available for both menu operation and specific applications. The YAMM program was written in C for execution on a Sun Microsystems workstation running SunOS, based on the Berkeley (4. 2 bsd) version of UNIX. During development, YAMM has been used on both 68020 and SPARC architectures, running SunOS versions 3. 5 and 4. 0. YAMM should be portable to most other UNIX-based systems. It has a central memory requirement of approximately 232 K bytes. The standard distribution medium for this program is one. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format.

40|$|Menu {{systems have}} been key {{components}} in modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs), {{and there has been}} a lot of research about menu design. Review of previous menu design studies for human-computer interaction suggests that menu design guidelines for computers and mobile phones need to be reappraised, especially with regard to the use of 3 D interfaces in cell phones. ^ The main objective of this dissertation is to propose an overall framework for 3 D menu interfaces in cell phones. The second objective is to propose guidelines for 3 D menu design in cell phones. Four main factors that influence the performance of menu retrieval tasks in cell phones are included in the proposed model: presentation type, number of items, task complexity, and menu type. For these purposes, three experiments were conducted to determine which of three types of 3 D menus is best, which of two types of 2 D menu is better than the other, and conditions under which the best 3 D menu is better than a 2 D menu. ^ Experiment 1 used a nested factorial design with an iPhone simulator to investigate which of three 3 D <b>menus</b> (collapsible cylindrical <b>trees,</b> carousel, or revolving stage) are most applicable for small displays. Performance was best with the revolving stage menu, and there was a non-significant tendency for it to be rated as preferred by the participants. ^ In Experiment 2, an iPhone was used to determine which of two types of 2 D menu is better and a nested factorial design was used as well. Even though the differences were not significant, an overview menu tended to show better performance and preference scores than a text menu that required scrolling. The overview menu was chosen for Experiment 3 as the control alternative for comparison with the 3 D menu because it provides alphabetical icons as 3 D menus do. ^ Lastly, Experiment 3 used a nested factorial design with an iPhone to investigate when the revolving stage menu is better than the overview menu. The 3 D menu was preferred by users at high breadth levels, and the 2 D menu showed better performance than the 3 D menu with low task complexity. ^ From the experimental outcomes, a theoretically based link among the four components of cell phone menu design was identified. Furthermore, theoretically and practically based guidelines for the design of menus for small displays were developed. ...|$|R
