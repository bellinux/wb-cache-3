2500|$|Cathay Pacific Flight 780 {{took off}} from runway 28 at Surabaya's Juanda International Airport at 08:24 local time (01:24 UTC). During the climb, both engines had small engine {{pressure}} ratio (EPR, {{a measure of the}} amount of thrust output) fluctuations, with No. 2 engine fluctuating over a greater range than No. 1 engine. Just over half-an-hour after takeoff, when the aircraft was at its cruising altitude of Flight level (FL) 390 (about [...] above sea level), the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) system displayed an [...] "ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT" [...] message. The crew contacted the airline engineering department's <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Control</b> (MC) and discussed the fluctuations. As other engine operating parameters on both engines were normal the flight crew and MC decided it was safe for the flight to continue.|$|E
