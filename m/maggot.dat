5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. <b>Maggot</b> debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E

5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. <b>Maggot</b> species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include <b>maggot</b> therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E

40|$|Controlled Production and Use of <b>Maggots.</b> Two {{tests have}} been {{undertaken}} in Maroua (North Cameroon), {{in the months}} of february and may 1998, {{in order to provide}} data concerning the production and use of <b>maggots</b> for poultry nutrition in traditional farm, this beyond the scope of mini-livestock. Both test have been carried out under shelter, with 7 plots each containing 2 kg of fresh rumen contents as substrate, packed in black plastic bag as container. The results showed that <b>maggots</b> are preferential food for poultry compared with cereals. <b>Maggots</b> from third to the fifth day are more interesting because of their size, their consistency and their weight. Temperature seems to have an influence on the <b>maggots</b> growth. In the same way, the substrate nature and its container size {{have an effect on the}} quantitative and qualitative production of <b>maggots.</b> The type of housefly preferred (Tvlusca domesticaj also has an effect on the quantitative production of <b>maggots.</b> Controlled production and use of <b>maggots</b> seems to be interesting in poultry farming and mini-livestock in tropical area.

2500|$|Casu marzu is {{considered}} by Sardinian aficionados to be unsafe to eat when the <b>maggots</b> in the cheese have died. Because of this, only cheese in which the <b>maggots</b> are still alive is usually eaten, although allowances are made for cheese that has been refrigerated, which can kill the <b>maggots.</b> When the cheese has fermented enough, it is often {{cut into thin strips}} and spread on moistened Sardinian flatbread (pane carasau), to be served with a strong red wine. Casu marzu is believed to be an aphrodisiac by Sardinians. Because the larvae in the cheese can launch themselves for distances up to [...] when disturbed, diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the <b>maggots</b> from leaping.

In this treatment, Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and Farmer <b>Maggot,</b> Glorfindel, Radagast, Elladan and Elrohir are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazg√ªl just make it into Mount Doom before they fall. They presented their treatment to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75million.|$|E
5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a <b>maggot</b> grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>maggot</b> {{therapy is}} not limited to humans, {{but it is not a}} common {{practice}} with livestock. Using <b>maggot</b> therapy with livestock could be beneficial in many ways. In dairy cattle, it would eliminate the need to destroy milk contaminated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics on horses can affect its gastrointestinal flora which may result in colitis. <b>Maggot</b> therapy would eliminate this additional stress when treating equine wounds. Treatment options for the animals of people who cannot afford expensive surgeries would be a new possibility for veterinarians using this therapy.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: Debridement {{therapy with}} sterile bred larvae in non-healing wounds {{is a widely}} {{accepted}} safe and efficient treatment modality. However, during application in the contaminated wound bed microbial contamination with potential microbial pathogen spread after escape from the wound or after unreliable disposal procedure may happen, {{particularly in the case}} of not using bio-bags. The aims of this work were first to investigate the release of ingested bacteria into the environment by <b>maggots</b> and second to examine the common practice of freezing the <b>maggots</b> after use and/or disposal in trash-bags. Potential methods for hygienic safe disposal of used <b>maggots</b> should be deduced. Methods: First, <b>Maggots</b> were contaminated with by allowing them to crawl over an agar surface completely covered with bacterial growth over 24 h at 37 ¬∞C. After external disinfection <b>maggots</b> were transferred onto sterile Columbia agar plates and shedding of was visualized. Second, <b>maggots</b> were frozen at ‚Äì 20 ¬∞C for 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min. After exposure, the larvae were transferred onto Columbia blood agar with consecutive incubation at 37 ¬∞C over 48 h. The larvae were analyzed visually for mobility and eating activities. The frozen bodies of dead larvae were examined for viable bacteria. Results: We could demonstrate that <b>maggots</b> release formerly ingested pathogens (). Freezing at ‚Äì 20 ¬∞C for at least 60 min was able to kill all <b>maggots,</b> however the contaminant bacteria inside could survive. Conclusion: Since freezing is apparently able to kill <b>maggots</b> but not to reliabely inactivate the ingested bacterial pathogens, we recommend the disposal of free-range larvae in screw cap vials after use to achieve full hygienic control...|$|R

25|$|<b>Maggot</b> {{debridement}} therapy (MDT) is {{the medical}} use of selected, laboratory-raised fly larvae for cleaning nonhealing wounds. Medicinal maggots perform debridement by selectively eating only dead tissue. Lucilia sericata (Phaenicia sericata), or the common green bottlefly, {{is the preferred}} species used in <b>maggot</b> therapy. Myiasis (<b>maggot</b> infestation) by non-medicinal maggots is not always therapeutic - {{in addition to the}} possibility of introducing microbes, some species of maggots eat healthy tissue as well, such as screwworms. MDT can be used to treat pressure ulcers, diabetic foot wounds, venous stasis ulcers, and postsurgical wounds.|$|E
25|$|Phormia regina is a flesh-eating fly {{not usually}} used for medical gain. However, the maggots {{from the black}} blow fly are used in a medical {{practice}} called <b>maggot</b> therapy. <b>Maggot</b> therapy {{is a type of}} biotherapy involving the intentional introduction by a health care practitioner of live, disinfected maggots into the skin and soft tissue wound of a human or animal for the purpose of selectively cleaning out only the necrotic tissue within a wound to promote wound healing. <b>Maggot</b> therapy dates back to the Mayan empire, but there are no actual records of use until the early 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Nicrophorus beetles often {{carry on}} their bodies the mite Poecilochirus which feed on fly eggs. If they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and <b>maggot</b> {{development}} is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates. Nicrophorus beetles find the ammonia excretions of blowfly maggots toxic, and the Poecilochirus mites, by keeping the <b>maggot</b> population low, allow Nicrophorus to occupy the corpse.|$|E
2500|$|Redi {{continued}} his experiments by capturing the <b>maggots</b> {{and waiting for}} them to metamorphose, which they did, becoming flies. [...] Also, when dead flies or <b>maggots</b> were put in sealed jars with dead animals or veal, no <b>maggots</b> appeared, but when the same thing was done with living flies, <b>maggots</b> did. Knowing full well the fates of outspoken thinkers such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei, Redi was careful to express his new views in a manner that would not contradict theological tradition of the Church; hence, his interpretations were always based on biblical passages, such as his famous adage: omne vivum ex vivo [...] ("All life comes from life").|$|R
5000|$|<b>Maggots</b> (larvae of Rhagoletis completa and Rhagoletis suavis) in the husk are common, {{though more}} a {{nuisance}} than {{a serious problem}} for amateurs, who may simply remove the affected husk as soon as infestation is noticed.

25|$|Myiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or necrotic tissue {{in a living}} host by fly larvae. Some flies may just lay their eggs in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of myiasis but is not a fly that is regularly found. Myiasis is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. Myiasis is different from <b>maggot</b> therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on necrotic tissue in order to clean up a wound and aid healing. <b>Maggot</b> therapy can clean up a wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of black}} blow fly maggots in <b>maggot</b> therapy is common. After the maggots have hatched, they are {{carefully}} monitored {{until they reach}} roughly 2 to 3mm in length; at this point they {{are ready for the}} next step. Within 24 to 36 hours of hatching, the maggots are tested for their sterility; if they pass the rigorous tests, then they may be used in <b>maggot</b> therapy. These maggots are placed onto a sterile piece of gauze which is laid over the wound of the patient. The maggots will proceed through the gauze to the open wound, where they will then begin their work. When they are full-grown, they leave the wound and enter the gauze for the purpose of pupating. They are then removed with the waste gauze and disposed of properly.|$|E

50|$|After {{several days}} of {{following}} the river, several of her wounds became infected, {{one of the larger}} ones becoming infested with <b>maggots.</b> Having seen her dog become infested with <b>maggots</b> once before, she attempted to remove the <b>maggots</b> by squeezing her wound, as well as removing them with a stick. Both attempts failed. On the tenth day of her ordeal she finally came across a boat, which at first she thought was a mirage. She managed to crawl up a path next to the boat, and she came across a small hut that was being used by lumbermen. Although the hut was empty at the time, she found an outboard motor and some diesel fuel in a barrel. She used a tube she found to suck out some of the fuel from the barrel and she attempted to remove the <b>maggots</b> by applying the diesel fuel on her wound, a method she learned from her father when attempting to remove the <b>maggots</b> from the family dog.
