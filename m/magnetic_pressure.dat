40|$|Summary. How does {{turbulence}} {{contribute to}} the formation {{and structure of the}} dense interstellar medium (ISM) ? Molecular clouds are dense, high-pressure objects. It is usually argued that gravitational confinement causes the high pressures, and that the clouds are (magneto) hydrostatic objects supported by a balance between <b>magnetic</b> and turbulent <b>pressures</b> and gravity. However, <b>magnetic</b> <b>pressures</b> appear too weak, and MHD turbulent support not only requires driving, but also results in continuing gravitational collapse, as has now been demonstrated in simulations reaching 512 3 zones. Models of supernova-driven, magnetized turbulence readily form transient, high-pressure, dense regions that may form molecular clouds. They are contained not by self-gravity, but by turbulent ram pressures from the larger flow. Apparent virialization may actually be a geometrical effect. Turbulent clouds are unlikely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead either collapsing or expanding, although they may appear well-fit by projected equilibrium Bonnor-Ebert spheres. Collapsing clouds probably form stars efficiently, while expanding ones can still form stars by turbulent compression, but rather inefficiently. ...|$|R
