So {{it is important to}} learn the effect of stress on some magnetic parameters. A measuring system to measure magnetic permeability and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> and a device to load uniaxial tension and pressure stress were developed. The result shows that magnetic permeability and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> increase with uniaxial tension stress increase and decreases with uniaxial pressure stress increase. It is also concluded that the relative change of magnetic permeability and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> decrease with increase of the included angle between the directions of the stress and magnetic field. These results suggest that magnetic permeability and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> can be further used to evaluate the stress in low-carbon steel...|$|E

In order to induce a reduction of electrical energy consumption, governments across the world have pressured the appliance makers to increase in energy efficiency of electric engines. One of the ways to improve the performance of electric engines is to use steels with lower <b>magnetic</b> <b>losses.</b> The typical electrical steels are steels with about 3. 5 wt. % Si.

The {{amounts of the}} magnetic transition metals and early transition metal growth inhibitors were systematically varied to determine trade-offs between higher inductions and fine microstructures with consequently lower <b>magnetic</b> <b>losses.</b> Alloys of nominal composition (Fe 65 Co 35) 79. 5 +xNb 4 −xB 13 Si 2 Cu 1. 5 (x= 0 – 4) were cast into a 28 mm wide, 20  μm thick ribbon from which toroidal cores were wound.

30|$|In this work, {{the high}} ε′ and ε″ values should be {{ascribed}} to the good conductivity of CoFe@C composites. According to Cao’s electron-hopping model, the well-conductivity CoFe@C allows electrons to migrate and hop, and thus can greatly consume the electromagnetic energy, leading to enhanced dielectric loss [48 – 51]. Moreover, two peaks at f[*]=[*]~[*] 5.2 and ~[*] 11.1  GHz (Additional file  1 : Figure S 2) from the Cole-Cole plots indicate the existence of dual relaxation behaviors in CoFe@C samples. These relaxations are probably derived from the surface functions, defects, and interfacial polarizations in CoFe@C composites. In addition, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> also contributes to the electromagnetic wave attenuation of CoFe@C composites. Eddy current effects, natural resonance, and exchange resonance are three key wave loss sources in the microwave region. As shown in Additional file  1 : Figure S 3, the μ″(μ′)− 2 f−[*] 1 for CoFe@C is not a constant value, suggesting eddy current is not the dominating <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> mechanism. Instead, two peaks at ~[*] 3 and 12.5  GHz can be found and are indexed to natural resonance and exchange resonance. We also calculated the dielectric loss tangents (tan δE[*]=[*]ε″/ε′) and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> tangents (tan δM[*]=[*]μ″/μ′) of CoFe@C and CoFe 2 O 4, in which the maximum values of tan δE and tan δM are 0.706 and 1.370, respectively (Additional file  1 : Figure S 4). The relatively high values of tan δE and tan δM further reveal that CoFe@C possesses intense dielectric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

As shown in Fig.  10 b, {{it can be seen}} that the real part (μ′) almost is a constant in whole range, and the values of μ′ are floating around 1 and the floating modest. The imaginary part (μ″) in whole range of 2 – 12  GHz shows the obvious fluctuation and the values are fluctuating between 1.03 and 0.01. In Fig.  10 d, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> tangent also shows the similar trend. Generally, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> of magnetic materials is originated from hysteresis loss, domain-wall resonance, eddy current effect, and natural resonance [47]. The hysteresis loss of strontium ferrite in R-GO/SF/PANI- 2 nanocomposite can be ignored in the frequency range of 2 – 18  GHz, the domain-wall resonance of strontium ferrite usually occurs in lower frequency than the GHz range [48, 49]. Therefore, Eddy current effect and natural resonance are the main <b>magnetic</b> <b>loss</b> of R-GO/SF/PANI- 2 nanocomposite.|$|E

It combines {{the flexibility of the}} FEM with the efficiency of the FDTD scheme. The electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>losses</b> are treated by the FEM on an unstructured mesh, which allows for local mesh refinement in order to resolve rapid variations in the material parameters and/or the electromagnetic field. The hybrid method is based directly on Ampère's and Faraday's law and it is stable up to the Courant stability limit of the FDTD method. The hybrid method shows second order convergence for smooth scatterers. The bistatic radar cross section (RCS) for a circular metal cylinder with a lossy coating converges to the analytical solution and an accuracy of 2 % is achieved for about 20 points per wavelength. The monostatic RCS for an airfoil that features sharp corners yields a lower order of convergence and it is found to agree well with what can be expected for singular fields at the sharp corners. A careful convergence study with resolutions from 20 to 140 points per wavelength provides accurate extrapolated results for this non-trivial test case, which makes it possible to use as a reference problem for scattering codes that model both electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R
