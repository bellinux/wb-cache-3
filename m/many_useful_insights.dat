We derive a closed-form expression for the transmitted sum power required by the MEB strategy and prove that this strategy is asymptotically optimal. The simple closed-form expression for the MEB sum-power provides <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> <b>insights</b> into the asymptotic behavior of multi-user MIMO systems.

The aim {{of the study is}} to ascertain whether the use of 'Exploratory Talk' can be promoted within the groups. The frequency of the use of 'key words' is taken as a measure of how effective the level of discussion was and therefore whether or not learning has taken place. Was there a development of shared understanding? To support the reliability of my results a triangulation of methods was used. Target discussions were recorded before and after the groups had received detailed input on rules and guidelines that improve discussion work. The audio tapes were then transcribed {{and with the help of}} a field diary, context notes were added. To complete the triangulation an in depth review of the current literature was carried out and applied to the project. The results indicated that the intellectual rigour of discussion can be substantially improved by giving pupils insights into how to discuss. The project provided <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> and informative <b>insights.</b> It was felt that schools have failed to fully exploit the cognitive power of classroom talk.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 This {{dissertation}} describes theories, develops {{ideas and}} examines evidence relating to how strategy implementation is managed in business firms. The relationship between an organization's strategic process orientation, its strategy implementation governance mechanisms, and its performance provide {{the central focus}} of my research. A contingency framework is developed which yields hypotheses predicting performance depending on the fit between the strategic process of the organization and the tools the organization uses to manage the implementation of its strategies. Cross-sectional survey methodology is used to gather data on a sample of organizations. The survey assesses the strategic process orientation of each organization, the strategy implementation governance mechanisms used by each organization {{and the performance of}} each organization. The data are reduced using predicted item to construct loadings which are confirmed with factor analysis. Hypotheses testing and general data analysis are accomplished with moderated regression analysis. The evidence does not support the central hypotheses of this research that the predicted fit between an organization's strategic management process and its management methods is an important determinant of firm performance. However, <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> findings and <b>insights</b> into the management of strategies in organizations have emerged. The primary finding is that successful firms operate with a deliberate strategic process and employ interest aligning management methods.
