50|$|The first {{synthesis}} of 2-methylundecanal was recorded by Georges Darzens in 1904 from <b>methyl</b> <b>nonyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and ethyl chloroacetate. This method of synthesis {{can be used}} to produce a variety of aldehydes and became known as the Darzens reaction and is still used today. 2-Methylundecanal is synthesized in industry by two main routes. The first route, like Darzens, involves converting <b>methyl</b> <b>nonyl</b> <b>ketone</b> to its glycidate by allowing it to react with alkyl chloroacetate. The glycidate then undergoes saponification followed by decarboxylation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (H. cordata) is an {{anti-inflammatory}} {{herbal drug}} that is clinically used in Asia. The essential oil obtained from H. cordata {{is known to}} contain 2 -undecanone (2 -methyl <b>nonyl</b> <b>ketone).</b> In addition, sodium houttuyfonate {{is a compound that}} can be derived from H. cordata and has important clinical uses as an anti-inflammatory agent. Sodium houttuyfonate can be converted to decanoyl acetaldehyde (houttuynin) and then to 2 -undecanone. Therefore, the experiments described here explore the comparative anti-inflammatory activities of these compounds. Sodium houttuyfonate showed more potent anti-inflammatory activities than that of 2 -undecanone at the same dosage, both in vitro and in vivo, although both compounds significantly inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), but increased the secretion of interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells. In addition, both compounds showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on xylene-induced mouse ear edema. In a previous study, we found sodium houttuyfonate to be transformed to 2 -undecanone during steam distillation (SD).

Optimum therapeutic effects are related to the stability and pharmacological activity of the drugs. Consequently, we studied the stability of sodium houttuyfonate under a simulated gastrointestinal environment with the main influencing factors being solvent, temperature and pH effects. For the first time, sodium houttuyfonate and 2 -undecanone were detected simultaneously in the mouse serum and the gastrointestinal tissue after oral administration. Sodium houttuyfonate is detected within {{a short period of time}} in the systemic circulation and tissues without conversion to 2 -undecanone...|$|R

These polymers are suitable to study structure/property relationships as their cationic ROP and the relative facile monomer synthesis allow for control over the molecular structure. The number of carbon atoms in the linear side-chain is systematically varied from <b>methyl</b> to <b>nonyl.</b> Relations between chemical structures, thermal transitions, surface energies, and elastic moduli are discussed.

Anderson called Secretary Andrus a 2 ̆ 2 cuttlefish 2 ̆ 2 as the latter is as adept at squirting ink to hide his operations as is the marine squid. Anderson has documented some very questionable, Mafia-linked practices by Andrus when he was govenor of Idaho. Jack Anderson Andrus: Annoyed By Stories Of Past One of the immediate effects of Andrus selling out to the environmentalists has been the loss of a potentially effective tool incontroliing livestock depredation - - the 1080 toxic collar.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of polyaniline with alkylsulfonate dopants {{have been investigated}} at the atomic level using quantum mechanical methods. Calculations have been performed on complexes formed by dopant molecules with an alkyl group ranging from <b>methyl</b> to <b>nonyl</b> and model oligoanilines of different sizes. The stabilization provided by {{the formation of the}} alkylsulfonate···oligoaniline complexes (70 − 90 kcal/mol) is significantly higher than that found for conventional hydrogen bonds (5 − 12 kcal/mol) but lower than that obtained for methylsulfate···alkylammonium and methylsulfate···Na+ systems (120 − 135 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the influence of size of the alkyl group contained in the dopant on the interaction is practically negligible, whereas, in opposition, the number of aniline units used to represent polyaniline significantly affects the energetics of the interaction. Specifically, the interaction energy of an alkyl-dopant molecule and an infinite polyaniline chain has been predicted to be around − 65 kcal/mol. The overall results allow the conclusion that the interaction between alkylsulfonate dopants and polyaniline is a very local phenomenon. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{selected}} polyimide properties when pendant alkyl groups {{were attached to}} the polymer backbone was investigated. A series of polymers were prepared using benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (BTDA) and seven different p-alkyl-m,p'-diaminobenzophenone monomers. The alkyl groups varied in length from C(1) (<b>methyl)</b> to C(9) (<b>nonyl).</b> The polyimide prepared from BTDA and m,p'-diaminobenzophenone was included as a control. All polymers were characterized by various chromatographic, spectroscopic, thermal, and mechanical techniques. Increasing {{the length of the}} pendant alkyl group resulted in a systematic decrease in glass transition temperature (Tg) for vacuum cured films. A 70 C decrease in Tg to 193 C was observed for the nonyl polymer compared to the Tg for the control. A corresponding systematic increase in Tg indicative of crosslinking, was observed for air cured films. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed a slight sacrifice in thermal stability with increasing alkyl length. No improvement in film toughness was observed...|$|R
