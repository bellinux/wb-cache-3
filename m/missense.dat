5|$|W16 {{is found}} in the Oldenburger and is a <b>missense</b> {{mutation}} on Exon18.|$|E
5|$|W17 {{is found}} in a Japanese Draft horse and is a <b>missense</b> {{mutation}} on Exon14.|$|E
5|$|A <b>missense</b> {{mutation}} R174Q, a {{nonsense mutation}} R156X, and three single residue deletions DE167, DK175 and DK176, {{all in the}} C-terminal actin-tropomyosin interacting domain, {{have been found in}} patients with distal arthrogryposis.|$|E
5|$|But {{not all the}} SNPs have a {{detrimental}} effect on TG levels. A recent report, showed that, in Sardinian population, the <b>missense</b> mutation Arg282Ser in APOA5 gene, correlates with a decrease in TG levels. The authors believe that this point mutation is a mayor modulatory of TG values in this population.|$|E
5|$|W2 {{is found}} in Thoroughbred horses descended from KY Colonel, a {{stallion}} born in 1946. While KY Colonel {{was described as a}} chestnut with extensive white markings, he is known for siring a family of pure white horses through his white daughter, White Beauty, born in 1963. The W2 allele is also linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.1960G>A), but it is a <b>missense</b> mutation located on Exon17.|$|E
5|$|W4 {{is found}} in Camarillo White Horses, a breed {{characterized}} by a white coat, beginning with a spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan. Like W1 and W3, horses {{with this type of}} dominant white may be pure white or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a <b>missense</b> mutation on Exon12.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, <b>missense</b> mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a <b>missense</b> mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by <b>missense</b> (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, <b>missense</b> mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} than 40 known {{mutations}} associated with TMAU. Loss-of-function mutations, nonsense mutations, and <b>missense</b> mutations are {{three of the most}} common. Nonsense and <b>missense</b> mutations cause the most severe phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Patients with <b>missense</b> {{mutations}} have {{a better}} prognosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Missense</b> mutations, which {{code for}} a {{different}} amino acid.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{group called}} myoclonic {{dystonia}} where some cases are hereditary and {{have been associated with}} a <b>missense</b> mutation in the dopamine-D2 receptor. Some of these cases have responded well to alcohol.|$|E
25|$|One DISC1 {{mouse model}} is {{induced by the}} {{mutagenic}} chemical ENU. ENU introduces <b>missense</b> point mutations; screening for mutations in a particular exon of DISC1 can produce mouse models with schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits.|$|E
25|$|Most lamin B {{mutations}} {{appear to}} be lethal with mutations in lamin B1 causing death at birth in mice. In 2006, lamin B2 <b>missense</b> mutations were identified in patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|There is one natural {{variant of}} the {{population}} (frequency 0.436) at 233aa from proline to leucine in the CXorf66 protein, with proline being the ancestral encoded amino acid. No effects have been observed with this <b>missense</b> mutation.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies on}} the {{interaction}} of proteins with <b>missense</b> mutations and its neighbors showed high degree of rigidity associated with central hub proteins involved in protein binding and flexible subnetworks having molecular functions involved with calcium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Missense</b> {{mutations}} or nonsynonymous mutations are {{types of}} point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution {{of a different}} amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease, and SOD1-mediated ALS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Missense,</b> {{nonsense}} and {{splice site}} mutations of the UBR1 gene in both {{parents have been}} found with JBS, confirming the homozygous nature of the JBS phenotype. Variability of the phenotype, associated with residual ubiquitin ligase activity in some patients, has also been attributed to hypomorphic mutations occasionally found in either of the carrier parents. The UBR1 gene is located on human chromosome 15.|$|E
25|$|As the rhabdoid {{phenotype}} may exclusively {{be associated}} with certain <b>missense</b> mutations in the CK-8 gene (or, possibly, the vimentin gene — see above), it may prove possible to develop specific monoclonal antibodies against certain peptides in these aberrant gene products that may target only rhabdoid cells with these specific mutations. Recent reports suggest that antibodies may be easier {{to get into the}} interior of cells than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|FSS {{is caused}} by genetic changes. Krakowiak et al. (1998) mapped the distal arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenita (DA2B; MIM #601680) gene, a syndrome very similar in phenotypic expression to classic FSS, to 11p15.5-pter. Other mutations have been found as well. In FSS, inheritance may be either autosomal dominant, most often demonstrated. or autosomal recessive (MIM 277720). Alves and Azevedo (1977) note most reported cases of DA2A {{have been identified as}} new allelic variation. Toydemir et al. (2006) showed that mutations in embryonic myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3; MIM *160270), at 17p-13.1-pter, caused classic FSS phenotype, in their screening of 28 (21 sporadic and 7 familial) probands with distal arthrogryposis type 2A. In 20 patients (12 and 8 probands, respectively), <b>missense</b> mutations (R672H; MIM *160270.0001 and R672C; MIM *160270.0002) caused substitution of arg672, an embryonic myosin residue retained post-embryonically. Of the remaining 6 patients in whom they found mutations, 3 had <b>missense</b> private de novo (E498G; MIM *160270.0006 and Y583S) or familial mutations (V825D; MIM *160270.0004); 3 other patients with sporadic expression had de novo mutations (T178I; MIM *160270.0003), which was also found in DA2B; 2 patients had no recognized mutations.|$|E
25|$|This {{condition}} {{is caused by}} an inherited disorder of a chloride channel in {{the muscles of the}} skeleton (skeletal muscle chloride channel 1, CLCN1). The responsible gene is autosomal dominant, but has incomplete penetrance, leading to variable severity of the condition. In affected goats, the CLCN1 gene contains a <b>missense</b> mutation; the amino acid alanine is replaced with a proline residue. This small change causes the choride channel in the muscle fibres to have a reduced conductance of chloride ions.|$|E
25|$|X-linked myotubular {{myopathy}} was traditionally a fatal {{condition of}} infancy, with {{life expectancy of}} usually less than two years. There appears to be substantial variability in the clinical severity for different genetic abnormalities at that same MTM1 gene. Further, published cases show significant differences in clinical severity among relatives with the same genetic abnormality at the MTM1 gene. Most truncating mutations of MTM1 cause a severe and early lethal phenotype, while some <b>missense</b> mutations are associated with milder forms and prolonged survival (up to 54 years).|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{albinism}} type 1 (OA1), {{also called}} Nettleship–Falls syndrome, {{is the most}} common type of ocular albinism, with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000. It is an inheritable classical Mendelian type X-linked recessive disorder wherein the retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment while hair and skin appear normal. Since it is usually an X-linked disorder, it occurs mostly in males, while females are carriers unless they are homozygous. About 60 <b>missense</b> and nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions have been identified in Oa1. Mutations in OA1 have been linked to defective glycosylation and thus improper intracellular transportation.|$|E
25|$|Molecular genetic {{studies have}} defined {{at least two}} loci for TSC. In TSC1, the {{abnormality}} is localized on chromosome 9q34, but {{the nature of the}} gene protein, called hamartin, remains unclear. No <b>missense</b> mutations occur in TSC1. In TSC2, the gene abnormalities are on chromosome 16p13. This gene encodes tuberin, a guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein. The specific function of this protein is unknown. In TSC2, all types of mutations have been reported; new mutations occur frequently. Few differences have yet been observed in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or the other.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the rules}} that govern the genetic code and the various {{mechanisms}} present in a cell to ensure the correct transfer of genetic information {{during the process of}} DNA replication as well as during translation, mutations do occur; frameshift mutation is not the only type. There are at least two other types of recognized point mutations, specifically <b>missense</b> mutation and nonsense mutation. A frameshift mutation can drastically change the coding capacity (genetic information) of the message. Small insertions or deletions (those less than 20 base pairs) make up 24% of mutations that manifest in currently recognized genetic disease.|$|E
25|$|Also called Hirschsprung's disease, it is a {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} the colon in which nerve cells of the myenteric plexus in its walls, also known as ganglion cells, are absent. It is a rare disorder (1:5 000), with prevalence among males being four times that of females. Hirschsprung’s disease develops in the fetus {{during the early stages}} of pregnancy. A genetic predisposition to Hirschsprung's disease has been linked to chromosome 13 where a <b>missense</b> mutation at an ultraconserved region impairs functionality of the W276C receptor. Seven other genes seem to be implicated, however. If untreated, the patient can develop enterocolitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{mutations}} {{found in}} EEC are <b>missense</b> mutations, meaning {{that there is}} a single amino acid change in the protein, as opposed to premature termination of protein synthesis, known as a nonsense mutation. The frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon that affected the α isotope, but does not affect the β and γ isotopes of p63. From this, it can be concluded that mutant p63α isotopes seem {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of EEC syndrome. Interestingly, it seems that p63α is the predominant p63 isotope in epithelial basal cell layers, which are the cell type often associated with the anomalies found in patients with EEC syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of dietary iron absorption {{is complex and}} our understanding is incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is HFE on chromosome 6, which codes for a protein that participates in the {{regulation of}} iron absorption. The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. The C282Y allele is a transition point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a <b>missense</b> mutation that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake.|$|E
25|$|<b>Missense</b> {{mutations}} in the lamin A/C rod and tail domains are {{the cause for}} {{a wide array of}} genetic disorders, suggesting that lamin A/C protein contains distinct functional domains that are essential for the maintenance and integrity of different cell lineages. Interaction between lamin A and the nuclear envelope protein emerin appears to be crucial in muscle cells, with certain {{mutations in}} lamin mimicking mutations in emerin and causing Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Different mutations lead to dominant-negative and recessive alleles. Mutations in the lamin rod domain leading to mislocalization of both lamin A and emerin occur in patients with autosomal dominant forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene is {{perceived}} {{by a family}} of five transmembrane protein dimers such as the ETR1 protein in Arabidopsis. The genes encoding ethylene receptors have been cloned in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and many other plants. Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in plant genomes. Dominant <b>missense</b> mutations {{in any of the}} gene family, which comprises five receptors in Arabidopsis and at least six in tomato, can confer insensitivity to ethylene. Loss-of-function mutations in multiple members of the ethylene-receptor family result in a plant that exhibits constitutive ethylene responses. DNA sequences for ethylene receptors have also been identified in many other plant species and an ethylene binding protein has even been identified in Cyanobacteria.|$|E
25|$|There are 17 {{different}} mRNAS {{produced from}} the CCDC130 gene. 13 of these mRNAs come from alternative splicing, {{and the other}} four are unspliced. There have been four alternative promoters, five alternative polyadenylation sites, and four alternative last exons described. Two instances of intron retention have been described. 14 different proteins have been identified from the CCDC130 gene, all of which contain the DUF572 domain but only five seem to show the coiled-coil stretch. The other three mRNAs were very low quality and were not translated. It was also noted that this gene {{has the potential to}} encode several non-overlapping proteins. 45 SNPs have been documented for CCDC130 on NCBI: 29 <b>missense</b> mutations and 16 synonymous mutations that don't change the amino acid.|$|E
25|$|Tay–Sachs disease {{exists in}} Jacob sheep. The {{biochemical}} mechanism for this {{disease in the}} Jacob sheep is virtually identical to that in humans, wherein diminished activity of hexosaminidaseA results in increased concentrations of GM2 ganglioside in the affected animal. Sequencing of the HEXA gene cDNA of affected Jacobs sheep reveal an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in the human HEXA gene, and 86% nucleotide sequence identity. A <b>missense</b> mutation (G444R) {{was found in the}} HEXA cDNA of the affected sheep. This mutation is a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11, resulting in that exon's deletion (before translation) via splicing. The Tay–Sachs model provided by the Jacob sheep is the first to offer promise as a means for gene therapy clinical trials, which may prove useful for disease treatment in humans.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} genes that, when mutated, {{can cause the}} retinitis pigmentosa phenotype. Inheritance patterns of RP {{have been identified as}} autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and maternally (mitochondrially) acquired, and are dependent on the specific RP gene mutations present in the parental generation. In 1989, a mutation of the gene for rhodopsin, a pigment that plays an essential part in the visual transduction cascade enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. The rhodopsin gene encodes a principal protein of photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in this gene most commonly presents as <b>missense</b> mutations or misfolding of the rhodopsin protein, and most frequently follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. Since the discovery of the rhodopsin gene, more than 100 RHO mutations have been identified, accounting for 15% of all types of retinal degeneration, and approximately 25% of autosomal dominant forms of RP.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in Oa1 {{have been}} well {{characterized}} and studied using various techniques like southern blot analyses, single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Most of these mutations {{have been reported to}} be occurring in the N-terminus and few in the trans-membrane regions but very rarely in the much conserved cytoplasmic C-terminus. Populations belonging to different ethnic groups have been extensively analyzed and a database has been created recording the details of mutations related to OA1. A total of 25 <b>missense,</b> 2 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splicing mutations have been reported till date. In addition to these mutations, there also occur several deletions in one or many of the exons of Oa1 gene, especially exon 2. These deletions are presumed to be because of unequal crossing-over due to the presence of flanking Alu regions. In some cases, the entire Oa1 gene is deleted along with other contiguous genes. Many different polymorphisms have also been detected, mainly in intron 1.|$|E
