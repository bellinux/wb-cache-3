Entomopathogenic fungi such as Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorokin may provide an alternative to chemicals and their efficacy may be enhanced by autodissemination amongst flies. This study assessed the capacity of M. anisopliae for transmission between adult M. domestica and the effects of infection on the fecundity of females. RESULTS Metarhizium anisopliae was transmitted between adult M. domestica flies with 91. 67 % - 100 % mortality resulting across the three ratios of infected: non-infected flies tested (1 : 2, 1 : 5, 1 : 10). The <b>mean</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> (LT 50) for female recipients mixed with infected male donor flies at the three ratios were 3. 95, 4. 79 and 5. 65 days, respectively, whereas for male recipients mixed with infected female donors at the same ratios the LT 50 were 4. 98, 5. 98 and 7. 44 days, respectively. Infection with M. anisopliae significantly reduced the reproductive capacity of female flies during the first four days of infection with 25 % less eggs oviposited by infected flies than those that were uninfected.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} common parasites found in ruminants in the world. These parasites cause parasitic gastroenteritis and {{have a negative effect on}} productivity. Nematode control has been based on the use of anthelmintic chemicals—against which nematodes have developed a certain degree of resistance—which have been rated as residual substances in goat products that may cause adverse effects on the final consumer. As a result, the study of plant components has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to control nematodosis in goats. The anthelmintic potential of aqueous extracts of Nicotiana tabacum and oily extracts of Azadirachta indica on gastrointestinal nematodes affecting the goat chain was evaluated in vitro in this study. Nematicidal activity tests were performed on stool samples from goats with a high parasite load (trichostrongyles), by performing dose/ response curves. Percent inhibition in egg hatch for the aqueous extract of N. tabacum and the oily extract of A. indica was 99 % and 80 %, respectively. Extracts showed an effect on larva 3 (infective stage), with a <b>mean</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> of 8 ± 1 minutes for extracts of N. Tabacum, and of 8 ± 1 minutes for extract of A. indica. The in vitro results of the nematicidal activity show that N. tabacum and A. indica extracts can be a promising alternative for controlling nematodes in ruminants...|$|E

Bioassays were performed with engorged females, eggs and larvae. Fungal infection was evaluated based on biological parameters of treated engorged females, percentage of hatch from treated eggs, and percentage of mortality and <b>mean</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> (LT 90) of treated larvae. When the treatments were compared between the two populations, {{there were significant differences}} in the following parameters: pre-oviposition period, hatching period and egg production index. Moreover, the results showed that B. bassiana s. l., isolate Bb 986, was more virulent than M. anisopliae s. l., isolate 959, for engorged females, showing a control percentage of 49 %. In the bioassay with eggs, the hatching percentage ranged from 3. 1 % to 49. 5 % in one population and from 3. 4 % to 42. 7 % in the other, with {{no significant difference between the}} two populations. In the bioassay with unfed larvae, the mortality percentage ranged from 91. 8 % to 98. 7 % in one population and from 71. 0 % to 94. 0 % in the other.

40|$|The cold {{tolerance}} of different seasonal groups (pre-diapause, diapauses and post-diapause) of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) {{was assessed by}} exposing them either to a constant temperature of – 3 °C for 48 to 624 h, or to – 3, − 4, − 5, − 6 or − 7 °C for a constant 24 h. Cold survival was affected by the length of exposure, by the temperature rates and by seasonality. The least cold-tolerant were pre-diapause beetles in August with a mean lethal temperature (Ltemp 50) of − 4. 4 °C for 24 h exposure and with a lethal time (Ltime 50) of 106. 8 h at − 3 °C. Cold tolerance was significantly higher in the diapause group in January and in the post-diapause group in March; it {{did not differ significantly}} between these groups of beetle for 24 h exposure, the lethal temperature being − 5. 8 °C for both groups. Seasonality had a greater influence on survival of these groups after longer exposure to constant mild sub-zero temperature (− 3 °C); in diapause group, all the beetles survived 624 h exposure, but in post-diapause group the survival limit decreased to 216 h and lethal time was 153. 9 h. Colorado potato beetle eggs tolerated 24 h exposure to sub-zero temperatures from − 3 °C to − 5 °C or longer exposure at − 3 °C for 72 h without a reduction in hatchability. The <b>mean</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> for 50 % mortality of eggs was 76. 5 h and mean lethal temperature was − 5. 8 °C.

Four laboratory bioassays, including 1) proboscis extension and 2) gustatory response, 3) lethal concentration, and 4) <b>mean</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> to mortality, were used to investigate the effects of seventeen insecticides mixed with two sugar feeding stimulants on feeding behavior and mortality of pheromone trap captured adult male corn earworms, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), to screen and evaluate toxicants for use in an attracticide formulation. Commercially-available formulations of acephate, boric acid, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, DDVP, dimethoate, endosulfan, imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, oxamyl, profenofos, sulprofos, and thiodicarb, mixed with two concentrations of sucrose and fi-uctose feeding stimulants at toxicant concentrations up to 10, 000 ppm AI (I%) (wt:vol), were evaluated for proboscis extension response. Data from this bioassay indicate that none of these insecticides inhibited proboscis extension below 100 ppm Al concentrations. The same test mixtures were evaluated for gustatory response. Response inhibition varied between toxicants, but most insecticides elicited no significant inhibition of gustatory response at toxicant concentrations causing mortality, Acephate, carbaryl, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, profenofos, and thiodicarb mixed with 2. 5 M sucrose were evaluated for toxicity to adult male corn earworms via ingestion. Twenty-four hr LCggs are ranked as follows: thiodicarb 2. 0 ppm Al) < methomyl (2. 5) < lambda-cyhalothrin (4. 4) < profenofos (8. 4) < acephate (12. 3) < malathion (58. 2) < carbaryl (73. 0).

40|$|Poultry red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) {{infestation}} {{has high}} animal welfare relevance {{and leads to}} remarkable economic losses particularly in layers. Due to developments of resistances, residue problems, and the current legal regulations, control options are very limited in the EU, especially for organic layer farms. An alternative to chemical acaricides are silica products, {{which are based on}} silicon dioxide. In this study the twelve silica products were characterized with regard to water absorption capacity (WAC), silicon dioxide content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and specific BET-surface. Furthermore, an electron microscopy was conducted. Moreover acaricidal efficacy of these twelve products, nine in powder form and three for liquid application, was tested under laboratory conditions. Mite mortality was measured over time and the <b>mean</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>time</b> (LT 50) was determined by Probit analysis. The LT 50 values of powdery formulations ranged from 5. 1 to 18. 7 and of the fluid ones from 5. 5 to 12. 7 hours. Significant differences between the products were detected by Oneway ANOVA and Tukey´s HSD Test (p < 0. 05). The ranges of LT 50 of fluid and powdery formulations overlapped. Backward stepwise regression analysis was conducted in order to analyze the impact of the measured parameters on acaricidal efficacy. Silicon dioxide content had no significant impact on efficacy, while specific surface and CEC were positively and WAC negatively related to efficacy. Influence of these parameters on acaricidal efficacy was significant according to the results of a stepwise regression analysis (p < 0. 01). No direct relation was found between the analyzed parameters and the application form (powdery or liquid). To test the safety of the treatment procedure, hens were exposed to two fluid products. The products were sprayed in presence of the hens. One week after the initial exposure, the hens were slaughtered and trachea, lungs and air sacs were inspected by histology and compared to the not exposed control group. No alterations of high degree were found in any of the hens. Dust was found in very few lungs of the silica exposed hens as well as in lungs of the control hens. Application of the silica in presence of the hens did not lead to acute alterations in the hens respiratory tract. Consequences of long term exposure were examined in ten hens which came from an organic layer farm and were silica exposed for a period of one year. Foreign matter, supposed to be dust, was found in the lungs of all hens and in the airsacs of three hens. There is no evidence for silica exposure as origin of the dust found in lungs and airsacs of the hens. A further study was conducted to survey mite infestation and different schedules for control of D. gallinae on 17 organic layer farms. Both mite infestation and control strategies differed concerning the use of prophylactic silica application, curative use of acaricides and in the monitoring of the mite infestation by the farmer. Within the scope of this project a monitoring method modified at the Institute of Animal Welfare and Animal Husbandry, Celle (FLI) was validated. Monitoring and prophylactic silica application are important components of successful mite control. Farms with curative use of acaricides did not show lower mite burden than those without. The reason for this might be that highly infested farms rather use curative control than those that do not suffer from mite infestation. It was found that on highly infested farms with curative mite control mite infestation did not increase...|$|E
