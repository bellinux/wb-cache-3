5|$|The Romans were {{in front}} of the hill leading to Cannae and hemmed in on their right flank by the Aufidus River, so that their left flank was the only viable means of retreat. In addition, the Carthaginian forces had maneuvered so that the Romans would face east. Not only would the <b>morning</b> <b>sun</b> shine low into the Romans' eyes, but the southeasterly winds would blow sand and dust into their faces as they {{approached}} the battlefield. Hannibal's unique deployment of his army, based on his perception of the terrain and understanding of the capabilities of his troops, proved decisive.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the <b>morning</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E

5|$|Though the Meridian Star is now {{the only}} {{newspaper}} printed in the city, {{there have been a}} few other historical newspapers. One such paper is the Memo Digest, a ten to twenty page publication published during the 1970s. The Digest focused on issues relevant to the African-American population of the region, gathering a circulation of about 5,000 people. Other newspapers in the city have included The Colored Messenger, The State, The Weekly Mercury, The Blade, Weekly Echo, Fair Play, Headlight, Meridian <b>Morning</b> <b>Sun,</b> Teacher and Preacher, and Clarion.|$|E
5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly {{impairing}} his speed and marksmanship. Loco then {{stands in the}} doorway, ready to face the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army – but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the <b>morning</b> <b>sun.</b> A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the <b>morning</b> <b>sun)</b> and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E

25|$|A.gravesii was {{produced}} by artificial hybridization in 1954–1955 by Thomas Darling, Jr., who provided {{a detailed account of}} the process. Spores of the two parental species were sown on damp peat moss and kept largely in the shade, except for a few hours of <b>morning</b> <b>sun.</b> Gametophytes developed, and the young sporophytes that grew from them were large enough to remove in autumn. They were transplanted into a well-drained, gravelly loam. They were raised in a humid terrarium exposed to morning sunlight, with a layer of tissue to shade them from direct sunlight. Of the A.gravesii in the mixed population, one reached maturity in August 1955; two others did not mature until June 1956. Difficulties were encountered due to aphid infestation and various diseases promoted by excess moisture.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, while {{awaiting}} entrance to Saumur, Lahm {{won the first}} Gordon Bennett Cup international balloon race against competitors from seven nations, all of which had a military officer as a crew member. The race, commencing at the Tuileries Garden in Paris, was actually a distance competition across the English Channel. His father had planned to pilot the balloon United States himself but desired to return to America for Katherine's wedding, and so recruited his son to fly in his place. Accompanied by Major Henry Blanchard Hersey of the United States Weather Bureau, who had studied the storm tracks and prevailing winds, Lahm started 12th {{in a field of}} 16 late in the afternoon of September 30. Under a full moon they reached the Channel before midnight and a lightship off the coast of England three hours later, where fog obscured the surface. The <b>morning</b> <b>sun</b> slowly burned off the fog and caused the balloon to ascend to 3,000 meters altitude. Lahm and Hersey established their position over Berkshire around 07:00 and continued north, gradually descending to avoid drifting out over the North Sea. They landed near Fylingdales in Yorkshire after covering a distance of 641 kilometers and more than 22 hours aloft.|$|E
