5|$|Prior to {{the public}} performance, L'Estrange {{undertook}} the crossing for a select audience including <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> That crossing was a success, and was well reviewed in the papers, no doubt adding to the crowd's anticipation for the Saturday show. Sadly, bad weather postponed the performance, which did not go ahead until 14 April.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of news {{trucks and}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> {{arrived at the}} site to cover the story. The press {{immediately}} noticed that the bombing {{took place on the}} second anniversary of the Waco incident. Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Arsenal {{fans were}} {{originally}} {{blamed for the}} violence as the police had fixed blame on them. In Turkey, the media portrayed Galatasaray fans as acting in self-defence, with criticism directed at the British fans for allegedly attacking <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> However, there were conflicting reports, with claims that some Galatasaray fans were instigating some of the violence. Later on, British media blame also transferred towards Galatasaray fans.|$|E
5|$|News of a Kidnapping (Noticia de un secuestro) {{was first}} {{published}} in 1996. It is a non-fiction book that examines a series of related kidnappings and Narco-terrorist actions committed in the early 1990s in Colombia by the Medell√≠n Cartel, a drug cartel founded and operated by Pablo Escobar. The text recounts the kidnapping, imprisonment, and eventual release of prominent figures in Colombia, including politicians and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E

5|$|On October 31, 2012, Microsoft and government-owned {{organization}} Liechtenstein Marketing {{transformed the}} countryside of Liechtenstein {{for a special}} live action event for fans and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The Gutenberg Castle {{was transformed into a}} military fortification where guests tried out Halo 4 for the first time. A nearby countryside had a United Nations Space Command military camp installed and Balzers Quarry was transformed into a battleground where fifteen actors played out a two-hour-long adventure.|$|E
5|$|A large press gang from Aigle, of {{more than}} 50 marines and sailors, led by Wolfe, put ashore in Portland on 2 April 1803. In {{what became known as}} the Easton Massacre, a scuffle broke out between the {{inhabitants}} and Wolfe's forces. Several civilians were shot and four were killed, while sixteen <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> gang received injuries. Nine were wounded so seriously they had to be discharged. Wolfe and three officers stood trial for murder but were acquitted and left Portland, aboard Aigle, on 10 April to continue their patrol in home waters. Taking a French frigate, Franchise on 28 May, Aigle went on to capture six merchant vessels over the course of a week. A French privateer, Alerte, of 14 guns was taken on 27 September, off Vigo.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became {{redundant}} {{and were}} abandoned. Their maintenance became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. In March 1948 the question of public access to the War Rooms was raised in Parliament and the Minister responsible, Charles Key MP, considered that 'it would not be practicable to throw open for inspection by the general public accommodation which forms part of an office where confidential work is carried on'. Even so, a tour was organised for journalists on 17 March, with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> being welcomed by Lord Ismay and shown around the Rooms by their custodian, Mr. George Rance.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} season since Big Brother 6, {{the program was}} filmed at CBS Studios in Studio City, California. The {{production}} team was located in the second story of the House which included the story department, audio department and the switchers and shaders. The House was equipped with 52 cameras and 80 microphones to record the participants. The art department that created the competitions for the program was located outside the House. The House theme was eco-friendly and modern California living was released on June 29 during media day, where select <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> were invited to spend 12 hours inside the House. Official pictures of the House interior were released by CBS on the same day, showing the living room, bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, lounge room and backyard. The living room featured chipboard walls with fake plants along the side.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his {{succession}} Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas-Home) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues, ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.|$|E
50|$|Jayes joined Sky News in 2006 as a reporter, and in 2011 {{became a}} {{political}} reporter and <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> gallery based in Canberra. She was <b>the</b> presenter <b>of</b> Lunchtime Agenda {{before the program}} was axed in June 2015.|$|R

5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch {{and the likelihood of}} frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4‚Äì0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Landis {{worked hard}} to protect Gresham's {{interests}} in the State Department, making friends with many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> He was less popular among many of the Department's senior career officials, who saw him as brash. When word leaked concerning President Cleveland's Hawaiian policy, the President was convinced Landis {{was the source of}} the information and demanded his dismissal. Gresham defended Landis, stating that Cleveland would have to fire both of them, and the President relented, later finding out that he was mistaken in accusing Landis. President Cleveland grew to like Landis, and when Gresham died in 1895, offered Landis the post of United States Ambassador to Venezuela. Landis declined the diplomatic post, preferring to return to Chicago to begin a law practice and to marry Winifred Reed, daughter of the Ottawa, Illinois postmaster. The two married July 25, 1895; they had two surviving children, a boy, Reed, and a girl, Susanne‚Äîa third child, Winifred, died almost immediately after being born.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2009, Paramount flew 50 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> to New York with Anna Kendrick, Sad Brad Smith {{and representatives}} of American Airlines to promote Up in the Air. The film was shown on the aircraft's video {{monitors}} during the flight from New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines provided the Boeing 767 gratis. Smith performed a few songs including Help Yourself in the aisle of the aircraft. On November 18, 2009, Backstage and Paramount Pictures had a special screening of Up in the Air for Screen Actors Guild and Backstage members at The Paramount Theatre (on the Paramount Lot), Los Angeles, California. The screening of the film {{was followed by a}} conversation with cast members Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. The Starz Denver Film Festival closed on November 22, 2009 with a screening of Up in the Air, with an introduction by J.K. Simmons, who was in town to accept the festival's Cassavetes Award earlier that afternoon. The 20th Stockholm International Film Festival, which ran from November 18 to November 29, 2009, closed with a screening of Up in the Air on November 29, 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{mass was}} first {{performed}} on 14 March 1864 at the couple's new residence in Paris, the h√¥tel of Louise, comtesse de Pillet-Will. The countess is the dedicatee of this refined and elegant piece, which avoids the sentimental opulence of most contemporary liturgical works, {{such as those}} by Charles Gounod. Albert Lavignac, aged eighteen, conducted from the harmonium. The soloists were the sisters Carlotta and Barbara Marchisio, Italo Gardoni and Luigi Agnesi. The sisters Marchisio had performed together in Rossini's works before, such as the leading parts of the lovers in his opera Semiramide. Rossini, who had helped prepare for the performance, turned pages for the first pianist, Georges Mathias, and marked tempos by nodding his head. Among the first listeners were Giacomo Meyerbeer, Daniel Auber and Ambroise Thomas. The performance was repeated the following day, for a larger audience which included <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Governor Shirley was at Louisbourg trouble {{had been}} brewing between the Royal Navy {{and the people}} of Boston. The Navy had long sought to press Americans into service on its ships. Impressment was a long-standing {{practice}} in Britain, but its application in America was resisted by the colonists. In 1702 Fort William on Castle Island had fired on HMS Swift as it tried to leave Boston Harbour with six recently impressed men aboard. As a result of American complaints (reinforced by British merchants), Parliament in 1708 banned impressment in the American colonies. Navy leaders argued that the American exemption from impressment had been in force only during Queen Anne's War, which ended in 1713. In practice, Royal Navy captains had to apply to colonial governors for a license to press men. In late November 1745 a fight between a press gang and some sailors staying in a boarding house in Boston left two of the sailors with fatal injuries. Two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> gang were charged with murder and convicted, but were released when the indictment was found invalid.|$|E
5|$|The high {{waves and}} winds caused the {{greatest}} marine damage {{in a decade}} around New York City. More than 100boats were overturned or beached in Jamaica Bay, and another 150boats were wrecked between Hell Gate and {{the west end of}} Coney Island. At least ten houseboats were damaged or sank, with boaters injured and requiring rescue. A man attempting to row ashore near Point O' Woods required rescue amid strong winds. Passengers swam safely ashore after their boat capsized in Hell Gate. President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced the effects of the hurricane while vacationing on the naval yacht Sylph along Long Island. Also on the yacht were Roosvelt's wife, son, his secretary, several friends and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> association. The yacht experienced gusty winds and heavy rainfall, along with rough seas, and witnessed a boat capsizing in Hell Gate. Passengers left the deck of the yacht for safety while their belongings were secured. After the President was considered to be in danger, the yacht headed for land, and instead of embarking toward Ellis Island as originally planned, the yacht landed at Brooklyn Navy Yard. Farther north, high winds downed many trees along coastal Connecticut, which cut telegraph and telephone lines in Bridgeport. A boy was killed in Hartford after stepping onto a downed power line. Several boats were washed ashore along the Connecticut coast. Farther inland, winds disrupted power in Leicester and damaged crops.|$|E
