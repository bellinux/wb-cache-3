2500|$|The {{history of}} the 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonists began in 1957, when J.H. Gaddum and Zuleika P. Picarelli at the University of Edinburgh proposed the existence of two serotonin receptor subtypes, the M and D receptors (thus named because their function could be blocked by morphine and dibenzyline respectively), in a landmark paper. The 5-HT3 receptor was later found to correspond to the M receptor. In the 1970s, John Fozard found that metoclopramide and cocaine were weak antagonists at the 5-HT3 (5-HT-M) receptor. Fozard and Maurice Gittos later synthesized MDL 72222, the first potent and truly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.

40|$|Intravenous {{injection}} of ioxaglate (4 g iodine kg− 1), an iodinated radiographic contrast medium, caused a marked protein extravasation, pulmonary oedema and {{a decrease in}} the arterial partial oxygen pressure in rats. All of these reactions to ioxaglate were reversed by the pretreatment with gabexate <b>mesilate</b> (10 and 50 mg kg− 1, 5 min prior to injection) or nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> (3 and 10 mg kg− 1), in which the inhibition was complete after {{injection of}} nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> (10 mg kg− 1). Both gabexate <b>mesilate</b> and nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> inhibited the activity of purified human lung tryptase, although the latter compound was far more potent than the former. Ioxaglate enhanced the nafamostat-sensitive protease activity in the extracellular fluid of rat peritoneal mast cell suspensions. Tryptase enhanced the permeability of protein through the monolayer of cultured human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Ioxaglate, when applied in combination with rat peritoneal mast cells, also produced the endothelial barrier dysfunction. These effects of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by nafamostat <b>mesilate.</b> Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence morphological analysis revealed that tryptase or ioxaglate in combination with mast cells increased actin stress fibre formation while decreasing VE-cadherin immunoreactivity. Both of these actions of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by nafamostat <b>mesilate.</b> These findings suggest that tryptase liberated from mast cells plays {{a crucial role in the}} ioxaglate-induced pulmonary dysfunction.

40|$|Received on 26 - 06 - 2012 Accepted on 10 - 07 - 2012 Gabexate <b>mesilate</b> {{has been}} mainly {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of disseminated intravascular coagration (DIC) in Japan since 1983. Recently, several generic versions of injectable gabexate <b>mesilate</b> with or without d-mannitol as an additive have been put on the Japanese market. In our study, thermo gravimetry (TG) did not show any differences between gabexate <b>mesilate</b> products with or without d-mannitol as an additive. However, differential thermal analysis (DTA) showed a significant change in absorption derived from endothermic reactions. Differential thermal analysis for M 1, M 2 and M 3, with 100 mg of d-mannitol produced two endothermic peaks during the first rise in temperature from 30 ◦ C to 170 ◦ C, followed by an exothermic peak derived from the 170 ◦ C to 30 ◦ C cooling period. During the second rise in temperature from 30 ◦ C to 170 ◦ C another endothermic peak was produced. On the other hand, N 1, N 2, N 3, and FOY without d-mannitol derived from gabexate <b>mesilate</b> produced only one endothermic peak, and were followed by no exothermic peaks during the cooling period. Interestingly, a glass transition was found at the second rise in temperature. In addition, we confirmed that gabexate <b>mesilate</b> undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of water due to the ester bonds in its chemical structure. The addition of d-mannitol seems to cause moisture absorption in the lyophilized processing of gabexate <b>mesilate</b> products, resulting in a higher content of hydrolyzed ethyl 4 -Hydrobenzoate for M 1...|$|E

Single intravenous doses of 1. 8 or 2. 4 mg/kg of dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> or 3 mg of granisetron hydrochloride were administered in a volume of 50 ml over a 5 -min period, beginning 30 min prior to cisplatin (≥ 80 mg/m 2) administration. The number and timing of emetic episodes, time to administration of escape anti-emetic medication, severity of nausea by visual analogue scale (VAS), and safety were monitored for 24 h after the start of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Investigators' evaluations of overall efficacy and patients' satisfaction with therapy were recorded {{at the end of the}} 24 -h study period. Of the 474 patients evaluable for efficacy, complete responses were achieved by 54, 47 and 48 % of patients given dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> 1. 8 mg/kg, dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> 2. 4 mg/kg and granisetron, respectively. Statistically, treatment groups had comparable complete and complete plus major responses, times to first emesis, and use of escape medication; patient maximum nausea severity and treatment satisfaction ratings; and physician nausea severity and overall efficacy assessments. For the majority of efficacy endpoints, 1. 8 mg/kg dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> produced numerically superior responses compared with the 2. 4 mg/kg dose. Gender and prior chemotherapy were significant predictors of complete response; males and chemotherapy-naive patients had higher responses. The overall incidences of adverse events were comparable among the treatment groups; headache and diarrhoea were most common. In conclusion, 1. 8 and 2. 4 mg/kg of dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> and granisetron (3 mg) were equally effective in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. In addition, because no additional benefit was observed with 2. 4 mg/kg of dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> and numerically greater responses were observed with the 1. 8 mg/kg dose, the lower dose of 1. 8 mg/kg is optimal for further clinical development.

Single oral doses of 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg of dolasetron <b>mesilate</b> were administered 1 h prior to the initiation of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Multiple doses of ondansetron (8 mg x 3 or 8 mg x 4) capsules, or matching placebo for patients randomised to dolasetron, were given 1. 5 h before and 6. 5, 14. 5 and 22. 5 h after the start of chemotherapy (total dose = 32 mg). Efficacy was evaluated for 24 h after the initiation of chemotherapy. The most frequently used moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and carboplatin (28. 4, 23. 1 and 20. 6 % of patients, respectively). A statistically significant (P < 0. 001) linear dose-response relationship was observed over the entire dolasetron dosage range for all efficacy parameters. Complete response rates were 45. 0, 49. 4, 60. 5 and 76. 3 % for 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg dolasetron <b>mesilate,</b> respectively, and 72. 3 % of ondansetron patients.

40|$|The {{employment}} of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies represents a {{backbone of the}} therapeutic options {{for the treatment of}} metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, this therapy is poorly effective or ineffective in unselected patients. Mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA genes have recently emerged as the best predictive factors of low/absent response to EGFR-targeted therapy. Due to the need for efficacious treatment options for mCRC patients bearing these mutations, in this short report we examined the antitumoral activity of the protease inhibitor gabexate <b>mesilate,</b> alone and in combination with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, in a panel of human CRC cell lines harbouring a different expression pattern of wild-type/mutated KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA genes. Results obtained showed that gabexate <b>mesilate</b> significantly inhibited the growth, invasive potential and tumour-induced angiogenesis in all the CRC cells employed in this study (including those ones harbouring dual KRAS/PIK 3 CA or BRAF/PIK 3 CA mutation), while cetuximab affected these parameters only in CRC cells with KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA wild-type. Notably, the antitumoral efficacy of gabexate <b>mesilate</b> and cetuximab in combination was found to be not superior than that observed with gabexate <b>mesilate</b> as single agent. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that gabexate <b>mesilate</b> could represent a promising therapeutic option for mCRC patients, particularly for those harbouring KRAS, BRAF and PIK 3 CA mutations, either as mono-therapy or in addition to standard chemotherapy regimens.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on patients who developed SAP with or without CRAI. Out of 18 patients fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for SAP in Japan, 9 patients underwent CRAI, while 9 patients underwent conventional systemic protease inhibitor and antibiotics therapy (non-CRAI). CRAI was initiated within 72 h of the onset of pancreatitis. Gabexate <b>mesilate</b> (2400 mg/d) was continuously administered for 3 to 5 d. The clinical outcome including serum inflammation-related parameters were examined. RESULTS: The duration of abdominal pain in the CRAI group was 1. 9 ± 0. 26 d, whereas that in the non-CRAI group was 4. 3 ± 0. 50. The duration of SIRS in the CRAI group was 2. 2 ± 0. 22 d, whereas that in the non-CRAI group was 3. 2 ± 0. 28.

40|$|The {{origin of}} blood loss during liver surgery is multifactorial. Surgical skill, technique, anesthesiological care, but also hyperfibrinolysis {{have been shown}} {{to play a role in}} the origin of {{bleeding}} during partial hepatectomy and liver transplantation. The latter has provided the scientific basis for the prophylactic use of antifibrinolytic drugs, such as aprotinin and nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> in liver surgery. Recently however, concern has been voiced about potential risks associated with aprotinin, including renal failure and thromboembolic events. In this review we discuss the efficacy and safety issues of aprotinin and nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> in liver surgery. We identified a total of 19 studies on the use of either aprotinin or nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> in liver surgery reported in the time period between 1966 and July 2006. The use of aprotinin or nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> in partial hepatectomies was studied in three studies. In 16 studies the use of aprotinin in liver transplantation was investigated. With respect to partial hepatectomy, improvements in surgical technique and anesthesiological care seem to be more important in reducing blood loss than the use of the antifibrinolytic drugs. Aprotinin may be indicated in a selected group of patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver resection, but further studies in this specific group of patients will be needed. In liver transplantation, the use of aprotinin is associated with a significant reduction in blood loss and transfusion requirements of around 30 - 40 %. Results of prospective studies do not provide support for safety concerns as no increased risk for thromboembolic events or renal dysfunction has been observed in liver transplant patients treated with aprotinin. In conclusion, there is currently no scientific support for the routine use of aprotinin or nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy, whereas the efficacy of aprotinin in liver transplantation is well established.

40|$|Uncertainties {{still exist}} about the {{clinical}} benefit of pharmacological prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis by either antisecretory {{drugs such as}} somatostatin and its long-acting analogue octreotide, or protease inhibitors such as gabexate <b>mesilate.</b> Recent, large-scale prospective studies have reported a fourfold reduction in acute pancreatitis as compared to a placebo with the prophylactic administration of either gabexate <b>mesilate</b> or somatostatin, whereas octreotide {{was found to be}} ineffective. An initial meta-analysis of all available controlled trials on this topic has confirmed these findings. The indiscriminate use of these drugs in all patients is unlikely to be cost-effective, but the selective use of prophylaxis for high-risk patients might be advocated. Moreover, inasmuch as 85 % of complications developed within 4 to 6 hours of completing the ERCP, it would be reasonable to infuse drugs only for this limited length of time. A recent prospective trial, carried out on high-risk patients, has surprisingly documented a higher incidence, although a non-significant one, of pancreatitis in patients who received short-term prophylaxis with somatostatin or gabexate <b>mesilate</b> than those given a placebo: 11. 5 % and 8. 1 % vs. 6. 5 %, respectively. In order to explore this discrepancy, the original meta-analysis was updated by including data of this negative trial: heterogeneity among the trials was apparent. A careful scrutiny of the most recent studies has revealed differences in patient population, protocols of drug administration, technique and operator-related risk factors for complications among the trials, which could explain, by themselves, the contrasting results reported by the interventional studies. In conclusion, current literature does not support the prophylactic use of either somatostatin or gabexate <b>mesilate</b> for the prevention of ERCP-related pancreatic damage, even in patients deemed to be at high risk for complications. At present, post-ERCP complications (and pancreatitis) can be prevented efficaciously by appropriate selection of patients, mastering of the technique and operator competence...|$|E

40|$|Aim. The authors {{report their}} {{experience}} with adrenalectomy {{in the treatment of}} pheochromocytoma, focusing on the perioperative management of the disease. Methods. A comparative analysis of 3 preoperative schemes of cardiovascular therapy is made: Doxazosyn <b>mesilate</b> 8 mg/day, Doxazosyn <b>mesilate</b> 8 mg/day plus Nifedipine 30 mg/day, Doxazosyn <b>mesilate</b> 8 mg/day plus Nifedipine 30 mg/day plus Atenolol 100 mg, all administered along with a proper volemic expansion to minimize vasoconstriction from circulating exceeding cathecolamines and reduce secondary β-stimulation caused by α-blockers. All patiens (n= 19) had been admitted to hospital for paroxysmal hypertension, severe headhache, tachycardia, tremors, upper and lower limb paresthesia, polyuria. They all had been submitted, prior to surgery, to serum chemistry, cardiac evaluation, catecholamine and vanil-mandelic acid assay, CT total body and adrenal MIBG scintigram that confirmed the presence of an adrenal neoplasm. Surgery was performed in all patients under general anesthesia, tracheal intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation with Isofluorane, Fentanyl and Vecuronium. Results. The authors discuss the only intraoperative death of a 25 year old female patient {{in the light of the}} data reported in the literature. Conclusion. The conclusion is drawn that, in spite of the broad consensus on the efficacy of a preoperative cardiovascular therapy, it is still not available an optimal perioperative strategy or a golden standard in the anesthesiologic management, really effective in minimizing the complications of the surgical treatment of pheocromocytoma...|$|E
40|$|There is no proven {{specific}} {{drug therapy}} {{for the treatment}} of acute pancreatitis, including protease inhibitors. In this virtual Round Table, our invited authors reviewed the past, present, and projected future clinical relevance of protease inhibitors. Through their discussion, protease inhibitors are demonstrated to have broad inhibitory actions on serine proteases, the coagulation system, the complement system and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, both in vitro and in vivo. We are assured that proteases remain an important and active field of study. Several protease inhibitors, including gabexate <b>mesilate,</b> nafamostat <b>mesilate</b> and ulinastatin, have been used {{for the treatment of}} acute pancreatitis in Japan [1, 2]. Camostat <b>mesilate,</b> an orally active protease inhibitor, has also been used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis [2]. Their major action in suppressing pancreatitis is that of inactivating trypsin and preventing autodigestion. In recent years, several actions of a protease inhibitor have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo studies. For example, gabexate has been revealed to inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) activation in human monocytes or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [3, 4]. NF-kappa B plays a crucial role in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [5, 6]. Therefore, gabexate has been hypothesized to have various functions in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, if gabexate therapies targe...|$|E
40|$|ONO 3403, a new {{synthetic}} {{serine protease}} inhibitor, is a derivative of camostat <b>mesilate</b> {{and has a}} higher protease-inhibitory activity. The effect of ONO 3403 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264. 7 macrophage-like cells was examined. ONO 3403 significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha production at a lower concentration than camostat <b>mesilate.</b> It also inhibited LPS-induced NO production. Their inhibition {{was responsible for the}} reduced mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and inducible NO synthase. In LPS-stimulated cells, ONO 3403 prevented the augmentation of MyD 88 expression and inhibited the phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and IRF- 3, and the production of interferon-beta. ONO 3403 abolished the elevation of the extracellular serine protease activity in response to LPS. Further, it reduced the circulating TNF-alpha level, hepatic injury and mortality in mice receiving an injection of D-galactosamine and LPS. ONO 3403 was suggested to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory responses via inactivation of MyD 88 -dependent and independent pathways...|$|E
