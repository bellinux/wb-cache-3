5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August Nansen and Johansen boarded Jackson's {{supply ship}} Windward, and sailed for Vardø where they {{arrived on the}} 13th. They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the {{originator}} of the polar drift theory, {{who was in the}} town by chance. The world was quickly informed by telegram of Nansen's safe return, but as yet there was no news of Fram. Taking the weekly <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> south, Nansen and Johansen reached Hammerfest on 18 August, where they learned that Fram had been sighted. She had emerged from the ice north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Tromsø. She had not passed over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark. Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Tromsø, where they were reunited with their comrades.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Emden was anchored in the German base at Tsingtao. She steamed out to sea on the evening of July 31, 1914, and on August 4 she intercepted and captured the Russian <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> Rjäsan, the first prize taken by the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) in the Great War. Emden then made rendezvous with the German East Asia Squadron of Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee in the Mariana Islands.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>steamers</b> were steamships which {{carried the}} mail across waterways, such as across an ocean or between islands, {{primarily}} during the 19th century and early 20th century, when {{the cost of}} sending a letter was declining to the point an ordinary person could afford the cost of sending a letter across great distances. In addition to carrying <b>mail,</b> most <b>mail</b> <b>steamers</b> carried passengers or cargo since the revenue from the mail service, if any, was insufficient by itself {{to pay for the}} cost of its travel.|$|R

25|$|Like {{many other}} {{officers}} of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable {{interest in the}} American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, {{he decided to take}} a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface: On 2 March 1863, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the <b>mail</b> <b>steamer,</b> Atrato.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 1897, the <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> Queen {{would be}} the first of the gold rush {{flotilla}} to dock at Moore's wharf in Skagway Bay, followed by John Irving's Islander and the collier Willamette. Skagway, Alaska was born and became a boomtown overnight. Originally the Indians called it Skagua, Moore renamed it Mooresville and the stampeders took over and named it Skaguay, later spelled Skagway. What Moore did not anticipate was the lack of concern for his legal rights in ownership of the land Skagway sat upon. The residents and stampeders that made up the population pushed Moore aside and took over ownership of his land. When streets were surveyed it was found that Moore's home stood directly in its path. Moore put up a fight but in the end his home was uprooted and moved to another location. Moore brought suit against the claim jumpers who remained in town after the rush and, in 1901, won a 25% reimbursement.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Mexican-American War in 1848, the United States Pacific {{coastline}} now {{extended from}} Puget Sound to San Diego. When the 29th Congress passed the <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamer</b> Bill (1847), mail delivery was authorized to be routed by ship from the Eastern Seaboard to the Pacific Coast via the Isthmus of Panama, with two steamship routes operating: New York City to Chagres, Colombia on the Eastern side of the isthmus, and then a second route from Panama, Colombia to Astoria, Oregon. That same year, William Henry Aspinwall secured a 10-year government contract through Arnold Harris, with the New York State Senate incorporating the Pacific Mail Steamship Company with a capital of $400,000, of which Aspinwall was elected the first president. This company was to move the mail from Panama to the West Coast, being paid $199,000 per annum by the U.S. government. In January 1848, the company ordered three mail steamers from the shipyard of William Henry Webb: the SS California, SS Panama and SS Oregon. On October 5 or October 6, 1848 the Pacific Mail's first of these steamers, the SS California, departed from New York City to run service from Panama to the West Coast, traveling around Cape Horn to San Francisco—coincidentally, the California Gold Rush began in January of that year, and the steamer—and its sisters, Oregon and Panama—took on many hopeful miners en route.|$|E

500|$|Experts were sceptical of {{all such}} reports, and Nansen's arrival in Vardø quickly put paid to them. In Vardø, he and Johansen {{were greeted by}} Professor Mohn, the {{originator}} of the polar drift theory, {{who was in the}} town by chance. The pair waited for the weekly <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> to take them south, and on 18 August arrived in Hammerfest to an enthusiastic reception. [...] The lack of news about Fram was preying on Nansen's mind; however, on 20 August he received news that Sverdrup had brought the ship to the tiny port of Skjervøy, south of Hammerfest, and was now continuing with her to Tromsø. The next day, Nansen and Johansen sailed into Tromsø and joined their comrades in an emotional reunion.|$|E

2500|$|Stead {{had often}} {{claimed that he}} would die from either lynching or drowning. He had {{published}} two pieces that gained greater significance {{in light of his}} fate on the Titanic. On 22 March 1886, he published an article titled [...] "How the <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamer</b> went down in Mid Atlantic by a Survivor", wherein a steamer collides with another ship, resulting in a high loss of life due to an insufficient ratio of lifeboats to passengers. Stead had added: [...] "This is exactly what might take place and will take place if liners are sent to sea short of boats". In 1892, Stead published a story titled [...] "From the Old World to the New", in which a vessel, the Majestic, rescues survivors of another ship that collided with an iceberg.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1938 memoirs, Dew recalled:"I {{had landed}} on July 29 by the liner Laurentic, {{arriving}} {{two days before}} the Montrose, which was already well out in the Atlantic when we first suspected that Crippen was aboard, but which was a much slower vessel than the <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> Laurentic. Old Crippen took it quite well. He always {{was a bit of a}} philosopher, though he could not have helped being astounded to see me on board the boat. He was quite a likeable chap in his way. Much of my time in Canada was spent evading reporters and cameramen, who knew all about my arrival in spite of our efforts to keep it secret, and who frequently became personal when I did not give them a statement. As it happened, Crippen and his companion, Miss Ethel Le Neve, showed no desire to postpone our departure and waived their extradition rights, which enabled us to make the return journey after being only three weeks in Canada." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} myth, photos from Government House during Murray's and Boyle's administrations {{and during the}} Prince of Wales visit to Newfoundland in 1860 show the Union Jack, the {{governmental}} ensigns, and various other flags being flown on ships in St. John's harbour, but not the [...] "Pink, White and Green". [...] Captain Robert Bartlett, who captained Admiral Peary on his ultimate polar expedition in 1909, was claimed by members of his crew to have planted the [...] "Pink, White and Green" [...] within six miles of the North Pole. [...] This was in fact untrue, as Bartlett was never closer than 150 miles (241km) from the pole, with Peary continuing on sled without Bartlett or his crew from there. [...] The tricolour {{is said to have}} been flown alongside the Union Jack at Government House during the administrations of Boyle and Murray, though there is no photographic evidence from the period to support this, with existing photos showing only the Union Jack and governmental Ensigns. [...] An official <b>mail</b> <b>steamer</b> was to be seen flying the tricolour as late as 1907 but was forced by authorities to replace it with the Newfoundland Red Ensign, the civil flag of Newfoundland vessels, upon entering St. John's harbour. [...] After the First World War its use diminished and Newfoundlanders generally flew the Union Jack as their flag - the Union Jack being legislated as the Dominion of Newfoundland's official flag in 1931, with the Newfoundland Red Ensign designated as [...] "National Colours". [...] In recent years, the [...] "Pink, White and Green" [...] flag has undergone a revival, and has become popular on T-shirts incorrectly referring to it as [...] "the Republic of Newfoundland flag," [...] despite the fact that available history indicates it originated exclusively as a symbol representing Roman Catholic/Irish communities on the island, was never officially recognized as a national or provincial flag, and although Newfoundland was an independent British Dominion from 1907 to 1949, it was never a republic.
