5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project <b>management</b> <b>function,</b> rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in outsourcing corporate real estate <b>management</b> <b>functions.</b> We explain why firms should consider outsourcing and identify both positive benefits and possible negative consequences of outsourcing. Further, we utilize concepts from the neoclassical theory of the firm, supported by the literature on corporate real estate outsourcing, to shed some light on how much and which corporate real estate <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> should be outsourced. Functions associated with "taskmasters", "controllers", and "dealmakers" {{are more likely to be}} outsourced successfully. "Entrepreneur" and "business strategist" <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> are more likely to be carried out more effectively by internal managers. Outsourcing the appropriate real estate <b>management</b> <b>functions,</b> consistent with each company's individual needs, should enhance shareholder wealth. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design <b>management</b> <b>function</b> has a large influence on what the design manager does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a [...] "secondary" [...] organisational process, design management is seen as [...] "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R, and communication. Various authors use different concepts to describe the authority and position of design management; they can be grouped as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe tension towards <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> is all {{the more}} {{fundamental}} in Democratic Member-owned Firms (DMFs), such as co-operatives, as this kind of firm has developed against the ‘conventional’ managerial hierarchy. What show degenerations of DMFs, be it for a business failure or a democratic withdrawal, is the very issue of designing adapted <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> in such firms. This implies to go further than current approaches which mainly rest on ‘conventional’ approaches of <b>management</b> <b>functions.</b> We investigate this issue through in-depth and longitudinal case-studies in two DMFs confronted with the need for transforming their <b>management</b> <b>functions.</b> New perspectives on the management of DMFs emerge from the case-studies. Particularly, linking the design of <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> with correlated “spaces of participation” appears as a way to generate dynamic collective learnings for the business activity management and also to ‘regenerate’ the democratic functioning. We contribute to its theorization, showing the need of an ‘integrative’ and ‘expansive’ vision of management to avoid irreversible degeneration. This also opens new ways to grasp the management issue of linking employee ownership and participation...|$|R

2500|$|Risk {{management}} [...] is {{the process}} of measuring risk and then developing and implementing strategies to manage ("hedge") that risk. Financial risk management, typically, is focused on the impact on corporate value due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and stock prices (market risk). [...] It will also {{play an important role in}} short term cash- and treasury management; see above. [...] It is common for large corporations to have risk management teams; often these overlap with the internal audit function. [...] While it is impractical for small firms to have a formal risk <b>management</b> <b>function,</b> many still apply risk management informally. See also Enterprise risk management.|$|E
