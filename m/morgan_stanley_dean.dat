500|$|Dean Witter's {{corporate}} headquarters {{were located in}} New York City's 2 World Trade Center (i.e. South Tower), where the firm had occupied over [...] since 1985. [...] Dean Witter {{was one of many}} tenants whose offices were evacuated {{as a result of the}} 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which took place during the firm's spinoff from Sears. [...] Following, the firm's merger with Morgan Stanley, the firm's headquarters would be moved to 1585 Broadway on the edge of New York's Time Square. [...] <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Dean</b> Witter would still have a large presence at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.|$|E
500|$|Although Morgan Stanley was {{the more}} {{prominent}} partner, Dean Witter's focus on retail investors, mutual funds and credit cards which were seen by the stock market as generating more stable cash flows than Morgan Stanley's investment banking business, had {{by the time of}} the merger made it the more valuable partner in terms of market capitalization. [...] Dean Witter's CEO, Philip Purcell, the main architect of the merger, became chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the merged group. [...] The merger marked the pairing of a storied investment banking firm with a retail brokerage (that had been owned by a retailer) that was often termed [...] "white shoes and white socks". [...] In order to avoid tension during the integration of the two firms, Purcell and Morgan Stanley's CEO John Mack decided not to choose between the two brand names. Instead, they combined the names of the two firms and put the <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Dean</b> Witter brand on almost all of its operations.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "wealth management" [...] {{occurs at}} least as early as 1933. It came into more general use in the elite retail (or [...] "Private Client") {{divisions}} of firms such as Goldman Sachs or <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> (before the <b>Dean</b> Witter Reynolds merger of 1997), to distinguish those divisions' services from mass-market offerings, but has since spread throughout the financial-services industry. Family offices that had formerly served just one family opened their doors to other families, and the term Multi-family office was coined. Accounting firms and investment advisory boutiques created multi-family offices as well. Certain larger firms (UBS, <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> and Merrill Lynch) have [...] "tiered" [...] their platforms – with separate branch systems and advisor-training programs, distinguishing [...] "Private Wealth Management" [...] from [...] "Wealth Management", with the latter term denoting {{the same type of}} services but with a lower degree of customization and delivered to mass affluent clients. At <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley,</b> the [...] "Private Wealth Management" [...] retail division focuses on serving clients with greater than $20 million in investment assets while [...] "Global Wealth Management" [...] focuses on accounts smaller than $10 million.|$|R
