We {{present a}} methodology {{which aims to}} ease this process by automatically acquiring new translations of medical terms based on word alignment in parallel text corpora, and test it on English and French. After collecting a parallel, English–French corpus, we detected French translations of English terms from three terminologies—MeSH, SNOMED CT and the MedlinePlus Health Topics. We obtained respectively for each terminology 74. 8 %, 77. 8 % and 76. 3 % of linguistically correct new translations. A sample of the MeSH translations was submitted to expert review and 61. 5 % were deemed desirable additions to the French MeSH. In conclusion, we successfully obtained good quality new translations, which underlines the suitability of using alignment in text corpora to help translating terminologies.

The terminology used in Bleach has a variety of inspirations, with each category of characters bearing a different linguistic theme. Many of the names for swords and spells used by Soul Reapers were inspired by ancient Japanese literature. Hollows and Arrancars use Spanish terms. Fullbringers use English vocabulary, with names referencing rock music, and finally, both Quincy and Bounts draw on the German language.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{usability}} of frames for the analysis and representation of specialized language units based on SNOMED Clinical Terms. This <b>multilingual</b> clinical <b>terminology</b> is designed for healthcare professionals and consists of codes, terms, synonyms and definitions for the computer-based coding, retrieval, and analysis of data in clinical documentation and reporting. The terminology {{is based on the}} ontological principles developed by Terminology Science and represents a static ontology based on hierarchical relations. The original (American) English edition has been translated into different languages using a concept-based approach. SNOMED Clinical Terms are in principle not contextualized, which causes translation problems regarding context-dependent and complex terms presupposing terminological domain knowledge and a good understanding of the hierarchical position of concepts within the concept system and the interconceptual (non-hierarchical) relationships. The aim of the present contribution is to discuss in greater detail the potentials of a frame-based methodology for the dynamic representation and definition of SNOMED Clinical Terms in order to support and optimize the translation process. Our approach is inspired by the frame conception as elaborated by Fillmore (1976, 1982 and 1985) and Fillmore and Atkins (1992), and based on terminological frame models developed for representational and heuristic purposes in the domains of healthcare (Martin 1998) and environment (León-Araúz et al. 2012). Starting from the assertion that specialized knowledge units are not isolated entities, but embedded in concrete dynamic situations and events (Faber 2012, León-Araúz et al. 2012), we assume that the conceptual meaning of the clinical terms under investigation is strongly affected by contextual elements and should therefore be defined in relation to the overall semantic event frame in which they are used. The proposed model is supposed (1) to reflect the conceptual organization of the specialized language units under investigation; (2) to elucidate the multidimensionality of the underlying concepts; (3) to provide semantic, syntactic, and combinatory information using multilingual corpora (medical documentation in English, French and Dutch). By means of corpus samples taken from domains with national or cultural variations we will illustrate the usefulness of a frame-based representation for consistent definitions and other issues relevant to the translation of clinical terminology such as concept equivalence, false friends, and terminological variation. status: publishe...|$|R

In order for South Africa to be competitive in the global economy, it will need to develop a workforce with appropriate Information Technology skills. Of necessity, these skills will extend to using a computers and developing appropriate software and technical support skills (DOE, 2008). This thesis represents a critical analytical study in that it explores the online Sesotho Information and Communication Technology (ICT). It aims at analysing terminology development in this area. The study aims to determine how Sesotho and ICT correlate and how the linguistic aspect plays a role in online ICT terminology. The focus is not on creating new terms but to analyze the already existing ICT terms available, with regards to linguistic rules and principles and to critique if they are of quality. Furthermore, the thesis explores whether there are other strategies that can be used in the development of this terminology. It also seeks to determine if the terms are easily accessible to students and if they are used at all. Terms will be sourced from the Department of Arts and Culture ICT term list, and the focus will be on extracting only terms that have to do with computer literacy. Other online sources that list Sesotho equivalents will also be considered. The study also assesses the quality of the terms created by the Department of Arts and Culture (DAC) together with the Department of Communications (DOC) for a <b>multilingual</b> ICT <b>terminology</b> list. Furthermore, the thesis explores whether the Sesotho equivalents adhere to the linguistic rules and principles of the language. The other question asked is whether the terms are used by the intended users and if they are easily accessible to the speakers of the language.

Not only does the thesis engage with computer literacy terminology, it also presents a detailed literature review of studies and work that has been done in this field.

40|$|Translation is {{becoming}} an ever-expanding field of investigation and is attracting increasing interest among scholars from various disciplines and schools of thought. These developments within translation studies reflect the interdisciplinary trend that characterises almost every academic discipline today, cutting across {{all areas of the}} humanities and sciences. This has led to a great breadth and depth of coverage, making plurality and diversity the most prominent features of translation studies today. As a consequence, translation studies and the terminology used to describe it are characterised by a plurality not only of conceptualisations, orientations and applications but also of terminology. Yet, behind this plurality lies unity – the unity of the discipline as a scientific object and as a field of research. The same is true for translation terminology, the main concern of which is the need for standardisation and uniformity with that of <b>multilingual</b> diversity. Translation <b>terminology</b> is the set of units of expression which allow specialised knowledge within the field of translation studies to be represented, acquired, stored, communicated and transferred effectively and unambiguously both intralingually and interlingually. Thus, possessing specialised metalingual competence in the field of translation terminology means knowing how the world of translation is perceived and represented, what the terms mean and how to use them properly. Terminologia della Traduzione is based on the original four-language version, which offers an exhaustive and coherent presentation of the multiple components of translation studies via its terminology in French, English, Spanish and German. Both volumes share a descriptive approach and put into practice the fundamental goals of terminology, namely, to search, select and order the terms used in the various areas of translation studies in order to normalise their form and content for more effective communication. The aims are to provide clear and consistent definitions of the most widely used concepts in translation with particular regard to applied translation studies and to establish the limits between different terms. Terminologia della Traduzione is independent and self-standing within an Italian setting in that the focus is clearly on the terminological resources available in Italian translation studies. At the same time, it follows the general rationale and format of the source text and each entry includes the corresponding terms in the four original languages for reference and comparison. This form of presentation was thought to be the most practical and efficient in guaranteeing a monolingual description of the state of affairs in translation terminology in Italy {{while at the same time}} allowing cross-referencing with a multilingual textbook of corresponding terminology in French, English, Spanish and German...|$|R
