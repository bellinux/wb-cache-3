40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents Galerkin weighted residual Finite-Element Time-Domain (FETD) formulations using a 2 D cylindrical modal non-reflecting {{boundary condition}} (MNRBC) for the modelling of plane wave scattering from cylindrical structures of arbitrary cross-section surrounded by free space. Chapter 1 begins by presenting {{the motivation for}} this work. Key concepts regarding cylindrical geometries are introduced at this stage. The Galerkin weighted residual Finite-Element method is briefly outlined. Chapter 2 presents a novel scattered field FETD-MNRBC formulation for the transverse electric polarisation of a modal non-reflecting boundary condition for plane wave scattering from perfectly electrically conductive (PEC) cylindrical structures of arbitrary cross-section. The boundary condition {{is based on a}} Vector-Fitting (VF) approximation of the boundary kernel appearing in the time-domain formulation. The convolution integral appearing in the time-domain formulation of the boundary condition is calculated recursively using the Vector-Fitting coefficients. Accurate numerical results are shown for the bistatic scattering width (BSW) that validate the approach. Chapter 3 focuses on the VF approximation of the cylindrical boundary kernel. Two approaches are investigated; the so called Vector-Fitting G function approximation (VFG) and the Vector-Fitting U function approximation (VFU). Both approaches produce satisfactory finite-element results with the VFU being more versatile. Chapter 4 presents, for the first time, the total field FETD-MNRBC formulation for both transverse electric and transverse <b>magnetic</b> <b>polarisations.</b> The VFU approach is employed. The structures considered in this chapter are not only PEC cylinders but also dielectric ones of various cross-sections and various values of relative permittivity and permeability. The numerical results demonstrate the good accuracy of this formulation. Chapter 5 combines the cylindrical modal non-reflecting boundary condition with the Floquet theorem and extends this formulation, for the first time, to azimuthally periodic cylinders using scattered and total field time-domain formulations. The advantages and disadvantages of the periodic modal non-reflecting boundary condition approach are discussed and numerical results for the BSW are shown. Chapter 6 presents a novel sparse-matrix scattered field FETD-MNRBC formulation in which the fully dense submatrices associated with the boundary integral are avoided. Through numerical results the accuracy of the proposed formulation is investigated. Chapter 7 concludes the work by summarizing the main achievements and discussing its impact in electromagnetics.

These systems show the simultaneous existence of two or more ferroic orders, and cross-coupling between them, such as <b>magnetic</b> spin, <b>polarisation,</b> ferroelastic ordering, and ferrotoroidicity. Based on the type of ordering and coupling, they have drawn increasing interest for a variety of device applications, such as magnetic field sensors, nonvolatile memory elements, ferroelectric photovoltaics, nanoelectronics etc. Since single-phase materials exist rarely in nature with strong cross-coupling properties, intensive research activity is being pursued towards the discovery of new single-phase multiferroic materials and the design of new engineered materials with strong magneto-electric (ME) coupling. This review article summarises the development of different kinds of multiferroic material: single-phase and composite ceramic, laminated composite and nanostructured thin films.

The object of the survey was to establish an optimum geophysical exploration procedure for the location of the style of mineralisation known at Carrock. The VLF-EM method recorded only weak or indistinct anomalies over much of the known mineralisation but a weak anomaly coincident with the Emerson vein was traced northwards for one km. Several similar linear features were recorded in the area on trends favourable for mineralisation and two, at Poddy Gill in the east and Arm o’ Grain in the west, are coincident for part of their strike with exposed mineralisation. Resistivity measurements indicated that most fault structures have coincident low resistivity zones; a detailed traverse across the Emerson vein showed a minor high resistivity peak within the low zone.

There are significant variations in β over the sky (Δβ≈ 0. 2). We explore the link between the large-scale filaments and the local ISM, using the model of an expanding shell in the solar vicinity. We compared observed polarisation angles with the predictions from the model and found good agreement. This strongly suggests that many large scale filaments and loops are nearby structures. This is important {{in the context of the}} Galactic magnetic field as these structures are normally included in global models, neglecting the fact that they might be local. We also studied the level of contamination added by the diffuse filaments to the CMB polarisation power spectra.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control and {{manipulate}} the state of polarisation of optical signals is becoming an increasingly desirable feature in numerous applications including integrated optical circuits, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) and optical communication systems. This thesis introduces the design, optimisation, fabrication and operation of two novel integrated reciprocal single-section passive polarisation converter devices based upon mode-beating. The converter designs consist of asymmetric profiled waveguides, which were realised in a single reactive ion dry-etch process step. An in-situ custom built sample holder was utilised to place the samples at a predetermined angle to the incoming ions, which resulted in waveguide profiles with sloped sidewalls. This fabrication technique also allowed the incorporation of adiabatic taper sections within the device design. The converter section waveguide profile of the first design consists of two sloped sidewalls. Devices realised on a GaAs/AlGaAs material structure achieved a converted transverse <b>magnetic</b> (TM) <b>polarisation</b> purity of 81. 4 % at a device length of 30 μm for a transverse electric (TE) polarised input signal at an operating wavelength of λ = 1064 nm. The convention used is that TE refers to light polarised in {{the plane of the}} wafer and TM refers to light polarised perpendicular to the plane of the wafer. The total optical loss imposed by this device was evaluated to be 1. 72 dB. This design was also used for the monolithic integration of a passive polarisation converter incorporated within a Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser diode on an unstrained GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well heterostructure material system. A predominantly TM polarised optical output from the converter facet of greater than 80 % is demonstrated for a converter length of 20 μm at an emitting wavelength of 867. 1 nm. The about 1. 4 mm long fabricated device has a current threshold level of 100 mA and a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 25 dB. The second converter design is based on the modification of an already existing stripe waveguide structure. The converter section is defined by applying the above mentioned angled dry-etch process on a certain length of the stripe waveguide. The fabricated asymmetric waveguide core profile consists of a sloped undercut. A TM polarisation purity of 90 % at a device length of 55 μm for a TE polarised input signal at an operating wavelength of λ = 1064 nm was achieved at the output.

Non-volatile magnetic memory is used in data storage devices, such as the hard drives found in personal computers, where data is encoded via the magnetisation state of magnetic domains in the device with one of two states: either up or down (M ↑ or M ↓); the state is determined or changed by interacting with the magnetic flux about the domain. Furthermore, in current computing and sensor technology, logic operations are performed with arrays of transistors; however, in spintronics ("spin transport electronics") the electric current itself is spin polarised and there is data encoded in the current itself. Circuit elements in such a system are magnetic devices that interact with the electron spin. Magnetoelectric multiferroics are materials that have both a spontaneous ferroelectric <b>polarisation</b> (P) and <b>magnetic</b> magnetisation (M). <b>Polarisation</b> may be manipulated by an electric field and magnetisation by a magnetic field, hence the potential of multiferroics lies in the coupling between the two degrees of freedom and the manipulation of magnetisation by an applied electric field and vice versa. The properties of a magnetic device could be altered "on-the-fly" by applying an electric pulse, and {{in the context of the}} examples provided this would greatly diversify the logic elements in spintronic circuits. Furthermore, with both polarisation and magnetisation a multiferroic domain can take on one of four states (M ↑ P ↑, M ↑ P ↓, M ↓ P ↑, or M ↓ P ↓) dramatically increasing data storage density over the current binary system. Lutetium ferrite (LuFe 2 O 4) is a multiferroic material in which both the magnetisation and polarisation arise from the iron sites and with strong iron-iron correlations the material is a promising candidate as a high temperature multiferroic. The material has a layered structure with bilayers of FeO separated by single layers of LuO on a hexagonal lattice. Frustrated 2 D charge order exists below 550 K which transitions to 3 D charge order below 330 K and simultaneously frustrated ferrimagnetic order exists in the multiferroic phase below 250 K. X-ray and neutron scattering experiments have been performed in order to characterise the ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic order and magnetoelectric coupling in this material. Resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) was performed on the Material Science beamline of the Swiss Light Source where the energy dependence of the superlattice reflections corresponding to the charge order was collected. Non-linear regression using a custom Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm was applied in order to extract the anomalous scattering factors which demonstrated the superlattice reflections were described by a charge order model. Furthermore, the chemical shift was shown to correspond to full Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + charge disproportionation. The absence of any polarisation or azimuthal dependence, shown by resonant x-ray scattering data collected on the ID 20 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, confirmed the prediction of Nagano et al. that the orbital moments of the Fe 2 +-sites exist in a disordered glassy state. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) calculations were performed using the FDMNES program in order to assess the validity of the anomalous scattering factors obtained in the RXS experiment and to further test the charge order model. It was shown that the characteristic features of the experimentally determined functions can be qualitatively reproduced by calculations using the known charge order model. Furthermore, these functions were shown to reproduce the phase of the RXS data further demonstrating that the reflections result from a pure charge ordered phase. Inelastic neutron scattering performed on the PUMA triple axis spectrometer of the FRMII demonstrated that magnetic critical scattering is observed at 250 K. A broad peak in the temperature dependence is observed rather than the characteristic divergence of a magnetic transition: this is attributed to broadening of the transition by the distribution of oxygen stoichiometry in the sample and ferroelectric fluctuations integrated into the data due to poor c-axis resolution. Pyroelectric current and magnetometry measurements demonstrate a peak in the magnetic susceptibility and a step in the polarisation at approximately 215 K, well below the magnetic transition. Elastic neutron scattering experiments performed on the E 2 flat cone diffractometer of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin demonstrate these features correspond to a 2 D-to- 3 D magnetic transition that has previously only been predicted by anomalies in other measurements. An applied field study performed by neutron scattering on the E 2 flat cone diffractometer of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin and x-ray scattering on the PX 1 protein crystallography beamline of the Australian synchrotron demonstrate the control of the magnetic domain population with an electric field, contrary to other recent reports on this topic. Furthermore, the observed magnetoelectric coupling is inconsistent with current models of the magnetic structure of this system. The x-ray measurements demonstrate a disorder-to-order effect by the applied electric field as 3 D order is preferred with an increase in the intensity of all satellites. Temperature dependent x-ray powder diffraction data collected on the Powder Diffraction (PD) beamline of the Australian Synchrotron has demonstrated anisotropic thermal expansion with negative thermal expansion of the c-axis in this material. Electron density mapping by Fourier analysis shows the disorder of the oxygen between the electrically static Lu ions and the neighbouring Fe ions, as electron hopping between Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + leading to a corresponding variation on the Fe-O bond length. Reversible structural distortions are observed indicating a piezoelectric effect in this material caused by the crushing during sample preparation. Furthermore, weak reflections in the x-ray patterns, corresponding to a monoclinic sublattice, suggest a monoclinic distortion of the oxygen sites which is supported by neutron powder diffraction collected on the ECHIDNA instrument of the OPAL reactor...|$|R
