5|$|On 15 September 1881, a {{light engine}} and a coal train {{collided}} {{near the mouth}} of Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error. One person was killed and another was severely injured. Bad weather contributed to flooding in the tunnels.

5|$|These {{delays in}} turn {{affected}} the fly-in of 1 RAR, with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO Colombus before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral. Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15:30 to discuss {{aspects of the}} defence, as well as events planned for the following day. The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16:10, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> late. It became clear to Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy {{to the east of}} the FSB, and with just two hours before last light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions, the last of which were not established until 17:00. Due to the hurried deployment, by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their supporting elements were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups, rather than in a co-ordinated defensive position. The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally, yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly—Commanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment—both remained in Bearcat. Hughes was not present either, having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat, and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day.|$|E

30|$|Phenol is an {{environmental}} pollutant; {{the present study}} was conducted to examine the adsorption of phenol by rice straw. For this purpose raw (untreated), physically treated (boiled and dried) and thermally treated (heated at 230  °C for 3  h to produce ash) rice straw were selected to determine phenol removal efficiency at different contact times and adsorbent dosages for 1 and < 1  mm rice straw particles. Residual phenol concentrations were determined by colorimetric method. Highest 84  % of phenol removal was observed for thermally treated < 1  mm rice straw particle. Equilibrium time was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hour.</b> Percentage of removal of phenol increased as the adsorbent dose increase. The removal efficiency increase in the order of: raw rice straw < physically treated < thermally treated (ash) rice straw. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm was developed for 1 and < 1  mm particle size of thermally (ash) treated rice straw. Freundlich isotherm best fit the equilibrium data for 1  mm thermally treated rice straw. The results showed that thermally treated rice straw (ash) can be developed as a potential adsorbent for phenol removal from aqueous solution.|$|R

25|$|Lack {{of access}} to water supply and {{sanitation}} has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women and girls who have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara is more than an hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> before they can get water.|$|E
