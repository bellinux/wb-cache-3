40|$|In a {{follow-up}} installment in 1839 to the anonymously authored Recollections of Slavery by a Runaway Slave, the narrator testifies that a Charleston slave speculator known as "Major Ross" had sold his brother. The narrator notes that Ross lives in "a nice little white house, {{on the right}} hand side of King street as you go in from the country towards the market. " The right-hand side? Was that level of precision necessary? Because people challenged the veracity of slave narratives {{at the time they}} were published, details mattered very much. But the level of specificity in this instance caught my eye. The facts were borne out: property records in the Charleston County Register <b>Mesne</b> <b>Conveyance</b> Deeds office show that in 1831, a James L. Ross, known also as "Major Ross," purchased a house situated {{on the west side of}} King Street, just a few blocks north of the market. If you were entering the city of Charleston from the country, Ross' house would indeed have been on the right-hand side (fig 1). And so it comes down to that. In order to prove his own humanity, the truth about the human capacity for cruelty, and the very reputation of abolitionist crusaders of the American Anti-Slavery Society, this survivor made his story unassailable by giving the correct location for the speculator's house on King Street in Charleston...|$|E

"No doubt, sir; and I advise Mr. Effingham to send you, his agent, {{to every}} man, {{woman and child}} in the county, with the Patent of the King, all the <b>mesne</b> <b>conveyances</b> and wills, in your pocket, in order that you may read them at length to each individual, with a view that every man, woman and child, may be {{satisfied}} {{that he or she}} is not the owner of Edward Effingham's lands!" ...|$|R
50|$|Bicknell v. Comstock, 113 U.S. 149 (1885), was {{an action}} {{to recover the}} cost paid for a tract of land in Iowa {{and the value of}} the {{improvements}} made by the defendant. The complaint alleged a conveyance by Bicknell to one Bennett, the subsequent transfer to the defendant by sundry <b>mesne</b> <b>conveyances,</b> valuable improvements on the premises made by Bennett and his grantees, and a failure of title in Bicknell when the deed was made by reason of a superior title in the State of Iowa under a land grant. Judgment below for plaintiff, to reverse which this writ of error was brought.|$|R
500|$|Certification {{having been}} declined, the Fourth Circuit, again en banc, held 4-2 {{that the statute}} of {{limitations}} did not bar the tribe's claim, finding that there was a presumption of possession within the 10 year limitations period. [...] In other words, the court held that the Catawba's claim would only be time-barred as to defendants who were able to demonstrate adverse possession, without tacking except by inheritance. [...] Thus, the court would look for a continuous ten-year period of possession for each defendant land-owner for the period between July 12, 1962 (the date of termination) and October 28, 1980 (the filing of the complaint). [...] Further, the court rejected the defendant's other affirmative defense that the claim was not recorded in South Carolina's Registry of <b>Mesne</b> <b>Conveyances</b> and challenge to the jurisdiction of the court. [...] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari after this ruling.|$|R
5000|$|After these events, on September 25, 1878, the {{original}} bill {{in this case}} was filed by Mrs. Flagg against Walker, Sibley, Weed, the trustee, and her husband, William F. Flagg. It alleged that since the conveyances made by her husband to Walker in February 1875, the former had by <b>mesne</b> <b>conveyances</b> transferred and conveyed to her [...] "all his interest, right, and title in and to said real estate above mentioned," [...] referring to the real estate conveyed by Flagg to Walker, [...] "and all personal property appertaining thereto, or that went into the hands of Samuel Walker." [...] The bill set out the transfer to Walker by Flagg and his wife of the real and personal estate of Flagg, and in reference thereto made the following averments:"That the said deeds were intended by said William F. Flagg and [...] to secure the said Samuel Walker for his advances to be made by him, as above set forth, and as a further security for a reasonable compensation to be paid to him for the rendition of such services, and that he might out of the sale of a portion of said property be reimbursed for such advances and compensation. It was also agreed [...] [...] [...] that when the purpose for which such conveyance had been made was fully completed, the said Samuel Walker was to reconvey to William F. Flagg, or to oratrix, as they might elect at least one-half of the property remaining unsold and undisposed of, and should keep for himself and for his compensation a portion of said lands, not exceeding one-half of the residue, after payment of all debts." ...|$|R
