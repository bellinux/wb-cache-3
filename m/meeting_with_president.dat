5|$|Reinfeldt visited Washington, D.C. on 15 May 2007, <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Bush. His trip also {{included}} meetings with others, including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. This {{is his first}} visit to the United States since becoming Prime Minister in 2006. Bush and Reinfeldt mostly discussed climate change and free trade, focusing on the Doha Round. He visited President Barack Obama at first the White House and then in the Metropolitan Museum of Art on 23 September 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E

5|$|After World War II ended, del Valle {{was ordered}} back to Headquarters Marine Corps, {{where he was}} named Inspector General, a {{position}} which he held until he retired on January 1, 1948. On February 19, 1946 New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez and del Valle held a <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Harry S. Truman in the White House, in which Chavez recommended del Valle for the position of governor of Puerto Rico. From 1898 to 1942, the governors of the island were officials appointed by the President of the United States. Local Puerto Rican politicians, such as Luis Muñoz Marín, opposed the naming of del Valle in favor of Jesús T. Piñero; to which del Valle eventually asked President Truman to withdraw his name among those considered for the position. The first civilian and native Puerto Rican appointed governor of Puerto Rico thus became Piñero in 1946. If Congress had not approved legislation in 1947 allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor, del Valle may have been appointed to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to see the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, amidst heavy {{fighting}} in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, General Ngô Quang Trưởng flew out to Saigon for a <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. In this meeting, President Thiệu outlined his decision to abandon most of the provinces in I Corps Tactical Zone, and ordered General Trưởng to withdraw his forces towards the coastal regions of central Vietnam instead. In addition, the Airborne Division (South Vietnam) would be redeployed to the Mekong Delta region, where it could protect the nation's capital. Unwilling to concede the northern provinces to the enemy, General Trưởng tried unsuccessfully to convince President Thiệu to reverse his decision {{in the belief that}} he could hold onto I Corps, and recapture lost territories by using the Airborne and Marine Corps Divisions. After he returned to his headquarters that afternoon, General Trưởng decided to redeploy his forces instead of carrying out President Thiệu's order straightaway, for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to convince the President that most South Vietnamese units were still intact, and that they still had the time to recapture lost territories. And secondly, General Trưởng did not want to create confusion amongst his subordinates, when the military situation in I Corps was still under control.|$|E

25|$|A. Philip Randolph came to {{national}} attention {{as the leader}} of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Randolph proposed a march on Washington, D.C. to protest racial discrimination in the U.S. Armed Forces. <b>Meeting</b> <b>with</b> <b>President</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Oval Office, Randolph respectfully, politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that Negroes would march in the capital unless desegregation would occur.
