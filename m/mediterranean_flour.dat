40|$|The endosymbiotic {{bacterium}} Wolbachia pipientis manipulates host reproduction by rendering infected males reproductively {{incompatible with}} uninfected females (cytoplasmic incompatibility; CI). CI {{is believed to}} occur {{as a result of}} Wolbachia-induced modifications to sperm during maturation, which prevent infected sperm from initiating successful zygote development when fertilizing uninfected females' eggs. However, the mechanism by which CI occurs has been little studied outside the genus Drosophila. Here, we show that in the sperm heteromorphic <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth, Ephestia kuehniella, infected males transfer fewer fertile sperm at mating than uninfected males. In contrast, non-fertile apyrene sperm are not affected. This indicates that Wolbachia may only affect fertile sperm production and highlights the potential of the Lepidoptera as a model for examining the mechanism by which Wolbachia induces CI in insects...|$|E

Patch residence times were typically greater than 24 h. The probability of remaining on the patch was greatest on mullein and tomato, followed by chrysanthemum and least on pepper, whereas probability of remaining on the patch was greatest when flour moth eggs were present, and least when no prey were available. Patch residence time in D. hesperus was determined by both the prey, and the species of plant, in an independent fashion.

This behavior turned arrhythmic in P. interpunctella females in constant darkness (DD) and remained arrhythmic in constant light (LL), whereas E. kuehniella females showed a persistent rhythm in DD and {{suppression of the}} behavior in LL, indicating regulation by a circadian clock mechanism. The rhythm of male locomotor activity corresponded well with the sexual activity of females, reaching the peak at dusk in P. interpunctella and at dawn in E. kuehniella.

It is shown that the duration of egg laying behaviour decreases exponentially from the first host egg encountered onwards. This decreasing kinetic, which corresponds to a learning ability, shows a high variability between females, but a mother-daughter r gression analysis fails to demonstrate any genetic transmissibility of this learning ability over 2 successive generations. Once the learning is over, there remains aresidual variability which is, in part, under genetic control.

A phylogenetic study of the Lepidoptera based on complete mitochondrial genomes places E. kuehniella correctly in the family Pyralidae and supports major lepidopteran taxa as phylogenetic clades. The W chromosome of E. kuehniella is an exceptionally rich reservoir of originally mitochondrial sequences (numts). Around 0. 7 % of the W DNA {{was found to be}} of mitochondrial origin, 83 % of the mitogenome sequence was represented between 1 - 11 × in the W chromosome.

40|$|Enterococcus mundtii strains {{isolated}} from the larval feces of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth Ephestia kuehniella show antimicrobial activity against {{a broad spectrum of}} Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro probiotic characterization of one isolate revealed a high auto-aggregation score, a hydrophilic cell surface, tolerance for low pH, no hemolytic activity, and susceptibility to all tested antibiotics. We used the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, an established model organism, for the in vivo characterization of one probiotic E. mundtii isolate from E. kuehniella larvae. Tribolium castaneum larvae were fed orally with the probiotic isolate or the corresponding supernatant and then infected with either the entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis or Pseudomonas entomophila. Larvae exposed to the isolate or the supernatant showed increased survival following infection with B. thuringiensis but not P. entomophila. Heat treatment or treatment with proteinase K reduced the probiotic effect of the supernatant. However, the increased resistance attracts a fitness penalty manifested as a shorter lifespan and reduced fertility.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the characterization of}} a trypsin inhibitor from Poincianella pyramidalis seeds (PpyTI). The partial sequencing of PpyTI revealed homology to Kunitz inhibitors, clustered {{as a member of}} Family 103 in MEROPS database. PpyTI has a single polypeptide chain of 19, 042 Da and presents stability at high temperatures (up to 70 degrees C) and a wide range of pH. In vitro assays showed that disulfide bridges have an important stabilization role of reactive site in PpyTI, a characteristic shared among several Kunitz inhibitors. Bioassays carried out with the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth (Anagasta kuehniella) revealed a significant decrease in both larval weight and survival of PpyTI-fed larvae, besides a larval stage extension. Through biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that the PpyTI insecticide effects were triggered by digestion process commitment, through the inhibition of trypsin and chymotrypsin activities, the major digestive enzymes in this species. The insecticide effects and biochemical characterization of PpyTI encourage further studies using this inhibitor for insect pest control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Mass rearing of Orius laevigatus on non-insect foods could {{substantially}} {{increase the}} cost-effectiveness {{of the production}} of this biological control agent which is largely based {{on the use of}} expensive eggs of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth Ephestia kuehniella. In this study, the effect of substrate quality and predator density on nymphal development of O. laevigatus fed on E. kuehniella eggs, honeybee pollen or an egg yolk based artificial diet was assessed using several types of substrates as shelter materials in the rearing containers (wax paper, bean pod or no extra substrate). In general, E. kuehniella eggs proved to be a nutritionally superior food compared to pollen and artificial diet. Pollen supported nymphal development of O. laevigatus better than the artificial diet. Overall, increasing nymphal density resulted in higher mortality, which may be due in part to cannibalism. The addition of a bean pod compensated for the nutritionally suboptimal artificial, but had a negative effect when O. laevigatus was fed on pollen. The non-insect foods tested could not adequately replace lepidopteran eggs as a food source for O. laevigatus but they may be useful as an alternative food or {{in a part of the}} rearing process...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the insecticidal effect of labramin, a protein that shows lectin-like properties. Labramin was isolated from seeds of the Beach Apricot tree, Labramia bojeri A. DC ex Dubard (Ericales: Sapotaceae), and assessed against {{the development of the}} <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), an important pest of stored products such as corn, wheat, rice, and flour. Results showed that labramin caused 90 % larval mortality when incorporated in an artificial diet at a level of 1 % (w/w). The presence of 0. 25 % labramin in the diet affected the larval and pupal developmental periods and the percentage of emerging adults. Treatments resulted in elevated levels of trypsin activity in midgut and fecal materials, indicating that labramin may have affected enzyme-regulatory mechanisms by perturbing peritrophic membranes in the midgut of E. kuehniella larvae. The results of dietary experiments with E. kuehniella larvae showed a reduced efficiency for the conversion of ingested and digested food, and an increase in approximate digestibility and metabolic cost.

40|$|Wolbachia {{is known}} as the causative agent of various {{reproductive}} alterations in arthropods. The almond moth Cadra cautella is doubly infected with A- and B-group Wolbachia and expresses complete cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth Ephestia kuehniella carries A-group Wolbachia and expresses partial CI. In the present study, the Wolbachia in C. cautella was transferred to E. kuehniella from which the original Wolbachia had been removed. We obtained transfected lines of three different infection states: single infection with A, single infection with B, and double infection with A and B. The doubly transfected lines and those transfected with only A produced exclusively female progeny. Two lines of evidence suggested that the sex ratio distortion was due to male killing. First, reduced egg hatch rate was observed. Second, removal of the Wolbachia from the transfected lines resulted in the recovery of a normal sex ratio of approximately 1 : 1. The occurrence of male killing following transfection showed that host factors influence the determination of the reproductive phenotype caused by Wolbachia. The transfected E. kuehniella males carrying exclusively B-group Wolbachia expressed partial incompatibility when crossed with the uninfected females. In addition, the transfected lines were bidirectionally incompatible with the naturally infected strain, which was the first demonstration of bidirectional CI in a lepidopteran...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that mating disruption (MD) successfully reduces population densities of stored product moths, for example, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). However, practical issues, such as finding control plots, replication, and lack of similarity between replicates, often incur problems in full-scale investigations and often draw focus from the added results. We here present results from long-term monitoring of E. kuehniella populations in two similar flourmills in Poland, one treated with pheromone for MD and one left untreated and used as control. Pheromone-mediated MD was applied during 2 years. Thirty pheromone dispensers (one per 100 m(3) factory volume), each releasing about 2 mg (Z,E) - 9, 12 -tetradecadienyl acetate per day, were used. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the moth populations in the MD mill and in a nearby untreated mill. The reduction in trap catch during the MD treatment was about 90 % or more, compared with the untreated mill or pre-treatment periods of the MD mill. The reduction was larger during the 2 nd year of MD than during the 1 st year. These results contribute to the picture that MD is an effective method to control moth species infesting stored products...|$|E

Essential oils from three species of plants were obtained by Clevenger-type water distillation. The major compounds in these essential oils were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and their insecticidal activity was tested against adults of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and the bean weevil Acanthoscelides obtectus Say (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). While the major compound found in oregano and savory was carvacrol, the main constituent of the myrtle was linalool. Among the tested insects, A. obtectus was the most tolerant species against the essential oils. However, the insecticidal activity of the myrtle oil was more pronounced than other oils tested against A. obtectus adults. The essential oils of oregano and savory were highly effective against P. interpunctella and E. kuehniella, with 100 % mortality obtained after 24 h at 9 and 25 µl/l air for P. interpunctella and E. kuehniella, respectively.

Cultured in the optimized medium, P. temperata K 122 cells aged 32 h exhibited 51 % growth inhibition at a concentration of 9 × 108 cells/ml. However, culture must be prolonged up to 48 h incubation in the proteose peptone medium to reach only 28. 6 % inhibition. At the same concentration, no adult emergence was observed {{in the case of}} larvae feeding on wheat flour treated with the whole culture of P. temperata K 122 after physical lysis. Interestingly, P. temperata K 122 cells in the viable but non culturable (VBNC) state retained the same toxicity level as the culturable cells. At a high concentration of 12 × 108 cells/ml, 100 % mortality of E. kuehniella larvae could be reached. Insect mortality is due to toxaemia as confirmed by the absence of Variants small colony (Vsm) or P. temperata colonies in E. kuehniella tissue. The investigation of the histopathological effect of P. temperata toxins on the gut of infected E. kuehniella larvae showed destruction of the gut epithelium, appearance of large cavities and cellular disintegration.

In order to leam the effect of mass rearing conditions on the reproduction of E. kuehniella, four groups of adult moths were studied: (i) isolated couples which were allowed to mate freely during all adult life, and which were not fed; (ii) isolated couples which mated freely and were fed with honey; (iii) couples that mated once and were not fed; (iv) virgins and were not fed. Differences between groups regarding weight, longevity, copulating behaviour, fecundity, fertility and number of spermatophores were evaluated. Females were heavier than males. Males and virgin females lived significantly longer than mated females. The oviposition was mainly concentrated in the first three days of the females lifetime (70 - 90 % laying eggs). A high percentage (88 %) of copulations occured within five hours before dawn.

The experiments were conducted in the Czech Republic, Greece and Italy during 2007 and 2008 in storage facilities that varied in their size and type, and included flour mills, retail stores, storage rooms with currants and raw grain stores. After a summer pre-treatment monitoring period to assess moth population in, dispensers containing TDA were placed in the fall. Adjacent facilities without dispensers were used as control units. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the population fluctuation of the pyralid moths during the entire experimental periods. The presence of MD dispensers notably reduced the number of adults found in the traps in comparison with control rooms.

The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate the chemical composition and fumigant toxicity of essential oil from Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam. against the eggs, larvae, and adults of E. kuehniella. All toxicity tests were carried out under laboratory conditions set at 26 ± 1 °C and 70 % relative humidity (RH). The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis indicated that the essential oil extracted from the leaves of Z. clinopodioides, is rich in pulegone (49. 4 %), piperitenone (10. 7 %), menthone (8. 9 %), and 1, 8 -cineol (6. 9 %). Based on the bioassay results, the LC 50 value of the tested oil was estimated to be 54. 61 μl · l− 1 air for larvae and 1. 39 μl · l− 1 air for adults. Also, it is shown that increasing the oil concentration resulted in a significant increase in oviposition deterrency as well as a considerable reduction in the egg hatching percentage.

Small rooted plants of Spanish pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. 'Creta', long red) served as oviposition substrate and moisture source. In all treatments, total fecundity, oviposition period and female longevity of O. laevigatus were {{greater than that of}} O. albidipennis. When a diet of E. kuehniella eggs was supplemented with pollen, total fecundity of O. albidipennis was increased by about 40 %. Female O. albidipennis fed only pollen laid five times less eggs than those fed flour moth eggs and pollen; also, longevity of females was shorter when only pollen was offered as food. Fecundity {{and longevity}} of O. laevigatus were not influenced when supplementing a diet of E. kuehniella eggs with pollen. Females of O. laevigatus receiving only pollen reduced egg production by about 60 % but had a similar longevity as those receiving a diet including flour moth eggs. In either species, preoviposition period and egg hatch were not affected by diet. The ability of both anthocorids to use pollen as an alternative or additional food is discussed in relation to their practical use in integrated control programmes...|$|E
40|$|BUPM 95 is a Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain {{producing}} the Vip 3 Aa 16 toxin with an interesting insecticidal activity against the Lepidopteran larvae Ephestia kuehniella. Study of different {{steps in the}} mode of action of this Vegetative Insecticidal Protein on the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth (E. kuehniella) was carried out in the aim to investigate the origin of the higher susceptibility of this insect to Vip 3 Aa 16 toxin compared to that of the Egyptian cotton leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis. Using E. kuehniella gut juice, protoxin proteolysis generated a major band corresponding to the active toxin and another band of about 22 kDa, whereas the activation of Vip 3 Aa 16 by S. littoralis gut juice proteases generated less amount of the 62 kDa active form and three other proteolysis products. As demonstrated by zymogram analysis, the difference in proteolysis products was due to the variability of proteases in the two gut juices larvae. The study of the interaction of E. kuehniella BBMV with biotinylated Vip 3 Aa 16 showed that this toxin bound to a putative receptor of 65 kDa compared to the 55 and 100 kDa receptors recognized in S. littoralis BBMV. The histopathological observations demonstrated similar damage caused by the toxin in the two larvae midguts. These results demonstrate that the step of activation, mainly, is at the origin of the difference of susceptibility of these two larvae towards B. thuringiensis Vip 3 Aa 16 toxi...|$|E
30|$|In February 2012, the Hilbeck’s group {{published}} a further study (Hilbeck et al. 2012), {{in response to}} the 2010 publication of the Romeis group. They accused the Romeis group of using a different test method and this method was the reason for the difference in the results. They mentioned that combining the test methods from both groups showed that Bt toxin can indeed have a harmful effect on two-spot ladybird larvae. The result of Hilbeck’s group (Schmidt et al. 2009) was obtained by feeding ladybird larvae on eggs of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> moth, Ephestia kuehniella that had been sprayed with Bt toxin solutions at different concentrations. They then found a higher mortality rate among the treated larvae compared to the control group. Romeis group examined ladybird larvae under the microscope and found that the larvae only suck the contents of the eggs and do not eat even a part of the egg shell which was sprayed with the Bt toxin (Alvarez-Alfageme et al. 2010). Consequently, the larvae are not exposed to the Bt toxin. In 2012 paper, Hilbeck’s group also observed ladybird larvae under the microscope and mentioned that the larvae bite into the eggs and when the contents spill out they come into contact with the egg shell sprayed with the toxin (Hilbeck et al. 2012). However, they added that in the field, ladybird larvae are only be exposed to potentially harmful quantities of Bt toxins if the feed on Bt corn pollen or on prey, except aphids, accumulate Bt toxins; aphids only suck plant sap which does not contain Bt toxin.|$|E
