50|$|In 2007, {{its mandate}} was {{extended}} to include the Commission's 2007-2013 Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013 (CIP) and the <b>Marco</b> <b>Polo</b> <b>Programme</b> 2007-2013. It was also renamed EACI. In practice, {{this meant that the}} bulk of the Agency's work was split into three programmes from other DGs. It continued working on IEE. The agency then also became involved in the operations of the Eco-Innovation programme, which is overseen by DG Energy and provides assistance to pre-market environmental products. It also handled parts of the <b>Marco</b> <b>Polo</b> <b>programme,</b> which works to shift road haulage to rail and water transport, and was managed by DG Mobility and Transport.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Marco</b> <b>Polo</b> <b>programme</b> of the European Commission aims {{to shift}} or avoid freight {{transport}} off the roads to other more environmentally friendly transport modes. The programme is implemented through yearly calls for proposals. The proposals received to each call are selected for financial support inter alia {{on the basis}} of their merits in terms of environmental and social benefits. The evaluation of each proposal's merits in terms of environmental and social benefits is based on the external costs for each transport mode. On the Commission’s request the Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) modified and updated the methodology underlying the calculation of external costs and the software application that automates the estimation of the impact on external costs for specific projects. The work was based on a combination of data and model results that allow the estimation of transport volumes, fleet mixes, levels of utilisation and resulting externalities with up-to-date methodologies for the economic valuation of these externalities. The new external cost methodology and calculator covers road, rail, inland waterways and short sea shipping. External cost coefficients are provided for environmental impacts (air quality, noise, climate change) and socio-economic impacts (accidents, congestion). The methodology permits the estimation of external cost coefficients for specific mode subcategories based on fuel technology, cruising speed, vehicle size, and cargo type. JRC.

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{overview}} of relevant market definition in the sea transport sector. The author examines the sea transport sector {{through the eyes of}} Article 82 EC and its inherent concept of relevant market definition. Two main questions are answered in this thesis: 1) How is the relevant market in the sea transport sector defined in EC competition law? 2) What must shipping companies take into consideration when defining it? The Community’s goal for the future of EC maritime trade is to – {{with the help of the}} <b>Marco</b> <b>Polo</b> <b>programme</b> –shift billions of tonnes kilometres from land transport services to sea transport services making transport in the Community more environmentally sound. The shifting consists of tens of per cent of tonnes kilometres which will naturally increase the frequency and thus importance of sea transport. It is the author’s view that along with this increase in sea borne trade will follow an increased amount of cases before the Commission, the Community Courts with regard to shipping and competition. Due to this future increase and due to the lack of Community case law on relevant market definition as regards the sea transport sector, the author’s finds that there is an acute need for an analysis with regard to this area. The thesis encompasses both relevant product market definition and relevant geographic market definition and encompasses six chapters. The first four chapters offer the reader an introduction to the concept of competition, {{an overview of}} competition law in the EC especially with regard to relevant market definition. The fifth chapter shows how the relevant market may be defined in the sea transport sector by examining how relevant markets have been defined in the case law of the Community Courts and how this market has been assessed by the Commission. The discussion is both analytical as well as speculative. The study ends with conclusions in chapter six...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Marco</b> <b>Polo</b> <b>Programme</b> in the EU was {{launched}} in 2003 to stimulate modal shift from trucks to trains or ships. There may be potential for similar programmes in the passenger sector, given the implementation of dynamic Model Shift Policies (MSPs) in the logistics sector. This thesis {{will focus on the}} question: ‘What is an effective MSP from the car to public transport in the passenger sector in South Korea?’, ‘What is the best combination of MSPs?’, and ‘What factors influence the transport mode choice of commuters?” The main MSPs considered in this thesis are: 1) the commuting cost subsidy for public transport users, 2) additional parking fees for car users, and 3) the congestion charges for car users. In order to investigate the relative effectiveness of these policies, stated preference data were obtained from 767 respondents, who work in the Gangnam area of Seoul, through an online survey that took place in early 2013. A full factorial design was used for the purpose of the survey to estimate the main effects and interactions without correlation. Various binary standard logit models with alternative-specific, generic and covariate variables were developed to identify the effectiveness of MSP and understand what factors affect people’s mode choice decisions. In order to overcome limitations of standard logit by allowing for random taste variation, mixed logit models are developed. In addition, through various models both without and with interaction terms, the modal shift effects of the combined MSPs, as well as single MSP, are compared. According to the change of allocation ratio of two combined MSPs (e. g. subsidy 0 % : parking 100 % ? subsidy 10 % : parking 90 %), the market share of travel mode was also evaluated to understand interaction terms. This research offers numerical evidence of negative modal shift synergy effect for three combinations of MSP. With a view to forecasting the modal shift effects of socio-economic groups and a more deep understanding of the characteristics of each group, the segmentation methods were used. An equity impact analysis of MSPs has been conducted to obtain the Compensating Variation Per Person (CVPP). In addition, the ratio of the CVPP to the average income of each income group is calculated to judge whether each MSP is a progressive or regressive policy. The expenditure and revenue of MSPs are calculated. In addition, how revenue from MSPs should be spent in order to achieve a better transport system is considered...|$|E
