50|$|There {{appears to}} be some general {{requirements}} for formation. Barrier island systems develop most easily on wave-dominated coasts with a small to moderate tidal range. Coasts are classified into three groups based on tidal range: <b>microtidal,</b> 0-2 meter tidal range; mesotidal, 2-4 meter tidal range; and macrotidal, >4 meter tidal range. Barrier islands tend to form primarily along <b>microtidal</b> coasts, where {{they tend to be}} well developed and nearly continuous. They are less frequently formed in mesotidal coasts, where they are typically short with tidal inlets common. Barrier islands are very rare along macrotidal coasts. Along with a small tidal range and a wave-dominated coast, there must be a relatively low gradient shelf. Otherwise, sand accumulation into a sandbar would not occur and instead would be dispersed throughout the shore. An ample sediment supply is also a requirement for barrier island formation. The last major requirement for barrier island formation is a stable sea level. It is especially important for sea level to remain relatively unchanged during barrier island formation and growth. If sea level changes are too drastic, time will be insufficient for wave action to accumulate sand into a dune, which will eventually become a barrier island through aggradation. The formation of barrier islands requires a constant sea level so that waves can concentrate the sand into one location.|$|E
50|$|Cape Espenberg, located 40 km east of a {{pronounced}} easterly deflection in the coast, is the depositional sink of a 200 km long littoral transport system fostered by a dominant west to northwest wind regime. Due to an abundant offshore source, sandy barrier islands front {{most of the}} northwest facing Seward Peninsula from Bering Strait into Kotzebue Sound, enclosing several extensive lagoons. The Chukchi Sea is <b>microtidal</b> < 50 cm, and the prevailing westerly currents maintain a series of widely spaced offshore bars that typically damp onshore wave energy. Storm surges occur with some regularity in the fall, with the extreme events, attaining a maximum elevation of 3 to 4 meter.|$|E
50|$|Washdyke Lagoon is {{a coastal}} lake, ‘choked’ type lagoon {{as it is}} {{separated}} from the sea by a built-up bar, and has only minimal tidal input (<5% of total tidal impact to coast within the lagoon). Lagoons of this type usually form along high energy, <b>microtidal</b> coastlines, have high ratio of fresh to salt water and rarely open to the ocean. This type of lagoon differs from more ‘open’ lagoons which {{are open to the}} ocean through one or more channels, have a lower percentage of fresh water and form directly at the end of large river mouths. Lagoons form when longshore transport builds up sediment across the mouth of a water source cutting it off or diverting it from directly reaching the ocean. In order for a lagoon to form the barrier needs both a coarse and fine sediment source, the fines usually from longshore transport offshore and the coarse usually from transport of sediment from river mouths. The barriers created rely on the accretion of sediment to at least equal the rate of erosion in order for the lagoon to remain separate from the ocean. This balance is also effected by sea level changes, rising causing the barrier to be overtopped and falling allowing a smaller barrier keep the lagoon separate.|$|E
40|$|Tidal {{range is}} a master factor {{governing}} the differences in physico-chemical and biological characteristics between <b>microtidal</b> (2 m) estuaries, which, for convenience, thus include mesotidal estuaries (2 – 4 m). <b>Microtidal</b> estuaries differ from macrotidal estuaries in geomorphology, tidal water movements, salinity regimes, residence times, turbidity, sedimentology and intertidal area. Consequently, their phytoplankton, microphytobenthos and macrophytes communities differ in biomass and production, areal extent, distribution patterns and composition. Mesozooplankton comprise predominantly autochthonous species in <b>microtidal</b> estuaries and allochthonous species in macrotidal estuaries. Meiobenthos in <b>microtidal</b> estuaries have greater densities in subtidal than intertidal areas and species persist along the estuary. Macrobenthos is dominated by small deposit-feeding species in <b>microtidal</b> estuaries, whereas macrotidal estuaries contain some larger species and suspension feeders. Species richness and abundance of estuarine-resident fish species and the contributions of diving piscivorous birds and wading invertebrate-feeding birds are greater in <b>microtidal</b> estuaries. As paradigms regarding estuarine ecology have been based mainly on northern hemisphere macrotidal systems, this review has redressed this imbalance by detailing the extent of differences between <b>microtidal</b> and macrotidal estuaries. In particular, it uses data and case studies for southern hemisphere <b>microtidal</b> systems {{to demonstrate that the}} physico-chemical characteristics and ecology of the main flora and fauna of <b>microtidal</b> estuaries are frequently not consistent with those paradigms...|$|E

40|$|Runoff from {{an extreme}} storm on 22 March 2010 led, {{during the next}} 3 months, to the {{formation}} of a pronounced halocline and underlying hypoxia in {{the upper reaches of the}} <b>microtidal</b> Swan–Canning Estuary. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled between January 2010 and October 2011 at five sites along 10 km of this region. By mid-April, the number of species, total density, Simpson’s evenness index and taxonomic distinctness had declined markedly, crustaceans had disappeared and the densities of annelids and molluscs had declined slightly. These faunal attributes (except Simpson’s index) and species composition did not recover until after the end of the hypoxia. The survival of annelids and loss of crustaceans in this period reflects different sensitivities of these taxa to severe environmental stress.

40|$|Salt marshes {{are valued}} for their {{ecosystem}} services, and their vulnerability is typically assessed through biotic and abiotic measurements at individual {{points on the}} landscape. However, lateral erosion can lead to rapid marsh loss as marshes build vertically. Marsh sediment budgets represent a spatially integrated measure of competing constructive and destructive forces: a sediment surplus may result in vertical growth and/or lateral expansion, while a sediment deficit may result in drowning and/or lateral contraction. Here we show that sediment budgets of eight <b>microtidal</b> marsh complexes consistently scale with areal unvegetated/vegetated marsh ratios (UVVR) suggesting these metrics are broadly applicable indicators of <b>microtidal</b> marsh vulnerability. All sites are exhibiting a sediment deficit, with half the sites having projected lifespans of less than 350 years at current rates of sea-level rise and sediment availability.

Both were experimentally fertilized for six years with varying levels of N and P. For unfertilized, N and NPK treatments, average yearly CO 2 emissions (which represent only respiration) at the <b>microtidal</b> marsh (13, 19, and 28 mmoles CO 2 m(- 2) hr(- 1), respectively) were higher than at the macrotidal marsh (12, 15, and 19 mmoles m(- 2) hr(- 1), respectively, with a flux under the additional high N/low P treatment of 21 mmoles m(- 2) hr(- 1)). Response of CH 4 to fertilization was more variable. At the macrotidal marsh average yearly fluxes were 1. 29, 1. 26, and 0. 77 μmol CH 4 m(- 2) hr(- 1) with control, N, and NPK treatments, respectively and 1. 21 μmol m(- 2) hr(- 1) under high N/low P treatment. At the <b>microtidal</b> marsh CH 4 fluxes were 0. 23, 0. 16, and - 0. 24 μmol CH 4 m(- 2) hr(- 1) in control, N, and NPK and treatments, respectively. Fertilization changed soils from sinks to sources of N 2 O. Average yearly N 2 O fluxes at the macrotidal marsh were - 0. 07, 0. 08, and 1. 70, μmol N 2 O m(- 2) hr(- 1) in control, N, NPK and treatments, respectively and 0. 35 μmol m(- 2) hr(- 1) under high N/low P treatment.

Our results indicate that N 2 O fluxes are likely to vary with the source of pollutant nutrients but emissions will be lower if N is not accompanied by an adequate supply of P (e. g., atmospheric deposition vs sewage or agricultural runoff). With chronic fertilization the global warming potential of the increased N 2 O emissions may be enough to offset the global cooling potential of the C sequestered by salt marshes...|$|E
30|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that, despite their many valuable ecosystem services (Costanza et al. 1997; Creighton et al. 2015; Sheaves et al. 2015), temperate estuaries {{are the most}} degraded of all aquatic ecosystems (Jackson et al. 2001). <b>Microtidal</b> systems, i.e. those with a tidal range < 2  m, located in Mediterranean climate regions are particularly susceptible to degradation, due to their limited tidal water movement, highly seasonal rainfall and, in some cases, ephemeral connection to the ocean (Potter et al. 2010; Tweedley et al. 2016). These characteristics increase the residency time {{of water in the}} estuary and facilitate the trapping of fine sediments and contaminants (Patchineelam et al. 1999; Tweedley et al. 2016). Given the ‘natural susceptibility’ of <b>microtidal</b> estuaries, such as those in south-western Australia, to environmental degradation and the effects on these systems of increased urbanisation and eutrophication, it is unsurprising that the environmental health of some of these systems has been shown to have declined since the 1980 s (Wildsmith et al. 2009; Tweedley et al. 2012, 2014).|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{suspended}} sediment concentration properties has been undertaken in a predominately <b>microtidal</b> estuary using an in situ profiling instrument package comprising a LISST- 100 particle sizer and SeaBird CTD. This novel instrumentation arrangement permitted the simultaneous sampling of temperature, conductivity, pressure, transmissiometry and particle volume concentration (as {{a function of}} particle size) during profiling operations.

The second was associated with inflow, which was found to have high concentrations of fine particles whose concentration increased with inflow rate. The particles were observed to flocculate rapidly when the salinity of the inflow water reached about 5 0 /. The location of the 5 0 / 00 00 isohaline was found to be a power law function of the inflow rate, indicating that <b>microtidal</b> estuaries can be readily dominated by inflow water properties.

40|$|Observational {{evidence}} and mathematical modeling {{have demonstrated the}} crucial role of wind waves on sediment resuspension in shallow <b>microtidal</b> basins, where tidal fluxes alone are unable to mobilize tidal flat sediments. Carniello et al. [2005] presented a mathematical model for shallow <b>microtidal</b> basin which combines wind waves with tidal fluxes under the assumption of constant wave period. A detailed analyses of field data shows that the wave period varies {{as a function of}} wind speed and flow depth, and its variation has a non-negligible impact on wave heights and wave induced bed shear stresses. We therefore re-formulate the model by introducing a variable wave period through a suitable empirical power law relating the wave period to the wind speed and flow depth. The improvement obtained by introducing such an estimation of the local wave period is emphasized by the results of a number of simulations, carried out considering different storm events recently occurred in the Venice lagoon. The new formulation of the wind wave-tidal model provides a better description of the wind-wave field and, therefore, reflects favourably also on the estimation of the sediment re-suspension, as clearly shown by the comparison of turbidity measurements with the results obtained with a sediment transport model coupled with the wind wave-tidal model. ...|$|E
40|$|The role of wave-topography {{interactions}} {{in the formation}} of sand ridges on <b>microtidal</b> inner shelves is investigated with an idealized morphodynamic model. The latter uses the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe a storm-driven flow on an inner shelf with an erodible bottom and a transverse slope. Both bed load and suspended load sediment transport are included. New are the incorporation of a wave module based on physical principles and a critical shear-stress for erosion. A linear stability analysis is used to study the initial growth of bed forms, by analyzing the initial growth of small perturbations evolving on an alongshore uniform basic state, which describes a storm-driven flow on a <b>microtidal</b> inner shelf. Model simulations show that wave-topography interactions cause the ridges to become more trapped to the coast. Both growth and migration of the ridges are controlled by suspended load transport. The physical mechanism responsible for ridge growth is related to transport by the storm-driven current of sediment that is entrained due to wave orbital motions induced by bed forms. This new mechanism even acts in absence of a transverse bottom slope. The orientation, spacing and shape of the modeled ridges agree well with field observations from different shelves.

We then discuss both observed and predicted {{effects of climate change}} on the hydrology and physico-chemical environments of the <b>microtidal</b> estuaries of SWWA, and the ecological impacts of these changes on estuarine fish communities. Warming of marine and estuarine waters, sustained reductions in rainfall and changes in the timing, location and magnitude of extreme weather events are predicted. These are likely to cause changes in the timing and decreases in the magnitude of river flows; changes to the mouth status of bar-closed estuaries; ‘marinisation’ and ‘tropicalisation’ of estuarine waters, including increased hypersalinity in estuaries on the south coast; and changes in the extent, timing and persistence of water column stratification and hypoxia. Such changes are likely to have both positive and negative effects on the abundance, species richness and community composition of estuarine fish faunas in SWWA, with potential implications for estuarine and nearshore marine fisheries.

40|$|Intermittently Closed/Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a {{particularly}} dynamic form of estuary characterised by periodic entrance closure to the ocean.

ICOLLs are found to be more widespread globally than previously described with 1477 of these estuaries being identified in this study.

ICOLLs are concentrated along <b>microtidal</b> to low mesotidal coastlines in the mid-latitudes and predominantly on coasts with temperate climates.

The highest proportion of ICOLLs are present in Australia (21 % all global ICOLLs), South Africa (16 %) and Mexico (16 %). In Australia, a comparison with fluvial input found that it is less important than marine processes in determining ICOLL formation and that ICOLLs are associated with a relative tidal range of < 3. 22.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{utility of}} deep-time global paleotidal {{modeling}} {{is evaluated with}} a series of modeling experiments focused on the Early Cretaceous (Aptian). The results from a series of paleobathymetry sensitivity experiments indicate that, despite paleogeographic and paleobathymetric uncertainty, appropriate use of global paleotidal models complements and enhances stratigraphic and sedimentological methods. Before being applied to global paleotidal modeling, the Imperial College Ocean Model (ICOM) is validated for the computation of modern global tides. The ICOM results only deviate slightly from a ‘‘state-of-the-art’ ’ published model and were achieved with considerably less computational expense and without data assimilation. The results from global paleotidal modeling of the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) were assessed by comparison with the published geological record. ICOM predicts high mesotidal to macrotidal ranges on the Arabian Platform, around India (especially to the north and west), along the Pacific coast between North and South America, northeast of Australia, and around Southeast Asia. The model predicts low <b>microtidal</b> ranges in the proto-South Atlantic Ocean and Weddell Sea. A further validation test assessed the ability of the model to predict the dominant tidal constituents (diurnal or semidiurnal) in the Aptian ‘‘Lower Greensand Seaway’ ’ of southeastern England and Northern France.

40|$|A {{straightforward}} conceptual {{method is}} proposed to quantitatively assess the seasonal-scale tendency of retreatment or advancement on <b>microtidal</b> beaches {{by using the}} backshore/foreshore length ratio. This method is based on measuring the cross-shore profile of a beach when it passes through the “transitional state” that separates the high-from the low-energy season, period during which the morphological characteristics of the beach tend to its equilibrium profile. In order to obtain real measurements of backshore (B) and foreshore (F), {{the definition of the}} limits bounding these two important components in subaerial beaches is reviewed and discussed. The approach based on the measurement of the B/F length ratio assumes that foreshore and backshore have equivalent lengths in beaches that approximate to their state of morphodynamic equilibrium (B/F ~ 1). A backshore length exceeding the foreshore length is indicative of a state of beach recession, with a B/F length ratio > 1. When the foreshore length is greater than the backshore length, the shoreline is advancing or, alternatively, it is developing in a state of morphological confinement, i. e. due to the presence of a sea cliff, with a B/F < 1. This practical method is then tested against 36 sand and gravel <b>microtidal</b> beach profiles measured along the coasts of Basilicata, in southern Italy. The various “beach states” are summarised into seven classes (I-VII), each identified from specific value intervals of the B/F length ratio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} detailed hydrodynamic and morphological {{data from}} a field experiment spanning 5 days (10 tidal cycles, starting at Spring Tide conditions) undertaken in Lido di Dante, a <b>microtidal</b> protected beach in the Northern Adriatic Sea. This <b>microtidal</b> beach experienced intense erosion {{in the recent past}} and therefore it has been protected by groins, nourishments and a semi-submerged breakwater (Low-Crested Structures). During the fieldwork, an intertidal swash bar formed at spring tide under very low wave-energy conditions. The swash bar migrated 3. 5 m landwards during two consecutive tides when the measured maximum significant wave height at the upper beach was around 0. 2 m. This migration was associated with an onshore sediment transport, resulting from the erosion of the bar’s seaward slope. Once the tidal range decreased during the last tides and wave action ceased, the swash bar became static and only some non-significant changes were observed on both seaside slope and bar slip-face. The net volumetric change of this beach during the fieldwork was non-significant, in spite of the swash bar landward migration (cross-shore redistribution of the initial beach sediment budget). The wave attenuation generated by the beach protection structures was highlighted through comparison between wave measurements inside and outside the barrier. This had a significant role on swash processes and tide controlled duration of swash action, which controlled the cross-shore bar’s morphodynamics in the absence of significant longshore processes...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an analytical model of salt marsh evolution that captures the dynamic response of marshes to perturbations in suspended sediment concentrations, plant productivity, {{and the rate of}} relative sea level rise (RSLR). Sediment‐rich and highly productive marshes will approach a new equilibrium state in response to a step change in the rate of RSLR faster than sediment‐poor or less productive marshes. <b>Microtidal</b> marshes will respond more quickly to a step change in the rate of RSLR than mesotidal or macrotidal marshes. Marshes are more resilient to a decrease rather than to an increase in the rate of RSLR, and they are more resilient to a decrease rather than to an increase in sediment availability. Moreover, macrotidal marshes are more resilient to changes in the rate of RSLR than their <b>microtidal</b> counterparts. Finally, we find that a marsh’s ability to record sea level fluctuations in its stratigraphy is fundamentally related to a timescale we call TFT, or filling timescale, which is equal to the tidal amplitude divided by the maximum possible accretion rate on the marsh (a function of plant productivity, sediment properties, and availability). Marshes with a short‐filling timescale (i. e., marshes with rapid sedimentation or small tidal amplitudes) are best suited to recording high‐frequency fluctuations in RSLR, but our model suggests it is unlikely that marshes will be able to record fluctuations occurring over timescales that are shorter than decadal...|$|E

The parabolic bay shape equation {{has proven to be}} a convenient and practical tool for studying the stability of the headland-bay beaches, tombolos, and salients in Santa Catarina. The beaches exhibit different patterns of sediment removal as a function of the degree of beach curvature. In highly curved beaches, there is a well-developed shadow zone and a range of morphodynamic conditions, from a sheltered low-energy beach adjacent to the downdrift headland to a high-energy exposed beach on the straight end of the headland-bay beach. The less curved beaches instead, tend to show more uniform behaviour since they are directly exposed to incident waves. There is no obvious relationship between average wave height and mean grain size, showing the importance of sediment source to characterize the sedimentary distribution patterns in the study area. The analysis of beaches showed that beach morphodynamics and sequence profiles for a bay-headland coast in a <b>microtidal</b> east coast environment is a function of geological inheritance (e. g., distance between headlands and orientation, nearshore and inner shelf morphology, coastal plain morphology, and sediment source), and hydrodynamic factors (wave conditions, oceanic wave exposure and relative tidal range).

Lateral transects were also conducted at the borders of each of three hydrologically distinct sections. The pCO₂ displayed considerable spatial-temporal variability. Likewise, net air-water CO₂ fluxes showed high spatial and temporal variability, with a maximum [release] of 271 mmol C m⁻² d⁻¹ during high river flow conditions in fall and minimum [uptake] of − 38 mmol C m⁻² d⁻¹ during wind-driven, high primary productivity conditions in late spring.

Radium isotopes (223 Ra, 224 Ra, 226 Ra, 228 Ra) and radon (222 Rn) have been widely applied as tracers of SGD. Their application requires the appropriate characterization of both the concentrations of tracers in the discharging groundwater and their distribution in the coastal water column. This study evaluates the temporal evolution of Ra isotopes and 222 Rn concentrations in a dynamic subterranean estuary of a <b>microtidal</b> Mediterranean coastal aquifer that experiences large displacements of the fresh-saltwater interface as a necessary initial step in evaluating the influence of SGD in coastal waters. We show that changes in groundwater salinities due to the seaward displacement of the fresh-saltwater interface produced large variations in Ra activities in groundwater ({{by a factor of}} ~ 19, ~ 14, ~ 6, and ~ 11 for 223 Ra, 224 Ra, 226 Ra and 228 Ra, respectively), most importantly during rainfall events. In contrast, the 222 Rn activities in groundwater oscillated only by a factor of 3 during these rainy periods. The large temporal variability in Ra activities hampers the characterization of the SGD end-member when using Ra isotopes as tracers, and thus presents a challenge for obtaining accurate SGD estimates. This study emphasizes the need to understand the hydrodynamics of coastal aquifers to appropriately constrain the Ra isotopes and 222 Rn concentrations in groundwater and when applying both tracers in dynamic <b>microtidal</b> coastal systems.

40|$|We {{are further}} {{developing}} behaviour-model describing {{the interaction between}} a tidal lagoon or basin and its adjacent coastal environment, including the ebb-tidal delta. While the model is based on general sediment transport equations, the behavioural aspect concerns the a priory assumption that the equilibrium state of each element {{of the system is}} known or at least can be defined. Here, we are able to rely on a vast body of reported experience for each of these system elements. The importance of the present work lies in the application of the model to the <b>microtidal</b> environment of the Po Delta, while the original model was validated for the mesotidal environment of the Wadden Sea...|$|E
