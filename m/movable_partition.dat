25|$|Suppose {{a system}} is {{thermally}} and mechanically isolated from the environment (isolated system). For example, consider an insulating rigid box divided by a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> into two volumes, each filled with gas. If the pressure of one gas is higher, it will expand by moving the partition, thus performing work on the other gas. Also, if the gases are at different temperatures, heat can flow from one gas to the other provided the partition allows heat conduction. Our above result indicates that the entropy of {{the system as a}} whole will increase during these processes. There exists a maximum amount of entropy the system may possess under the circumstances. This entropy corresponds to a state of stable equilibrium, since a transformation to any other equilibrium state would cause the entropy to decrease, which is forbidden. Once the system reaches this maximum-entropy state, no part of the system can perform work on any other part. It is in this sense that entropy {{is a measure of the}} energy in a system that cannot be used to do work.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} {{is considered a}} fine example of traditional Quaker architecture because it contains all of the elements found in the typical meeting house. However, the building does have one major difference on its interior when compared with most meeting houses. Traditionally, Quaker meeting houses had two rooms, divided by a <b>movable</b> <b>partition,</b> termed [...] "shutters," [...] meant to separate men from women during meetings; these shutters are noticeably absent on the Benjaminville Meeting House. The members of the meeting at the Benjaminville Meeting House were among [...] "pioneers" [...] within the Society of Friends in that they were one of the first seven groups to allow men and women to meet as one group of Friends. The room inside the Benjaminville building was simply divided with a waist-high partition as opposed to the movable wall.|$|E

50|$|In a move {{to cater}} {{specifically}} to the business traveler, Braniff, Inc., created the Braniff Business Cabin concept that called for a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> to be installed in the aircraft to divide up the two sections that would be installed on its aircraft. Business Cabin {{was placed in the}} front portion of the aircraft where all full Coach paying passenger will be seated. Braniff noted that it was not uncommon for a full Coach fare passenger to be seated next to a leisure passenger who might have paid 50 percent less or more for his fare. The leisure traveler was {{able to take advantage of}} 7 day advance fares or stay over a Saturday night which lowered their fare considerably. Braniff's Business Cabin eliminated this disenfranchisement of the full Coach fare paying passenger. Business Cabin service reflected the higher Coach fare that was paid by business travelers.

A gabled vestibule dominates the center of the south façade and houses the primary entry. The tower rises from the roof of the vestiblue and is capped with a stepped parapet. Three large stained glass windows with arched tops dominate the east wall of the sanctuary which features a post and beam ceiling.

50|$|In 1852, a new indoor gym (link=no) {{was opened}} for use classes {{of boys and}} girls from various schools. It {{contained}} a hall one hundred by sixty feet which could be changed into two rooms by means of a <b>movable</b> <b>partition.</b> It was surrounded by a double Turnplatz and was the first building of the kind in Germany. Public exhibitions the next year and again in 1855 acquainted parents, teachers, the grand ducal family, and the state and city authorities with the nature of his work. In the summer of 1855, failing health compelled Spiess to interrupt his hitherto unceasing activity. Tuberculosis had developed in a lung wounded by a sword thrust during his student days as a second to a duel. Attempts to stop its progress by residence in the Taunus and for two years at Vevey, on Lake Geneva, proved unavailing. He returned to Darmstadt, visiting the Turnhaus there for the last time in the fall of 1857, and died the following year.|$|E
5000|$|A {{plot of land}} on South 12th Street - 142 ft by 134 ft (43.3 m by 40.8 m) - was {{purchased}} in 1810 for $11,000. Carpenter John D. Smith dismantled the old building. Its roof trusses, which dictated {{the width of the}} new building, were unpegged and transported in pieces. Other architectural elements such as windows, doors and columns were salvaged and reused. The new building was longer than the old - 91 ft (27.6 m), rather than 57 ft (17.4 m). Smith built two additional roof trusses of tulip poplar, and increased the spacing between all of them. The two-story main meeting room replicated the dimensions of the Great Meeting House's interior, and {{at least some of the}} old benches were reused. [...] The building's extension contained a one-story women's meeting room, separated by a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> from the main meeting room, and a second floor room. Construction of the Twelfth Street Meeting House was completed in April 1813, at a cost of $21,410.46.|$|E
25|$|Another ongoing major {{development}} is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by <b>movable</b> <b>partitions)</b> to one {{in which they are}} accommodated in individual rooms. The ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy. A major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.|$|R
50|$|The school's {{original}} architecture was unique: {{the building}} was circular, and class areas were divided by <b>movable</b> <b>partitions,</b> {{an attempt to make}} the school easily adaptable to changing needs. More recently, some classrooms have been reconstructed with permanent walls and closing doors. Westmont High School did not have windows in its classrooms until they were recently installed before the 2012-2013 school year. Some of the adaptable rooms do not have walls. Sound echoes very well throughout the building, so the faculty has great control of the student body.|$|R

5000|$|See also Mission House (Mackinac Island)Christian {{missions}} {{were often}} the first outposts of European colonization of the NorthAmerican frontier. The United Foreign Missionary Society founded a Protestant mission on Mackinac Island in 1822. The objective was to train Indian youth as teachers of English, Christianity and majority American ways, and as interpreters. To support this mission, the US government transferred 12 acres at the southeast {{end of the island}} to the Society. [...] The Connecticut Missionary Society sent Rev. William Montague Ferry to the island, and he opened the school with twelve Indian children on Nov. 3, 1823. He was assisted by his wife Amanda White Ferry and Elizabeth McFarland. The school building was framed and enclosed by workers from Detroit, using timbers obtained from a sawmill on Mill Creek (6 mi SE of current day Mackinaw City). By 1825, construction of the 2-story ‘Mission House’ was completed by Martin Heydenburk, one of the school’s teachers. Because the island had no Protestant church, the east wing of Mission House was fitted with a <b>movable</b> <b>partition</b> so that on Sundays it became a chapel. Enrollment soon averaged 150 Native American pupils per year with >100 receiving free board, room, and clothing from the mission family. The southeast point of Mackinac Island became known as Mission Point.|$|E

It is a simple 1-1/2 story wood frame building, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior.

The interior has a vestibule spanning the building width, leading to the main chamber, with a gallery above. The main chamber has <b>movable</b> <b>partitions,</b> which can be raised and lowered by means of pulleys.

Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.|$|R
