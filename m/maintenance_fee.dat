Modeled on contemporary British residential squares such as those found in London's Bloomsbury neighborhoods, its first phase, on Washington Place, featured rows of townhouses with a unified facade fronting on a park reserved exclusively for residents, whose deeds require a monthly <b>maintenance</b> <b>fee.</b> It retains its integrity despite some later alterations and damage, and is one of only two privately owned urban parks in New York.|$|E

50|$|<b>Maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> or {{renewal fees}} are fees that {{are paid to}} {{maintain}} a granted patent in force. Some patent laws require the payment of <b>maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> for pending patent applications. Not all patent laws require the payment of <b>maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> and different laws provide different regulations concerning not only the amount payable but also the regularity of the payments. In countries where <b>maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> are to be paid annually, they are sometimes called patent annuities.|$|R
50|$|No annuity (<b>maintenance)</b> <b>fees</b> {{need to be}} paid while {{applications}} are pending. Once granted of the patent <b>maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> are due based {{on the anniversary of}} application date. The unpaid fees while the patent was pending have to be paid on grant.|$|R

500|$|Although [...] "Master Building" [...] is {{the name}} that {{appeared}} on official documents, the structure {{has long been known}} as Master Apartments or The Master.

Choice 1, 2 room suites, serving pantries, full hotel service, all rooms outside; from $50 month unfurnished; few furnished, $65 month. Popular price restaurant. Home of Riverside Museum. Concerts, lectures, recitals free to residents." [...] The building continued to be called by both names after conversion to a housing cooperative in 1988. At that time it was described as having 335 apartments on 28 floors served by four elevators. Buyers were permitted to finance up to 90% of the purchase price and 28% of the monthly <b>maintenance</b> <b>fee</b> was tax deductible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model for}} understanding a firm's decisions regarding the maintenance (renewal) and patenting of sequential innovations and studies how these decisions {{are affected by the}} model's parameters, including <b>maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> and filing fees. The model demonstrates that the two prices exert negative effects on renewal and patenting, respectively (i. e. adverse own price effects). The model also offers a discriminating testable hypothesis, predicted on the cross-price effects, to identify complementarity or substitutability across sequential innovations. Our regression results show that the probability of patent renewal and <b>maintenance</b> <b>fees</b> are correlated negatively and that the patent propensity and application fees are correlated negatively. We also demonstrate that higher application fees are associated with lower probability of patent renewal, which corroborates the case of complementarity in sequential innovations.
