5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine liked {{to make his}} runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and enjoyed being tested; his approach would often lead his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|The winning {{goal for}} Luton in a 2–1 victory over Cardiff City in October was scored by Holmes from close range, which brought {{an end to}} the opposition' eight match unbeaten run. He {{suffered}} from a twisted knee during a match against Derby County on 26 December 2005, eventually returning to action from a hamstring injury in February 2006 by playing in a reserve match against Southend United. His competitive return was in a 3–3 draw against Cardiff, where he came on as a substitute for Dean Morgan on 82 minutes. He completed 2005–06 with 25 appearances and scored two goals, when Luton finished 10th in the Championship. Following the conclusion of the season, he signed a new one-year contract in June 2006. He joined League One club Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 12 January 2007, making his debut the following day in a 1–0 away victory over Rotherham United, in which he forced goalkeeper Neil Cutler into <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> save. Chesterfield were given the lead by Holmes in a match away to Huddersfield Town with a header from a Kyle Critchell cross, which eventually finished a 1–1 draw. The loan was extended for a second month on 8 February 2007, and Holmes said he would consider signing for the club permanently when the loan expired. He eventually finished his spell at Chesterfield with 10 appearances and scored one goal. He joined Lincoln City of League Two on loan until the end of 2006–07 on 22 March 2007. His debut came in a 3–2 home defeat to Swindon Town and he completed the loan spell with five appearances.|$|E

Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as {{he was afraid to}} enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.|$|E
25|$|A {{highlight}} of Bichel's career was Australia's 2003 World Cup campaign. He was initially {{back up to}} Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath. He played his first game against Netherlands <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression with the ball and after injury had ended Gillespie's World Cup campaign he took over his position in the side. Bichel retrieved Australia from serious trouble {{on more than one}} occasion, most notably his 7–20 against England. This bowling performance rated as the best bowling against England in ODIs, best bowling at St George's Park in ODIs, and his best bowling in World Cups as well.|$|E

25|$|The Yorkshire Committee still {{considered}} Cordingley {{to have a}} place within the squad, particularly as his bowling style was different to that of Rhodes. However, Cordingley believed he would only be Rhodes' reserve and refused a contract in 1899. Instead, he became the professional at a cricket club in Nottinghamshire before moving to Sussex. He played club cricket in Brighton and qualified for the County team after <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on the local press. He first played for Sussex in 1901 and, in total, he played 15 first-class games for the team, but his only notable performances were in 1902: he took five wickets for 22 runs against Nottinghamshire and shared a partnership of 115 for the ninth wicket with K. S. Ranjitsinhji. He remained with the club in 1903 but was not a first choice in the team and played only intermittently afterwards until 1905. He continued to live in Sussex and became a player, coach and groundsman at Pease Pottage, earning a good reputation for encouraging cricket in the local area. He died in 1945, aged 72.|$|E
25|$|The third match {{followed}} {{a very similar}} pattern to the second, with the West Indians <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start through Roach (53) and Challenor (46), but no other batsman getting beyond the 30s. The total of 238 was, though, the highest of the series for the touring side. Hobbs and Sutcliffe made 155 for the first wicket, and Hobbs and Tyldesley then added 129 before Hobbs was out for 159 with the score at 284. Five further wickets then fell {{in the next hour}} for 49 runs, all of them to Griffith, whose innings figures of six for 103 were the best of the series for the West Indies. Tate and Harold Larwood then added 61 in 25 minutes and the last three wickets made 105 runs. West Indies' second innings, as in the previous Tests, began badly, and only a stubborn 41 from Martin enabled the side to reach three figures. As at Lord's and Old Trafford, the match was over before lunch on the third day.|$|E

25|$|Small Heath {{were without}} several first-team regulars against a full-strength Bury {{side in the}} first round of the FA Cup. During the first half the play was fast-paced, {{end-to-end}} and goalless until Harry Haynes left the field with a knee injury. He resumed after the interval, limping heavily, but during his absence Bury took a 2–0 lead, which they were to double before Lewis scored a late consolation. Two days later, in the replay of the match abandoned for bad weather, Small Heath's forwards pressed hard early on, but faded after Hugh Goldie scored somewhat against the run of play and Everton won 3–0. The Liverpool Mercury picked out debutant Tom Farnall as <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression at right-half. An improved performance secured a draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday, Leake scoring a headed goal, his first for the club. Wednesday had a goal from a free kick disallowed because the ball had not touched another player on its way into the net, though Meates made a desperate attempt to save it after it appeared to have deflected off Fred Spiksley.|$|E
25|$|Lutyens {{campaigned for}} its fixing, {{but was not}} able to get it to be changed. Lutyens wanted to make a long {{inclined}} grade all the way to Viceroy's House with retaining walls on either side. While this would give a view of the house from further back, it would also cut through the square between the secretariat buildings. The committee with Lutyens and Baker established in January 1914 said the grade was to be no steeper than 1 in 25, though it eventually was changed to 1 in 22, a steeper gradient which made it more difficult to see the Viceroy's palace. While Lutyens knew about the gradient, and the possibility that the Viceroy's palace would be obscured by the road, it is thought that Lutyens did not fully realize how little {{the front of the house}} would be visible. In 1916 the Imperial Delhi committee dismissed Lutyens's proposal to alter the gradient. Lutyens thought Baker was more concerned with making money and pleasing the government, rather than <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> architectural design.|$|E
25|$|Lancashire won the toss {{and chose}} to bat first. After losing both openers cheaply, John Crawley and Neil Fairbrother (76) put {{together}} a third wicket partnership of 164. Crawley's innings took him past 1,000 runs for the season, the third man to pass the landmark in 1994. Lancashire collapsed from a strong position of 274/3 to 342/9 with Welch taking three wickets in 19 balls. Despite missing Brian Lara the match with a knee injury, Warwickshire's top order performed well ending day two on 350/3. Opener Andy Moles scored 87 from 222 balls while Trevor Penney reached a sixth first-class hundred. Jason Radcliffe, making his first appearance of the season, added 69. The hosts collapsed on the third morning losing their last seven wickets for 28 runs, four of those fell to Glen Chapple. The clay pitch was now offering indifferent bounce and after <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start to their second innings Lancashire themselves collapsed from 100/1 to 194 all out. Neil Smith took 7/42 and bettered his career best figures for the second successive home match. With rain threatening, the target was chased urgently, the last 72 runs being scored in 12 overs. Roger Twose’s top score of 90 contained eleven fours and two sixes.|$|E
