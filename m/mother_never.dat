5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the moment she is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E

When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the council estates the post-war Labour government built.

At the behest of their mother, Marie and her sisters were taught French, which they detested and rarely ever spoke. Overall, the Duchess neglected her daughters' education, considering them not very bright or gifted. They were permitted to read aloud, but in the fields of painting and drawing, areas in which they had inherited Queen Victoria's talent, the girls received only a [...] "pedestrian instruction". The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh frequently received {{members of the royal family}} at Eastwell Park, inviting them for breakfast nearly daily and in 1885, Marie and Victoria Melita served as bridesmaids at the wedding of their aunt Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg.

2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the <b>mother</b> <b>never</b> responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E
