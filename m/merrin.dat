2500|$|Some critics accused Baudrillard {{of instant}} revisionism; {{a denial of}} the {{physical}} action of the conflict (which was related to his denial of reality in general). Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and Berkelian idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William <b>Merrin</b> (in his book Baudrillard and the Media) have argued that Baudrillard was {{more concerned with the}} West's technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, and what that means for the present possibility of war. <b>Merrin</b> argued that Baudrillard was not denying that something had happened, but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral [...] "atrocity masquerading as a war". <b>Merrin</b> viewed the accusations of amorality as redundant and based on a misreading. In Baudrillard's own words (pp.71–72): ...|$|E
2500|$|Willam Merrin's {{work has}} {{presented}} a more sympathetic account, which attempts to [...] "place Baudrillard {{in opposition to}} himself". Thereby <b>Merrin</b> has argued that Baudrillard's position on semiotic analysis of meaning denies himself his own position on symbolic exchange. <b>Merrin</b> thus alludes to the common criticism of structuralist and post-structuralist work (a criticism not dissimilar in either Baudrillard, Foucault, or Deleuze) that emphasising interrelation {{as the basis for}} subjectivity denies the human agency from which social structures necessarily arise. (Alain Badiou and Michel de Certeau have made this point generally, and Barry Sandywell has argued as much in Baudrillard's specific case.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The doctors, {{thinking}} that Regan's aberrations are mostly psychiatric in origin, recommend an exorcism to be performed. Chris arranges {{a meeting with}} Karras. After recording Regan speaking backwards and witnessing the apparent effect of the scarification of her flesh with the words [...] "Help Me" [...] on her stomach, Karras is convinced Regan is possessed. Believing her soul is in danger, he decides to perform an exorcism. The experienced <b>Merrin</b> is selected for performing the actual exorcism with Karras present to assist.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with {{his theory of}} society, Baudrillard portrayed the attacks as a symbolic reaction to the inexorable rise of a world based on commodity exchange. This stance was criticised on two counts. Richard Wolin (in The Seduction of Unreason) forcefully accused Baudrillard and Slavoj Žižek of all but celebrating the terrorist attacks, essentially claiming that the United States received what it deserved. Žižek, however, countered that accusation to Wolin's analysis {{as a form of}} intellectual barbarism in the journal Critical Inquiry, saying that Wolin failed to see the difference between fantasising about an event and stating that one is deserving of that event. <b>Merrin</b> (in Baudrillard and the Media) argued that Baudrillard's position affords the terrorists a type of moral superiority. In the journal Economy and Society, <b>Merrin</b> further noted that Baudrillard gives the symbolic facets of society unfair privilege above semiotic concerns. Second, authors questioned whether the attacks were unavoidable. Bruno Latour, in Critical Inquiry, [...] argued that Baudrillard believed that their destruction was forced by the society that created them, alluding to the notion that the Towers were [...] "brought down by their own weight". In Latour's view, this was because Baudrillard conceived only of society in terms of a symbolic and semiotic dualism.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{only one}} of the two major confrontational books on Baudrillard's thought—Christopher Norris's Uncritical Theory: Postmodernism, Intellectuals and the Gulf War (...) —seeks to reject his media theory and {{position}} on [...] "the real" [...] out of hand. The other—Douglas Kellner's Jean Baudrillard: From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyond (...) —seeks rather to analyse Baudrillard's relation to postmodernism (a concept with which Baudrillard has had a continued, if uneasy and rarely explicit, relationship) and to present a Marxist counter. Regarding the former, William <b>Merrin</b> (discussed above) published more than one denunciation of Norris's position. The latter Baudrillard himself characterised as reductive (in Nicholas Zurbrugg's Jean Baudrillard: Art and Artefact).|$|E
2500|$|Father Merrin's arrival {{scene was}} filmed on Max von Sydow's {{first day of}} work. The scene where the elderly priest, Father <b>Merrin</b> (portrayed by Max von Sydow) steps out of a cab and {{stands in front of}} the MacNeil residence, between the open gates of the driveway — silhouetted in a misty streetlamp's glow and staring up at an intense beam of light shining from a bedroom window above — is one of the most famous scenes in the movie.

2500|$|The {{question}} of whether or not such a young actress, even a talented one, could carry the film on her shoulders was an issue from the beginning, with film directors asked to do the project such as Mike Nichols being skeptical. As well, the studio wanted Marlon Brando for the role of Father Lankester <b>Merrin.</b> [...] Friedkin immediately vetoed this by stating it would become a [...] "Brando movie." [...] Jack Nicholson was up for the part of Karras before Stacy Keach was hired by Blatty. According to Friedkin, Paul Newman also wanted to portray Karras. [...] Friedkin then spotted Jason Miller following a performance of Miller's play That Championship Season in New York. Even though Miller had never acted in a film, Keach's contract was bought out by Warner Brothers, and Miller was signed.|$|E

Telemond in the movie version of the novel) and Father Lankester <b>Merrin</b> in William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist. In Dan Simmons' 1989–97 Hyperion Cantos, Teilhard de Chardin has been canonized a saint in the far future. His work inspires the anthropologist priest character, Paul Duré. When Duré becomes Pope, he takes Teilhard I as his regnal name.

2500|$|The {{interior}} of Karras' room at Georgetown was a meticulous reconstruction of Theology professor Father Thomas M. King, S.J.'s [...] "corridor Jesuit" [...] room in New North Hall. Fr. King's room was photographed by production staff {{after a visit}} by Blatty, a Georgetown graduate, and Friedkin. Upon returning to New York, every element of King's room, including posters and books, was recreated for the set, including a poster of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S.J., a theologian on whom the character of Fr. <b>Merrin</b> was loosely based. Georgetown was paid $1,000 per day of filming, which included both exteriors, such as Burstyn's first scene, shot {{on the steps of}} the Flemish Romanesque Healy Hall, and interiors, such as the defilement of the statue of the Virgin Mary in Dahlgren Chapel, or the Archbishop's office, which is actually the office of the president of the university.
