5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York. As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings would put on plays.|$|E
5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E
25|$|What {{at first}} held his {{attention}} now <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to flee. It was maddening to be inside– to be swallowed whole– so long. He had {{an image of}} himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.|$|E

However, despite being in his thirties, Redfearn's {{performances}} had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a <b>wanted</b> man in the Premier League, and he was signed by Charlton Athletic for £1 million in the summer of 1998. He left Barnsley having played 338 first team games, scoring 84 goals.|$|R

Following St Johnstone's win over Rosenberg in the Europa League, Davidson rejoined the club on a one-year contract after failing to secure a move south. Afterwards Davidson said that he had re-signed for St Johnstone as they <b>made</b> <b>him</b> feel <b>wanted.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{a holiday}} in Killarney, {{he listened to}} the Irish {{broadcaster}} Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to return to radio. Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8million to 2.6million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.|$|E

Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this [...] "mysterious phenomena" [...] <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> [...] "to know more of this wonderful force". Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers {{to believe that he}} was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.|$|E
500|$|Ellis {{states in}} American Creations {{foreword}} {{that the book}} was prompted by repeated questions he received on his 2000 book tour for Founding Brothers negatively comparing presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore to the Founders. His difficulty in properly assessing the Founders <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> {{to write a book}} that both acknowledged their achievements and punctured the myth that they were [...] "demigods". He stated {{in an interview that he}} wanted to show that [...] "these folks didn't completely understand what they were doing... They were improvising on the edge of catastrophe." [...] Ellis did the research for the book personally, rather than working with research assistants. He wrote the manuscript by hand with a rollerball pen.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{inspired}} to create an album where [...] "every song was a killer" [...] and developed Thriller with that in mind. Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and {{why it was so}} personal to Jackson, who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted that it remain because it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to dance. The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song [...] "Beat It". Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm-guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "original" [...] or [...] "unique" [...] and praised its script's range of emotions and humor. IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both [...] "bizarre and memorable". Official Nintendo Magazine Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as [...] "one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines" [...] that fluctuated [...] "between humorous and poignant". GameZone David Sanchez thought its script was [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "sharp", as it displayed {{a wide range of}} emotions that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to talk to all non-player characters. GamesTM wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its [...] "strangely existential narrative framework".|$|E
500|$|Developers {{have cited}} Braid as an {{influence}} on their game design; The Guardian considered the game as the [...] "Sex, Lies, and Videotape" [...] of indie gaming, a potent symbol for the saleable potential of non-mainstream productions". Japanese video game developer Goichi [...] "Suda51" [...] Suda, developer of killer7 and No More Heroes, stated that playing Braid <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to try making a 2D title. Tim can be unlocked as a playable character in Super Meat Boy, a game designed by independent game developer Edmund McMillen who had previously created Gish and the original character designs for Braid. Braid has also garnered academic interest and acclaim for its complexity, with narratologists saying [...] "Anyone who thinks... the unique constraints of game play cannot possibly be used to best structure a story has probably not encountered Braid, which marries pure mechanics and story into a philosophical platform." [...] Braids use of narrative elements and puzzle-making {{has been compared to}} similar techniques of [...] "imperative storytelling" [...] in novels such as Life A User's Manual and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

2500|$|During most of World War II, Smochină {{backed the}} authoritarian regime of Ion Antonescu and paid service to Gheorghe Alexianu's Transnistria Governorate. His {{scientific}} work included a recovery of pre-Bolshevik or anti-Russian Romanian folklore in Transnistria and beyond. Such activities, {{along with his}} exposure of Soviet brutality, <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a <b>wanted</b> man once the communist regime took over in Romania. He was eventually captured, sent to prison and deprived of his academic honors. Partly reinstated by the late 1960s, he spent his final decades encouraging the second-generation communist authorities to take a firmer stand against controversial Soviet policies such as [...] "Moldovenism".|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to go back and rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut {{stating that the}} album features an [...] "inspired overhaul" [...] of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a [...] "mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing" [...] and musicOMH calling it [...] "an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes". Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the way more than he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Oram {{appears as}} Daniel, Sara's assistant. When asked what <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to get {{involved}} in the project, Oram revealed that he had loved the script from the moment he read it and really liked his character. Oram called Daniel [...] "slightly misguided and psychopathic", but he has a good heart. Sara's other friends, Jamie and Justine, are portrayed by Dominic Coleman and Nicola Walker. Coleman auditioned for the role of Jamie, but was unsure if he would get the part as he did not have much in common with the character.|$|E

VanDerWerff added that the episode [...] "has some hiccups here and there". He criticized the final scene, adding that it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to [...] "punch" [...] something.

50|$|Bruce {{was one of}} a {{group of}} three {{siblings}} who were found by a party of Voltamen in the ruins of their father's laboratory and revived by the Voltaman commander. Once revived, the Voltamen wanted to kill the three children, but Hunt Bowman and Lyssa intervened and defeated the Voltamen. The Voltaman commander shot Bruce right through the heart and was tackled by Hunt and subdued. Bruce's brother, Thomas, then removed Bruce's brain from his dying body and transplanted it into the body of the Voltaman commander — who turned out to be Prince Guth, the Emperor's son. Because he possessed the Prince's body, Bruce was able to go the Voltaman's home planet, Volta, due to an accident and kill their aging Emperor. This act <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a <b>wanted</b> man.|$|R
5000|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{was mixed}} in his {{assessment}} of the record, writing [...] "There's certainly nothing wrong with a producer as talented as Terje feeling constrained by the style of music that's <b>made</b> <b>him</b> famous and <b>wanting</b> to spread his wings. It's just that the areas that Terje spreads his wings into feel a bit hackneyed." [...] On the album, Tim Senda of Allmusic wrote [...] "Terje should set aside the experiments and just focus on making sleek and shiny electro-disco tracks; the rest only {{gets in the way}} of a good time." ...|$|R

[...] Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as Black Jack.|$|E

Lucky and Elizabeth have an on-and-off relationship throughout the years that includes marriages, infidelity and children. Herbst explained portraying the relationship through different actors to Comcast in 2010: [...] "The characters are still the same. Each individual actor chose to play him a little differently.

In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween <b>made</b> <b>him</b> not <b>want</b> to come back for a sequel, but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea. The writer/director explains that with the sequel, he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any [...] "John Carpenter-ness", as he could now do [...] "whatever [...] wants to do". Instead of focusing on Michael, Zombie chose to look more at the psychological consequences on Laurie after the events of the remake. As Zombie explains, after Michael murdered her friends and family, Laurie became a [...] "wreck", who continually sinks lower as the film moves forward.|$|R

He began writing after reading John Scalzi's Old Man's War (2005), which he stated showed him that the literary genre still had potential. While writing Hough tried to create a world that was [...] "equal parts The Stand and 2001" [...] that would be accessible to all readers.
