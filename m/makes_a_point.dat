5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of {{distinguishing}} between good and bad tengu. The book explains that the former are {{in command of the}} latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism– although the flaw of pride or ambition has caused them to fall onto the demon road, they remain the same basically good, dharma-abiding persons they were in life.|$|E
5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|E
5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, he <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> {{of operating}} quietly and dressing {{with a modest}} conservatism both {{as a sign of}} strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E

25|$|In Hasidic congregations, Tachanun is omitted on {{the anniversary}} of the death of various Rebbes (except Lubavitch <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of saying), since that is {{considered}} a day for religious renewal and celebration. There is a Hasidic custom of omitting Tachanun the entire week of Purim (11-17 Adar) and the entire week of Lag BaOmer (14-20 Iyar). Some communities omit Tachanun on 7 Adar because it is the anniversary of the death of Moses. Additionally some Hasidic congregations omit Tachanun on Friday mornings (getting ready for Shabbat), and some even on Sunday mornings (revival from Shabbat).|$|E
25|$|Talex {{himself was}} not touched by {{communist}} persecutions and was {{perceived by the}} authorities as a fellow traveler. When Istrati was posthumously rehabilitated in the 1970s, Talex worked on publishing his manuscripts and his correspondence. As argued by cultural historian Zigu Ornea, Talex's work in this field <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of obfuscating Istrati's contribution to the Crusade, as well as Talex's own. This contrasted with the treatment of other former Crusade people: Dem. Bassarabeanu's poetry was stricken from public memory by communist censorship, due to the author's fascist beliefs. Another poet, Mihu Dragomir, albeit formally aligned with communist ideology, was investigated for a supposed teenage involvement with the Crusade.|$|E

25|$|The next leg of {{the journey}} takes the prince into a deep forest {{inhabited}} by the evil Spânul, or Bald Man. There follow three consecutive encounters between the protagonist and the Bald Man: after twice refusing the latter's insidious offer of services, the prince is eventually forced by dire circumstance into accepting it. After another elaborate deception, the creature is able to trap the prince into a well, and only leaves him out in exchange for swearing on his backsword that they would exchange roles: the Bald Man will be introduced as the king's son to his uncle, while the young man will become a slave {{under the name of}} Harap Alb. They proceed to the Green Emperor's palace, who innocently welcomes the Bald Man as his son. During the meeting, the master <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of mistreating and hitting his slave. This upsets the emperor's daughter, who asks him to behave with more reserve, and secretly begins to wonder about his actual identity.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte (later Eva Duarte de Perón) {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva {{falls in love with}} a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows ("On This Night of a Thousand Stars"). Eva persuades Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is {{initially}} resistant, he eventually accepts ("Eva, Beware of the City"). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress ("Buenos Aires"). After Magaldi leaves her, and Che relates the story of how Eva goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality ("Goodnight and Thank You"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder ("The Lady's Got Potential"). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Perón and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy ("The Art of the Possible").|$|E

500|$|A major {{turning point}} in the novel comes with Laura's {{discovery}} of a bag of Sofía's marijuana, and her subsequent punishment of being removed from her boarding school and forced to spend a year in the Dominican Republic with family. This event is representative of the girls' transformation into Americans and away from the Dominican culture and Laura and Carlos' conflicted relationship with the assimilation. Laura [...] "still did lip service to the old ways", and Carlos <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of educating the accents out of the girls, thus showing the tension between the cultures.|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "funerary" [...] {{strictly}} means [...] "of or {{pertaining to}} a funeral or burial", {{but there is}} a long tradition in English of applying it not only to the practices and artefacts directly associated with funeral rites, but also to a wider range of more permanent memorials to the dead. Particularly influential in this regard was John Weever's Ancient Funerall Monuments (1631), the first full-length book to be dedicated to the subject of tomb memorials and epitaphs. More recently, some scholars have challenged the usage: Phillip Lindley, for example, <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of referring to [...] "tomb monuments", saying [...] "I have avoided using the term 'funeral monuments' because funeral effigies were, in the Middle Ages, temporary products, made as substitutes for the encoffined corpse for use during the funeral ceremonies". Others, however, have found this distinction [...] "rather pedantic".|$|E
500|$|The State Board of Education {{approved}} the site purchase in July 1855, but months later had proven {{unable to make}} any progress in deciding on basics for the college—including what buildings it might require. The Board turned to Holmes, who had continued to acquaint himself with the site by making some preliminary surveys. After some consideration, he reported back to the Board that the school required two main buildings: a combination classroom and office building, and a dormitory. Thus, John C. Holmes is {{the man responsible for}} the design of both College Hall and the original dormitory, now known as Saints' Rest. In addition, although Professor Harold W. Lautner (who, as the official Director of Campus Planning from 1945 to 1969, was a direct successor to Holmes) <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of noting that [...] "who proposed the sites for these first buildings is not answered in any record," [...] he concurs that Holmes' ubiquitous hand makes it unlikely that anyone else made that decision.|$|E

500|$|Playwright David Garrick {{dedicated}} the enormously successful The Farmer's Return to the satirical artist William Hogarth. [...] The story {{concerns a}} farmer who regales his family with {{an account of}} his talk with Miss Fanny, the comedy being derived from the reversal of traditional roles: the sceptical farmer poking fun at the credulous city-folk. [...] Hogarth made his own observations of the Cock Lane ghost, with obvious references in Credulity, Superstition and Fanaticism (1762). [...] This illustration <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of attacking Methodist ministers, {{one of whom is}} seen to slip a phallic [...] "ghost" [...] into a young woman's bodice. [...] He again attacked the Methodists in The Times, Plate2 (1762–1763), placing an image of Thomas Secker (who had tried to intervene on behalf of the Methodists) behind the Cock Lane ghost, and putting the ghost in the same pillory as the radical politician John Wilkes, which implied a connection between the demagoguery surrounding the Methodists and Pittites. [...] The print enraged Bishop William Warburton, who although a vocal critic of Methodism, wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel's characterization, {{especially}} her Christmas greed {{even though}} she is Jewish, was singled out for criticism in many reviews.

Sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was [...] "a character who <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of her Jewish heritage often". He added, [...] "she was basically horrible and played against character the entire episode, so she could eventually realize that she was awful and change her ways." [...] Bell criticized Rachel's list of gifts, such as [...] "spray tan and teeth whitening", as [...] "back to square one" [...] after her nose-job storyline in the second season. Finn's contribution of a charity pig in Jewish Rachel's honor was deemed [...] "wrong on at least two levels" [...] by Chaney.|$|E
500|$|Since his comeback, Bennett has financially prospered; by 1999, {{his assets}} were worth $15 to 20 million. He had no {{intention}} of retiring, saying in reference to masters such as Pablo Picasso, Jack Benny, and Fred Astaire: [...] "right up to the day they died, they were performing. If you are creative, you get busier as you get older." [...] Bennett continued to record and tour steadily, doing a hundred shows a year {{by the end of the}} 1990s. In concert Bennett often <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of singing one song (usually [...] "Fly Me to the Moon") without any microphone or amplification, demonstrating his skills at vocal projection. One show, Tony Bennett's Wonderful World: Live From San Francisco, was made into a PBS special. Bennett also created the idea behind, and starred in the first episode of, the A Network's popular Live by Request series, for which he won an Emmy Award. In addition to numerous television guest performances, Bennett has had cameo appearances as himself in films such as The Scout, Analyze This, and Bruce Almighty.|$|E
