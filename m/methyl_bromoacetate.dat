40|$|For {{functional}} nitrogen-bridged calix(hetero) aromatic platforms to {{be further}} used {{in the design of}} more sophisticated receptors, the azacalix[2]arene[2]triazine nitrogen bridges were functionalised with <b>methyl</b> <b>bromoacetate.</b> Three new macrocycles with four N-methyl ester pendant arms were straightforwardly prepared in good yields from the undecorated azacalix[2]arene[2]triazine precursors with chlorine, dimethylamine or dihexylamine substituted triazines.

Subsequently, the N-methyl ester appendages were hydrolyzed with each dialkylamine derivative providing a single macrocycle with four carboxylic groups. In contrast the hydrolysis of the dichlorinated azacalix[2]arene[2]triazine analogue yielded a mixture of three isomeric macrocycles having two N-methyl esters and two carboxylmethyl pendant arms and the triazine chlorine atoms replaced by hydroxyl groups.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of {{two types of}} imidazole derivatives bearing a hydrazide group was achieved by treatment of the corresponding esters with NH 2 NH 2 ·H 2 O in MeOH at room temperature. In the case of 4 -(ethoxycarbonyl) - 1 H-imidazole 3 -oxides 3, hydrazides of type 1 were formed with retention of the N-oxide structure (Scheme 1). Interestingly, due to a strong H-bonding, no deoxygenation of the N-O function could be achieved even by treatment of 3 with Raney-Ni. The second type, 2 -[(1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl) sulfanyl]acetohydrazides 2, was obtained from 1 H-imidazole- 2 (3 H) -thiones 4 in two steps via S-alkylation with <b>methyl</b> <b>bromoacetate,</b> followed by treatment with NH 2 NH 2 ·H 2 O (Scheme 2).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and biological evaluation of some medicinally important hybrid compounds {{in which two}} or more active nuclei are clubbed together in a single molecule like quinazolinone-azomethines, iminothiazoline-sulfonamides, iminothiazolidinone-sulfonamides, coumarinyl-thiazolyl-thioureas, coumarinylthiazolyl-iminothiazolidinone. In addition to that novel synthesis of thiosemicarbazones and derivatives of indanone and isoindolinone is also described. The key intermediates 2 -thioxo-quinazolinones (136 - 140) prepared in two steps from corresponding aniline were treated with methyl chloroacetate to afford S-substituted esters (141 - 142). These esters were converted into corresponding hydrazides (143144) by reacting with hydrazine hydrate. These hydrazide (143) were converted into quinazolinone-azomethine hybrids (147 - 157) by reacting with substituted aldehydes. Quinazolinone-azomethine hybrids were evaluated against lung carcinoma cells and cholinesterases. Most of the compounds exhibited significant cytotoxicity at low micromolar concentrations and were less toxic to normal cells. After 24 h incubation period, ortho methoxy analogue (155) showed maximum cytotoxicity. The parabromo substituted compound (149) showed higher acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity than other screened compounds. The most active compound (149), among the series, had an IC 50 value 209. 8 µM against AChE. The tested compounds showed less inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase. Molecular docking studies were performed in order to investigate the plausible binding modes of synthesized compounds. All compounds occupied the same position inside the active site of human AChE (PDB ID: 4 BDT). A novel series of new Schiff base derivatives (158 - 175) were synthesized by the reaction of thiosemicarbazide with aldehydes in ethanol using a catalytic amount of acid and investigated as potential new inhibitors of Jack bean urease in vitro. All the screened compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range. Among the tested compounds, (163) was the most potent with Ki being 90 nM bearing NO 2 group at meta position. Thiourea {{was used as the}} reference compound for the assay with Ki 19600 nM. Molecular docking studies were also performed to illustrate the binding mode of the compounds. Docking studies were performed on an enzyme from Jack bean urease (PDB: ID 3 LA 4). It was observed that all the compounds aligned very well in the active site of the protein. The most potent compound (163) was further investigated to determine the kinetics of inhibition and it was found that (163) exhibited a competitive mechanism of inhibition. Iminothiazoline-sulfonamides hybrids (176 - 185) were synthesized by heterocyclization of the of sulfanilamide thioureas with propragyl bromide in dry ethanol using 1, 8 -diazabicyclo[5. 4. 0]undec- 7 -ene (DBU) as a base. The synthesized iminothiazoline-sulfonamides (176 - 185) were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on ureases. All of the synthesized compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity with IC 50 ranging 58 to 350 nM, while IC 50 of thiourea is 20090 nM. The excellent activity was shown by 3 -chloro- 4 -nitro (184) and meta flouro (183) derivatives with IC 50 58 and 64 nM, respectively. In an effort to elucidate the inhibition mechanism, molecular docking of (176 - 185) into the crystal structure of jack bean urease (PDB: ID 3 LA 4) was performed by using the molecular operating environment MOE program. The most favorable docking conformations of all the compounds were stacked well inside the active site. The most potent inhibitors (183) and (184) were further studied for their kinetics of inhibition. It was found that (183) is a mixed type inhibitor while (184) showed the competitive mechanism of inhibition. Synthesis of iminothiazolidinone-sulfonamide hybrids (186 - 196) was achieved by base catalyzed cyclization of sulfanilamide thioureas by reacting with <b>methyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> in dry ethanol. An efficient synthesis of coumarinyl thiazolyl thioureas hybrids (200 - 219) was carried out. 3 -Acetyl- 2 H-chromen- 2 -one (197) was synthesized by knoevenagel condensation reaction between salicylaldehyde and ethyl acetoacetate using piperidine as base. ?bromination of 3 -acetyl coumarin (197) was done by reaction with bromine in chloroform to afford 3 (bromoacetyl) - 2 H-chromen- 2 -one (198). 3 -(bromoacetyl) - 2 Hchromen- 2 -one (198) was cyclized into coumarinyl aminothiazole (199) by treating with thiourea in ethanol. The acid chlorides were treated with a solution of KSCN in dry acetone to convert into isothiocyanates followed by reflux with coumarinyl aminothiazole (199) to afford coumarinyl thiazolyl thioureas hybrids (200 - 219). A series of coumarinyl thiazolyl iminothiazolidinone hybrids (222 - 231) were synthesized. Coumarinyl aminothiazole (199) was converted into 2 -chloro-N-(4 -(2 oxo- 2 H-chromen- 3 -yl) thiazol- 2 -yl) acetamide (220) by treating with chloroacetyl chloride. The synthesis of key intermediate 2 -(4 -(2 -oxo- 2 H-chromen- 3 -yl) thiazol- 2 ylimino) thiazolidin- 4 -one (221) was achieved by heterocyclization of 2 -chloro-N-(4 (2 -oxo- 2 H-chromen- 3 -yl) thiazol- 2 -yl) acetamide (220) with ammonium thiocyanate. 2 -(4 -(2 -oxo- 2 H-chromen- 3 -yl) thiazol- 2 -ylimino) thiazolidin- 4 -one (221) had an active methylene group, So it was coupled with different substituted aromatic aldehydes using sodium methoxide in methanol to afford target compounds 5 (substitutedbenzylidene) - 2 -(4 -(2 -oxo- 2 H-chromen- 3 -yl) thiazol- 2 -ylimino) thiazolidin 4 -one (222 - 231). The synthesized coumarinyl thiazolyl iminothiazolidinone hybrids (222 - 231) were evaluated for urease inhibition activity. All of the synthesized analogues showed remarkable inhibitory activity with IC 50 ranging 8 to 34 nM, while IC 50 of thiourea is 20090 nM. The most potent compounds were 2, 4 di chloro (229) and meta nitro (222) derivatives with IC 50 values of 8 and 13 nM, respectively. A library of 5 -aminoindanone and 5 -aminoisoindolinone analogues were designed to develop bromodomain (BRDT) Inhibitors. For that purpose computational docking studies were performed for designed compounds against the human BRDT (PDB: ID 4 FLP). All the designed compounds stabilized the protein by making crucial hydrogen bonding interaction with Asn 109 through carbonyl oxygen of indanone and isoindolinone. Synthesis of amides and sulfonamides of indanone and isoindolinone (237 - 265) was achieved by reaction with various acid chlorides and benzene sulfonyl chlorides respectively. Synthesized analogues were screened for biochemical assay in dynamic scanning flourometry (DSF). It was found that most of the analogues were positive shifters i. e. stabilizing the protein. Binding affinities (Kd) of the analogues were determined by using protein observed fluorinated NMR (proF NMR) and inhibitory activities were found from Fluorescence polarization (FP) analysis in terms of Ki and IC 50 values. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by available spectroscopic techniques like FTIR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, Mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and in some cases by single crystal XRD...|$|E
