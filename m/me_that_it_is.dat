25|$|My friend, space lawyer Andrew G. Haley, {{who likes}} to explore {{historical}} questions as a hobby, later told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that the Russians – and not the Germans as is popularly supposed – founded the first rocket society in the world. At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, {{at the time the}} Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of Space Navigation. In 1928 and during the following four years Professor Nikolai Rynin published a formidable nine-volume encyclopedia entitled Interplanetary Communications. It was the first authoritative summary of man’s knowledge of space travel.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
500|$|Einstein often {{referred}} to the [...] "inner voice" [...] {{as a source of}} both moral and physical knowledge: [...] "Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice." ...|$|E

500|$|This terrible anti-American {{academic}} {{has finally}} passed away...The obits and commentaries mentioned his book, ‘A People’s History of the United States,’ is the ‘textbook {{of choice in}} high schools and colleges around the country.’ It is a truly execrable, anti-factual piece of disinformation that misstates American history on every page. Can someone assure <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not in use anywhere in Indiana? If it is, {{how do we get}} rid of it before more young people are force-fed a totally false version of our history? ...|$|E
500|$|A {{textbook}} for {{an advanced}} undergraduate course. [...] "Experience has convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> pedagogically unsound (though logically correct) {{to start off}} with the construction of the real numbers from the rational ones. At the beginning, most students simply fail to appreciate the need for doing this. Accordingly, the real number system is introduced as an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property, and a few interesting applications of this property are quickly made. However, Dedekind's construction is not omitted. It is now in an Appendix to Chapter 1, where it may be studied and enjoyed whenever the time is ripe." [...] (p. ix) ...|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1897, {{thousands}} of people reported seeing [...] "airships" [...] {{in various parts of}} the United States. Many signed affidavits. Scores of people even reported talking to the pilots. Thomas Edison was asked his opinion, and said, [...] "You can take it from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a pure fake." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving written use of {{the term}} {{can be found in the}} diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B. A. Lowrance, who wrote the following on February 6, 1863 while in Pender County, southeastern North Carolina: [...] "I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea occurs to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no wonder we are called 'Tar Heels'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum {{formally}} petitioned Commissioner Rob Manfred for reinstatement, {{on grounds}} that Jackson had [...] "more than served his sentence" [...] in the 95 years since his banishment by Landis. [...] Manfred denied the request after an official review. [...] "The results of this work demonstrate to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not possible now, over 95 years since those events took place and were considered by Commissioner Landis, to be certain enough of the truth to overrule Commissioner Landis' determinations", he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson stated, [...] "I {{think the}} Court's {{decision}} of the question whether it complied with the Articles of War is uncalled for. The history and {{the language of the}} Articles are to me a plain demonstration that they are clearly inapplicable to this case and it is abundantly clear to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well within the war powers of the President to create a non-statutory military tribunal of the sort here in question." [...] He further wrote [...] "The right to convene such an advisory committee of his staff as a 'military commission' for the discharge of his duties toward prisoners of war is one that follows from his position as commander in chief." [...] Nonetheless, Jackson maintained that the President's power should be [...] "discharged, of course, in the light of any obligation undertaken by our country under treaties or conventions or under customs and usages so generally accepted as to constitute the laws of warfare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{wrote to}} Laurence on 22 February 1797 {{that he did}} not wish for a change in {{government}} lest it [...] "lead to a change in the constitution" [...] but agreed that a [...] "reform in the abuses of executive government" [...] was needed and that Fox would carry on the war [...] "for the same reason , and peace would be made by him more to advantage, because, made by him, there would be virtually a saving of the country's honour—made by Mr Pitt, the country is beat into it' made by Mr Fox it is a measure of choice". In March 1797 he looked with sympathy on a scheme by MPs and peers to form a government without Pitt and wrote a Memorial on the state of Ireland in which he called for Emancipation and the sacking of anti-Catholic members of the Irish government, which would reconcile Catholics to British rule and halt the spread of Jacobinism. He spoke in the Lords to put forward these proposals but it was rejected by 72 votes to 20. Fitzwilliam wrote on 2 April that he was [...] "the most isolated individual in politics in the king's dominions...a person who approves of nothing doing and therefore of no set of men whatever". The government had abandoned its principles and the Foxites were [...] "more hostile in ten times in my opinion, and more decided to act upon principles contrary to my views, than the Ministry". On 30 May Fitzwilliam met Burke at his home in Beaconsfield during his last illness before his death. Burke reported to Laurence that Fitzwilliam had [...] "a strong predilection to Mr Fox" [...] and [...] "influenced, too much so in my opinion, though very naturally and very excusably, by a rooted animosity against Mr Pitt". Fitzwilliam returned to his previous independence when the scheme for a [...] "third party" [...] collapsed and Laurence wrote to Fitzwilliam on 9 July (the day of Burke's death) that Burke had said on his deathbed: [...] "Inform Lord Fitzwilliam from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my dying advice and request to him, steadily to pursue that course in which he now is. He can take no other that will not be unworthy of him". Laurence said [...] "this was almost if not quite the last thing which he said on public affairs". Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 11 July of Burke's death: ...|$|E
