In this context, preserving the security of information, and making Information Security a core organisational aspect in public sector organisations, requires attention from management. Our research is the first known attempt to gauge <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward Information Security in Oman. We also consider how such attitudes influence Information Security governance. In addressing these issues, we review current compliance with Information Security procedures in Omani public sector organisations, review <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward Information Security governance practices, and explore how <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward Information Security impact upon these aspects...|$|R

The study was carried out through a survey of senior executives in large, UK, business-to-business organisations {{from a number of}} industries and the results indicate that there is an interrelationship between market intelligence systems, <b>management</b> <b>attitude</b> towards coordination, and collaboration between sales and marketing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{classify}} appearance <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> into groups and analyze the difference of self-efficacy and body satisfaction by the groups. Questionnaires were administered to 255 college students living in Deagu Metropolitan City and Kyungbook province. The data collected were analyzed by using frequency, factor analysis, cluster analysis, correlation analysis, ANOVA, Duncan-test, t-test, and χ 2 -test. The findings were as follows. Appearance <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> of college students were classified into three groups such as group health body, low body interest group, emphasizes collective body. The appearance <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> showed significant correlation with the sub-variables of self-efficacy and body satisfaction. Male students showed no significant difference in self-efficacy by the groups while female students showed a significant one in task performance which was a sub-variable of self-efficacy. Both of the male and female students showed a significance of difference in the gap between actual and ideal weight which was a sub-variable of body satisfaction by the groups. Gender of college students showed distinction between the sub-variables of self-efficacy factors such as task performance, and anxiety and body satisfaction such as BMI, the difference between current height and idea...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the relationship between}} gambling behaviour (gambling frequency and problem gambling severity) and financial management practices (cash management, risk management, and general <b>management),</b> financial <b>management</b> <b>attitudes,</b> and money attitudes (materialism, achievement, budget, obsession, and anxiety) in a sample of 118 participants (45 males, 73 females) recruited from a university. The findings revealed that gambling frequency was not significantly associated with any financial <b>management,</b> financial <b>attitude,</b> or money attitude variable but that problem gambling severity was significantly positively associated with financial <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> and obsession and negatively associated with budget. However, problem gambling severity scores were no longer significantly correlated with these factors after controlling for demographic and socio-economic factors. It was concluded that future research evaluating multiple dimensions of practices and attitudes with reliable and valid standardised instruments in large community or clinical samples is required in order to design cognitive interventions for problem gambling that facilitate changes in general beliefs about the importance of money...|$|R

Using {{a combination of}} interview and survey techniques, we explore how Nigerian SMEs perceive and deal with crisis, and motivations as well as practices adopted for engaging in crisis planning. Specifically, we consider the impacts of actual experience, crisis awareness and top <b>management</b> <b>attitude</b> on crisis <b>management</b> planning. An interpretive approach was adopted for the analysis as was use of quantitative statistical package. Our {{results indicate that the}} level of awareness generates a higher degree of concern for crisis management planning than both top <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> and actual crisis experience, and a lack of awareness significantly limits firms’ preparedness for crisis management and business continuity...|$|R
40|$|Sensor network <b>attitude</b> <b>problem</b> {{consists}} in retrieving {{the attitude of}} each sensor of a network knowing some relative orientations between pairs of sensors.

The proposed algorithm solves the problem {{when all of the}} relative attitudes are known. A complete characterisation of the algorithm is established: spatial complexity, time complexity and robustness. Our algorithm is validated in simulations and with real experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focused on how forests will be managed in the future {{in light of the}} {{increased}} emphasis being put by the public on the ecological and recreational values of forests, the trend towards an increased share of non-resident forest owners, and the increased female forest ownership. The value and belief basis of forest <b>management</b> <b>attitudes</b> was explored using a questionnaire sent to a sample of private forest owners ‘residing on’ (n = 995, return rate = 51. 3 %) and ‘not residing on’ the forest property (n =  997, return rate = 50 %). The results showed that a share of private forest owners strongly value both the view that the forest should predominately be used for timber production and the view that preservation is most important. The proposed hierarchical structure of influence, in which the forest <b>management</b> <b>attitude</b> was influenced by values and beliefs, was supported in the study. The ecological, recreational, and production forest values primarily influenced the most closely related forest <b>management</b> <b>attitude,</b> even if some cross-sectional effects and some effects of socio-demographics were found, showing that the view a private forest owner has on different forms of management styles is shaped by the perceived multiple values of the forest...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of <b>management’s</b> <b>attitudes</b> and {{responses}} to union activities in 20 call centres in Western Australia. Australian unions have identified call centres as an important sector to organise, but past research has acknowledged the importance of employer recognition of union rights to organise within the workplace as {{critical to the success}} of a union campaign. In addition, there is now substantial literature illustrating call centres as high control workplaces, and therefore difficult sites for unions to organise, although the question as to what extent these high control strategies reflect <b>management’s</b> <b>attitude</b> towards union organisation in call centres has been much less addressed. This article outlines management's stance towards unions within the sample of Western Australian call centres, detailing the forms their co-operation and resistance take. It explores the link between management's control strategies and their attitudes towards unions and, finally, identifies several factors influencing management's stance towards unions. ...|$|R

40|$|The project {{management}} literature on project success is rich. Numerous papers {{focus on the}} evolution of the understanding of project success, identification of success criteria and critical success factors. Critical success factors increase the potential for achieving project success, while project success can be evaluated with the help of success criteria. Although the interrelationships between critical success factors and success criteria are rarely analyzed, yet there is a strong demand for it. The aim of this paper is twofold. One of the aims is to identify the impact of one of the critical success factors, the project manager’s project <b>management</b> <b>attitude</b> on project success. The other aim is to highlight the interrelationship between the project manager’s personal characteristics and project <b>management</b> <b>attitude</b> and leadership style, which are three critical success factors. These aim to address the shortcoming mentioned above, which is considering the lack of the interrelationships between critical success factors and success criteria.
