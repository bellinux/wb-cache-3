5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was {{actually}} a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Motohiro {{wanted to}} return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early {{in the making of}} the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> that could not be adapted into a live-action film.|$|E

50|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Matt Withers, who reviewed the film for JoBlo.com, praised both 'the cast, {{and the character}} development'. He stated that Courtney Hope is a 'believable' leading lady and that 'Bruce Payne shows up as a trucker in a throwaway role that he <b>makes</b> <b>anything</b> but'.|$|R
25|$|Fixed: The fixed {{signs are}} Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. A native with mainly fixed signs has the {{strength}} and endurance to see things through and to uphold the status quo. They need stable homes, careers and partnerships and prefer the known to uncertainty. Fixed subjects are loyal and dependable but can be very obstinate. A subject lacking fixed signs cannot stick with anything or see anything through, and will tend {{to walk away from}} problems. They may be too easily bored or too busy chasing rainbows ever to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> substantial happen. Planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses, or an emphasis on earth in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|The revolt {{may have}} {{involved}} {{the death of}} David's eldest son. Before recounting the war against Máel Coluim, Orderic Vitalis reported the death of this son {{at the hands of}} an exiled Norwegian priest; but Orderic's account is so obscure {{that it is difficult to}} <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> of it. The priest was reportedly a member of David's household, and was put to death by being bound to the tails of four horses. Whether or not the two events were connected, Máel Coluim escaped unharmed into areas of Scotland not yet under David's control, and there gained shelter and some measure of support; when Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair renewed his claim to the throne six years later, he had the support and protection of the king of Moray.|$|E
25|$|Mullich {{contracted}} the Dreamers Guild {{to do the}} programming, artwork and sound effects. Its S.A.G.A. game engine {{was seen as an}} ideal user interface for the player to interact with the environment and to converse with the characters in AM's world. It was decided early on that high resolution graphics were necessary to capture the nuances and mood of Ellison's vivid imagination, and so Technical Director John Bolton adapted the engine to utilize SVGA graphics and included the Fastgraph graphics library. Mullich and Cyberdreams art director Peter Delgado had frequent meetings with Dreamers Guild art director Brad Schenck to devise art direction complementing the surreal nature of the story. Since the story takes place in the mind of a mad god who can <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> happen, the team chose a variety of art styles for each of the scenarios, ranging from the unsettling perspectives used in German Expressionist films to pure fantasy to stark reality. Assistant art director Glenn Price and his team rendered more than 60 backgrounds utilizing a number of 2D and 3D tools, including Deluxe Paint and LightWave. Hundreds of animations were drawn by assistant art director Jhoneil Centeno and his team of animators.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Payne {{appeared}} in the horror film Prowl as a [...] "blatantly untrustworthy" [...] "hillbilly truck driver" [...] named Bernard in the film. Matt Withers, who reviewed the film for JoBlo.com, stated that [...] "Bruce Payne shows up as a trucker in a throwaway role that he <b>makes</b> <b>anything</b> but". [...] Payne also {{appeared in}} Carmen's Kiss (an adaptation of the Georges Bizet opera Carmen).|$|R
5000|$|Francis Heaulme recounted murder {{scenes with}} {{incredible}} precision. For example, he showed officers {{how to kill}} a sentry by having {{a firm grip on}} the back of his head with one hand and stabbing him in the carotid artery with the other, draw, and then retract. According to Abgrall, [...] "He doesn't lie. He never <b>makes</b> <b>anything</b> up. But he deliberately covers his tracks by mixing the crimes, dates and locations." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Spice Up Your Life" [...] {{was already}} {{finished}} {{and ready to}} be released, but nothing was recorded for the B-side. Every other song available {{had been used in}} the Spice album, and the group needed a new track for their next single. A session with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins—the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute—was booked. Because of the limited time and the scarce creative inspiration at that point, Virgin told the duo to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> they liked.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Melody Maker found 1987 [...] "inspirational", and [...] "the most exciting, most original record [...] {{heard in}} years". He also argued that: [...] "Some snatches [...] rather outstay their welcome, tugging tell-tale glitz {{away from the}} clifftop and dangerously close to smug obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> else you're very likely to hear on the radio dull and desperately humourless." [...] "It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics {{as little more than}} a brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town", a later article said, but [...] "believe me, it's far more than a gimmick".|$|E
500|$|Jones {{introduced}} Mardas to Lennon, {{and it was}} at {{this point}} that Mardas impressed Lennon with the Nothing Box; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD. Lennon later introduced the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his [...] "new guru", calling him [...] "Magic Alex". Mardas allegedly told Lennon about ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was [...] "working on", which he later denied either promising or discussing: a telephone that responded to its owner's voice and could identify who was calling, a force field that would surround the Beatles' homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers, which would actually {{be a part of the}} wallpaper. Mardas later asked for the V-12 engines from Lennon's Rolls-Royce and George Harrison's Ferrari Berlinetta car, so he could build a flying saucer. Mardas also denied making these claims.|$|E
5000|$|Deadly Poppy Field - The poppies in {{this field}} have a spicy scent and <b>makes</b> <b>anything</b> living faint. Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Field Mice had to get Dorothy, Toto, and Cowardly Lion out of the poppy field. In the 1939 film, the Wicked Witch of the West had enchanted some poppies to put the group to sleep. Their effects were {{neutralized}} when Glinda used her magic to make it snow.|$|R

Joffre says it has no military significance." ...|$|R
50|$|Manuela {{decides to}} rebuild her life. She meets Sansón (Mijaíl Mulkay), {{who comes to}} take {{possession}} {{of one of the}} houses he bought from Germán, while still owing him. This is why Manuela ends up sharing the house with Sansón's family. Manuela and Sansón fall in love with each other, but he has a relationship with Yuri (Majida Issa), who <b>makes</b> <b>anything</b> she can to keep him by her side and pushing him away from Manuela.|$|R

2500|$|He condemns {{the role}} of the Federal Reserve and the {{national}} debt in creating monetary inflation. The minority report of the U.S. Gold Commission states that the federal and state governments are strictly limited in their monetary role by , Clauses 2, 5, and 6, and , Clause 1, [...] "The Constitution forbids the states to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt, nor does it permit the federal government to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> a legal tender." [...] The Commission also recommended that the federal government [...] "restore a definition for the term 'dollar'. We suggest defining a 'dollar' as a weight of gold of a certain fineness, [...]999 fine." [...] On multiple occasions in congressional hearings he has sharply challenged two different chairmen of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.|$|E
2500|$|Among the few {{who knew}} of Lamarr's {{inventiveness}} was aviation tycoon Howard Hughes. Lamarr discussed her relationship with Hughes during an interview, saying that while they dated he actively supported her [...] "tinkering" [...] hobbies. He put his team of science engineers at her disposal, saying they would do or <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> she asked for.|$|E

40|$|Intellect will {{determine}} the victors in future conflict. Our adversaries will be largely unrestricted in their tactics, operating in spite of legal constraint and largely immune from conventional reprisal. Strategic thought in China, for example, <b>makes</b> <b>anything</b> that provides state advantage fair game and grist to the military mill. Pre-emptive, counter-conflict activities to prevent the emergence of conditions requiring prolonged campaigning and unpredictable, high-impact and smart operations by the Land component will be both enabled and underpinned by intellectual leadership and its novel concepts...|$|R

2500|$|After {{winning the}} title of African Champions League 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a {{declaration}} which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered {{the main reason for}} winning the tournament, he replied, [...] "We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika who got the Cup, but the whole team. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever <b>make</b> <b>anything.</b> Football is a game played by many players, it isn't Tennis or Squash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three-dimensional cakes, off-center cakes, cakes {{with sugar}} shards jutting from them, a {{caramelized}} sugar teeter-totter balancing equal rounds of fruit sorbet and crème fraîche. Cakes shaped like the Guggenheim Museum. Avant-garde pastry. Dessert artist Elizabeth Falkner takes these artistically inspired visions them into culinary delights. [...] "It {{is not my}} tendency to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> round," [...] she says, and her cakes are anything but. Topped with her signature explosion of sugar spirals, pulled sugar ribbons and fruit tuiles, Elizabeth Falkner’s dessert creations have become {{the talk of the}} pastry world.|$|E

2500|$|An {{exquisite}} draftsman whose delicate yet solid, fine-line figures {{made his}} work both distinctive and well-suited to the medium, Maneely {{was one of}} the relative stars of Atlas, along with such soon-to-blossom talents as Steve Ditko and John Romita, Sr. Writer/editor Stan Lee commented that, [...] "Joe Maneely to me would have been the next Jack Kirby. He also could draw anything, <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> look exciting, and I actually think he was even faster than Jack."

2500|$|British {{menswear}} designer, Kim Jones, remembers {{collaborating with}} Smalley: [...] "I remember shooting {{in an old}} Amish village with Luke during the winter— I think {{it must have been}} 15 degrees.

[...] He continued, [...] "Luke cared so much about everything in his work that everyone involved wanted to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> happen for him. He was such a great talent who was underestimated by many, but I’m sure future generations will appreciate everything he’s done." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first attempt}} at a {{national}} currency was during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775 the Continental Congress, {{as well as the}} states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills [...] "Continentals". The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787, as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states' ability to <b>make</b> <b>anything</b> but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28.|$|E
