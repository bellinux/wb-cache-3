The effect of external air flow on <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> was simulated in a subsonic wind-tunnel.

To accomplish this, receptance coupling techniques were used to couple a finite element model of a varying thickness resonator end plate to a mass-spring-damper model of the vibrating air mass in the resonator.

By allowing the end plate thickness to vary, the <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> of the non-optimized baseline resonator was improved significantly, 28 percent.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic numerical {{investigation of the}} sound <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> through a multilayer system consisting of a bagged gas and lightweight panel. The goal {{of the study is}} to better understand the effect of the gas on <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> and determine whether a gas with a slow speed of sound is beneficial for noise control applications. As part of the study, the density and speed of sound of the gas are varied independently {{to assess the impact of}} each on <b>transmission</b> <b>loss.</b> Results show that near grazing incidence the plane wave <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> through the multilayer system is more sensitive to the speed of sound than the density of the gas. In addition, it was found that a slow wave speed in the bagged gas provides more low-frequency <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> benefit than a fast wave speed. At low angles of incidence, close to the plate normal, the benefit is due to the reduction of the characteristic impedance of the gas. At high angles of incidence, the benefit is attributed to the fact that the incident waves at the air/gas interface are bent towards the surface normal. Since <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> is angle dependent, refraction in the slow gas layer results in a significant improvement in the <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> at high angles of incidence...|$|R
