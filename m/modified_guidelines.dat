40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} {{prevalence}} of amblyopia risk factors in children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Methods: A retrospective review of records of children with the diagnosis of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), who underwent probing from January 2009 to October 2011, was done. All of them underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation including cycloplegic refraction and strabismus evaluation before probing. Results: A total of 142 children were included in this study. The mean age at presentation was 22. 38 months (sample standard deviation (SSD) - 15. 88). Amblyopia risk factors were defined according to two sets of guidelines: The American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS) referral criteria guidelines and the new AAPOS Vision Screening Committee guidelines. Twenty-eight (20 %) children {{were found to have}} some form of amblyopia risk factor based on the referral criteria prescribed by AAPOS. However, on applying <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> described by Donahue et al., to analyze the same cohort, 21 children were found to have amblyogenic risk factors. Of these 28 children, 13 had significant astigmatism (> 1. 50 D), 8 children had hypermetropia (> 3. 50 D), and six children had anisometropia (> 1. 50 D). One child had significant cataract (media opacity > 1 mm). None of the children in this series had either myopia or strabismus. Conclusion: Prevalence of amblyopia risk factor was found to be 20 % in our study based on the older guidelines; however, it reduces to 14. 78 % by applying the <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Despite this reduction, importance of a comprehensive ophthalmic examination including cycloplegic refraction in all children presenting with NLDO cannot be overstated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Several {{advisory}} committees have recently recommended that alcohol consumption {{be limited to}} moderate levels. Moderate drinking has been defined generally as not more than two drinks per day for healthy men and not more than one drink per day for healthy, nonpregnant women. The impact of reducing alcohol consumption to within the recommended guidelines on the prevalence of two serious alcohol-related problems was examined by modeling the relationship between average daily ethanol intake and alcohol abuse and dependence. METHODS. The recommended drinking guidelines, both in their existing form and modified by a measure of impairment, were applied to the observed distribution of consumption derived from a large representative survey of the US general population. RESULTS. The results demonstrated that restricting drinking to the maximum allowable levels under the existing and the <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> would reduce the prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence by 14. 2 % and 47. 1 %, respectively, in the adult US general population. CONCLUSIONS. Implications of these findings are {{discussed in terms of}} the validity of the assumptions underlying the models and the nature and direction of future research that would form the basis of newly developed guidelines for safe drinking limits...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{avalanche}} of GaltOr (Feb. 23 1999) {{was the most}} serious single accident in Austria since 1954. There were 31 fatalities, 6 buildings destroyed and 18 buildings damaged. Due to an area of high pressure over the Bay of Biscaya and an {{area of low pressure}} over Scandinavia the Alps received moist air from the Atlantic and cold air from the Arctic. This situation leaded to intensive precipition in the Arlberg- AuBerfern- and Paznaun area in February 1999 and to many large avalanches. Calculations with the Samos Avalanche Model showed some interesting results. The pressure (which was calculated for those sites where most of the buildungs were destroyed) was in the order of 100 kPa. About 26 % of the totally released snow mass (136 kilotons) was transferred to the powder part of the avalanche. As a result of the avalanche the Austrian Government spent about 130 Mio ATS (about 10 Mio $) for different protection measures (supporting structures in the release zone, two catching dams [...] ) in this area. The two accidents (GaltOr and Valzur) leaded to new design criteria for hazard maps in Austria.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSepsis is {{a common}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in populations with a high prevalence of HIV, but the full package of early goal directed therapy (EGDT) for sepsis is not feasible in most low and middle-income countries. The objective was to develop emergency adult sepsis care guidelines for Botswana appropriate to available resources and local epidemiology in referral hospitals and in lower levels of care. MethodsThe individual components of guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign were compared with available resources for their applicability in a tertiary referral hospital in Botswana. Antibiotics were chosen based on the hospital antibiogram, national antibiotic guidelines, and the cost and availability of antibiotics. The preliminary algorithm was presented to emergency centre medical officers in a referral hospital for feasibility and acceptability of implementation. The referral hospital guideline was further modified as part of a National Guidelines Project for suitability to all levels of care. ResultsAn acceptable and feasible sepsis algorithm was developed and implemented in a referral hospital in Botswana in accordance with the established hospital process. In turn, it served {{as the basis for the}} development of a national guideline. DiscussionThe principles of EGDT are adaptable to Botswana, and are likely to be adaptable to a variety of low- and middle-income countries on the basis of local resources and epidemiology.

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} a systematic procedure for adapting, or ‘tailoring' the World Health Organisation's ‘global {{guidelines for the}} management of HIV/AIDS in adults and children' for use in two developing countries: Malawi and Barbados. Design. In order for these guidelines to achieve reproducibility, clinical flexibility, and clinical applicability, a systematic procedure is needed to tailor the guidelines to the local practice conditions of specific settings. Methods. A group of local experts in each country used a nominal group process to modify the global program on AIDS (GPA) guidelines for local use. Semantic analysis techniques, known as clinical algorithm nosology (CAN), were used to compare the two <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> with the global ones to determine the extent and type of differences between sets of guidelines. Results. Standard, locally-tailored algorithm map guidelines (AMG) were developed within 4 months. CAN semantic analysis showed that guideline structure was maintained; 572 / 858 (66. 6 %) decision nodes were found to be the same in the GPA/Malawi, GPA/Barbados and Malawi/Barbados comparisons. However, different guideline versions managed patients quite differently, as evidenced by clinical algorithm patient abstraction (CAPA) scores of between 0 and 8. 46 (0 = different; 8 = similar; 10 = identical). Analysis of the 197 specific differences found in these abstractions showed that 83 % were in approaches to diagnosis and therapy, while the remaining 17 % related to disease prevalence. Conclusions. Standard techniques involving consensus used to develop clinical guidelines can also be employed to tailor these guidelines to local settings.

40|$|Lower {{energy and}} protein intakes are well {{documented}} in patients on texture modified diets. In acute hospital settings, {{the provision of}} appropriate texture modified foods to meet industry standards is essential for patient safety and nutrition outcomes. The texture modified menu at an acute private hospital was evaluated {{in accordance with their}} own nutritional standards (NS) and Australian National Standards (Dietitians Association of Australia and Speech Pathology Australia, 2007). The NS documents portion sizes and nutritional requirements for each menu. Texture B and C menus were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively over 9 days of a 6 day cyclic menu for breakfast (n= 4), lunch (n= 34) and dinner (n= 34). Results indicated a lack of portion control, as specified by the NS, across all meals including breakfast (65 – 140 %), soup (55 – 115 %), meat (45 – 165 %), vegetables (55 – 185 %) and desserts (30 – 300 %). Dilution factors and portion sizes influenced the protein and energy availability of Texture B & C menus. While the Texture B menu provided more energy, neither menu met the NS. Limited dessert options on the Texture C menu restricted the ability of this menu to meet protein NS. A lack of portion control and menu items incorrectly modified can compromise protein and energy intakes.

40|$|A Quality Improvement Initiative to Improve Weight Management in Primary Care Obesity {{has become}} a major health problem. The disease and its {{associated}} comorbidities impact health of patients and increase healthcare costs. Primary care providers have the potential to proactively address weight management. The importance of both prevention and treatment of obesity argues for addressing this matter at every provider-patient encounter. The literature suggests that a large percentage of providers do not broach the subject of weight management with patients. The American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and The Obesity Society (TOS) have developed a guideline for dealing with weight management. It is lengthy, however, and a modified and quick reference tool that outlines the suggested interventions may assist providers. The purpose of this quality improvement project is to evaluate whether the use of {{a modified version of the}} AHA/ACC/TOS guideline is feasible, and whether providers express more comfort in addressing obesity issues with use of the protocol. The utilization of a brief moderated version of the protocol may improve the frequency of use thereby effectively addressing weight management interventions. The question is: Does the utilization of a modified version of the AHA/ACC/TOS guidelines affect provider’s willingness to initiate weight management education and counseling? Providers utilized Watson’s Theory of Human Caring to engage patients in conversations about weight. The AHA/ACC/TOS guideline was utilized to create a brief one page protocol for use at each patient visit for ten days. The providers kept a tally of how many patients were seen and listed reasons that prevented the <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> from being utilized. Analysis of the data suggest that the use of a modified protocol may facilitate the discussion of weight management.

Place and Duration of Study: This {{study was conducted in}} Al-Ahrar General Hospital (local treatment centre for Hepatitis C virus), Sharkia Governorate, Egypt and the Tropical Medicine Department, Zagazig University Hospitals, Sharkia Governorate, Egypt in the period from April 2011 to March 2012. Methodology: Fifty chronic HCV patients were selected out of 255 chronic HCV patients awaiting assessment for combined pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy according to the <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> of the National Committee for Control and Prevention of viral Hepatitis C in Egypt. Diagnosis of HCV was confirmed by detection of anti-HCV antibody and positivity for HCV RNA for more than 6 months. All patients were assessed by liver biopsy and noninvasive methods namely aspartate transaminase/platelet ratio (APRI), abdominal ultrasonography measuring caudate/right lobe ratio and liver stiffness measurement. Results: The accuracy in diagnosis of liver fibrosis using different methods in comparison to liver biopsy was 60 %, 84 %, 88 %, 90 %, 92 % and 84 % for APRI, ultrasonography, Fibroscan, combined Fibroscan/APRI, Fibroscan/ultrasonography and APRI/ultrasonography respectively.

A total of 28 isolates of C. neoformans from 25 patients (24 AIDS patients) were tested. The MICs were determined by the broth microdilution technique by following the <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> described in National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS) document M 27 -A, e. g., use of yeast nitrogen base medium and a final inoculum of 104 CFU/ml. The fluconazole MIC at which 50 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 50) and MIC 90, obtained spectrophotometrically after 48 h of incubation, were 4 and 16 μg/ml, respectively. Of the 25 patients studied, 4 died of active cryptococcal disease and 2 died of other causes. Therapeutic failure was observed in five patients who were infected with isolates for which fluconazole MICs were ≥ 16 μg/ml. Four of these patients had previously had oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC); three had previously had episodes of cryptococcal infection, and all five treatment failure patients had high cryptococcal antigen titers in either serum or cerebrospinal fluid (titers, > 1 : 4, 000). Although 14 of the 18 patients who responded to fluconazole therapy had previously had OPC infections, they each had only a single episode of cryptococcal infection. It appears that the clinical outcome after fluconazole maintenance therapy may be better when the infecting C. neoformans strain is inhibited by lower concentrations of fluconazole for eradication (MICs, < 16 μg/ml) than when the patients are infected with strains that require higher fluconazole concentrations (MICs, ≥ 16 μg/ml). These findings also suggest that the MICs determined by the modified NCCLS microdilution method can be potential predictors of the clinical response to fluconazole therapy and may aid {{in the identification of}} patients who will not respond to fluconazole therapy...|$|E
40|$|Sequencing microRNA, reduced {{representation}} sequencing, Hi-C {{technology and}} any method requiring {{the use of}} in-house barcodes result in sequencing libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to {{the limitations of the}} Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e. g. detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect detection of clusters on the flowcell during initial sequencing cycles. We propose simple software modifications (Long Template Protocol) that overcome this problem. We present experimental results showing that our Long Template Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage. Second and third, we present <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which are more stringent than the manufacturer's, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In such cases, we propose that the flowcell be re-hybridized and sequenced again using our Long Template Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the Long Template Protocol to increase accuracy...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{image quality}} and radiation dose of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) scanned using automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and reconstructed by strong adaptive iterative dose reduction three-dimensional (AIDR 3 D). Eighty-four consecutive CTCA patients were collected for the study. All patients were scanned using ATCM and reconstructed with strong AIDR 3 D, standard AIDR 3 D and filtered back-projection (FBP) respectively. Two radiologists who were blinded to the patients' clinical data and reconstruction methods evaluated image quality. Quantitative image quality evaluation included image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). To evaluate image quality qualitatively, coronary artery is classified into 15 segments {{based on the}} <b>modified</b> <b>guidelines</b> of the American Heart Association. Qualitative image quality was evaluated using a 4 -point scale. Radiation dose was calculated based on dose-length product. Compared with standard AIDR 3 D, strong AIDR 3 D had lower image noise, higher SNR and CNR, their differences were all statistically significant (P< 0. 05); compared with FBP, strong AIDR 3 D decreased image noise by 46. 1 %, increased SNR by 84. 7 %, and improved CNR by 82. 2 %, their differences were all statistically significant (P< 0. 05 or 0. 001). Segments with diagnostic image quality for strong AIDR 3 D were 336 (100. 0 %), 486 (96. 4 %), and 394 (93. 8 %) in proximal, middle, and distal part respectively; whereas those for standard AIDR 3 D were 332 (98. 8 %), 472 (93. 7 %), 378 (90. 0 %), respectively; those for FBP were 217 (64. 6 %), 173 (34. 3 %), 114 (27. 1 %), respectively; total segments with diagnostic image quality in strong AIDR 3 D (1216, 96. 5 %) were {{higher than those of}} standard AIDR 3 D (1182, 93. 8 %) and FBP (504, 40. 0 %); the differences between strong AIDR 3 D and standard AIDR 3 D, strong AIDR 3 D and FBP were all statistically significant (P< 0. 05 or 0. 001). The mean effective radiation dose was (2. 55 ± 1. 21) mSv. Compared with standard AIDR 3 D and FBP, CTCA with ATCM and strong AIDR 3 D could significantly improve both quantitative and qualitative image quality...|$|E

40|$|Agent systems {{claim to}} have {{advantages}} over traditional software concerning their functionality and usability. Unfortunately, it soon becomes clear that not only current systems cannot keep these promises, they even create additional new problems for the user. Based on the successful application of human-computer interaction (HCI) design guidelines {{in the context of}} traditional software, this paper picks up the idea of <b>modifying</b> HCI <b>guidelines</b> and applying them to agent systems. This raises {{the question of how to}} best <b>modify</b> HCI design <b>guidelines</b> in order to maximize their impact. The solution developed here shows that software agents can be significantly improved only through a delegation-oriented application of HCI design guidelines. Therefore, we first identify suitable HCI design guidelines, transform them in an agent context, and later map them onto the concept of delegation which has also been elaborated in an agent context. We present a guide for agent-based software engineering which is subsequently applied to the improvement of the professional information brokering system bizzyB for the special needs and capabilities of non-professional users...|$|R
