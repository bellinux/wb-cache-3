500|$|Rocket {{engineer}} G. Harry Stine worked alongside Coandă from 1961 to 1965 at Huyck Corporation, {{and interviewed}} him in 1962. In 1967, the magazine Flying printed an account written by Stine, which described {{the landing gear}} as retracting into the lower wing, with the fuel tank hidden in the upper wing. Stine wrote that Coandă flew on 10 December 1910, and described {{the heat from the}} [...] "two jet exhausts" [...] as being [...] "too much for me" [...] after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft. In the 1980s after Coandă's death, Stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft, including new details such as the name of <b>master</b> <b>mechanic</b> Pierre Clerget as the friend who helped build the turbo-propulseur. Stine's recounting of the 10 December flight included the group of eyewitness French dragoons, asbestos heat shields and metal deflector plates aft of the engine, intended taxiing with unintentional flight, a steep climb with a stall, Coandă thrown clear, and the aircraft crashing to the ground, burning. Stine gave his assessment that [...] "Coanda's turbopropulseur had elements of a true jet", but that the patent application had no indication of the [...] "critical stage—injection of fuel into the compressed air". He wrote that [...] "although there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time—the 1910 Coanda Jet and the 1938 Caproni Campini N.1—the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in Germany in 1938".|$|E

The 23-year-old actress and one-time Chaplin protégé, Barry, {{had had an}} affair with the actor in 1942. Barry became pregnant, and sued Chaplin for child support in 1943. Barry hired Scott to press her case in court. Scott convinced the court to rule a blood test inadmissible as evidence, even though the test seemed to indicate that Chaplin was not the father. At trial, Scott railed against the actor—who had a lengthy and public history of adulterous relationships and affairs with very young women. Among other things, Scott called Chaplin a [...] "pestiferous, lecherous hound", [...] "a little runt of a Svengali", a [...] "cheap Cockney cad", [...] "a hoary headed old buzzard" [...] and [...] "a <b>master</b> <b>mechanic</b> in the art of seduction".

2500|$|While Samuel Slater had {{established}} {{the first successful}} textile mill at Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1793, there remained no way to efficiently mass-produce cloth from the spun yarn produced by the early mills. The yarn was still outsourced to small weaving shops where it was woven into cloth on hand looms. The first woolen mill, and the second textile mill in the Blackstone Valley, was a [...] "wool carding mill", established in 1810 by Daniel Day, near the West River and Blackstone River at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Then, in 1813, a group of wealthy Boston merchants led by Francis Cabot Lowell, known as the Boston Associates, established the first successful integrated textile mill in North America at Waltham. Lowell had visited England in 1810 and studied the Lancashire textile industry. Because the British government prohibited the export of this new technology, Lowell memorized plans for the power looms on his return trip to Boston. With the skill of <b>master</b> <b>mechanic</b> Paul Moody, the first successful power looms were produced, harnessing {{the power of the}} Charles River. For the first time, all phases of textile production could now be performed under one roof, greatly increasing production, and profits. This was the real beginning of the Industrial Revolution in America.|$|E
