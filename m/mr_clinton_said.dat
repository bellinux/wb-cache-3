50|$|Dart {{received}} the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the ceremony, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> Mr. Dart had literally {{opened the doors}} of opportunities to millions of our citizens by securing passage {{of one of the}} nation's landmark civil rights laws.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have changed}} a great deal, Edgar," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Of course {{we have seen}} Rupert {{comparatively}} lately; but I {{think that you have}} changed more than he has from what you both were three years ago. You look older than he does, and your figure is more set." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{others were}} silent. Then <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You know, Percy, I {{do not wish}} to prove that one more than the other of the boys is ours; but {{naturally}} the woman would wish to benefit her own boy, and if it had been her own boy who had the mark, why should she not have told Edgar that she had made a mistake, and that it was Rupert who was her son?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Carlos Alberto Contreiras Gouveia, PREA's {{president}} said that the MPLA are facilitating the constitutional amendment process to perpetuate Dos Santos' presidential power by an indirect-electoral process that violate the constitution. In Aug 2009, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has urged Angola to hold credible elections. [...] "We look forward to Angola building on this positive step by including adopting of a new constitution, investigating and prosecuting past human rights abuses and holding timely, free and fair elections," [...] <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't say I'm extra gone on corpses,' he said, as {{they walked}} back to the Court. 'The smell of them ain't what you might call eau-de-Cologne.' The other jurymen laughed. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> often <b>said</b> witty things like that.|$|R
5000|$|Defenders of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> have <b>said</b> that Schmidt's {{coverage}} of her {{is not fair}} {{and he has been}} frequently criticized by the group Media Matters and other liberals. After breaking the Clinton email story, Media Matters's founder and chairman, David Brock, wrote an open letter to The New York Times about the story, [...] "prominent correction as soon as possible" [...] about the story. The Times did not run a correction. [...] The inspector general for the State Department said in May 2016 that Clinton's use of the account had violated State Department's record keeping policies.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{arrived at}} the mortuary, a gay red and white building, which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was sworn with the other jurymen, and with them {{repaired}} to see the bodies on which they were to sit. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was squeamish.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> as before, {{had gone}} out, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{did her best}} to {{entertain}} the two doctors. The specialist, who talked most incessantly himself, was extremely impatient of other people's conversation.|$|R
60|$|The morning came at {{last and}} found him feverish and parched, unable to move. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> sent for the doctor, a slow, {{cautious}} Scotchman, in whose wisdom <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> implicitly relied, since he always agreed with her own idea of her children's ailments. This prudent gentleman ventured to assert that <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> had caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs. Then, promising to send medicine and come again next day, went off on his rounds. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> grew worse; he became delirious. When his wife, smoothing his pillow, {{asked him how he}} felt, he looked at her with glassy eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{crossed her}} hands over her stomach and looked at her husband with self-satisfaction. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was awake, staring in front of him with wide-open, fixed eyes; various {{thoughts}} confusedly ran through his head.|$|R
60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly have liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> in fact, became worse. He {{came home}} later and later every night, {{and his wife}} was disgusted {{at the state of}} uncleanness which his curious wanderings brought about. He refused to take the baths which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{prepared}} for him. He was more silent than ever, but when he spoke it was in biblical language; and always hovered on his lips the enigmatical smile, and his eyes always had the strange, disconcerting look. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> perseveringly made him take his medicine, but she lost faith in its power when, one night at twelve, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> brought home with him a very dirty, ragged man, who looked half-starved and smelt distinctly alcoholic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I never!' <b>said</b> <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> quite aghast; and as {{she walked}} by the flower girl, snorted at her and looked so savagely that the poor little maiden quite started. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> walked very slowly, {{stopping}} {{now and then to}} look at a couple of women seated on a doorstep, or the children round an ice-cream stall. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> saw him pay a penny and give an ice to a little child who was looking with longing eyes at its more fortunate companions as they licked out the little glass cups. He remained quite a long while watching half a dozen young girls dancing to the music of a barrel organ, and again, to his wife's disgust, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> gave money.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> looked helplessly at her friend; {{she feared}} {{something}} was wrong, and she didn't {{know what to}} do. But the neighbour, with a significant look, pointed to the Daily Telegraph, which was lying on a chair. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> brightened up {{and took it to}} her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my man,' he <b>said,</b> as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> at last came in, 'what are you {{complaining}} of?... One moment,' he added, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{was about}} to reply. He opened his notebook {{and took out a}} stylographic pen. 'Now, I'm ready for you. What are you complaining of?' ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was disgusted to see {{her husband}} enter a public-house.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> crumbled up his bread, rolling {{it about}} on the table.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{began to}} cry, {{and the doctor}} looked at her compassionately.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> embraced Rupert in silence, {{she was too}} {{affected}} for speech.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> did {{not reply}} for several minutes; the women waited in silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> turned {{towards her}} and again {{put his hand}} on her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|On Sunday, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> put on Sunday clothes, {{and heading}} the little {{procession}} formed by <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{and the two}} children, went to church, carrying in his hand a prayer book and a hymn book. After dinner he took a little walk with his wife along the neighbouring roads, avenues and crescents, examining {{the exterior of the}} houses, stopping now and then to look at a garden or a well-kept house, or trying to get a peep into some room. <b>Mr</b> and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> criticised as they went along, comparing the window curtains, blaming a door in want of paint, praising a well-whitened doorstep....|$|R
5000|$|For <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jordan's roles {{have been}} manifold: Golfing companion. Smoother of ruffled {{feathers}} (he put the president {{back in touch}} with ZoÃ« Baird after the withdrawal of her nomination to be attorney general). Consoler in chief (after <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> was defeated for re-election as governor in 1980, after the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr. in 1993). Conduit to the high and mighty (he took <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 1991 to the Bilderberg conference in Germany, an exclusive annual retreat for politicians and businessmen). Go-between (he told Mike Espy he had to go as secretary of agriculture, helped win Warren Christopher a larger role as secretary of state and sounded out Gen. Colin L. Powell for a Cabinet job).|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{looked at}} him; {{he was quite}} calm, and smilingly {{returned}} her glance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In my bed!' screamed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b> 'Not if I know it! 'Ere, you,' she said, {{addressing}} the man, and pushing past her husband. 'Out you get! I'm {{not going to}} 'ave tramps and loafers in my 'ouse. Get out!' <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was an energetic woman, and a strong one. Catching hold of her husband's stick, and flourishing it, she opened the front door.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> did not answer; {{his wife}} walked rapidly {{backwards}} and forwards, wringing her hands.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{looked up}} from his nails, which he was paring with a pair of pocket scissors.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{heaved a}} deep sigh. 'And {{what do you}} think 'ad better be done now?' she asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{reached his}} office at a quarter to ten, except when the train, by some mistake, arrived up to time, {{when he arrived at}} nine-thirty precisely. On these {{occasions}} he would sit in his room with the door open, awaiting the coming of the office-boy, who used to arrive two minutes before <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> and was naturally much annoyed when the punctuality of the train prepared him a reprimand.|$|R
60|$|But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{stood outside}} the {{mortuary}} door, meditating, and the coroner's officer remarked {{that it was a}} wet day.|$|R
5000|$|She adds: [...] "Sexism is insidious, {{unconscious}} and affects {{women as well}} as men. Just because women didn't turn out in big enough numbers for <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> does not mean we should dismiss the troubling sexism and misogyny that marred the campaign... The fact so many women in America voted for Mr Trump over <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> is a get-out-of-jail-free card: female voters weren't bothered, so it can't be sexist. It can, and it is." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{month later}} a small party were {{assembled}} in Captain Clinton's bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys {{was standing with}} a baby in each arm. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> was lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain Clinton was {{walking up and down}} the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment was standing grave and sympathetic by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Sergeant Humphreys was in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled expression on his face.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> shrugged her shoulders. 'Why couldn't {{they go to}} the workhouse, I wonder? I've no {{patience}} with people like that.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Fresh {{from the}} {{off-season}} under new coach Matthew Elliott, <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that confidence within the Panthers team was high for 2007. [...] "Blokes like me, Trent Waterhouse and Luke Lewis {{have taken on}} a leadership role this year," [...] <b>Clinton</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We {{used to be the}} younger generation but we've become senior players ourselves." ...|$|R
