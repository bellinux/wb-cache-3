50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> by the two laboratory methods requires a standard engine, and the test procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming. The standard engine required for the test {{may not always be}} available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories. These and other considerations led to the search for a rapid method for the {{evaluation of}} the anti-knock quality of gasoline. Such methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers (ASTM D-2885) and others. Deriving an equation {{that can be used for}} calculating the octane quality would also serve the same purpose with added advantages. The term Octane Index is often used to refer to the calculated octane quality in contradistinction to the (measured) research or <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> The <b>octane</b> index can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, cracked gasoline etc. These different grades are considered as one group when blending to meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their anti-knock quality. The ability to predict the octane quality of the blends prior to blending is essential, something for which the calculated octane index is specially suited.|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{anti-knock}} quality, {{defined by}} the research and <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> (RON and MON), is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. Gasoline knock resistance can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular anti-knock blending agent with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K. The {{results indicate that the}} effects of fuel <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON). Detailed kinetic analyses are performed to illustrate the dependence of gasoline ignition delay times on fuel composition and, in particular, on ethanol content...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} relationship of autoignition delay time with temperature and pressure is employed to derive the propagation velocities of autoignitive reaction fronts for particular reactivity gradients, once autoignition has been initiated. In {{the present study}} {{of a variety of}} premixtures, with different {{functional relationship}}s, such gradients comprise fixed initial temperature gradients. The smaller is the ratio of the acoustic speed through the mixture to the localised velocity of the autoignitive front, the greater are the amplitude and frequency of the induced pressure wave. This might lead to damaging engine knock. At higher values of the ratio, the autoignition can be benign with only small over-pressures. This approach to the effects of autoignition is confirmed by its application to a variety of experimental studies involving:(i) Imposed temperature gradients in a rapid compression and expansion machine. (ii) Onset of knock in an engine with advancing spark timing. (iii) Development of autoignition at a single hot spot in an engine. (iv) Autoignition fronts initiated by several hot spots. There is much diversity in the effects that can be produced by different fuels in different ranges of temperature and pressure. Higher values of autoignitive propagation speeds lead to increasingly severe engine knock.

40|$|Simple {{surrogate}} fuels {{are needed}} to model practical fuels, which are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. The surrogate fuel should match the combustion and emissions behaviour of the target fuel as much as possible. This paper presents experimental results using {{a wide range of}} fuels in both the gasoline and diesel auto-ignition range, but of different volatilities and compositions, in a single cylinder diesel engine. Premixed combustion in a compression ignition engine is defined, in this paper, to occur when the injection event is clearly separated from the combustion and the engine-out smoke is very low - below 0. 05 FSN (filter smoke number). Under such circumstances, if the combustion phasing is matched for two fuels at a given operating condition and injection timing, the emissions are also comparable regardless of the differences in composition and volatility. For the experimental conditions considered, combustion phasing at a given operating condition and injection timing depends only on the octane index (OI), OI = (1 -K) RON + KMON, where RON and MON are research and <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> and K is an empirical constant that depends on operating conditions. A mixture of iso-octane, n-heptane and toluene can be found to match the RON and MON of any practical gasoline and will be a very good surrogate for the gasoline since it will have the same OI. If the compression ratio is greater than 14, practical diesel fuels, with DCN (derived cetane number) between 40 and 60, will have comparable ignition delays to n-heptane, which is an adequate surrogate for such fuels. However, premixed combustion can be attained only at much lower loads at a given speed with diesel fuels compared to gasolines...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMost of the time, Spark Ignition (SI) engine {{performance}} {{is limited by}} knock phenomena (especially for turbocharged engines), which are linked to fuel resistance to auto-ignition, quantified by its <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> (Research <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> – RON and <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> Number-MON). If high <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> are crucial for efficient high load operating points, they are less necessary at low load.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{improving}} the efficiency and reducing emissions is a constant challenge in combustion engine design. For spark ignition engines, these challenges have been targeted {{in the past decade}} or so, through ‘engine downsizing’ which refers to a reduction in engine displacement accompanied by turbocharging. Besides the benefits of this, it is expected to aggravate the already serious issue of engine knock owing to increased cylinder pressure. Engine knock which is a consequence of an abnormal mode of combustion in SI engines, is a performance limiting phenomenon and potentially damaging to the engine parts. It is therefore of great interest to develop capability to predict autoignition which leads to engine knock. Traditionally, rather rudimentary skeletal chemical kinetics models have been used for autoignition modelling, however, they either produce incorrect predictions or are only limited to certain fuels. In this work, realistic chemical kinetics of gasoline surrogate oxidation has been employed to address these issues. A holistic modelling approach has been employed to predict combustion, cyclic variability, end gas autoignition and knock propensity of a turbocharged SI engine. This was achieved by first developing a Fortran code for chemical kinetics calculations which was then coupled with a quasi-dimensional thermodynamic combustion modelling code called LUSIE and the commercial package, GT-Power. The resulting code allowed fast and appreciably accurate predictions of the effects of operating condition on autoignition. Modelling was validated through comparisons with engine experimental data at all stages. Constant volume chemical kinetics modelling of the autoignition of various gasoline surrogate components, i. e. iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene and ethanol, by using three reduced mechanisms revealed how the conversion rate of relatively less reactive blend components, toluene and ethanol, is accelerated as they scavenge active radical formed during the oxidation of n-heptane and iso-octane. Autoignition modelling in engines offered an insight into the fuel-engine interactions and that how the composition of a gasoline surrogate should be selected. The simulations also demonstrated the reduced relevance of research and <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> to the determination of gasoline surrogates and that it is crucial for a gasoline surrogate to reflect the composition of the target gasoline and that optimising its physicochemical properties and <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> to match those of the gasoline does not guarantee that the surrogate will mimic the autoignition behaviour of gasoline. During combustion modelling, possible deficiencies in in-cylinder turbulence predictions and possible inaccuracies in turbulent entrainment velocity model required an optimisation of the turbulent length scale in the eddy burn-up model to achieve the correct combustion rate. After the prediction of a correct mean cycle at a certain engine speed, effects of variation in intake air temperature and spark timing were studied without the need for any model adjustment. Autoignition predictions at various conditions of a downsized, turbocharged engine agreed remarkably well with experimental values. When coupled with a simple cyclic variability model, the autoignition predictions for the full spectrum of cylinder pressures allowed determination of a percentage of the severely autoigniting cycles at any given spark timing or intake temperature. Based on that, a knock-limited spark advance was predicted within an accuracy of 2 ° of crank angle. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{distillation}} curves (ASTM D 86) {{associated with}} multivariate calibration (PLS-Partial Least Squares) {{were used to}} predict MON (<b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>number)</b> and RON (research octane number) parameters of automotive fuel RMSEC getting values (Root Mean Square Error of Calibration) and RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction) smaller than the literature. RMSEC values obtained were 0. 051 and 0. 078, and RMSEP values were 0. 063 and 0. 085 for MON and RON, respectively. These low values along with high accuracy, when compared to standard test methods (ASTM D 2700 and ASTM D 2999), indicated that the PLS models were efficient to predict MON and RON values {{and can be used}} as an alternative to control quality for automotive gasoline...|$|E

In the agricultural year 2007 – 2008, one conducted several researches on sugar beet fermentation process {{in order to obtain}} bioethanol, using sugar beet as main biological raw material. The biotechnology for obtaining alcohol out of sugar beet was developed on three stages:- sugar beet preparation for fermentation;- yeast cultures obtaining;- sugar beet leaven fermentation. The ethanol samples obtained from each of the experimental lots of the experimental field have been analyzed in the Environmental Analysis Laboratory from the Research Institute for Analytical Instrumentation Cluj-Napoca. Therefore, one has determined all the characteristics of each bioethanol sample, according to the requirements of SR EN 15376 standard, in terms of using the bioethanol obtained during the carried out research as a component of automobile fuel, according to SR EN 228 : 2008 standard; one has also determined the superior caloric power, as well as the <b>Motor</b> and Research <b>Octane</b> <b>Numbers.</b> For an efficient alcoholic fermentation, one must comply with several conditions, such as: proper root grooming, before crushing, a temperature of the dilution water of 80 – 85 oC,as well as a temperature around 30 oC inside the fermentation instalation. Further more the utilization of a growth factor so as to stimulate the yeasts development and of some nitrogen compounds during fermetation, so as to have a satisfactory rate for the obtained bioethanol...|$|R
40|$|Dimerization {{of linear}} olefins {{represents}} an attractive route {{for the production}} of high <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> blending components. The oligomerization needs not only to be high conversion and to produce mainly dimers but also to be selective within the dimer range, as only certain isomers have advantageous blending <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> Moreover, the <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> of these dimers blend in a highly nonlinear fashion. Normally the focus for such gasoline polymerization processes is on maximizing branching; however, in this study we seek to maximize the fraction of allylic hydrogens, because we have shown that these are directly linked to the blending <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> of the species. 1 -Butene and 2 -butene produce different quality dimer gasoline. This unexpected result can be explained from a consideration of the isomerization kinetics between the butene monomers...|$|R
