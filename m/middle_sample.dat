30|$|Two {{features}} {{in the pattern of}} the <b>middle</b> <b>sample</b> movies differ from that of the latter films. These are captured in the decrease in polynomials from sixth order to fourth order. In short, the pattern is less articulated. For example, the lengthening of shots in the epilogue is not nearly so marked as in the later movies, suggesting less contrast between the action of the typical climax and the calm of the typical epilogue. In addition, the decline in shot duration is extended from the complication through to the point in the climax where the epilogue weakly turns toward longer-duration shots. This suggests that stylistically there is a bit more anticipation of action in the complication of movies of this era than in those that are more contemporary. In other words, the pattern of shot durations in movies from 1960 to 1985 is generally similar, but not identical, to those from 1990 to 2015. The overall later form is nascent but not fully present in the midsample movies.|$|E

The characterization also includes supernate samples pulled from the surface (347 inch) and 250 inch levels of the salt supernate. The three saltcake samples (HTF-E- 03 - 145, 146, and 147) were filled to nearly their capacity with saltcake and free liquid, with an average saltcake bulk density of 2. 06 g/cm 3. The undrained saltcake {{from the bottom of}} the <b>middle</b> <b>sample</b> (HTF-E- 03 - 146) had a water content of 4. 1 percentage weight, a 137 Cs activity of 0. 14 Ci per gallon of saltcake, and an alpha content of 1. 4 E+ 4 pCi/g. The undrained saltcake {{from the bottom of the}} bottom sample (HTF-E- 03 - 147) had a water content of 8. 5 percentage weight, a 137 Cs activity of 0. 17 Ci per gallon of saltcake, and an alpha content of 3. 0 E+ 4 pCi/g. Interstitial liquid drained from the <b>middle</b> <b>sample</b> (HTF-E- 03 - 146) had a density of 1. 43 g/cm 3, a soluble solids content of 45. 4 percentage weight, a 137 Cs activity of 0. 78 Ci per gallon of interstitial liquid, a nd an alpha content of 1. 1 E+ 4 pCi/mL. An analysis of material from the top of the top sample (HTF-E- 03 - 145) is provided in support of Nuclear Criticality Safety Evaluations. The as-received saltcake and the residual insoluble solids had a uranium- 235 enrichment of approximately 12. 2 per cent. Characterization focused on providing information on fissile radionuclides, potential neutron poisons, and other potential diluents. Supernate samples pulled from the surface and from the 250 in. levels of the C 1 and C 3 risers yielded information on the vertical and lateral tank supernate homogeneity. The 137 Cs content of these Tank 41 H samples averaged 0. 56 Ci/gal for the C 3 riser and 0. 65 Ci/gal for the C 1 riser. The 238 Pu content of the four unfiltered samples ranged from 1. 41 E+ 4 pCi/mL to 2. 21 E+ 4 pCi/mL. Scanning electron microscopy of saltcake from sample HTF-E- 03 - 146 revealed several features consistent with mineral dissolution: sub-rounded appearance of grains, lack of coatings by secondary precipitates, and crevices and indentations in some grains...|$|E

They were placed parallel to each other, equally spaced apart at 2 mm, with their long axes being perpendicular to the incoming nitrogen flow. Pore evolution in each sample during isothermal sintering was examined metallographically. The compositional changes across sample mid-cross section and surface layers were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, respectively. The two outer samples bent toward the middle one, while the <b>middle</b> <b>sample</b> was essentially distortion free after sintering. The distortion in the outer samples {{was a result of}} differential shrinkage between their outer and inner surfaces during isothermal sintering. The porous outer surface showed an enrichment of oxygen around the large pores as well as lower magnesium and zinc contents than the interior and inner surface of the same sample, while the inner surface was distinguished by the presence of AlN. The differential shrinkage was caused by different oxygen contents in local sintering atmosphere and unbalanced loss of magnesium and zinc between the outer and inner surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Issue {{of finding}} a wavelet matched to signal has been {{addressed}} by various researchers in past. This paper presents a new method of estimating wavelet that is matched to a given signal in the statistical sense. The key idea lies in the estimation of analysis wavelet filter from a given signal and {{is similar to a}} sharpening filter used in image enhancement. The output of analysis wavelet filter branch after decimation is written in terms of filter weights and input signal samples. It is then viewed to be equivalent to difference of <b>middle</b> <b>sample</b> and its smoother estimate from the neighborhood which then needs to be minimized. To achieve this, minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is employed using the autocorrelation function of input signal. Since wavelet expansion acts like Karhunen-Lo&# 232;ve type expansion for generalized 1 /f&# 61538; processes, it is assumed that the given signal is a sample function of an nth order fractional Brownian motion. Its autocorrelation function is used with MMSE criterion to estimate analysis wavelet filter. Next, a method is proposed to design 2 -band FIR perfect reconstruction biorthogonal filter bank. This result in compactly supported wavelet matched statistically to given signal. Further, it is shown that compactly supported wavelet with desired support can be designed from a given signal. The theory is supported with number of simulation examples...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{drilling}} {{has produced}} the samples of impact melt breccias examined here. All samples examined here are from the YAX- 1 borehole [7]. Two main types of impact breccias have been studied. The first type is a green altered impact meltrock found in the lower portion of the impact sequence. The texture of the rock is microcrystalline and is composed of pyroxene, plagioclase, and alkali feldspars. Its composition is consistent with continental margin rocks. It is generally massive with some flow structure. The rock was brecciated and altered after solidfication and contains small amounts of both shocked and unshocked clasts of the impacted lithologies. These lithologies include lithic quartzite, and isolated feldspar crystals. The compositions of these rocks {{are similar to those}} seen in meltrocks sampled by the Yucatan- 6 borehole [8 - 9]. Our study includes samples YAX- 1 _ 861. 4, YAX- 1 _ 863. 51, and YAX- 1 _ 876. 46, which represent both the top and lower portion of the green impact meltrock. The <b>middle</b> <b>sample</b> in the sequence has the least amount of (mineralogical) alteration [10]. The second type of melt breccia under study is a brown altered impact meltrock. It also has a microcrystalline texture and both shocked and unshocked clasts of the target material. Even though this rock type has been altered, remnant schleiren, metaquartzite, and micritic calcite have been identified. Sample YAX- 1 _ 841. 32 is representative of this type of rock.

40|$|Non-homogeneous {{mixing of}} methane (NHM) within closed {{chambers}} was studied under laboratory conditions. The experimental set-up {{consisted of a}} PVC vented chamber of 5. 3 litres of effective volume fitted with a power-adjustable 12 V fan. NHM within the chamber was studied according to fan position (top vs lateral), fan airflow strength (23 vs 80 cubic feet per minute) and the mixing time before sample withdrawal (5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes). The potential bias of methane flux densities caused by NHM was addressed by monitoring the difference between linearly expected and estimated flux densities of ca. 400, ca. 800 and ca. 1, 600 mg CH 4. m- 2 d- 1. Methane within the chamber was under non-homogeneous conditions. Accordingly, methane concentrations {{at the bottom of}} the chamber were between 20 to 70 % higher than those recorded at the middle or top sections of the chamber, regardless of fan position, fan air-flow strength or time before sample withdrawal. NHM led to notable biases on flux density estimation. Accordingly, flux density estimated from top and <b>middle</b> <b>sampling</b> sections were systematically lower (ca. 50 %) than those expected.

40|$|Fifty-seven white mica clasts were {{separated}} from five samples taken from near {{the bases of}} turbidites {{ranging in age from}} early Albian to middle Eocene. Twenty two (39 %) of the micas have ages between 260 and 340 Ma and five (9 %) have older ages (~ 400 - 600 Ma). The former age range is characteristic of the North American Alleghenian orogeny and the Iberian Variscan orogeny. The latter range is characteristic of the North American Acadian orogeny and older basement rocks in the Grand Banks and Newfoundland areas. Both age ranges are present in the <b>middle</b> Eocene <b>sample,</b> but only the younger range occurs in the <b>middle</b> Albian <b>sample.</b> This difference could be a sampling artifact. If this is not the case, then the most likely explanation is that the Acadian-aged micas within the Meguma Zone underlying the Grand Banks were totally reset by Alleghenian reactivation of the zone, a feature which occurs extensively in Nova Scotia. The addition of Acadian-aged micas in the <b>middle</b> Eocene <b>sample</b> may reflect a change in sediment provenance as drainage systems unrelated to rift topography developed. With the exception of one clast dated at 186 Ma, the 12 other micas obtained from the upper Paleocene sample yielded ages between 55 and 74 Ma, with 7 falling within ± 2 m. y. of the 57 -Ma age of the sample indicated by the biostratigraphic age-depth plot for Site 1276. This, together with the volcaniclastic content of the sample, indicates an input from near-contemporaneous volcanism. The nearest known occurrences of near-contemporaneous late Paleocene volcanism that could have produced white micas are in Greenland and Portugal, some 2000 and 1500 km distant, respectively, from Site 1276 during the Paleocene. However, ages of volcanism in these areas indicate that they could probably not be sources of micas younger than 60 m. y., which suggests some as-yet unknown volcanic source in the North Atlantic area. Accumulation in the Grand Banks area of airborne-transported volcaniclastic material from eruptions of slightly different ages, followed by a single resedimentation event, could account for the spread of dates obtained from the sample. White micas from the lowermost Albian sample show a spread of ages between 37 and 284 Ma that is completely different from the age distribution pattern of the middle Albian and <b>middle</b> Eocene <b>samples.</b> The sample location is between, and at least 25 m above and below, two igneous sills dated at 98 and 105 Ma. The sills have narrow thermal aureoles and ages older than the youngest detrital micas in the sample. It is unlikely, therefore, that the spread of mica ages in the sample is due to partial resetting of ages caused by thermal effects associated with the intrusion of the sills. The resetting may have been associated with a longer lived thermal event...|$|R

In aquatic environment, the overall estrogenic activity is often due to the presence of a mixture of chemicals and their degraded products which can induce synergistic effects. Current strategies for monitoring estrogen-like chemicals are based on the use of a battery of in vivo and in vitro ecotoxicological tests. In this regard, the aim of the present work was to carry out a bio-monitoring study for testing estrogenicity of the Chienti river (Marche Region, Italy) by using both an E-screen and a vitellogenin (Vtg) induction assay in juvenile goldfish.
