40|$|Dog snapper (Lutjanus jocu Bloch and Schneider 1801) and <b>mahogany</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus mahogoni Cuvier 1828) are {{infrequently}} caught snappers in {{the southeastern}} U. S. primarily occurring off of southern Florida. The species were opportunistically sampled from commercial and recreational fisheries {{in the southeastern}} U. S. from 1979 to 2015. Fish were aged (56 dog snapper and 54 <b>mahogany</b> <b>snapper)</b> by counting opaque zones on sectioned sagittal otoliths. Otoliths of both species were easily interpretable and agreement between readers was acceptable. Analysis of otolith edge-type revealed that annuli formed between May and July on both species. Dog snapper ranged from 200 – 837 mm total length (TL) and ages 2 – 33, while <b>mahogany</b> <b>snapper</b> ranged from 270 – 416 mm TL and ages 2 – 18. The Von Bertalanffy growth equations were Lt =  746 (1 –e(− 0. 20 (t− 0. 32))) and Lt =  334 (1 –e(0. 31 (t+ 1. 19))) for dog snapper and <b>mahogany</b> <b>snapper,</b> respectively. The weight-length relations were W =  1. 31  ×  10 − 5 L 3. 03 (n =  78, r 2  =  0. 99) and W =  5. 40  ×  10 − 6 L 3. 15 (n =  79, r 2  =  0. 79) for dog snapper and <b>mahogany</b> <b>snapper,</b> respectively, where W = whole weight in grams...|$|E
