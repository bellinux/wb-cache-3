50|$|The {{frequency}} change which occurs as the beam voltage is raised {{is referred to}} as electronic tuning, and is typically 0.2% of the operating frequency measured from half power to cessation of oscillation. For larger {{frequency change}}s <b>mechanical</b> <b>tuning</b> is used which is obtained by moving one wall of the cavity. The moveable wall is, in fact, a piston which can be moved in a tunnel whose cross-section is that of the wall which it replaces. The range of <b>mechanical</b> <b>tuning</b> is usually limited by parasitic resonances which occur when the oscillating frequency and the frequency of one of the many other cavity resonances coincide. When this happens, serious loss is introduced, often sufficient enough to suppress oscillation completely. Typically, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>tuning</b> range of 4% can be obtained but greater ranges have been demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{are more}} than ever pushed to their limits for {{performance}} reasons. Consequently, they become increasingly nonlinear and they {{are more prone to}} undergo aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations. Structural nonlinearities affect aircraft such as the F- 16, which can undergo store-induced limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). Furthermore, transonic buzz can lead to LCOs because of moving shock waves in transonic flight conditions on many aircraft. This study presents a numerical investigation of passive LCO suppression on a typical aeroelastic system with pitch and plunge degrees of freedom and a hardening stiffness nonlinearity. The absorber used is made of a piezoelectric patch glued to the plunge springs and connected to a resistor and an inductance forming a RLC circuit. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>tuned</b> mass damper absorber of similar configuration is also considered. The piezoelectric absorber features significant advantages in terms of size, weight and tuning convenience. The results show that both types of absorber increase the linear flutter speed of the system in a similar fashion but, when optimal, they lead to a sub-critical bifurcation while a super-critical bifurcation was observed without absorber. Finally, it is shown that the addition of a properly <b>tuned</b> nonlinear spring (<b>mechanical</b> absorber) or capacitor (piezo- electric absorber) can restore the super-criticality of the bifurcation. The tuning of the nonlinearity is carried out using numerical continuation...|$|R

50|$|Electrical tuning is a {{mechanism}} by which vertebrates such as frogs and reptiles, which lack a long cochlea, discriminate sound.

The basilar membrane of animals with long cochleae also vibrates at different locations along the membrane in response to different frequency sounds. Since the reptilian ear lacks a long cochlea, electrical tuning provides an alternative mechanism for perceiving differences in sound.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>tuned</b> {{vibration}} absorbers (MTVAs) are devices used {{to mitigate}} the vibrations of a structure around one of its eigenfrequencies. By introducing an additional degree of freedom in the structure, MTVAs allow to split the peak {{of interest in the}} frequency response in two peaks with lower amplitudes. The design of MTVAs is usually based on the (approximate) equal-peak method proposed by Den Hartog. A closed-form exact solution was however obtained by Asami and Nishihara, for which the two peaks of the frequency response have exactly the same amplitude. Similarly to MTVAs, piezoelectric tuned vibration absorbers (PTVAs) allow to damp efficiently a specific peak of the frequency response. Although a pole placement technique can be used to design such devices, tuning rules are usually based on approximate equal-peak methods which define the optimum values of the resistor and the inductance of the shunt. Very recently, Asami and Nishihara’s exact solution has been extended for the equal-peak method to PTVAs by the authors of the present paper. The first contribution {{of this paper is to}} illustrate this new optimum design of a series RL piezoelectric shunt on a realistic example. A clamped-free steel plate excited with two piezoelectric actuators and shunted with two piezoelectric transducers is modelled using plate elements (laminates). Non-linearity is then introduced in the host structure, and a new non-linear PTVA for mitigating the vibrations of the non-linear host structure is proposed. The improvement of damping performances in the presence of structural non-linearties using a non-linear PTVA is illustrated. 1...|$|R

50|$|A {{monolayer}} of MoS2 can be strained {{at least}} up to 10%, comparable to graphene. Under {{the application of}} strain, {{a decrease in the}} direct and indirect band gap is measured that is approximately linear with strain. Importantly, the indirect bandgap decreases faster with applied strain to the monolayer than the direct bandgap, resulting in a crossover from direct to indirect band gap at a strain level of around 1%. As a result, the emission efficiency of monolayers is expected to decrease for highly strained samples. This property allows <b>mechanical</b> <b>tuning</b> of the electronic structure and also the possibility of fabrication of flexible electronics i.e. on flexible substrates.|$|E
