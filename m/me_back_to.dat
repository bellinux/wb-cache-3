5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to,</b> 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

The Virginia reel is among the square dances classified as the state dance. In March 2015, after 20 years without a state song, Virginia received two: [...] "Our Great Virginia" [...] (official traditional state song) and [...] "Sweet Virginia Breeze" [...] (official popular state song).

The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun.

500|$|In September 2004, Paige began {{a weekly}} Sunday {{afternoon}} radio show, Elaine Paige on Sunday, between 1 and 3 PM on BBC Radio2, featuring music from musical theatre and film. The 400th edition was broadcast on Sunday 29 July 2012. In an unfavourable review, {{the show was}} described by Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian as [...] "a chilly, alienating listening experience" [...] and a [...] "rare wrong move" [...] {{on the part of}} Radio2. Lisa Martland of The Stage agreed that [...] "it is by far the music that brings <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the programme... and not her lightweight presenting style". However, the show regularly attracts 3million listeners, and interviews are also featured each week. Paige also focused on television appearances, playing Dora Bunner in the 2005 ITV adaptation of Agatha Christie's A Murder Is Announced in the Marple series, before performing a guest role as a post mistress in Where the Heart Is. The episode of Marple was watched by 7.78million viewers.|$|E
500|$|However, Fisher {{was going}} through a divorce, and his {{personal}} situation meant that he was unable to perform the rewrites. This meant that script editor Douglas Adams, aided by Graham Williams, had to perform a complete rewrite of the story {{over the course of a}} weekend. According to Adams, Graham Williams [...] "took <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his place, locked me in his study and hosed me down with whisky and black coffee for a few days, and there was the script". The revised script, now titled The Curse of the Sephiroth, was credited to [...] "David Agnew", a standard pseudonym used by the BBC and which had been previously used on Doctor Who for the season fifteen serial The Invasion of Time. The serial was subsequently retitled City of Death on 8 May 1979. Adams would later reuse elements of City of Death, along with the unfinished Doctor Who serial Shada (1979; 2003), in his novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987). In Part One, Romana makes a throwaway reference to a great art gallery called the Braxiatel Collection; the Virgin New Adventures novel series would later expand on this, introducing the character Irving Braxiatel, a Time Lord. Braxiatel also appears in the Bernice Summerfield series of novels and audio dramas and in the Gallifrey series of audio dramas.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were not}} as positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two criticized the idea that Scully would give her child up for {{adoption}} solely based on the word of Jeffrey Spender, noting [...] "if she wasn't {{going to give it}} away for the sake of its own protection after a UFO cult abducted it , then why should she because Jeffrey Spender of all people comes along and informs her that it's under threat?" [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> this world of The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Yolande Geralds, who also directed the clip for Songz's previous single. [...] "I Invented Sex." [...] The video was filmed on October 7, 2009. Wynter Gordon, DJ Clue as well as Jessica White performing {{the owner of the}} Party make appearances in the video. Stills from the clip were released on the following day, October 8, 2009. A combination video was released for the dual clips of [...] "Say Aah" [...] and [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] and the videos were also released separately. Songz confirmed to MTV News in November 2009 that the latter would be a continuation of the previous. On the video, Songz said that he wanted the video to be [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "adult" [...] in which everyone had fun. He further explained, [...] "The song speaks on more so a club atmosphere, but the video is more lofty — sexy women all over the place, adults having fun. This one lady in particular, she's representing the independent women without taking it over the top. She's got her own. She takes <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her crib — so we invent sex together." [...] In a review of the video, calling the song itself [...] "ballerific", Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy said, [...] "the video keeps it pretty grown in sexy", commenting the choice of button down shirts as attire and commending Fabolous's part, which he said, [...] "has a very plain-spoken feel to it, and because his blue-framed shades are matching his shirt.".|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
