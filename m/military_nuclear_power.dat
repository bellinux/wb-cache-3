5000|$|SM-1 was a 2-megawatt {{nuclear reactor}} {{developed}} by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for the US Army Nuclear Power Program (ANPP) in the mid-1950s. The compact [...] "package" [...] reactor was designed to produce electricity and generate heat for remote military facilities. The first, the SM-1, served as the Army's primary training facility to train reactor operations personnel from all three services (Army, Navy and Air Force). In 1954, the Department of Defense placed the US Army {{in charge of all}} <b>military</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants except those used for propulsion by the US Navy. The Army's Chief of Engineers established the US Army Engineer Reactors Group in April 1954, and decided to construct the SM-1 facility at the Corps of Engineers headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, about 18 miles south of Washington, D.C.. About 800 personnel were trained on the SM-1 during its operational life, from 1957 to 1973. The power plant was shut down in March 1973, and is monitored within a [...] "restricted access" [...] section of the post. Inspectors enter the shut-down operations control room every decade or so, and the building may be demolished [...] "about 50 years" [...] after the reactor core was removed, possibly around 2030.|$|E

For example, many countries operate nuclear power plants, and some, including Korea, are developing software-based emergency shutdown systems. Should emergency situations such as reactor overheating occur, software is required to initiate emergency shutdown procedures while maintaining the plant in a safe state. When software {{is used as a}} control agent in these systems, safety becomes a paramount concern. In the worst case, software malfunctions, i. e., unsafe software control outputs can result in serious and unacceptable consequences such as death, injury, or environmental damage. In order to ensure safety requirements, developers of safety-critical systems should design a model and analyze its behavior before the system is actually developed...|$|E

We hypothesize that the disparities between “sin” firms operations and prevailing social norms create an adverse context which heightens the client's business risk assessment by auditors and is, thereby, reflected in the pricing decisions for audit and consulting services. Having controlled for the impact of variables relating to client attributes, auditor attributes and engagement attributes, we demonstrate that audit firms charge significantly higher audit and consulting fees to companies that deviate from prevailing social norms. Additionally,we show that audit pricing levels within the “sin” group depend both on prevailing political views and on the level of “vice” exhibited by “sin” companies...|$|E
40|$|The word risk {{is used to}} {{describe}} a situation that involves a possibility of something undesired to happen. The systematic process of identifying, evaluating and reducing risks is usually referred to as risk management (RM). The forerunner applications of modern RM emerge from the <b>military,</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> production and finance from where the methods have subsequently spread to every field where significant unwanted uncertainties exist. Although risk is pervasive, the methods and their usage depend on the context. Therefore, the case method is a powerful tool in teaching RM. This thesis presents four educational RM case studies compiled by the author. The studies are aimed to show graduate students how some central RM methods {{may be used in}} practice and give insight in the general principles of RM. The whole process from risk identification to evaluation of implemented solutions is described. To give a multifaceted view, the cases include risk situations from different fields: poultry production, electricity retailing, mining and pension insurance business. Also a comparative analysis of the cases is conducted, where causal relationships between different properties are identified. Using the insight learnt from the cases...|$|E
40|$|Plutonium {{is one of}} the {{principal}} materials of both commercial and <b>military</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> It is produced primarily in fission reactors that contain uranium fuel, and its importance arises from the fact that {{a large portion of the}} plutonium produced is fissile: like uranium 235, the mass 239 and 241 isotopes of plutonium can be caused to fission by neutrons, including those with low energy. Because such fission events also release neutrons, substantial amounts of energy can be extracted from plutonium in a controlled or an explosive nuclear chain reaction. Now that commercial nuclear reactors provide a noticeable fraction of United States (and world) electrical energy, these reactors account for most plutonium production. For the most part, this material now remains in the irradiated fuel after removal from reactors, but should this fuel be reprocessed, the plutonium could be recycled to provide part and even most of the fissile content of fresh fuel. For the current generation of water-cooled reactors, the amount of plutonium to be recycled is substantial. In fast breeder reactors, designed to produce more fissile material than they destroy, considerably larger quantities of plutonium would be recycled. In other types of advanced reactors, particularly those which depend heavily on thorium as the material from which fissile material (primarily uranium 233) is produced, the amount of plutonium to be handled would be considerably reduced. Because plutonium is a highly toxic substance, great care is taken to contain it at the sites and facilities where it is stored or handled. In addition, it is necessary that devices be available to monitor any releases from these facilities into environmental media and to measure concentrations of plutonium in these media. The radiation protection standards are so strict for plutonium that only small releases and low concentrations can be tolerated. Such considerations, discussed in the next section, require that monitoring instrumentation be extremely sensitive. The hazard from plutonium arises largely from the alpha particles emitted during radioactive decay. The most sensitive plutonium monitoring devices are based on detection of this radiation and are used for air monitoring and for measurement of plutonium extracted by radioachemical analysis of water, soil, and biological samples. Instruments for area surveyor for monitoring of human subjects often utilize the electromagnetic radiation (x-rays or gamma rays) which follow radioactive decay. Less often used techniques for plutonium monitoring include activation and electrochemical methods. Other techniques, such as mass measurement, are possible but not developed. It is worth noting that, for the most part, the techniques for monitoring plutonium may also be used for monitoring other nuclear materials, including transuranics that may be associated with plutonium. Techniques for monitoring plutonium have been reviewed previously. This article is based largely on work performed in connection with Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's Survey of Environmental Instrumentation. Detailed information on the properties and uses of plutonium may be found in references 4 - 14...|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{analyses}} Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses as necessitation by {{uncovering the}} strategies and arguments surrounding the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion debate in 2004 - 2006. The study on Japanese case is contrasted with Finland as a representing case of European perspective of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in revival period from early to mid- 2000 s. Based on previous research {{the concept of}} necessitation is defined as 'reluctant acceptance' of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> People unwillingly accept <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as for the greater challenges such as climate change and energy security. In addition, necessitation is a forceful strategy of argumentation promoting <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as an energy source without alternatives. Regarding necessitation, this research addresses following themes: discourses and representations surrounding <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in Japan 2004 - 2006, argumentation strategies to necessitate <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> and major similarities and differences of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses between Japan and Finland. Qualitative content analysis {{is applied to the}} minutes of the meetings produced by responsible institutions in Japan. Following datasets are selected for the analysis: 1) the sectorial meetings for long-term nuclear energy policy under Japan Atomic Energy Commission in 2004 - 2005 and 2) the minutes documented in Nuclear Subcommittee under Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 2005 - 2006. In order to gain deeper understanding of the arguments, discourse analysis is also conducted upon the material. The research first discloses seven Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses based on the arguments - <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for: energy security, stable supply, cost-efficiency, environmental compatibility, <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as a means of international contribution, new economic growth, and guaranteed nuclear safety. Representations of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are analysed within each discourse. The analysis also reveals the employed argumentation strategies to oblige <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> use and prioritised discourses. A comparison between Japanese and Finnish <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discussions shows significant common discourses in energy security, stable supply, affordable electricity, and climate change mitigation. This comparison also shows distinctive Japanese discourses in international collaboration and national economic prosperity. Moreover, Japanese arguments over environmental and economic benefit of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are by far more elaborate. The research reveals a wide range of social issues concerning the necessity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in Japan, whereas Europe concentrates on limited social issues of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> A detail picture of Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> shows extensive expectation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> which are embedded in the society.

In such cases the corners have to be suitably reinforced at top and also at bottom otherwise cracks are liable to be formed at the corners. The present investigation is intended to study the influence of torsion reinforcement in reinforced concrete slab with end condition all ends discontinuous under uniformly distributed load. Slabs with torsion reinforcement varying from 0 % to 30 % were casted and tested. Increasing in the torsion reinforcement controls the deflection of the slab element.
