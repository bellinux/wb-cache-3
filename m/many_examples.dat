5|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} show <b>many</b> <b>examples</b> of convergent evolution. The mouthparts {{of different}} insect groups {{consist of a}} set of homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E

The rock art consists of petroglyphs (carvings) and petrographs (drawings). The petrographs were made using the index finger. Pioneer {{in the study of}} the rock art has been Miguel Triana. Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, Eliécer Silva Celis and others. It is theorised that the rock art has been made under the influence of ayahuasca (yahé).|$|E
5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of <b>many</b> <b>examples</b> includes ageliferin.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority.

5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J. Alloiteau {{was built}} on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were <b>many</b> <b>examples</b> of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides {{were settled}} during the Mesolithic era around 6500BC or earlier, after the climatic {{conditions}} improved {{enough to sustain}} human settlement. Occupation at a site on Rùm is dated to 8590 ±95 uncorrected radiocarbon years BP, which is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland. There are <b>many</b> <b>examples</b> of structures from the Neolithic period, the finest example being the standing stones at Callanish, dating to the 3rd millennium BC. Cladh Hallan, a Bronze Age settlement on South Uist is the only site in the UK where prehistoric mummies have been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{demarcation}} between carnivorous and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory and ambiguous academic literature on the subject. <b>Many</b> <b>examples</b> of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true carnivorous plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' carnivorous adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid definition of a carnivorous plant.|$|E

Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy, however scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. <b>Many</b> <b>examples</b> of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E
