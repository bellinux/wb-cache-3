40|$|The {{occurrence}} of foramen ovale patens {{was investigated in}} four different <b>meat-type</b> <b>pig</b> breeds: Slovak White Improved (WI), Landrace (LA), Slovak meat-type (SM) and a crossbreed of Pietrain x Slovak meat-type (PN x SM) at the Station for Research and Meat Quality Evaluation. The highest incidence of foramen ovale patens (FOP) cases was recorded in the SM breed (13. 7 %) and the least in the LA breed (10. 5 %). Two sizes of the openings were registered (2 and 3 mm diameter). Only the 2 mm size gap was observed in the PN x SM crossbreed. This defect was observed in all siklines of Wi, all four lines of LA and all three lines of SM and PNxSM. No case of FOP {{was found in the}} Pietrain (PN breed). Only 2 mm size gaps were found in the crossbreed PN x SM. Therefore it is important to look for a rise of this heart defect in crossbreed lines of these two breeds...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) method was developed for in vivo examination of the pig heart. Measurements were carried out on 15 <b>meat-type</b> <b>pigs</b> of different liveweight using a 1. 5 T equipment. Inhalation anaesthesia was applied, then data acquisition was synchronised by ECG gating. Depending on the heart rate and heart size, in each case 8 to 10 slices and in each slice 8 to 14 phases were acquired prospectively according to one heart cycle. During the post-processing of the images {{the left and the}} right ventricular volumes were determined. The values measured at 106 kg liveweight are 2. 5 times higher than those obtained at 22 kg, while the ejection fractions are equal. The calculated cardiac output values were 3. 5 l (22 kg, 132 beats/min.), and 6. 0 l (106 kg, 91 beats/min.), respectively. After measuring the wall thickness, the contraction values were also determined for the septum (70 %), and for the anterior (61 %), posterior (41 %) and lateral (54 %) walls of the left ventricle. Three-dimensional animated models of the ventricles were constructed. Based on the investigations performed, the preconditioning, the anaesthetic procedure, the specific details of ECG measurement and the correct MR imaging technique were worked out...|$|R
40|$|Six {{adult male}} <b>meat-type</b> guinea <b>pigs</b> were {{subjected}} to three subsequent digestibility trials with 100 % alfalfa, 50 % alfalfa and 50 % sugar cane and 50 % alfalfa and 50 % concentrate. For each animal in each period, feed intakes were recorded and all faeces were collected and stored at - 20 degrees C until analysis. Feeds and faeces were analysed for dry matter, crude ash, crude protein, ether-extract, crude fibre and acid-insoluble ash. Coefficients of apparent digestibility were calculated according to both the total collection method and the marker method with acid-insoluble ash as internal marker. The present study suggests that acid-insoluble ash is not valid as an internal marker when looking at differences between individuals, but might be useful to demonstrate differences between diets, albeit with lack of accuracy for estimating the absolute digestibility coefficients obtained through the total collection method. Sugar cane was slightly less digestible than alfalfa in meat-type guinea-pigs...|$|R
