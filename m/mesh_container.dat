40|$|Abstract—Cargo {{containers}} whichtransport 90 percentof the world’s trade transit {{the countries}} of the world daily. Despite the vulnerability of cargo containers, only about 5 percent of the over 10 million cargo containers entering the U. S. each year can be inspected now. Our primary goal is to develop the smart container security system using RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks in order to enhance the cargo container security. In addition, the end-to-end visibility via this networked tracking and sensing capability can bring additional commercial benefits to supply chain and chain of custody. In this paper, we first propose a dynamic <b>mesh</b> <b>container</b> network among neighboring containers. Since a group of containers moves together, we can take advantages of interaction between them via this <b>mesh</b> <b>container</b> network instead of focusing an individual container. Second, we introduce the concept of Mobile Edge Computing Devices (MECD) which is the interface between distributed sensors and the end server in order to reduce processing and bandwidth requirements to the end servers. MECDs can give scalability, flexibility, reliability, and cost-efficiency to our cargo container security system. I...|$|E

40|$|In the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), {{the quality and}} quantity of nursery habitat available for juvenile utilization is the most critical limiting factor affecting local populations of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Though submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and oyster reefs (both natural and artificial) have been more-commonly acknowledged of late for their provisioning of this valuable habitat, each has also suffered decline recently throughout many areas. However, the gear used in off-bottom oyster farming (i. e. the culture of oysters within <b>mesh</b> <b>containers</b> held above the seafloor; OBOF) holds potential to provide additional habitat that is valuable for juvenile blue crabs (JBCs), especially in areas lacking other types of suitable habitat. In order to make a qualitative assessment regarding the potential value of habitat that OBOF gear could provide for JBCs in the region, comparative field sampling and tethering experiments were performed to collect quantitative data from OBOF gear (specifically, the gear used in adjustable longline systems), along with bagged oyster shell, SAV, and unvegetated bottom habitats, during Summer and Fall 2013, at three spatially separated field sites within th...|$|R

40|$|Objective : {{to develop}} a {{technology}} for obtaining the molded sorbent VNIITU 1, to study its physicochemical and biomedical properties, and to evaluate its efficacy in preventing and treating pyoinflammatory complications in obstetrics. Materials and methods.   The molded sorbent VNIITU- 1 was designed from the carbon porous material based on nanodispersed carbon by mixing with a vehicle, extruding the mixture, drying the extrudate in an inert atmosphere, thermally treating and activating by steam, followed by washing with distilled water and drying (TU 9398043710698342013). The molded sorbent VNIITU- 1 is apyrogenic and nontoxic (Toxicity Study Conclusion No. 1998. 013. P dated 14. 08. 2013; Engineering Testing Assessment No. 12. 404 ORTI/ 2013 dated  26. 08. 2013), it is destined for single administration, sterile, placed in a removable thread capron <b>mesh</b> <b>container,</b> and used to treat and prevent pyoseptic complications in puerperas at risk for infection, such as acute nonspecific postpartum endometritis. A total of  52 puerperas were examined and treated. They had been divided into 2 groups: a study group (n= 37) and a comparison group (n= 15). In the study group, the hemosorbent VNIITU 1 as a porous carbon applicator was postpartum inserted into the uterine cavity, by concurrently performing traditional antibiotic therapy to prevent infectious complications. The comparison group received only traditional antibiotic therapy. The uterine cavity aspirate was examined for IL 1 β and IL 6 levels, its microbial profile, and microbial growth patterns in culture media. The data were processed using a package of applied STATISTICA 6. 1 programs and standard mathematical tables in Microsoft Excel. Descriptive and variation statistical methods were applied. The data were presented as Me [low quartilehigh quartile (LQHQ) ]; two pre and posttreatment dependent variables were compared using the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. Results. The molded carbon sorbent VNIITU 1 {{was found to have}} pronounced antibacterial activity against S. aureus, P. aeroginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli and S. agalactiae. Examination of lavages {{from the surface of the}} sorbent after its removal from the uterine cavity, by using a transmission electron microscope, revealed castoff epithelial cells, leukocytes, macrophages, and microorganisms, which determines the capacity of the sorbent to eliminate not only soluble toxins, but also microorganisms and disintegrating cell elements. Conclusion. The proposed procedure to  postpartum endometritis in puer peras at risk for infection via insertion of the porous carbon applicator VNIITU 1 into the uterine cavity is more effective than the traditional approach and it can improve treatment results, by completely eliminating pathogens from the uterus and by reducing the level of local proinflammatory cytokines. </p...|$|E

40|$|We used {{a pool of}} 3 common riparian-plant {{species in}} Portugal (alder, oak and eucalyptus) to examine the {{potential}} long-term impacts of riparian diversity loss on the feeding behaviour and body composition of a stream invertebrate shredder (Limnephilidae). Fine-mesh bags containing mixtures of the 3 leaf species were immersed in a mixed-forested stream to allow microbial colonization. After 2 weeks, colonized leaves were transferred to microcosms containing stream water and all combinations of 1 to 3 non-colonized leaf species enclosed in <b>mesh</b> <b>containers.</b> The experiment ran for 6 months. In each month, a portion of leaf material was used to inoculate new microcosms containing non -colonized leaf material, keeping the leaf species composition constant. After 2 and 6 months, those leaves were used to feed invertebrate shredders {{for a period of}} 8 days. Leaf consumption and FPOM production by the shredder were affected by leaf species diversity, with higher values in mixtures with 3 leaf species. Leaf mass loss and FPOM production were also affected by leaf species identity, but not by time of leaf diversity loss. C:N ratio of FPOM was affected by leaf identity and showed a positive linear relationship with initial leaf C:N ratio. Invertebrate C:N ratio increased along time of leaf diversity loss. Results suggest that the riparian-plant diversity loss can affect leaf consumption, FPOM production and invertebrate body composition, but effects did not appear to change at longer times.

40|$|Manipulations {{of plant}} litter {{diversity}} {{have been shown}} to affect litter decomposition and to alter the structure of aquatic assemblages. However, most experiments addressing biodiversity effects have been conducted at small temporal scales. Here, we used a pool of 3 common riparian plant species in Portugal (alder, oak and eucalyptus), to examine the potential long-term impacts of riparian diversity loss on litter decomposition and associated microbes. Fine-mesh bags containing mixtures of the 3 leaf species were immersed in a mixed-forested stream to allow microbial colonization. After 2 weeks, leaves were retrieved and placed in microcosms to simulate plant species loss. For that, all combinations of 1 to 3 non-colonized leaf species were enclosed in <b>mesh</b> <b>containers</b> and a set of colonized leaves was used as inoculum. This procedure was repeated each 30 days during 6 months keeping leaf species composition constant. In every 2 months, we assessed leaf mass loss, fungal biomass and microbial diversity by the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, using primers targeting rDNA for bacteria, fungi and ciliates. The highest diversity on litter was found for bacteria (68 OTUs), followed by fungi (41 OTUs) and ciliates (31 OTUs). Litter decomposition, fungal biomass and the structure of microbial assemblages on each litter species varied along time. Fungal biomass and diversity of fungi and ciliates were affected by litter species diversity. After 6 months, fungal biomass on oak and eucalyptus was highest in mixtures with 3 litter species. Also fungal diversity on each litter species was highest in leaf mixtures, especially at longer times. Results suggest that changes in riparian vegetation, at longer time scales, can alter the structure of stream microbial assemblages and affect litter decomposition dynamics in streams.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{suppress}} and/or change behaviour {{on the basis}} of negative feedback, often conceptualized as cognitive flexibility, has rarely been investigated in nonhuman great apes across a broad age range. In this study, 25 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eight bonobos, Pan paniscus, seven orang-utans, Pongo abelii, and three gorillas, Gorilla gorilla, whose ages ranged from 5 to 48 years, were presented with a transparent Plexiglas rectangular box horizontally attached to their cage <b>mesh.</b> A square <b>container,</b> 7. 5 cm 2, fixed inside the apparatus contained a food reward (i. e. a grape). While the container rested on its central position the grape was not accessible. To retrieve the grape the subjects needed to grasp the handle connected to the reward container and displace it sideways to reach one of the lateral access windows. Subjects were intensively trained to displace the handle to a specific side (right or left, depending on the group) and then the rewarded side was reversed during the test. Performance in this reversal task did not differ significantly between species. However, a U-shaped relation between age and perseverative responding (i. e. moves to the previously rewarded side) was observed, extending findings with humans to our closest living primate relatives.

40|$|Abstract- Spirogyra is a lamentous green alga that inhabits {{the streams}} and lakes of North America, {{including}} Conesus Lake, NY. Two separate experiments {{were designed to}} determine if nutrient enhancement {{had an effect on}} Spirogyra growth. In one experiment, known quantities of Spirogyra were placed in 12 <b>containers</b> provided with <b>mesh</b> screens. The <b>containers</b> were separated into three groups and held in racks that were placed at increasing distances from a stream with a known efuent nutrient load. The average percent change in biomass calculated after two weeks for near, middle and far distances were 35. 38, 16. 62, and 4. 12 (respectively). The growth rates of algae incubated near the stream were signicantly higher than algae living farther away from the stream. In a second experiment, Spirogyra was incubated in 12 closed one-liter containers. Each set of jars contained different concentrations of enhanced nitrogen and phosphorous; amounts of lake water and Spirogyra remained constant. Two sets of jars had enhanced concentrations of N and P, while a third contained ambient lake water. The average percent change in increased biomass determined after two weeks in the lake was 19. 8 (high nutrient concentration), 10. 8 (low nutrient concentration) and 7. 5 (no nutrient addition). There was a statistically signicant difference in the growth rates of algae living in high concentration and control environments. The results obtained from these two experiments support our hypotheses that Spirogyra living in an environment with enhanced nutrient levels will have an accelerated growth rate compared to algae living in waters with ambient levels of N and P. Since the greatest Spirogyra growth was observed with increasing distance from stream outlets into the lake, articial nutrient addition should be a concern to the Conesus Lake community. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
