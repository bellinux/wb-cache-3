The knowledge discovery process focuses on the detection and definition of the maritime corridors, based {{on the construction of}} maritime traffic networks. The maritime traffic network provides maritime contextual knowledge to automatically update the Maritime Situational Picture, contributing towards Maritime Situational Awareness and risk management systems evolution.
