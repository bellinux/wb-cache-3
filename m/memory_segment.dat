25|$|In the present, {{with the}} {{location}} of the Shroud confirmed, Shaun, Rebecca, and Russian Assassin Galina Voronina head to the vault. Unfortunately, Otso Berg, da Costa, and Ardant beat them there and a fight ensues in which Berg is knocked unconscious, Rebecca is shot and wounded and Ardant is killed by Shaun while da Costa escapes with the Shroud. Hacking Isabelle's computer, the Assassins find out the Templars plan to use the Shroud to construct a living Precursor. The recording also shows that Juno is secretly manipulating certain employees within Abstergo from behind the scenes to sabotage the company, and has her own plans for the Shroud. Juno also contacts the Initiate through the simulation, leading them into a new <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> of Lydia Frye, where she tracks down and kills a Sage in a war-torn London during World War I.|$|E

30|$|Some {{alternative}} solutions {{can also}} be investigated to increase the effort needed by an attacker to succeed in performing the considered attack. For instance, the platform that we have studied brings additional security features: some DMA protected configurable <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> (the DMA Protected Range specified by the processor and the Protected Memory Ranges implemented in the IOMMU) [19, Vol. 2, 2.5]. Linux does not use these <b>memory</b> <b>segments,</b> placing IOMMU structures outside the protected ranges. Devices are consequently able {{to read and write}} the IOMMU configuration before its activation. These DMA-protected <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> are common in modern architectures and should be systematically used to set up such hardware protection components, such as the IOMMU.|$|R
50|$|Object {{files are}} <b>segmented</b> into various <b>memory</b> <b>{{segments}}</b> types. Example segments include code segments, data segments, stack segments (.bss), or others.|$|R
5000|$|The {{semaphore}} instructions {{prove their}} worth by controlling {{access to the}} shared writable <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> while allowing the contents to be moved around efficiently.|$|R

5000|$|In {{embedded}} software, oftentimes certain functions need to {{be placed}} in certain code sections by use of special compiler instructions such as [...] "pragma" [...] statements. Sometimes, a function in one <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> might need to call a function in another <b>memory</b> <b>segment,</b> and if inlining of the called function occurs, then the code of the called function might end up in a segment where it shouldn't be. For example, high-performance memory segments may be very limited in code space, and if a function belonging in such a space calls another large function that is not meant to be in the high-performance section and the called function gets inappropriately inlined, then this might cause the high-performance <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> to run out of code space. For this reason, sometimes it is necessary to ensure that functions do not become inlined.|$|E
50|$|If an {{instruction}} pointer error occurs during the execution {{and a program}} points to a <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> filled with NOP instructions, inevitably an error occurred and is recognized.|$|E
30|$|We {{conducted}} the same steps {{for the process}} android.process.acore, which serves as Android’s contact provider, for com.cyanogenmod.filemanager and for com.android.browser. Inside anonymous <b>memory</b> <b>segments,</b> {{we were able to}} find the contact Secret Contact with phone number 017 *. The browser’s <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> contain vast amounts of loaded websites, user account names, search queries, and text entered in webmail and social media pages. This made it possible to recover entered data, such as Top Secret Information. The Dalvik-heap of the filemanager exposes the filename /data/secret.txt and its content Top Secret Text.|$|R

50|$|Thus, as a {{practical}} matter, LINC-8 <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> are limited to segment 0-3, or perhaps 0-7 on the few 8K implementations. However, basic 4K machines cannot address beyond 0-3 while extended memory models could attempt to address segments 0-37 octal even if non-existent memory.|$|R
50|$|The Local Descriptor Table (LDT) is {{a memory}} table {{used in the}} x86 {{architecture}} in protected mode and containing <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> descriptors: start in linear memory, size, executability, writability, access privilege, actual presence in memory, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Segmentation is {{one method}} of {{implementing}} memory protection. [...] Paging is another, {{and they can}} be combined. The size of a <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> is generally not fixed and may be as small as a single byte.|$|E
50|$|The memory on XCGA was a {{contiguous}} byte array (just like MCGA mode) {{and was not}} interleaved {{like other}} CGA graphics modes. It started at <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> B800 like all CGA video memory, and displaying the first 16000 bytes of the segment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interfaces}} used by user {{programs are}} the cleanest of all. User programs may never refer directly to any system control block (neither for reference nor change), because the virtual <b>memory</b> <b>segment(s)</b> that contain system control blocks (the system segments) {{are removed from}} a job's virtual address space when a user mode program is running. The subroutine interfaces available to user programs are also used by most {{other parts of the}} system (system mode programs, CLSs, ...) even through components running in system mode do have access to the [...] "system" [...] virtual <b>memory</b> <b>segment(s).</b> Transitions from user mode to system mode and back are managed by a special protected set of subroutine interfaces known as [...] "the gate" [...] (initially developed at Wayne State University).|$|R
50|$|The FRAM MPU {{protects against}} {{accidental}} writes to designated read-only <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> or execution of code from a constant memory. The MPU can set any portioning of memory with bit level addressing, making the complete memory accessible for read, write and execute operations in FRAM devices.|$|R
30|$|As a {{next step}} of the analysis, we {{retrieved}} the <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> of the process com.android.exchange using the plug-in linux_proc_maps.

5000|$|In memory {{addressing}} for Intel x86 computer architectures, segment descriptors {{are a part}} of the segmentation unit, used for translating a logical address to a linear address. Segment descriptors describe the <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> referred to in the logical address.The segment descriptor (8 bytes long in 80286) contains the following fields: ...|$|E
5000|$|Where 150 student {{variables}} was insufficient, a lesson {{could use the}} command to create an additional private <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> of up to 1000 words.

50|$|Pointers are {{implemented}} on the B5000 by indexed descriptors. During indexing operations, pointers are checked at each increment {{to make sure}} that neither the source nor the destination blocks are out of bound. During a scan or replace operation, the mechanisms used to read or copy large blocks of memory, both source and destination are checked at each word increment for a valid memory tag. Each <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> is bounded by tag 3 words, which would make such an operation fail. Each <b>memory</b> <b>segment</b> containing integrity sensitive data, such as program code, is stored in tag 3 words, making an uncontrolled read - let alone modification - impossible. Thus a significant source of program errors can be detected early before software goes into production, and a more significant class of attacks on system security is not possible.|$|E
5000|$|Extended {{memory is}} not {{accessible}} in real mode (except {{for a small}} portion called the high memory area). Only applications executing in protected mode can use extended memory directly. A supervising protected-mode operating system such as Microsoft Windows manages application programs access to memory. The processor makes this memory available through the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and one or more Local Descriptor Tables (LDTs). The memory is [...] "protected" [...] {{in the sense that}} <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> assigned a local descriptor cannot be accessed by another program because that program uses a different LDT, and <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> assigned a global descriptor can have their access rights restricted, causing a processor exception (e.g., a general protection fault or GPF) on violation. This prevents programs running in protected mode from interfering with each other's memory.|$|R
25|$|The {{references}} being resolved may be addresses for {{jumps and}} other routine calls. They {{may be in}} the main program, or in one module depending upon another. They are resolved into fixed or relocatable addresses (from a common base) by allocating runtime memory for the <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> of each module referenced.|$|R

50|$|The key {{component}} of dynamic memory is the last in, first out (LIFO) stack as this makes using the various functions much easier. A MULTOS chip is a stack machine, which makes use of this dynamic memory to pass parameters and perform calculations. In addition, the Input/output buffer resides in another dynamic <b>memory</b> <b>segment.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{creating}} a new (file-based) translation memory, SDL Trados Studio creates a database file in which all translation units are stored. The translation memory also stores structural and context information to link all the different segments and their position in a document. This allows the tool to select the most relevant translation <b>memory</b> <b>segment.</b>|$|E
50|$|The basic {{capability}} provided is that {{of shared}} memory XImages. This is essentially {{a version of the}} ximage interface where the actual image data is stored in a SysV shared <b>memory</b> <b>segment,</b> and thus need not be transferred across the socket to the X server. For large images, use of this facility can result in some real performance increases.|$|E
50|$|UMMPS uses 4096 byte {{virtual memory}} pages and 256 page virtual <b>memory</b> <b>segments.</b> UMMPS could be conditionally {{assembled}} {{to use the}} small (64 page) segments that were available on S/370 hardware, but job programs were always presented with {{what appeared to be}} large (256 page) segments.

50|$|The Oracle RDBMS stores data logically in {{the form}} of tablespaces and {{physically}} {{in the form}} of data files ("datafiles").Tablespaces can contain various types of <b>memory</b> <b>segments,</b> such as Data Segments, Index Segments, etc. Segments in turn comprise one or more extents. Extents comprise groups of contiguous data blocks. Data blocks form the basic units of data storage.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also an}} LDT or Local Descriptor Table. The LDT is {{supposed}} to contain <b>memory</b> <b>segments</b> which are private to a specific program, while the GDT {{is supposed}} to contain global segments.
