25|$|Anti-nuclear {{ribonucleoprotein}} (anti-nRNP) antibodies, {{also known}} as anti-U1-RNP antibodies, are found in 30–40% of SLE. They are often found with anti-Sm antibodies, {{but they may be}} associated with different clinical associations. In addition to SLE, these antibodies are highly associated with <b>mixed</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>disease.</b> Anti-nRNP antibodies recognise the A and C core units of the snRNPs and because of this they primarily bind to the U1-snRNP. The immune response to RNP may be caused by the presentation of the nuclear components on the cell membrane in apoptotic blebs. Molecular mimicry has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for the production of antibodies to these proteins because of similarity between U1-RNP polypeptides and Epstein-Barr virus polypeptides.|$|E
25|$|ANA {{screening}} yields {{positive results}} in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which {{are linked to}} SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases. Other ANA that may occur in people with SLE are anti-U1 RNP (which also appears in systemic sclerosis and <b>mixed</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>disease),</b> SS-A (or anti-Ro) and SS-B (or anti-La; {{both of which are}} more common in Sjögren's syndrome).

Rheumatoid arthritis and other spondyloarthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory myopathies, <b>mixed</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>diseases</b> (CTDs), systemic sclerosis, vasculitis, and sarcoidosis are among CTDs with serious cardiovascular involvement; this is due to multiple causative factors such as myopericarditis, micro/macrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, myocardial fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and finally heart failure. The complicated pathophysiology and the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of CTDs demand a versatile, noninvasive, nonradiative diagnostic tool for early cardiovascular diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment follow-up. Cardiovascular {{magnetic resonance}} imaging can detect early silent cardiovascular lesions, assess disease acuteness, and reliably evaluate the effect of both cardiac and rheumatic medication in the cardiovascular system, due to its capability to perform tissue characterization and its high spatial resolution. However, until now, high cost; lack of interaction between cardiologists, radiologists, and rheumatologists; lack of availability; and lack of experts in the field have limited its wider adoption in the clinical practice.

40|$|Searching for a {{mechanism}} underlying autoimmunity in autism, we postulated that gliadin peptides, {{heat shock protein}} 60 (HSP- 60), and streptokinase (SK) bind to different peptidases resulting in autoantibody production against these components. We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with <b>mixed</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>diseases.</b> Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD 26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD 13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP- 60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption dem-onstrated that only specific antigens (e. g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP- 60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP- 60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP- 60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43 % inhibition of the DPP IV–anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptide...|$|R

One hundred fifty patients with SLE were divided into three groups: group 1 patients (37) had anti-RNP alone, group 2 patients (46) had anti-RNP and anti-Sm and group 3 patients (67) had neither anti-RNP nor anti-Sm. Raynaud's phenomenon and central nervovs disease were significantly more common in patients of groups 1 and 2 than group 3. Renal disease, elevated n-DNA binding and decreased CH 50 were less common in patients of group 1 than group 3. LE cell phenomenon was less common in groups 1 and 2 than group 3. Renal disease was significantly less common in group 1 than group 2. Scleroderma patients with anti-RNP had fever, elevated ESR and hypergammaglobulinemia more frequently than those without anti-RNP.

Fifty patients with SSc, 20 with OS, including <b>mixed</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>diseases</b> (MCTD), 20 with SLE, 10 disease controls (DC) and 25 controls (C) were studied. The over-expression of p 53 and TBP antigen was determined quantitatively by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), varies between four- and sevenfold higher in patients with SSc, OS and SLE, in comparison to DC and C. The expressed protein antigens were not present as free antigens but as immune-complexes. Autoantibodies to p 53 were detected by ELISA in 78 % subjects with SSc, 100 % with OS and 80 % with SLE. Autoantibodies to TBP were observed in 28 % patients with SSc, 25 % with OS and 15 % with SLE. In comparison to healthy controls, the titre of antibodies to p 53 was significantly higher in patients with SSc (P = 0 · 00001) than the patients with OS (P = 0 · 00279) and SLE (P = 0 · 00289), whereas the titre of antibodies to TBP was higher in patients with OS (P = 0 · 00185) than the SLE (P = 0 · 00673) and the SSc (P = 0 · 00986) patients. Autoantibodies to p 53 and TBP were detected in all these patients and the levels of these two autoantibodies showed weak negative correlation with each other.
