6000|$|I {{understood}} that before my arrival in M. Pelet's establishment, the combined insubordination of the pupils had effected {{the dismissal of}} more than one English master. It was necessary then to exact only the most <b>moderate</b> <b>application</b> from natures so little qualified to apply--to assist, in every practicable way, understandings so opaque and contracted--to be ever gentle, considerate, yielding even, to a certain point, with dispositions so irrationally perverse; but, having reached that culminating point of indulgence, you must fix your foot, plant it, root it in rock--become immutable as the towers of Ste. Gudule; for a step--but half a step farther, and you would plunge headlong into the gulf of imbecility; there lodged, you would speedily receive proofs of Flemish gratitude and magnanimity in showers of Brabant saliva and handfuls of Low Country mud. You might smooth to the utmost the path of learning, remove every pebble from the track; but then you must finally insist with decision on the pupil taking your arm and allowing himself to be led quietly along the prepared road. When I had brought down my lesson to the lowest level of my dullest pupil's capacity--when I had shown myself the mildest, the most tolerant of masters--a word of impertinence, a movement of disobedience, changed me at once into a despot. I offered then but one alternative--submission and acknowledgment of error, or ignominious expulsion. This system answered, and my influence, by degrees, became established on a firm basis. [...] "The boy is father to the man," [...] it is said; and so I often thought when looked at my boys and remembered the political history of their ancestors.

The clovers with the most potential came from the remote areas of the Ethiopian highlands. The problem of phosphorus deficiency in Ethiopian soils is well known, {{but it is hard}} to believe that indigenous species could equal, and even surpass, that of imported commercial strains from the developed world, because of their high growth rates. The results of these experiments have important consequences for Ethiopia's fertilizer extension services. They raise new hope for the economic viability of forage crops on high African plains. Commercial fertilizers (phosphate, ammonium superphosphate), recommended to farmers by the extension services are too expensive to be used on a large scale. The discovery of indigenous, leguminous forage plants could have good results, in spite of difficult soil conditions. When combined with small applications of phosphates encouraging results could emerge in the future. Rather than using imported species, cheaper local seeds could be used. As for fertilization, phosphate fertilizer is sufficient during the growing cycle, and will increase yields of food and forage crops, while reducing the unit costs of production. More work is needed if this technique is to be of widespread benefit in the future. Where should research begin? With a more extensive and detailed study of the different plant varieties.

40|$|The {{compound}} Dy 7 Rh 3 ordering antiferromagnetically below (TN=) 59 K {{has been}} known to exhibit a temperature (T) dependent electrical resistivity (rho) behavior in the paramagnetic state unusual for intermetallic compounds in the sense that there is a broad peak in rho(T) in the paramagnetic state (around 130 K) as though there is a semi-conductor to metal transition. In addition, there is an upturn below T_N due to magnetic super-zone gap effects. Here we report the influence of external magnetic field (H) on the rho(T) behavior of this compound below 300 K. The rise of rho(T) found below TN could be suppressed at very high fields (>> 60 kOe), thus resulting in a very large magnetoresistance (MR) in the magnetically ordered state. The most notable finding is that the magnitude of MR is large for <b>moderate</b> <b>applications</b> of H (say 80 kOe) in a temperature range far above T_N as well, which is untypical of intermetallic compounds.

In response to Mn stress,polish wheat plant activated several detoxification mechanisms to counteract Mn toxicity, including enhanced antioxidant defense system, increased Mn distribution in the cell wall and upregulated genes involved in S assimilation. <b>Moderate</b> S <b>application</b> was found to alleviate Mn toxicity mainly by sequestering excess Mn into vacuoles, inhibiting Mn translocation from roots to shoots, stimulating activities of antioxidant enzymes and enhancing GSH production via upregulating genes involved in S metabolism.

Soil properties remained virtually unchanged by the leaching treatment, except that significant amounts of monovalent K and Na were removed.

40|$|In Thailand, acid {{sulphate}} {{soils are}} found {{mainly in the}} Central Plains. They cover approximately 1. 5 million ha. They are dominantly soft clay soils. Sulphur occurs mainly {{in the form of}} sulphide in iron sulphide layer below the plow layer. The major limitations of these soils for agricultural production are their strong acidity, phosphorus deficiency, and abundance of aluminium (Al), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) causing toxicities. Most of the acid sulphate soils in Thailand are used for rice cultivation. Without soil improvement measures, yields are relatively low, ranging from 1 to 1. 5 t ha. Traditionally, the cultivation of glutinous and non-glutinous rice during the wet season has been identified the most sustainable use of these soils. There is no single method for the reclamation and management of acid sulphate soils. But reducing soil acidity by liming and leaching (e. g., by flooding) can improve soil productivity. Adequate drainage, frequent applications of water and <b>moderate</b> <b>applications</b> of lime can improve the soil conditions significantly.

40|$|A {{flexible}} {{sheet in}} uniform parallel flow is studied {{in order to}} quantify its fluid dynamic drag and fluid-elastic stability characteristics. An experimental campaign is undertaken that involves a cantilevered sheet in air flow characterised by Reynolds numbers of order R= 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 6. The properties of the sheet include: constant mass per unit area; small but finite flexural rigidity; varying aspect ratios from within the range 0. 43 <l/L< 1, where L and l denote the length and width respectively; and tension applied at the trailing edge. The unique aspect of the present work is {{an investigation into the}} influence of in-plane tension on both the fluid drag and fluid-elastic stability of the sheet. In the absence of tension, the configuration resembles a flag and the drag coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing aspect ratio and Reynolds number. In the presence of tension, the fluid drag is significantly reduced in the region below the critical flow velocity at which convected wave instabilities appear. This critical flow velocity can be increased through the <b>moderate</b> <b>application</b> of in-plane tension. Under lateral tension, the drag of the sheet is given to good approximation by the turbulent boundary layer drag law for a flat plate. Once stability is lost, however, the drag coefficient increases rapidly with Reynolds number due to convected waves travelling over the sheet's surface. Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures.

Ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3) {{was used in this}} study, as the source of inorganic nitrogen. The nitrogen treatment consisted of four levels: 0, 30, 100, and 200 ppm of N which were added with the irrigation solution. Irrigation treatment consisted of irrigation every two, five or ten days. Nitrogen fertilization, irrigation regimes, and their interaction significantly affect the total stem, root, and leaf dry weight.

However, the term differentiation has been interpreted in diverse ways {{and there is a}} need to specify what effective differentiation entails. Previous reports of low to <b>moderate</b> <b>application</b> of differentiation underscore the importance of practical guidelines for implementing differentiation. In two studies, we investigated how teachers should differentiate according to experts, as well as the degree to which teachers already apply the recommended strategies. Study 1 employed the Delphi technique and focus group discussions to achieve consensus among eleven mathematics experts regarding a feasible model for differentiation in primary mathematics. The experts agreed on a five-step cycle of differentiation: (1) identification of educational needs, (2) differentiated goals, (3) differentiated instruction, (4) differentiated practice, and (5) evaluation of progress and process. For each step, strategies were specified. In Study 2, the Differentiation Self-Assessment Questionnaire (DSAQ) was developed to investigate how teachers self-assess their use of the strategies recommended by the experts. While teachers (N = 268) were moderately positive about their application of the strategies overall, we also identified areas of relatively low usage (including differentiation for high-achieving students) which require attention in teacher professional development.
