5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites {{is less than half}} that of Triton (the seventh-largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System) alone. The largest of the satellites, Titania, has a radius of 788.9km, or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. Uranus is about 10,000times more massive than its moons.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the <b>Moon.</b> <b>In</b> partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E

5|$|Aravan {{is known}} as Kuttantavar in the {{religious}} sect which bears his name, and {{in which he is}} the chief deity. His main temple is in Koovagam, Tamil Nadu. Here, the marriage of Aravan and Mohini, Krishna's female form, and her widowhood and mourning, after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the central theme of an 18-day annual festival either side of the night of the full <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May). The day of the full moon is the central day of the festival, when Aravan's sacrifice is ritually re-enacted.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1998 {{release of}} Tony Fletcher's Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, Moon's {{date of birth}} was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This {{erroneous}} date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who. The incorrect date had been supplied by <b>Moon</b> <b>in</b> interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede is {{the largest}} and most massive <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. Its {{diameter}} of 5,268km is 0.41 times that of Earth, 2% larger than that of Saturn's Titan (the second-largest moon), 1.08 times Mercury's, 1.09 times Callisto's, 1.45 times Io's and 1.51 times the Moon's. Its mass is 10% greater than Titan's, 38% greater than Callisto's, 66% greater than Io's and 2.02 times that of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, KzS von Karpf left Moltke; KzS Gygas assumed {{command of}} the ship. Between September and October 1917, the ship took part in Operation Albion {{supporting}} the German invasion of the Russian islands of Ösel, Dagö, and <b>Moon</b> (<b>in</b> present-day Estonia). Following the successful operation in the Baltic, Moltke was detached to support the II Reconnaissance Group (II AG), but did not actively participate in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight.|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} in October 1851 by William Lassell and named for a character in two different pieces of literature. As of 2017, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon's surface. There are no active plans at present to return to study the <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> more detail, although various concepts such as a Uranus orbiter and probe have been proposed from time to time.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|Neptune has 14 known moons, {{which are}} named for minor water deities in Greek mythology. By {{far the largest}} of them is Triton, {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century passed before {{the discovery of the}} second natural satellite, Nereid. Neptune's Neso, which has an orbital period of about 26 Julian years, orbits further from its planet than any other <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Oberon, also {{designated}} , is {{the outermost}} major moon {{of the planet}} Uranus. It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|Other {{peculiar}} calendars include ancient Greek calendars. These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} the New <b>Moon.</b> <b>In</b> reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E
5|$|Other supernatural {{abilities}} commonly {{attributed to}} the kitsune include possession, mouths or tails that generate fire or lightning (known as kitsunebi), willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, {{and the creation of}} illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> the sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.|$|E
