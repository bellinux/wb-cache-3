5|$|Nintendo GameCube memory cards, {{on which}} saved games are kept, can be {{inserted}} into these arcade units. A memory card {{is required for}} players {{a chance to win}} the AX-exclusive pilots, their vehicles, and tracks for use in GX. Players can store up to four machines from GX on a memory card, then play them in AX. If a memory card is used with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card,</b> players have additional options; they can enter stored GX machines into the F-Zero AX Internet ranking system, and transfer custom AX machine parts to GX. F-Zero AX content is also unlockable by progressing through GXs tougher challenges. It was discovered in early 2013 that the arcade version is playable within the GameCube version by the use of a cheat cartridge.|$|E
25|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card</b> {{is a type}} of card {{capable of}} storing data by modifying the {{magnetism}} of tiny iron-based magnetic particles on a band of magnetic material on the card. The magnetic stripe, sometimes called a magstripe, is read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards such as a driver's license, and transportation tickets. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card</b> was invented in 1960 by IBM engineer Forrest Parry, who conceived the idea of incorporating a piece of magnetic tape in order to store secured information and data to a plastic card base.|$|E
25|$|IBM {{manufactures}} {{and markets}} computers hardware, middleware and software, and offers hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM {{is also a}} major research organization, holding the record for most patents generated by a business (as of 2017) for 24 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card,</b> the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Re-programmable/dynamic <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>cards</b> are {{standard}} sized transaction cards {{that include a}} battery, a processor, and a means (inductive coupling or otherwise)of sending a variable signal to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> reader. Re-programmable <b>stripe</b> <b>cards</b> are often more secure than standard <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>cards</b> and can transmit information for multiple cardholder accounts.|$|R
50|$|Wiegand {{cards are}} more durable and {{difficult}} to counterfeit than bar code or <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>cards.</b> Since the keycode is permanently set into the card at manufacture by {{the positions of the}} wires, Wiegand cards can't be erased by magnetic fields or reprogrammed as <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>cards</b> can.|$|R

25|$|Famous inventions and {{developments}} by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic {{random access}} memory (DRAM), the electronic keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card,</b> the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM {{has been one of}} the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2017, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 24 consecutive years for the achievement.|$|E
500|$|The Octopus card {{uses the}} Sony 13.56 MHz FeliCa radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) chip, with Hong Kong being the world's first major public transport system using this technology. It is a [...] "touch and go" [...] system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader, and thus physical contact is not required. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared to 9.6 kbit/s for other smart card systems like Mondex and Visa Cash. The card has a storage capacity of 1 KB to 64 KB compared to the 125 bytes provided by traditional <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
500|$|F-Zero AX {{cabinets}} can dispense {{magnetic stripe}} cards called a [...] "F-Zero license card" [...] {{to keep track}} of custom machine data, pilot points, and race data. A card was bundled with the Japanese release of F-Zero GX. The card expires after fifty uses, but its data can be transferred to a new card. Once inserted, the game builds a machine with three custom parts which can be upgraded by earning pilot points. Pilot points are acquired as the player progresses through the Race and Time Attack modes. Players can increase point earnings by improving finish place, eliminating opponents, and finishing races with a large amount of energy reserved. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>card</b> is needed to enter the F-Zero AX Internet Ranking system. Similarly to GX, players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race to enter on the official F-Zero website's ranking system.|$|E
