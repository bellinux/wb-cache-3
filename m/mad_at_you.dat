40|$|The {{current study}} {{is part of}} a larger program {{evaluation}} of Caminar Latino, a community-based organization that works with Latino families affected by domestic violence. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects that community-based programs have on children. We wanted to investigate the relationship between children’s knowledge of violence and their attitude towards it. We hypothesized that children who have more educational awareness of violence can better recognize it when it happens, and therefore have better coping skills. Sixteen Latino children were interviewed and results showed that there was no significant relationship between violence knowledge and attitudes. This study found correlations between the number of siblings and attitudes towards violence: The more siblings a child had, the more he/she endorsed “if <b>you</b> are <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> someone <b>you</b> can just ignore them” and the less likely he/she endorsed “you try to talk out a problem instead of fighting”. Findings show that it is important to consider siblings when exploring attitudes towards violence. The biggest limitation of this study was that these preliminary data’s sample size may have been too small to show effects.

5000|$|Moore was {{reportedly}} the first blues singer {{to perform at}} the Apollo Theater and many other theaters around the country, including Carnegie Hall in New York City. [...] In Chicago, he appeared regularly at the Rhumboogie and at the Club DeLisa. At the latter club, in December 1948, he shocked clubgoers by stopping his performance of [...] "I Ain't <b>Mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>You</b> Pretty Baby" [...] and singing an old spiritual. Moore said, [...] "Folks started screaming. They thought I had lost my mind. I just singing and crying 'Shine on Me'...

50|$|A common {{example of}} this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal {{character}} that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. <b>you</b> are <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> your sibling, <b>you</b> are afraid of a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.|$|R
30|$|Many digital stories {{contained}} comments {{which fell}} into a thematic category we have termed “school improvements.” Invariably, students wanted learning that was “hands on”; they wanted educators who “get more involved” and were “not mean.” They also wanted “more responsibilities” which might be interpreted as more meaningful engagement with curricular content. Across the stories, some of these suggestions were quite general and some were quite specific. For example, Jake dislikes school generally because, “you get yelled at for every little thing and you can’t have fun because when you’re having fun in school the teachers get <b>mad</b> and yell <b>at</b> <b>you</b> because they’re not having fun.” Jake dislikes school specifically because “the school is ripping us off” by charging $ 2.25 for a slice of pizza and a salad.|$|R

It's an urge for protection. The loneliest feeling in the whole of a carrier pilot's world is when he's at sea with the gas running low, and he can't see his carrier. You think of the ready room then, and the noisy guys who make it the most desirable place in the world. It's your office, you live in it, it is the big thing in your life. &hellip;You sweat and worry in it, and grouse and argue, and <b>you</b> get <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> it when <b>you</b> can't hear yourself speak because everyone is yelling at once, but you're deeply attached to the place.

5000|$|Austin {{influenced}} Durham {{through his}} own undertakings during his own lifetime, and his actions continue to influence change in Durham to this day. Austin was able to teach the younger generation of activists {{what it meant to}} be a powerful leader, and these leaders were able to keep the movement alive. He taught them the importance of political engagement in order to effect change. Austin served as a paradigm for future black leaders about the importance of challenging the status quo, and not to be too scared to challenge unfair practices when others fear that it might create commotion. For example, Howard Fuller, who went on to lead Operation Breakthrough, was mentored by Austin. Austin taught Fuller to take on the upper class in the black community with the same zeal and uncompromising spirit that he used in confronting the white power structure. In the final days of his life, Austin said to Fuller, [...] "they're going to get <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> but you've got to keep…doing…these things." ...|$|E

5000|$|Seven years later, I {{received}} a letter from Harry Bates dated October 2, 1960. In essence, it revealed that Bates was now totally disabled due to progressive arthritis and was trying to get early Social Security at 60. He had a doctor's statement that he was suffering from that condition at present, but they wanted proof that it was progressive and prevented him from writing stories for income. He asked if I would be willing to supply a statement that he had written stories for me with the greatest difficulty. He didn't know if he had ever mentioned it to me, but any validation would help. It so happened that he had shown me his swollen knuckles in 1953, but beyond that, I had a letter from him describing the difficulty, written earlier that year. I mailed him back the letter, for which I still had the dated envelope, and he got his Social Security—- his only income for the next 20 years!
