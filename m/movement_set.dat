25|$|After {{winning the}} December 1973 {{municipal}} elections, Kiwan {{and those in}} the <b>movement</b> <b>set</b> up a cultural center in Umm al-Fahm with a small library where people could gather to attend public meetings and discuss the Palestinian cause. Local groups affiliated with Abnaa el-Balad emerged in many Arab towns in the 1970s under different names, such as al-Nahda ("The Rebirth") in Taibeh and al-Bayadir ("The Threshing Floor") in Ar'ara. Abnaa el-Balad was one of many groups to help organize the Land Day (Yom Al Ard) demonstration on 30 March 1976 as a way of defending Palestinian rights to the land and defying and challenging Israeli land confiscation policies.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Ho {{gave birth}} to her first child, a son. And finally, a decade after {{returning}} from Thailand, she began writing fiction again. The result was Rice without Rain, a story centering on Jinda, a seventeen-year-old girl from the fictitious Maekung Village which was caught up in the political winds sweeping across the country when a group of university students from Bangkok arrived to encourage the landless farmers to take up a rent resistance <b>movement.</b> <b>Set</b> against the very same historical background as Ho had experienced herself, Jinda's realization that the peasant class was but pawns in the ongoing political tug-of-war and her journey to find her own path in life told the untold stories during those years of turmoil that shrouded Thailand.|$|E
25|$|The Klan {{continued}} to solidify its stronghold on the state, {{taking over the}} Indiana Republican Party and using its new political might to establish a Klan-backed slate of candidates which swept state elections in 1924. The elections allowed the Klan to seize control of the Indiana General Assembly and place the corrupt Governor Edward L. Jackson in office. By then, more than 40% of the native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan. Klan-backed candidates took over the City Council, the Board of School Commissioners, and the Board of County Commissioners. Through the Klan, Stephenson ruled over the State of Indiana, leading a powerful national <b>movement</b> <b>set</b> on gaining control of the United States Congress and the White House. However, {{the power of the}} Klan would quickly begin to crumble after Stephenson was convicted at the end of 1925 for the rape and murder of a young Indianapolis woman, Madge Oberholtzer.|$|E

500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements. The text and tune of the hymn {{are kept in}} the outer choral movements and the central <b>movement,</b> <b>set</b> as two chorale fantasias and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sequences of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn (Co), two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), violino piccolo (Vp), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo including bassoon. The heading of the original parts reads: [...] "Dominica 27. post Trinit. / Wachet auf, rufft uns die Stime / â / 4. Voc. / 1. Violino picolo. / 2. Hautbois. / Taille. / Basson. / 2 Violini. / Viola. / e / Continuo. / di Signore / J.S.Bach." [...] The duration is given as 31 minutes.|$|E

[...] , commenting on the change of mood in the final section, writes, [...] "The sense of relief after the stifling pathos of the opening sections is palpable ... After so much pathos, the final coda led by the sopranos releases the pent-up energy in an explosion of joy." [...] comments, [...] "The words, to the end of this section, are based on Isaiah 58:7-8 ... It brings Jesus’ words to mind, ‘Inasmuch as you do it unto them, you do it unto me’ and his denunciation of the careless rich. Isaiah continues, ‘Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee.’ Bach sets the paraphrase of these last words to a glorious fugue, with two expositions, and so brings to an end one of his finest choruses and one that is worthy indeed of the inspired words of Isaiah.” [...] also expresses his admiration for Bach's setting: [...] "The chorus of the first <b>movement,</b> <b>set</b> to two beautiful verses of Isaiah, brings out the meaning of that text in the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed [...] are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' and the cantata ...|$|E
500|$|Schubert's three last sonatas {{have many}} {{structural}} features in common. D. 958 {{can be considered}} the odd one of the group, with several differences from the remarkably similar structure of D. 959 and D. 960. First, {{it is in a}} minor key, and this is the primary departure that determines its other differences from its companions. Accordingly, the major/minor scheme is alternated, with main material being minor, and digressions and the slow <b>movement</b> <b>set</b> in the major. Its opening Allegro is considerably more concise than those of the other two sonatas, and does not make use of the expansive time-dilating modulatory quasi-development passages that so strongly characterize the other two opening movements. Furthermore, its slow movement follows an ABABA form instead of the ABA form of the other two sonatas. Its third movement, instead of a scherzo, is a slightly less lively, more subdued minuet. Finally, the finale is in a sonata form rather than rondo-sonata form. However, these differences are relative and are significant only in comparison to the extreme similarity of D. 959 and D. 960. Those two are similar {{to the extent that they}} can be considered variations on an identical compositional template, having no major structural differences. All three sonatas, most importantly, share a common dramatic arc and make [...] considerable and identical use of cyclic motives and tonal relationships to weave musical-narrative ideas through the work. Each sonata consists of four movements, in the following order: ...|$|E

More than any other religious group in the state, it embodied {{the ideal of the}} “beloved community” that Martin Luther King, Jr., articulated as the ultimate goal of the civil rights movement: the vision, rooted in Christian millennial expectation, of a spiritualized polity characterized by justice, love, and the “total interrelatedness” of all people." [...] The progress was worked [...] "At the midpoint of the traumatic first year of mandatory statewide school desegregation in South Carolina, as disenchantment with the civil rights <b>movement</b> <b>set</b> in among many Blacks and Whites around the country and the competing rhetorics of Black power and White conservatism dominated the national political discourse, the teams of young Bahá’ís taught that God had sent a new Messenger to unite the human race." [...] "Almost overnight, the Bahá’í Faith in South Carolina had gone from a tiny community in a handful of localities to a mass movement with members in every county. In 1970, there were eight Local Spiritual Assemblies in South Carolina; the next year, after the winter project, there were 108, more than any other state in the country. By the middle of 1972, some 20,000 people—mostly African Americans, but hundreds of Native Americans and European Americans as well—had become Bahá’ís in South Carolina.… [...] fully one-third of the national community resided in South Carolina." [...] However [...] "Their small numbers," [...] he continues, [...] "severely limited the ability of the Bahá’ís in South Carolina and elsewhere to promote the wholesale transformation of society anticipated in their sacred scriptures, and for which enlightened contemporary leaders like King were increasingly calling." [...] "Teachers on the ground in South Carolina, however, were already {{coming to terms with the}} difficulties of sustaining such rapid growth. Reinforced by a stream of home-front pioneers and traveling teachers—many of them young adults and new Bahá’ís themselves— they set about the difficult business of establishing Bahá’í community structures and practices in dozens of localities scattered across the state." ...|$|E

And the women? They must have been strangely simple--simpler far than any moral archraeologist can show us in a learned restoration. Of course, their simplicity had its graces and devices; but one thinks with a sigh that, as the poor things turned away with patient looks from the viewless windows to the same, same looming figures on the dusky walls, they hadn't even the consolation of knowing that just this attitude and <b>movement,</b> <b>set</b> off by their peaked coifs, their falling sleeves and heavily-twisted trains, would sow the seed of yearning envy--of sorts--on the part of later generations.|$|E
