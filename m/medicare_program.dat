In 2017, {{she came out}} in favor of single-payer healthcare, and cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which would gradually expand the existing <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> to cover all Americans. She is a strong advocate for government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information. She is also a strong supporter of female equality and involvement, having begun the website offthesidelines.org in 2011. Although a supporter of gun rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction of gun control.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> CMS (that was not always the name of the responsible bureaucracy) has contracted with private insurance companies to operate as intermediaries between the government and medical providers to administer Part A and Part B benefits.

Beginning in 1997 and 2005 respectively, these and other insurance companies also began administering Part C and Part D plans.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E
25|$|Many {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles could yield substantial savings in the <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> mostly by reducing hospitalizations. Such programs would connect patients with primary care, create an individualized health plan, assist enrollees in receiving social and human services as well as medical care, reconcile medications prescribed by different doctors to ensure they do not undermine one another, and oversee behavior to improve health. The general ethos of these proposals is to “treat the patient, not the condition,” and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.|$|E

25|$|Medicaid is {{a program}} that is not solely funded at the federal level. States provide {{up to half of}} the funding for the Medicaid program. In some states, {{counties}} also contribute funds. Unlike the <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> Medicaid is a means-tested, needs-based social welfare or social protection program rather than a social insurance program. Eligibility is determined largely by income. The main criterion for Medicaid eligibility is limited income and financial resources, a criterion which plays no role in determining Medicare coverage. Medicaid covers a wider range of health care services than Medicare.|$|E

25|$|Peter R. Orszag, {{the then}} {{director}} of the CBO, argued in June 2008 that the <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> as currently structured is unsustainable without significant reform, as tax revenues dedicated to the program are not sufficient to cover its rapidly increasing expenditures. According to the CBO, spending on Medicare will grow from $485 billion during 2009 to $879 billion by 2018. President Obama said at a White House news conference on July 22 that, without changes, the system is guaranteed “to basically break the federal budget”. He argued {{that it is necessary}} to cut wasteful spending which is known to exist (over-testing, no IT, lack of co-ordination, hospital re-admissions) in order to cut costs in order to protect Medicare in the future and cut the projected national deficit.|$|E

25|$|Medicare {{has been}} in {{operation}} for a half century and, during that time, has undergone several changes. Since 1965, the provisions of Medicare have expanded to include benefits for speech, physical, and chiropractic therapy in 1972. Medicare added the option of payments to health maintenance organizations in the 1980s. Over the years, Congress expanded Medicare eligibility to younger people who have permanent disabilities and receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments {{and those who have}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association with HMOs begun in the 1980s was formalized under President Clinton in 1997 as Medicare Part C. In 2003, under President George W. Bush, a <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> for covering almost all drugs was passed (and went into effect in 2006) as Medicare Part D.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{publicly}} funded health care programs help {{to provide for}} the elderly, disabled, military service families and veterans, children, and the poor, and federal law ensures public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay; however, a system of universal health care has not been implemented nationwide. However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most other OECD countries, be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population. Although the federal <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some monopsonistic purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side. In most OECD countries, there is a high degree of public ownership and public finance. The resulting economy of scale in providing health care services appears to enable a much tighter grip on costs. The U.S., as a matter of oft-stated public policy, largely does not regulate prices of services from private providers, assuming the private sector to do it better.|$|E
500|$|Following Republican {{efforts to}} pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which {{included}} major changes to the <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.
