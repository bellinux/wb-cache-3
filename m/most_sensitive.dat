5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive.</b> Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E

5|$|TSH {{levels are}} {{considered}} the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> marker of thyroid dysfunction. They are however not always accurate, particularly if the cause of hypothyroidism {{is thought to be}} related to insufficient TRH secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> enzyme assays use lasers focused {{through a}} {{microscope}} to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E

5|$|A wider survey, {{but less}} sensitive, {{was carried out}} {{as part of the}} Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey; a section of this was then {{observed}} for longer to create the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, which was the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> optical deep field image for years until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field was completed in 2012. Images from the Extreme Deep Field, or XDF, were released on 26 September 2012 to a number of media agencies. Images released in the XDF show galaxies which are now believed to have formed in the first 500 million years following the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E

5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> at 1 kHz.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the San Juan {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization continues to increase in the San Juan watershed, <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E

5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E

5|$|Three {{years after}} the HDF {{observations}} were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged {{in a similar way}} and named the Hubble Deep Field South. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the universe is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the cosmological principle). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) was released in 2012.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the <b>most</b> <b>sensitive</b> area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|Cunnilingus is an {{oral sex}} act {{performed}} by a person on a female's genitalia (the clitoris, {{other parts of the}} vulva or the vagina). The clitoris is the <b>most</b> sexually <b>sensitive</b> part of the human female genitalia, and its stimulation may result in female sexual arousal or orgasm.|$|R
30|$|With {{the ever}} {{growing number of}} {{opportunities}} provided in the Cloud, it becomes critical {{to make the right}} choices regarding the architecture of the system {{in the early stages of}} development. To this end, we provide three robustness indicators: the overall robustness, the <b>most</b> <b>sensitives</b> components and the most threatening failure sequences. These indicators can be derived from any deployment topology, provided a fault propagation model. Our solution, inspired by Ecology, is built upon an analogy between species extinction and components’ failures, which both propagate into the (eco) system. Through SensApp, our running example, we showed how these three indicators help sort out architectural decisions regarding robustness. We shown that our metrics permits to simultaneously account for both isolation and replication strategies, and remains computable on a reasonable amount of time.|$|R
