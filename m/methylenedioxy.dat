25|$|Reticuline {{is known}} as the {{immediate}} precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the phenylethylamine fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is formed via DOPA, the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. L-DOPA loses carbon dioxide to form dopamine 1. Likewise, 4-hydroxypyruvic acid also loses carbon dioxide to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde 2. Dopamine 1 then reacts with 4-hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde 2 to form (S)-norcolaurine 3 in a reaction similar to the Mannich reaction. After oxidation and methylation by SAM, (S)-reticuline 4 is formed. (S)-reticuline serves as a pivotal intermediate to other alkaloids. Oxidation of the tertiary amine then occurs and an iminium ion is formed 5. In a Mannich-like reaction the ortho position to the phenol is nucleophilic, and electrons are pushed to form 6. Product 6 then undergoes keto-enol tautomerism to form (S)-scoulerine, which is then methylated by SAM to form (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine 7. Product 7 is then oxidized to form the <b>methylenedioxy</b> ring from the ortho-methoxyphenol, via an O2-, NADPH- and cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme, giving (S)-canadine 8. (S)-canadine is then oxidized to give the quaternary isoquinolinium system of berberine. This happens in two separate oxidation steps, both requiring molecular oxygen, with H2O2 and H2O produced in the successive processes.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the study of the}} {{volatile}} components of natural products has been enormously extended by the development of the techniques of gas-liquid chromatography. The detection, isolation, and identification of unsuspected minor components, either in the lower boiling (terpenaceous) or higher boiling (aromatic) fractions of essential oils, has provided both taxonomic assignment and insight into plausible biogenetic pathways. This latter fraction, that which is made up to a large extent of phenols and their ethers, has always proved difficult to analyze for numerous reasons. Most of the known components are oils at ordinary temperature, thus distillation cuts rarely crystallize. If there is any complexity in the natural mixture, a continuous temperature increase is observed during distillation even with the use of efficient fractionation equipment. Secondly, there is a consistent similarity in the substitution groups present; the ether groups are invariably methoxys or <b>methylenedioxys,</b> and the aliphatic chain is usually found to be allyl, cis-propenyl, or tralss-propenyl. Attempts at differential extraction or partition within these distillation cuts have been generally unsuccessful...|$|R
50|$|<b>Methylenedioxy</b> is {{the term}} used {{in the field of}} chemistry, {{particularly}} in organic chemistry, for a functional group with the structural formula R-O-CH2-O-R' which is connected to the rest of a molecule by two chemical bonds. The <b>methylenedioxy</b> group consists of two oxygen atoms connected to a methylene bridge (-CH2- unit). The <b>methylenedioxy</b> group is generally found attached to an aromatic structure such as phenyl where it forms the methylenedioxyphenyl or benzodioxole functional group which is widely found in natural products, including safrole, and drugs and chemicals such as tadalafil, MDMA, and piperonyl butoxide.|$|E

50|$|The {{metabolism}} of safrole {{through the}} oxidation of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> proceeds via the cleavage of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> group. This results in two major metabolites: allylcatechol and its isomer, propenylcatechol. Eugenol {{is a minor}} metabolite of safrole in humans, mice, and rats. The intact allyl side chain of allylcatechol may be oxidized to yield 2’,3’-epoxypropylcatechol. This {{can serve as a}} substrate for an epoxide hydratase enzyme, and will hydrate the 2’,3’-epoxypropylcatechol to 2’,3’-dihydroxypropylcatechol. This new compound can be oxidized to form propanoic acid (PPA), which is a substance that is related to an increase in oxidative stress and Glutathione S-transferase activity. PPA also causes a decrease in glutathione and Glutathione Peroxidase activity. The epoxide of allylcatechol may also be generated from the cleavage of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> group of the safrole epoxide. The cleavage of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> ring and the metabolism of the allyl group involve the hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidases.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{because of}} the altered {{structural}} and functional properties of cytochrome P450, loss of ribosomes which {{are attached to the}} endoplasmatic reticulum through cytochrome P450 may occur. The allyl group thus directly contributes to mutagenicity, while the <b>methylenedioxy</b> group is associated with changes in the cytochrome P450 system and epigenetic aspects of carcinogenicity. In rats, safrole and related compounds produced both benign and malignant tumors after intake through the mouth. Changes in the liver are also observed through the enlargement of liver cells and cell death.|$|E
50|$|Difluoromethylenedioxyamphetamine (DiFMDA) is a {{substituted}} {{derivative of}} 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), which {{was developed by}} Daniel Trachsel and coworkers, along with the corresponding fluorinated derivatives of MDMA, MDEA, BDB and MBDB, {{with the aim of}} finding a non-neurotoxic drug able {{to be used as a}} less harmful substitute for entactogenic drugs such as MDMA. Since a major route of the normal metabolism of these compounds is scission of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> ring, producing neurotoxic metabolites such as alpha-methyldopamine, it was hoped that the difluoromethylenedioxy bioisostere would show increased metabolic stability and less toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Toxicological {{studies have}} shown that safrole is a weak hepatocarcinogen at higher doses in rats and mice. Safrole {{requires}} metabolic activation before exhibiting toxicological effects. Metabolic conversion of the allyl group in safrole is able to produce intermediates which are directly capable of binding covalently with DNA and proteins. Metabolism of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> group to a carbene allows the molecule to form ligand complexes with cytochrome P450 and P448. The formation of this complex leads to lower amounts of available free cytochrome P450. Safrole can also directly bind to cytochrome P450, leading to competitive inhibition.  These two mechanisms result in lowered mixed function oxidase activity.|$|E
5000|$|... 3,4-Ethylenedioxy-N-methyl{{amphetamine}} (EDMA) is an entactogen drug of the amphetamine class. It is an analogue of MDMA {{where the}} <b>methylenedioxy</b> ring {{has been replaced}} by an ethylenedioxy ring. EDMA was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL, the dosage is listed as 150-250 mg, and the duration listed as 3-5 hours. According to Shulgin, EDMA produces a bare threshold consisting of paresthesia, nystagmus, and hypnogogic imagery, with few to no other effects. Scientific research has demonstrated that EDMA acts as a non-neurotoxic serotonin releasing agent with moderately diminished potency relative to MDMA, and with negligible effects on dopamine release. Based on Shulgins reports of essential inactivity at 150-250 mg, it may be more active at higher doses.|$|E
5000|$|Safrole can undergo {{many forms}} of metabolism. The two major routes are the {{oxidation}} of the allyl side chain and the oxidation of the <b>methylenedioxy</b> group. The oxidation of the allyl side chain is mediated by a cytochrome P450 complex, which will transform safrole into 1’-hydroxysafrole. The newly formed 1’-hydroxysafrole will undergo a phase II of Drug Metabolism reaction with a Sulfotransferase enzyme to create 1’-sulfoxysafrole, which can cause DNA adducts. A different oxidation pathway of the allyl side chain can form safrole epoxide. So far, this has only been found in rats and guinea pigs. The formed epoxide is a small metabolite due to the slow formation and further metabolism of the compound. An epoxide hydratase enzyme will act on the epoxide to form dihydrodiol, which can be secreted in urine.|$|E

Safrole can be found in anise, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper, and as an additive in root beer, chewing gum, toothpaste, soaps, and certain pharmaceutical preparations.
