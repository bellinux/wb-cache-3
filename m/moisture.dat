5|$|Beringia {{received}} more <b>moisture</b> and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. <b>Moisture</b> occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and <b>moisture</b> due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This <b>moisture</b> supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants.

40|$|According to the Darcy’s law, {{filtration}} rate should increase with increasing pressure drop (ΔP) across a filter cake. In centrifugal filtration, ΔP {{is created by}} the free water present {{on the surface of}} a filter cake. Thus, ΔP can become negative when the free water disappears from the cake surface, which makes it difficult to achieve low cake <b>moistures.</b> In the present work, we have developed methods of overcoming this problem by either increasing the air pressure inside or applying vacuum outside a centrifuge. Laboratory dewatering tests conducted using these provisions showed that the <b>moistures</b> of various minerals and coal fines can be reduced to the level that can obviate the need for thermal drying.

40|$|Paddy is a semiaqutic crop {{that is also}} adaptic {{to water}} lacking {{condition}} such as paddy gogo. As common practice in Indonesia, farmers use excessive amount of irrigation water for their paddy field, hoping to yield maximum amount of harvest. Such practice result in the problem of irrigation water supply due to significant amount of irrigation water requirement. However, paddy harvest is actually influenced by the crop variety, water management, soil nutrient availability and land management. A study of irrigation watering pattern is required to obtain irrigation water saving based on the paddy botanical characteristics related to soil nutrient appropriate management {{in order to gain}} optimal harvest. This study applied the pattern of irrigation water supply to five plots of 2 x 3 m 2 model consist of 7 x 11 points, filled with sandy clay soil. The pattern were continuous flooding (PTM), semi flooding – <b>moisturing</b> – semi flooding (SPS), semi flooding - <b>moisturing</b> (SPP), semi flooding – semi <b>moisturing</b> (SPSP) and flooding - <b>moisturing</b> (PP). Three seeds were planted in each point of PTM and PP pattern, and one seed for each of other pattern. Nutrient were given for every paddy plot at the 8 th, 25 th and 40 th day of cultivation. Result of this study showed irrigation water used, which did not include land preparation, and harvest under the PTM, SPS, SPP, SPSP and PP pattern were 5385 l and 3, 9 kg, 4290 l and 3, 9 kg, 4530 l and 4, 3 kg, 4265 l and 3, 0 kg and 3915 l and 4, 9 kg respectively. PP pattern used the least amount of irrigation water but yielded the filler to yield the optimum result, based on the paddy botanical characteristic and appropriate soil nutrient management. It also saved 33, 8 % irrigation water in compare to the conventional practice based on the standard stated by the Ministry of Public Works...|$|R
