40|$|Superhydrophobic {{materials}} {{have a lot}} of interesting potential applications. The self-cleaning property is a unique feature. Rendering the water-loving cellulosic paper superhydrophobic can open the door for value-added applications. Superhydrophobic paper is a fairly new area, and only very limited scientific publications are available in the literature. Among these publications, the topics on the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> in fabrication of superhydrophobic structures account for a large proportion. During the fabrication process, <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments,</b> e. g., silica, precipitated calcium carbonate, and clay, generally need to be hydrophobized, either directly or indirectly. <b>Mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> can be applied to cellulosic paper by surface treatment or wet-end filling, and good dispersabilities of these pigments are always highly demanded. A key mechanistic point is that by tunable particle packing or fabrication, <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> may exhibit surface-roughening effects, which are critical for superhydrophobicity development. The roughening of a hydrophobic surface helps to enhance hydrophobicity. Possible concepts such as nano-structuring or controllable surface patterning of <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> may help to improve superhydrophobicity. Environmental friendliness will also guide the scientific/technical development in this area...|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} online 06 Nov 2013 Cultural heritage {{materials from}} Indigenous cultures often use geological raw {{materials such as}} natural rock and <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments.</b> For analysis, these complex human-altered materials require high-resolution, non-destructive methods, {{and in the case}} of intricate designs, a point-by-point analysis and mapping capability is desirable. The CSIRO Australia HyLogger™ technology has been adapted from mineral exploration and mining applications to the high-resolution non-destructive infrared and visible light spectroscopic mineral analysis of Aboriginal Australian objects. Aboriginal Australian people primarily applied <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> such as hematite and kaolinite to wood, fibre, bark, resin or other organic substrates, making non-destructive in situ scientific analyses of cultural objects challenging. This proof of concept study demonstrated the utility of the near-IR technology for the visual and mineralogical analysis of six Aboriginal Australian objects, of varying size and pigment application, as case studies for the development of methods to identify and differentiate types of <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> regardless of the substrate or binder. While many identified pigments such as hematite and goethite were expected for the red, orange and yellow pigments, HyLogger™ in combination with The Spectral Geologist™ software identified additional mixtures of previously unknown mineral components. White minerals, such as calcite and pyrophyllite, were identified along with kaolinite in mixtures in white pigments on the artefacts. Analyses of individual spectra were used for interpretation of spectral features for specific pigments. Additionally, classes of pigment groups were identified for spectral analysis. This manuscript presents the novel application of the near-IR technology to Australian Aboriginal artefacts for characterisation and high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy of applied <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments.</b> These results challenge and add to prior knowledge about the mineralogical composition of traditional Aboriginal Australian inorganic pigments.

40|$|NoThe {{adoption}} of <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> for artistic expression {{can be traced}} back to the paintings of the Magdalenian and Cro-Magnon cultures of about 25 [*] 000 years BCE, wherein a limited range of oxides such as pyrolusite, goethite, and hematite were utilized along with the first synthetic pigment, carbon, to decorate cave dwellings with surprisingly lifelike images. The growth of chemistry created a new palette of colors, culminating in the preparation of organic dyes and pigments in the mid-nineteenth century. The historical usage of <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> largely based on metal sulfides, oxides, carbonates, sulfates, and nitrates followed by early natural organic extracts from botanical and insect species such as dragon's blood, indigo, gamboge, and cochineal that were later partially superseded by a wide range of synthetic azo dyes is described, where possible alongside their accepted date of first adoption in artworks; while this is relatively easy to define in the case of synthetic materials, it is rather more conjectural for the establishment of an historical timeline for naturally occurring minerals. The characterization of pigments using analytical chemical techniques applied to artworks and artifacts can therefore be used to identify an out-of-context material in an otherwise perfectly acceptable work of art sufficient to render an appellation of ‘fake’ being applied to the object. However, unrecorded later restoration whereby an artwork has been retouched using modern, more stable pigments replacing their more fugitive analogues can cause problems in this respect. In this article, the <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> used are tabulated along with their synthetic counterparts that frequently have precise dates for their appearance in the chemical literature giving rise to a contextual and chronological aspect to analytical science applied to artworks – a forensic art theme. Much work has recently been discussed in the analytical discrimination between natural <b>mineral</b> <b>pigments</b> used historically and their more recent synthetic counterparts: here, terminological differences are critically important and often lacking – hence, the confused usage of terms such as cinnabar and vermilion, lapis lazuli and ultramarine, which are to be found in artists' manuals and contemporary texts...|$|R
