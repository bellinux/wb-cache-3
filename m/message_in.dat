The Ωelected leader simulates processes it suspects to have crashed (♦S). For fault-tolerance, it uses a new cheap Generic Broadcast algorithm that requires only a majority of correct processes (n> 2 f) and, in failurefree runs, delivers all non-conflicting <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> two steps.

5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden <b>message</b> <b>in</b> Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E
