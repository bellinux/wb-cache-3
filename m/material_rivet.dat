40|$|Abstract. Lightweight materials, such as {{aluminum}} die castings, {{are used}} {{more and more}} for automotive applications. Due to the limited weldability, joining these <b>materials</b> by self-pierce <b>riveting</b> has been established. The challenge {{in this regard is}} that these materials, especially new high strength aluminum die castings, have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining by forming of these materials can be accompanied by cracks, which develop during the forming operation. This paper shows the experimental and numerical investigation of a new die concept for self-pierce <b>riveting</b> <b>materials</b> with limited ductility. At the new tool concept the riveting die is separated and a movable die element is used. This element allows that the parts are superimposed with compressive stresses during the self-pierce riveting process. In the paper it can be shown, that in contrast to the conventional process crack-free joints can be generated by using the new tool concept. Determination of the joining parameters and the die design was supported by simulative investigations. Additionally, the new and the conventional self-pierce riveting process are compared on the basis of results from the experimental investigations...|$|R

The obtained experimental self-heating curves show dispersion non observed in homogeneous materials, this phenomenon is explained by the lack of determination of the representative elementary volume of the puddled iron. However, this data gives us important information such as the minimum and maximum boundaries of the mean fatigue limit for several orientations.

During bird impact on such leading edges, the fasteners in baffle plate are subjected to pull through tensile forces due to buckling of the skin.

In a structure, a joint is {{considered}} as the weakest part, {{and it should}} not get separated when subjected to loading, so that an unstable collapse of structure can be avoided. It is important to investigate the failure in joint before it is used in a structure. Failure of a joint depends on {{various factors such as}} the geometry of joint configuration, sheet strength that are joined, <b>rivet</b> <b>material</b> used, cracks developed during joining, and many other. Self-Piercing riveting process is a new technology for joining sheet metals in automobile and aircraft industries. This process has many advantages over conventional joining processes. In this thesis, the failure of a self-piercing riveted joint is investigated. Failure of three different riveted configurations under 35 m/s and 60 m/s velocities were predicted using the general purpose non-linear finite element software LS-DYNA. This research is divided into three stages of work. In the first stage, a 2 D simulation of riveting process is carried out over two Aluminum sheets. An r-adaptive methodology is utilized to acquire a higher accuracy of results and to avoid high element distortion. A parametrical study is then conducted to study the effect of rivet penetration velocity and adaptive mesh size varies the quality of the joint. In the second stage of work, a spring back analysis of joint is conducted to study the deformations of work piece after the riveting process. In the third stage, a Peel specimen, a U-shaped single riveted connection, and a U-shaped double riveted connection were investigated for failure under 35 m/s and 60 m/s velocities in both shear and tension testing conditions. Three different loading conditions were used for testing. The results from this study will show how process parameters can influence the quality of riveted joint, amount of deformations that occur in the work piece after the removal of rigid bodies, and failure load of SPR joint in different configurations...|$|R
40|$|Multiple site damage (MSD) is the {{occurrence}} of many small cracks at multiple locations such as rivet holes. Once the MSD is initiated, the strength of structure may be quickly reduced to an unacceptable level and caused catastrophic failure. ^ This dissertation describes research into the fatigue life of lap joint structure with MSD. The load transfer mechanism in joint structure is studied, including several types of <b>rivets,</b> <b>material</b> properties and structure geometry. The load transfer for each rivet is determined {{as a function of}} crack propagation. Two other mechanisms can affect the load transfer mechanism-interference between the rivet and rivet hole due to riveting process, and clamping pressure between the panels, were also investigated. Since these two mechanisms are complicated to analyze, and rely {{on the quality of the}} manufacture and assembly, the riveting process was well controlled by applying the rivet squeeze force through an MTS machine. ^ Single lap joint specimens, containing fatigue MSD in one row of rivet holes, were cycled to failure under constant amplitude loading. A modified MSD life prediction model is used to estimate fatigue life. Predictions for the growth and coalescence of individual cracks are in accordance with the experimental results. During the fatigue tests, the propagation of some small cracks at low remote stress levels were delayed due to clamping-up stress under the countersink rivet head. Marker band analysis, therefore, is utilized to detect the crack growth information under countersink rivet head and includes the delay effect into the fatigue prediction program. ^ The individual/relative effect of two random variables—the interference fit levels and crack length distribution at rivet holes—on MSD fatigue life is investigated. A thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the statistical degradation in residual strength as the Wide Fatigue Damage (WFD) extends by fatigue. The fastener interference, reflected as riveting quality, determines the overall evaluation of fatigue behavior of a lap joint. The influence of both rivet installation (i. e. fastener interference) and initial WFD size on fatigue life and residual strength are presented, and indicate the relative influence of these parameters on structural integrity. ...|$|R
