5|$|The NCTA's November 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report {{included}} {{a proposal for}} an 89-mile (143km), $793 million rail system. The {{total cost of the}} proposed highway and rail system was less than the 1959 plan due to the elimination of controversial freeways. The plan was supported by President Kennedy, but opposed by highway advocates in Congress who reduced the rail system to only 23-miles (37km) within the District of Columbia. However, that proposal was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy's death. The Urban <b>Mass</b> <b>Transportation</b> Act of 1964 passed Congress, which promised 66% federal funding for urban <b>mass</b> <b>transportation</b> projects. Encouraged by the new act, the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi-state authority to operate the system using more non-federal funds. On September 8, 1965, President Johnson signed the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 approving the construction of a 25-mile (40km) rapid transit system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system in the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area, including a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue with a station between Cherry and James streets. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban <b>Mass</b> <b>Transportation</b> Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970.

5|$|Lynn is {{intended}} to be the terminus of a future extension of the MBTA Blue Line, which would bring the line 4.5 additional miles from Wonderland in Revere to Lynn. This extension has been proposed in various forms for over 80 years. The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945–47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn right-of-way. Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland, a further extension to Lynn has been planned. Following on the 1926 and 1945-47 studies, the 1966 Program for <b>Mass</b> <b>Transportation</b> recommended that the Blue Line be extended to Lynn, while the 1969 Recommended Highway and Transit Plan proposed that the extension run as far as Salem. An extension was not present in the 1972 Final Report of the Boston Transportation Planning Review, but the 1974 Transportation Plan revived the project with possible termini of Lynn, Salem, or even Route 128 in Peabody. The 1978 Program for <b>Mass</b> <b>Transportation</b> report and 1983 Transportation Plan both continued support for an extension to Lynn. Despite the continued recommendations, however, other projects like extensions of the Red and Orange lines were given funding instead of the Blue Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the key components of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south branch to serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east branch to serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban <b>Mass</b> <b>Transportation</b> Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970.

5|$|Planning for Metro {{began with}} the <b>Mass</b> <b>Transportation</b> Survey in 1955 which {{attempted}} to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency's 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report anticipated much of the present Blue Line route in Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It did not include a route in Prince George's County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.|$|E

External coke species, {{as a result of}} further aromatization and hydrogen deficiency [29, 31, 32], are mainly deeply graphitized poly-aromatics showing poor solubility in methylene chloride (methylene chloride insoluble, MCI) [26, 30]. They are typically visually seen in the form of either small concentrations of black carbon particles or an envelope shape around the zeolite crystals which remains as an empty mould after zeolite solubilisation [1, 26, 30].|$|R

25|$|About 4,500 Jews {{lived in}} Slovene areas before the <b>mass</b> <b>transportations</b> to the {{concentration}} camps in 1941.

According to the 1931 census, the Jewish community in the Drava Banovina (the administrative unit corresponding to the Yugoslav part of Slovenia) had less than 1,000 members, mostly concentrated in the easternmost Slovenian region of Prekmurje. In the late 1930s, anti-Jewish legislation was adopted by the pro-German regime of the Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović, supported by also by the largest political party in Slovenia, the conservative Slovene People's Party. The party's leader, Dr. Anton Korošec had a strong antisemitic discourse, and was instrumental in the introduction of the numerus clausus in all Yugoslav universities in 1938.|$|R
