2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} film {{capacitors}} were the cellulose acetate film capacitors, also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized capacitors in paint film thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because polyester film capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the <b>market</b> <b>niche</b> of the MKU type.|$|E

40|$|After {{the broad}} {{industrialization}} of the U. S. swine/pork industry, {{there have been}} numerous <b>niche</b> <b>markets</b> for export and domestic pork developing. With the Midwest’s tradition of a corn-hog family-based agricultural system, the stage was set for the pork <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> phenomena to take root. There are approximately 35 to 40 pork <b>niche</b> <b>marketing</b> efforts currently active in Iowa. A multistate Pork <b>Niche</b> <b>Market</b> Working Group (PNMWG) was started in 2002 in Iowa to “support the development of <b>niche</b> <b>markets</b> for pork, to foster the success of highly differentiated pork value chains that are profitable to all participants that incorporate farmer ownership and control, and contribute to environmental stewardship and rural vitality. ” Pork <b>niche</b> <b>markets</b> embrace a variety of approaches including direct marketing, internet sales, small locker plants, farmer groups, and organized marketing groups. One of the larger and more successful niche marketers of “natural pork” is Niman Ranch Pork, Thornton, Iowa. Niman Ranch pork has more than 200 farmer-producers and processes about 2, 000 pigs weekly. There are indications that U. S. consumers are interested in the environmental, pig welfare, and pig farm ownership and structure characteristics of the pork they buy. Many consumers may be willing to pay more for pork with positive attributes in these areas. <b>Niche</b> <b>markets</b> are attractive to small- and medium-based farmers who have swine experience and facilities. Noted agricultural economist Glenn Grimes of the University of Missouri stated at the 2003 World Pork Expo, Des Moines, Iowa, that “Unless small pork producers have captured a <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> within the pork chain, they will disappear. ” <b>Niche</b> <b>markets</b> seek product differentiation via quality and social or credence attributes. Quality attributes that are claimed by the <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> include certain breeds or genetics, taste or flavor, high quality, freshness, and tenderness. Social or credence attributes often are claimed and include antibiotic and growth promotant-free, family farm raised, “natural,” organic, outdoor or bedded rearing, locally raised, humane rearing, known origin, environment-friendly, and no animal by-products in feed...|$|R

We found two reliable categorizations for high-tech products {{which can be used}} for statistical analysis: industry and product complexity. Regarding the types of <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> applications, we adapted a well-known categorization introduced by the National Bureau of Statistics. The three types of <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> applications are government, business and consumer. Using ANOVA and chi-square tests, we found the most common types and the average number of <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> applications which appear prior to large-scale diffusion.
