In 1972, the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (JASIN) utilized special observations from weather ships for their research.

2500|$|In late July 2014, the Navy {{confirmed}} that Coronado would test-launch the Norwegian Naval Strike Missile in September. [...] Although {{there is no}} current requirement for the missile aboard Littoral Combat Ships, it is significantly larger than the AGM-114 Hellfire missile slated to be integrated onto the ship classes, and the Navy is testing its feasibility in an increased anti-surface warfare role for the ships. [...] The test was meant to {{provide insight into the}} missile's capabilities, see if it could fit aboard the ship, and review the detect-to-engage sequence of firing a long-range weapon from an LCS. The test occurred on 24 September 2014. The missile was successfully fired from a launcher positioned on ship's flight deck at a <b>mobile</b> <b>ship</b> target.|$|E

25|$|Ships in Eve Online come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, <b>mobile</b> <b>ships</b> {{good for}} {{disruption}} and harassment) and destroyers (slightly {{larger and more}} offensively oriented than frigates). Medium starships include cruisers (multipurpose ships with many possible roles) and battlecruisers (heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers). Battleships (heavily armed and armoured dedicated combat ships) make up the large size class. Extra-large (or capital-class) starships include carriers (mobile bases that can launch fighters and are adept at repairing other ships), dreadnoughts (dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships).|$|R

50|$|The {{final and}} most {{commonly}} known name, the Dartmouth Marine Slips, eventually evolved. They offered a complete range of repair services for vessels up to 3,000 tons. The Slips {{had a reputation}} for being a “quick turn-around” repair site. An additional 800 ft of berthing space was created to accommodate vessels needing alongside repairs. The Dartmouth Marine Slips provided a variety of services in its latter years: emergency and scheduled repair services for international and domestic fleets, extended repair services to offshore supply vessels servicing drill rigs off Canada's east coast, and also offered float repairs anywhere in Atlantic Canada by <b>mobile</b> <b>ship</b> crew using work boats and work barges.

After those cases Chichvarkin accused Russian law-enforcement agencies of corporate raiding.|$|R
5000|$|Other projects, {{such as the}} ResidenSea, have {{similarly}} {{attempted to}} create mobile communities, though they have conservatively limited themselves to the constraints of conventional shipbuilding. In regards to the economic flexibility and [...] "freedom" [...] created by such mobile settlements, these projects {{could be considered a}} realization of the avant-garde Walking City concept from 1964, by British architect Ron Herron of the group Archigram. The Freedom Ship also served as the inspiration for (and is closely resembled by) the Libertania, a <b>mobile</b> <b>ship</b> depicted in Grant Morrison's comic book The Filth. Buckminster Fuller also proposed, in the 1950s, [...] "floating cities" [...] approximately a mile wide that could accommodate up to 50,000 permanent inhabitants. Mike Wallace interviewed Buckminster Fuller on TV regarding this [...] "floating cities" [...] concept which Fuller explained would free up land needed for agriculture and industrial uses.|$|E
5000|$|A {{champion}} of New Deal domestic programs, Hill criticized Eisenhower's attempts to reduce hospital funding under the Hill-Burton Act {{that he had}} co-sponsored. Unlike most southern senators, Hill favored federal control of offshore oil with proceeds earmarked for education. Hill strongly supported rural electrification, federally subsidized freight rates, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Martin also supported the TVA and noted that the original sponsor of the inter-state development agency was a Republican U.S. senator, George W. Norris of Nebraska. Martin said that the TVA headquarters should be relocated from Knoxville, Tennessee, to its original point of development, Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Hill claimed credit for the deepening of the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Ship</b> Channel, {{the building of the}} Gainesville Lock and Dam in Sumter County, and the proposed Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, a much-criticized link between the Tennessee River with the Gulf of Mexico. [...] According to Hill, [...] "If Alabama is to continue the progress and development she has achieved, she cannot do so by deserting the great Democratic Party." [...] Senator Hill pledged to seek renewed funding for the Redstone Arsenal and George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and accused Eisenhower of having neglected the space program while the former Soviet Union was placing Sputnik into the atmosphere. Strongly endorsed by organized labor, Hill accused the GOP of exploiting the South to enrich the North and the East and attacked the legacy of former President Herbert C. Hoover and the earlier [...] "evils" [...] of Reconstruction. He boasted that Alabama voters would bury the Republicans [...] "under an avalanche." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, Hill sought {{his last}} {{term in office}} but faced an unusually strong Republican {{opponent}} in James D. Martin, a petroleum products distributor from Gadsden. Like Hill, Martin supported the Tennessee Valley Authority, a New Deal project begun in 1933. Martin noted that the original sponsor of the inter-state development agency was a Republican U.S. senator, George W. Norris of Nebraska. Martin proposed in the campaign that the TVA headquarters be relocated from Knoxville, Tennessee, to its original point of development, Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Hill had worked to fund other public works projects too, including the deepening of the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Ship</b> Channel, {{the building of the}} Gainesville Lock and Dam in Sumter County, and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, an ultimately successful strategy to link the Tennessee River with the Gulf of Mexico.
