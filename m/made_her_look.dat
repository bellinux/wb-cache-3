5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E

25|$|During filming, {{considerable}} publicity {{was given}} to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> {{the same age as}} Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.|$|E
500|$|James Hunt of Den of Geek {{said that}} it was a [...] "very good episode" [...] despite being [...] "Wesley-heavy".

Michelle Erica Green, whilst writing for TrekNation, described the episode as [...] "craptastic" [...] and Wesley as [...] "intolerable". She said that knowing about the [...] "insane" [...] alien parasite conspiracy in [...] "Conspiracy" [...] ahead of time <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> negatively on the episode.|$|E
500|$|During the January 2005 second inauguration ceremonies for her husband, Laura Bush was looked highly upon by People magazine, The Washington Post, {{and others}} for her elegance and fashion sense. At the inauguration she wore a winter white {{cashmere}} dress and matching coat designed by Oscar de la Renta. Following the inauguration were the inaugural galas, to which Bush wore a pale, aqua lace gown, sprinkled with crystals, with long sleeves in a silver blue mist. The tulle gown was also designed for her by de la Renta. According to The Washington Post, [...] "t <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> radiant and glamorous." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing Emma's {{style and}} costuming, Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich has explained: [...] "We {{wanted to make}} her look like everything’s so neat—perfectly ironed and tucked-in shirts with matching belts, shoes and pins. We wanted to make her {{stand out from the}} other teachers. She’s always so happy and excited, so we wanted her outfits to represent that sunny disposition. In the pilot, we <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping her bright and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma’s also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. It makes her look prim and almost old-fashioned." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2012, {{eleventh}} season contestant of American Idol, Hollie Cavanagh, {{covered the}} song. Her performance received mixed reviews from the judges of the show, {{who said that}} she was [...] "a little pitchy" [...] and added that she seemed to be [...] "overthinking" [...] the song. Amy Reiter of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "her clear, crisp tone, crashed and burned on 'Honesty,' missing notes and losing her way". Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post was mixed about her performance writing, [...] "She was occasionally pitchy on this song, and seemed to be overthinking it in parts and allowing the song to overwhelm her... Unusually, she seemed both nasal and pitchy in the early parts of the performance... her choice of a pantsuit was completely baffling, since it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> nearer 40 than 20." [...] Later, during an interview, Cavanagh revealed that she had difficulties singing the song because she had never heard it before.|$|E
500|$|She also {{performed}} the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 18, 2014. The performance was the restart of Gaga's emergence under media spotlight, following a self-imposed sabbatical due to depression and stories about betrayal surrounding {{the release of}} Artpop. The singer wore a white dress and sported a platinum blond wig; the ensemble <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like fashion designer Donatella Versace. Starting the song as an acoustic version, Gaga played a crystal piano placed atop a ramp {{at the end of}} the stage. By the second chorus, the electronic beats of the song started and she descended to the front of the stage to complete the performance with a dance. Carl Williot from Idolator complimented the performance, saying that it made him appreciate the track more. It was praised by Melinda Newman from HitFix who said that [...] "Gaga excels when it is just her at a piano performing the songs with the barest of accompaniment." ...|$|E

500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She {{might have been a}} little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|After {{roles in}} the comedy-drama Postcards from the Edge (1990) and the comedy-fantasy Defending Your Life (1991), Streep starred with Goldie Hawn in farcical black comedy, Death Becomes Her (1992), with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer David Koepp to rewrite several of the scenes, {{particularly}} {{the one in which}} her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was [...] "unrealistically male" [...] in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which she got into character by [...] "thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time". Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that they <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> nearer 70. Longworth considers Death Becomes Her to have been [...] "the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling". Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics. [...] Times Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's [...] "wicked-witch routine" [...] but dismissed the film as [...] "She-Devil with a make-over" [...] and one which [...] "hates women".|$|E
500|$|As Elizabeth aged {{her image}} {{gradually}} changed. She was portrayed as Belphoebe or Astraea, {{and after the}} Armada, as Gloriana, the eternally youthful Faerie Queene of Edmund Spenser's poem. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss {{to such an extent}} that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, reported an audience with the queen, during which he noticed, [...] "her teeth are very yellow and unequal... and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." [...] Yet he added, [...] "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal." [...] Sir Walter Raleigh called her [...] "a lady whom time had surprised". However, the more Elizabeth's beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it.|$|E
60|$|The cry {{for mercy}} {{was on her}} lips, but the instant our eyes met, it died away in long, low, hysterical moanings. Her cheeks were ghastly, her {{features}} were rigid, her eyes glared like an idiot's; guilt and terror had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> hideous to <b>look</b> upon already.|$|R
5000|$|LoleLole is {{the gypsy}} love {{interest}} of the now deceased Manu and Ugo. She is described in the novel as [...] "Her hands deep {{in the pockets of}} a straw-coloured bathrobe. The colour <b>made</b> <b>her</b> skin <b>look</b> browner than usual and emphasized the blackness of her hair, which she was wearing short now. Her hips may have grown thicker, he wasn't sure.

500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} and world designs were handled by art director Kentaro Kagami, and artist and graphics designer Masashi Nakagawa. Leanne {{was the first}} character to be envisioned, before most of the game's concepts had been finalized. The second was Zephyr, who was nicknamed [...] "Boy of the Demonic Possession". The third was Vashyron, who was dubbed [...] "ultimate gentleman". While originally conceived as a [...] "glistening" [...] character, he was reworked as a big brother figure, which in turn led to the scene where he and Zephyr first fight. Rowen's early artwork depict his position as an authority figure {{looking down on the}} world from the Zenith System. According to Kagami, his character artwork was created in consultation with Norimoto and Suguro. The three main characters went through multiple design revisions. While Zephyr and Vashyron were designed to reflect the grim environment of Basel, Leanne was meant to contrast against them. Zephyr was initially a lighter, less antagonistic character due to him being younger than Leanne. Unlike other characters, Vashyron's design went through a fairly smooth development process, with his clothing remaining consistent through the design phase. Leanne's clothing {{took a long time to}} finalize: earlier versions of her were based on a concept of her being fashion conscious, but this <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> odd next to the other characters. The small cast was something decided upon at an early stage, along with adjusting the male characters to appear less feminine than others from Japanese RPGs. The latter change was made with a Western audience in mind.|$|E
2500|$|After {{attending}} college, {{she became}} known {{by her family}} as [...] "Mitchi" [...] (ミッチ), but admitted to have also been named in her childhood as [...] "Temple-chan", because of her curly hair and reddish hues unusual for a Japanese girl which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like the American child actress Shirley Temple.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a sad}} thing, too, {{that when}} the last snow had melted, when the purple and yellow crocuses were {{coming up in the}} garden, and the old church was already half pulled down, Milly had an illness which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> lips <b>look</b> pale, and {{rendered}} it absolutely necessary that she should not exert herself for some time. Mr. Brand, the Shepperton doctor so obnoxious to Mr. Pilgrim, ordered her to drink port-wine, and it was quite necessary to have a charwoman very often, to assist Nanny in all the extra work that fell upon her.|$|R
6000|$|The {{apartment}} was looking somewhat frouzy, for the Maxwells breakfasted late, and the house-maid {{had not had}} time {{to put it in}} order. Louise saw it through her father's and mother's eyes with the glance they gave it, and found the rooms ridiculously little, and furnished with cheap Fourteenth Street things; but she bragged all the more noisily of it on that account, and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>look</b> out of the window for the pretty view they had from their corner room. Mrs. Hilary pulled her head back from the prospect of the railroad-ridden avenue with silent horror, and Louise burst into a wild laugh. [...] "Well, it isn't Commonwealth Avenue, mamma; I don't pretend that, you know." ...|$|R
50|$|The piece Jimbirlam and Kumerra, also {{referred}} to as Jimbirla and Gemerre, meaning Spearheads and Scarifications, was originally a black-and-white piece, but it was decided by the museum to convert it to a grey-on-grey piece, so that it would fit in with the aesthetics of the Haussmannian buildings across from the museum. Early experiments for the templates which would eventually be placed on the museum exterior wall were rejected by Nyadbi because they lacked contrast and she believed it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> artwork <b>look</b> like sausages. <b>Her</b> initial reluctance to approve the template designs almost lead to her being ejected from the project. The resultant rendering of the piece is now found on an exterior wall of the museum and is visible from rue de l'Universite.|$|R
2500|$|Rachel Weisz as Abigail Salmon, Susie's mother. After Susie's murder, {{her mother}} despairs and {{abandons}} the family. Weisz stated that playing {{the character and}} the film and novel's [...] "uplifting theme" [...] <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> at life as a [...] "treasure" [...] and the film gave her a [...] "positive feeling" [...] rather than a [...] "depressed" [...] one.|$|E

2500|$|Minnesota Republican Congresswoman {{and presidential}} {{candidate}} Michele Bachmann was {{featured on the}} cover of Newsweek magazine in August 2011, dubbed [...] "the Queen of Rage". The photo of her was perceived as unflattering, as it portrayed her with a wide eyed expression some said <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> [...] "crazy". Sources called the depiction [...] "sexist", and Sarah Palin denounced the publication. Newsweek defended the cover's depiction of her, saying its other photos of Bachmann showed similar intensity.|$|E
5000|$|What {{followed}} was massive criticism totally unseen in Hong Kong pageant history. [...] The {{media and the}} public severely bashed Cheung for {{being one of the}} least beautiful Miss Hong Kong winners ever. TVB, the organizer of the pageant, claimed that the onstage performance on the final night was just part of the game and Cheung had showed very strong communication skills when meeting the judges before the final, which might prove decisive. The public were not convinced, and insisted that Cheung's win was fixed. The bashing continued to the point that there were informal polls among internet fans on whether there should be a re-election of Miss Hong Kong 2007. Nevertheless, Cheung handled the pressure gracefully and remained calm and composed whenever she was asked about all the harsh comments <b>made</b> on <b>her</b> <b>looks.</b>|$|R
60|$|One morning, about eleven, Dorothea {{was seated}} in her boudoir with {{a map of the}} land {{attached}} to the manor and other papers before her, which were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her income and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but was seated with her hands folded on <b>her</b> lap, <b>looking</b> out along the avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent the prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease--motiveless, if her own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow's cap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing <b>made</b> <b>her</b> face <b>look</b> all the younger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|...
