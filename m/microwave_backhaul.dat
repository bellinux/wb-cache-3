Yet, recent studies have pointed out that the backhaul energy consumption cannot be neglected when a small cell deployment is introduced. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study on energy efficiency, cost issues and trade-offs for backhaul infrastructure when the influence of Radio Access Network (RAN) design and growth strategies are considered. For the case study, we use two well-known backhaul architectures, one supported on fiber-to-the-building (FTTB) + 10 Gbps passive optical Network (10 GPON) and a second which consists of FTTB+ <b>Microwave</b> <b>backhauling.</b> The numerical results and analysis performed provide significant insights of the potential energy savings, CAPEX, OPEX and challenges for backhaul and RAN architecture design...|$|R

40|$|The {{exponentially}} increasing {{traffic demand}} for mobile services requires innovative solutions in both access and backhaul segments of 5 th generation (5 G) mobile networks. Although, heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are a promising {{solution for the}} wireless access, the backhaul segment has received considerably less attention and falls short in meeting the stringent requirements of 5 G in terms of capacity and availability. HetNets together with mobility requirements motivate the use of <b>microwave</b> <b>backhauling</b> that supports fiber-like capacity with millimeter-wave communications. However, higher carrier frequencies are subject to weather disturbances like rain that may substantially degrade the network throughput. To mitigate this effect, we develop a fast and accurate rain detection algorithm that triggers a network-layer strategy, i. e., rerouting. The results show that with small detection error the network throughput increases while posing small overhead on the network. The rain impact can be alleviated by centralized rerouting under the software defined networking paradigm. However, careless reconfiguration may impose inconsistency {{that leads to a}} significant temporary congestion and limits the gain of rerouting. We propose a consistency-aware rerouting framework by considering the cost of reconfiguration. At each time, the centralized controller may either take a rerouting or no-rerouting decision in order to minimize the total data loss. We use a predictive control algorithm to provide such an online sequence of decisions. Compared to the regular rerouting, our proposed approach reduces the throughput loss and substantially decreases the number of reconfigurations. In the thesis we also study which backhaul option is the best from a techno-economic perspective. We develop a comprehensive framework to calculate the total cost of ownership of the backhaul segment and analyze the profitability in terms of cash flow and net present value. The results highlight the importance of selecting proper backhaul solution to increase profitability. QC 20170308 </p...|$|R
40|$|Relaying {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied during the last decades and has found numerous applications in wireless communications. The simplest relaying method, namely amplify and forward, has shown potential in MIMO multiple access systems, when Gaussian fading channels are assumed for both hops. However, in some cases ill conditioned channels may appear on the second hop. For example, this impairment could affect cooperative BS systems with <b>microwave</b> link <b>backhauling,</b> which involve strong line of sight channels with insufficient scattering. In this paper, we consider a large system analysis of such as model focusing on both optimal joint decoding and joint MMSE filtering receivers. Analytical methods based on free probability are presented for calculating the ergodic throughput, the MMSE error and the average SINR. Furthermore, the performance degradation of the system throughput is evaluated considering second hop impairments such as ill-conditioning and rank deficiency, while high- and low-SNR limits are calculated for the considered performance metrics.

The backhauling of the small cells in densely populated urban area is again a very difficult task to handle with Government regulations (eccentricities) and restrictions. Current trend in backhauling of small cells used fiber optic and twisted pair media result in increase in operational and deployment cost takes very long time and require permission from Govt. to deploy the cables, even Line of Sight (LoS) wireless link in densely urban area is not easy to achieve and non Line of Sight (NLoS) link result in decrease in power (signal strength) and require intelligent planning and difficult to operate and maintain. At the same time existing of new technologies in limited spectrum and to provide higher date rates for data traffic is again a challenge for mobile operators. The one possible solution to backhauling of small cells in NLoS situation is through cognitive radio spectrum sensing. In this thesis work the concept of spectrum optimization in small cells backhauling and challenges to achieve this have been introduced. Optimization has been done for different RF parameters and link budget of different networks in cognitive domain has been calculated and best possible network for backhauling of small cells is selected to enhance user demand. Dedicated link between the transmitter and receiver is not always the case. To cater for, the later Non-Line-of-Sight communication is opted for especially in scenarios which include urban, dense urban or where re-planning is done on a constant basis to provide coverage to tricky areas. To address this concept of small cells was introduced but along with it backhauling emerged as a major problem. Wired and wireless solutions have been closely observed and out of which <b>microwave</b> <b>backhauling</b> stood out. With NLoS, propagation impairments get mounted and expected outcomes are hindered. An alternate to it as mentioned in our thesis is the approach of optimization of cognitive radio in NLoS backhauling of small cells. This approach has the potential of lowering the NLoS propagation impairments which include diffraction, reflection and scattering. At the same time it is an answer to cost, coverage and capacity. 0046 - 727607055 (Paresh Kumar Lakhani) 0046 - 764468661 (Ajay Gul) 0046 - 761687555 (Fahad Naveed...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{communication}} networks {{account for}} 0. 5 % {{of the global}} energy consumption, a value {{that is expected to}} double within the next five years. For this reason, means of reducing the energy consumption in cellular mobile radio networks has recently gained great interest within the research community. In mobile networks the backhaul contribution to the total power consumption is usually neglected because of its limited impact compared to that of the radio base stations. However, meeting the almost exponential increase in mobile data traffic requires a large number of (mainly small) base stations. This means that backhaul networks will take a significant share of the cost and the energy consumption in future systems. Their actual contribution to the energy consumption will depend on the radio base station deployment scenario {{as well as on the}} technology and topology choices for the backhaul itself. This paper presents an initial assessment of the power consumption of two established backhaul technologies, i. e., fiber and microwave. For the <b>microwave</b> case, three <b>backhaul</b> topologies are considered, i. e., tree, ring and star, while for the fiber case only one topology is analysed, i. e., a dedicated point-to-point star. The presented results, assuming off-the-shelf products and based on todays network capacity levels, confirm the importance of considering the backhaul when minimizing the total power consumption in heterogeneous network scenarios. They also show the impact of the basic technology and topology choices of the backhaul for minimizing total power consumption...|$|R
