5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has {{had a profound effect}} on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain. Upon infection, TgPVR mice show signs of paralysis that resemble those of poliomyelitis in humans and monkeys, and the central nervous systems of paralyzed mice are histocytochemically {{similar to those of}} humans and monkeys. This <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
40|$|Several diverse genetically {{engineered}} <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of pancreatic exocrine neoplasia have been developed. These <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> have {{a spectrum of}} pathologic changes; however, until now, {{there has been no}} uniform nomenclature to characterize these changes. An international workshop, sponsored by The National Cancer Institute and the University of Pennsylvania, was held from December 1 to 3, 2004 with the goal of establishing an internationally accepted uniform nomenclature for the pathology of {{genetically engineered}} <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of pancreatic exocrine neoplasia. The pancreatic pathology in 12 existing <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of pancreatic neoplasia was reviewed at this workshop, and a standardized nomenclature with definitions and associated images was developed. It is our intention that this nomenclature will standardize the reporting of genetically engineered <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of pancreatic exocrine neoplasia, that it will facilitate comparisons between genetically engineered <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> and human pancreatic disease, and that it will be broad enough to accommodate newly emerging <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of pancreatic neoplasi...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{established}} an EPS cell-based approach for efficiently generating <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> with precise genetic modifications. This approach combines EPS cells, tetraploid complementation and CRISPR/Cas 9 technology, which permits {{the production of}} <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> that are precisely genetically modified within 2 months. Using this new approach, we successfully generated <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> that replaced the mouse Il 3 and Il 6 genes with their human counterparts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using our approach to efficiently and rapidly create <b>mouse</b> <b>models,</b> especially those {{that are difficult to}} produce using conventional gene-targeting strategies.|$|R
5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine. Prenatal cocaine exposure in a <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E
5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such as cancer, {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In the largest study conducted so far, bevacizumab infusion {{was associated with a}} decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of epistaxis in treated HHT patients. Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. Thalidomide treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonylureas are {{effective}} in the KATP channel forms of neonatal-onset diabetes. The <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of MODY diabetes suggested that the reduced clearance of sulfonylureas stands behind their therapeutic success in human MODY patients, but Urbanova et al. found that human MODY patients respond differently to the <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> {{and that there was}} no consistent decrease in the clearance of sulfonylureas in randomly selected HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY patients.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{established}} {{a new approach}} to directly generate gene-targeted <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> with the integration of EPS cells and tetraploid complementation. We demonstrated its feasibility by generating genetically modified <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> in which the human IL 3 or IL 6 gene was knocked into its corresponding locus in the mouse genome. This novel approach addresses a major barrier to construct <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> with comprehensive genetic modifications, greatly decreasing the time to generate genetically modified animals.|$|R

40|$|One unifying {{explanation}} for the complexity of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) {{may lie in the}} disruption of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) circuit balance during critical periods of development. We examined whether Parvalbumin (PV) -positive inhibitory neurons, which normally drive experience-dependent circuit refinement (Hensch Nat Rev Neurosci 6 : 877 – 888, 1), are disrupted across heterogeneous ASD <b>mouse</b> <b>models.</b> We performed a meta-analysis of PV expression in previously published ASD <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> and analyzed two additional models, reflecting an embryonic chemical insult (prenatal valproate, VPA) or single-gene mutation identified in human patients (Neuroligin- 3, NL- 3 R 451 C). PV-cells were reduced in the neocortex across multiple ASD <b>mouse</b> <b>models.</b> In striking contrast to controls, both VPA and NL- 3 <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> exhibited an asymmetric PV-cell reduction across hemispheres in parietal and occipital cortices (but not the underlying area CA 1). ASD <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> may share a PV-circuit disruption, providing new insight into circuit development and potential prevention by treatment of autism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Mouse</b> <b>models</b> {{of human}} cancer play an {{important}} role in understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and have accelerated the search for finding new molecular targets for cancer therapy. However, genetically engineered <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have only recently overcome major technical obstacles and begun to be explored. Here we review the current progress in the development of <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> for human HNSCC, with emphasis on conditional transgenic and knockout <b>mouse</b> <b>models.</b> These new models faithfully recapitulate human HNSCC at both the pathologic and molecular levels. These animal models will not only be useful to define the roles of specific genes in HNSCC development and progression but will also provide a unique tool for developing and testing new therapeuti...|$|R
