25|$|Mechanical dimming {{shutters}} used to {{vary the}} intensity of the light output. Mechanical dimmers are usually a specially designed disk or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutter.</b> Shutters with high speed stepper motors can be used to create strobe effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (<b>mechanical</b> <b>shutter</b> speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E

40|$|A new {{technique}} for reducing errors in a laser-cooled cesium fountain frequency standard provides for strong {{suppression of the}} light shift without need for <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutters.</b> Because <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutters</b> are typically susceptible to failure after operating times {{of the order of}} months, the elimination of <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutters</b> could contribute significantly to the reliability of frequency standards that are required to function continuously for longer time intervals. With respect to the operation of an atomic-fountain frequency standard, the term "light shift" denotes an undesired relative shift in the two energy levels of the atoms (in this case, cesium atoms) in the atomic fountain during interrogation by microwaves. The shift in energy levels translates to a frequency shift that reduces the precision and possibly accuracy of the frequency standard. For reasons too complex to describe within the space available for this article, the light shift is caused by any laser light that reaches the atoms during the microwave- interrogation period, but is strongest for near-resonance light. In the absence of any mitigating design feature, the light shift, expressed as a fraction of the standard fs frequency, could be as large as approx. 2 x 10 (exp - 11), the largest error in the standard. In a typical prior design, to suppress light shift, the intensity of laser light is reduced during the interrogation period by using a single-pass acoustooptic modulator to deflect the majority of light away from the main optical path. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>shutters</b> are used to block the remaining undeflected light to ensure complete attenuation. Without shutters, this remaining undeflected light could cause a light shift of as much as. 10. 15, which is unacceptably large in some applications. The {{new technique}} implemented here involves additionally shifting the laser wavelength off resonance by a relatively large amount (typically of the order of nanometers) during microwave interrogation. In this design, when microwave interrogation is not underway, the atoms are illuminated by a slave laser locked to the lasing frequency of a lower power master laser...|$|R

30|$|Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is {{an ideal}} method to grow nano-structures. MBE allows for the {{controlled}} growth of films with sharp doping profiles and different chemical compositions changing over a spatial depth of several angstroms. Multi-layer structures with alternating doping (n, p, or intrinsic) or alternating band gaps can be grown. In addition, self-organized effects can be applied for growing the nano-structures with controlled dimensions that are {{not only in the}} growth direction (thickness) but also laterally in the plane of the growth surface. These nano-structures are well known as quantum wells (QWs), quantum wires, and quantum dots (QDs). When their sizes are decreased, the quantum confinement effect becomes the dominant contribution to their electric and optical properties. Because quantum confinement energy is inversely proportional to size (1 /L), accuracy of size is very important to fabricate the nano-structures. However, MBE cannot avoid the effects of shutter transients (STs) by which a prominent inaccuracies are caused by strong flux transients after opening the shutter due to temperature gradients in the cells. In an MBE system, beam sources are provided by thermal evaporation of solid source materials in the cells, and the beam sources are individually controlled by <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutters</b> to obtain the intended structures. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutters</b> also reflect heat back into the cells. Therefore, a temperature gradient occurs when the <b>mechanical</b> <b>shutters</b> are moved. The studies conducted for STs were contrasting in two ways: (1) growth rate (GR) decreased and was saturated after a characteristic time constant (CTC) [1 – 4], and (2) the GR was below the desired GR and then approached the target GR within the CTC [5, 6]. Therefore, the effects of STs seemed to be contradictory or to have a machine dependence. Therefore, we have studied the effects of STs for our MBE system.|$|R
