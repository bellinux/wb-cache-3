50|$|Because most Minangkabau {{people are}} Muslims, Minangkabau cuisine follows halal dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, lamb meat, and poultry and fish. Minangkabau people {{are known for}} their fondness of cattle meat {{products}} including offal. Almost all the parts of a cattle, such as <b>meat,</b> <b>ribs,</b> tongue, tail, liver, tripe, brain, bone marrow, spleen, intestine, cartilage, tendon, and skin are made to be Minangkabau delicacies. Seafood is popular in coastal West Sumatran cities, and most are grilled or fried with spicy chili sauce or in curry gravy. Fish, shrimp, and cuttlefish are cooked in similar fashion. Most of Minangkabau food is eaten with hot steamed rice or compressed rice such as katupek (ketupat). Vegetables are mostly boiled such as boiled cassava leaf, or simmered in thin curry as side dishes, such as gulai of young jackfruit or cabbages.|$|R

50|$|Qazy is a dish in Kazakh and Kyrgyz cuisines {{made from}} horse <b>rib</b> <b>meat</b> sausage in natural {{intestine}} casing and sliced horse butt. A reviewer from Vice (magazine) described the dish as smokey and earthy.|$|R
50|$|Horse flesh ribs are cut {{out with}} the meat and hung for 5-7 hours to drain the {{remaining}} blood. The intestines of the horse are thoroughly washed and kept in saline water for 1-2 hours. The <b>meat</b> from the <b>ribs</b> is salted, seasoned with pepper and garlic and left roped in cloth for 2-3 hours. Then the intestines are filled with the <b>rib</b> <b>meat</b> and the two ends of the filled intestine are tied. After this preparation, the kazy can be smoked or hung to dry for {{a week at a}} sun-lit placed exposed to wind. Smoking is performed in a thick smoke of 50-60° for 12-18 hours.|$|R

40|$|Adipose {{tissues from}} the 12 th– 13 th <b>rib</b> <b>interface</b> were sampled at weaning (324 cattle) and {{slaughter}} (310 cattle). The animals were progeny from Hereford dams sired by Angus, Belgian Blue, Hereford, Jersey, Limousin, South Devon and Wagyu. Fatty acid {{composition of the}} triacylglycerol fraction at both stages was measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Estimates of heritability and genetic and phenotypic correlations at weaning and slaughter were computed by restricted maximum likelihood using a sire model in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Results indicated that generally, there were strong, positive genetic correlations between fatty acids at weaning and slaughter (as high as 0. 98). Phenotypic correlations were however, low and poor (0. 04 – 0. 44). Heritability (h 2) estimates at weaning were low to moderate, ranging from 0 – 0. 31. However, at slaughter, h 2 estimates were generally higher than at weaning: Stearate, oleate and total monounsaturates had h 2 estimates of 0. 43, 0. 37 and 0. 40, respectively. Other carcass traits such as marbling score and melting point of fat had h 2 estimates of 0. 20 and 0. 52, respectively. Significant breed, sex and location differences in fatty acid composition were also observed at weaning and slaughter...|$|R
50|$|Ribs of pork, beef, lamb, and venison are {{a cut of}} <b>meat.</b> The term <b>ribs</b> usually {{refers to}} the less meaty part of the chops, often cooked as a slab (not cut into {{separate}} ribs). Ribs of bison, goat, ostrich, crocodile, alligator, llama, alpaca, beefalo, African buffalo, water buffalo, kangaroo, and other animals are also consumed {{in various parts of}} the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{province}} is also famous due its meats, mainly lechazo (veal or lamb), suckling pig, steaks, <b>meat</b> chops, veal <b>ribs,</b> pork ribs, black pudding, or embutidos. There {{are numerous}} restaurants {{that specialize in}} lechazo and feature hornos de leña (wood-fired ovens or wooden stoves), in which the lamb is roasted. The typical restaurant where the meat is traditionally cooked is called mesón castellano (Castilian tavern).|$|R
5000|$|Kotellets (Fr. [...] „chop“, from Fr. [...] resp. Lat. [...] „rib“), {{also known}} as Koteletts, Karree, Karbonade or cutlets, are a German meat dish made of slices of <b>meat</b> from the <b>rib</b> area, {{including}} the bone. The piece of rib is found {{on both sides of}} the spine behind the neck. Koteletts are typically offered from pork, veal and mutton, but they can also come from beef.|$|R
5000|$|Short ribs {{cut from}} the rib area near the spine (the dorsal area) are better known as [...] "back ribs" [...] or [...] "dinosaur ribs". They consist of {{what remains of the}} rib in this area after the rib chop is removed. Due to the {{thinness}} of the serratus ventralis here, the <b>meat</b> on these <b>ribs</b> is generally intercostal muscle (e.g., the muscle between each rib).|$|R
5000|$|The word tteok-galbi has a {{relatively}} short history, that starts late 1960s to early 1970s. Before that, the dish was called hyo-galbi (...) meaning [...] "filial piety ribs" [...] or no-galbi (...) meaning [...] "elder ribs" [...] as it was often a dish for older people who had weak teeth to bite off the <b>meat</b> from the <b>rib</b> bones. Both hyo-galbi and no-galbi were used since Joseon era (1392-1897).|$|R
40|$|Predicting {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of beef cattle at slaughter using weaner data would enable an early selection decision thereby saving time and {{costs associated with}} progeny testing. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine genetic and phenotypic correlations between triacylglycerol fatty acid composition at weaning and slaughter. Subcutaneous fat between the 12 th and 13 th <b>rib</b> <b>interface</b> was biopsied from 324 weaner calves sired by Angus, Belgian Blue, Hereford, Jersey, Limousin, South Devon and Wagyu. Fat from the same anatomical site was sampled from their carcasses at slaughter and analysed for fatty acids by gas-liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis was by Mixed Model and Maximum Likelihood procedures of Harvey (1990) after adjusting for genotype, sire nested within genotype, sex and location. Results indicated strongly positive genetic correlations between biopsy and carcass stearate (18 : 0), oleate (18 : 1 n- 9), total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and delta-nine desaturase enzyme index of 0. 84, 0. 99, 0. 93 and 0. 82 respectively. However, biopsy and carcass palmitate (16 : 0) had a low genetic correlation of 0. 15. Phenotypic correlations were relatively low and ranged from 0 to 0. 67. The highly significant genetic correlations obtained suggest that selection decisions for fatty acid composition in the adipose tissue of cattle could be made at weaning...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the carcass}} is {{cut across the}} bone to create strips of <b>meat</b> with {{multiple}} <b>rib</b> bones, the short rib {{is known as a}} [...] "flanken cut." [...] These may also be known as crosscut ribs, Eastern European-style ribs, Hawaiian-style ribs, Jewish ribs, Korean-style ribs, or [...] "kosher ribs". Flanken-cut short ribs incorporate at least two rib bones, and are often no more than 1 to 2 in thick.|$|R

40|$|Forty-eight Angus bulls about 13 mo of {{age were}} used to {{study the effects of}} rate of change in live weight on muscle fiber, {{collagen}} and sensory characteristics of meat. Bulls were fed a finishing diet before treatment, and assigned to three treatments: 1) negative, 2) zero or 3) positive weight gain for 30 or 60 d prior to slaughter. Treatments were imposed by adjusting feed intake. Seventy-two hours after slaughter, carcasses were observed for quality and yield grade characteristics and longissimus muscle samples were obtained for fiber type, collagen and sensory characterization. Carcass lean at the 12 th <b>rib</b> <b>interface</b> became darker in color (P 3 ̆c. 01), softer (P 3 ̆c. 05), coarser textured (P 3 ̆c. 01) and more physiologically mature (P 3 ̆c. 01) when bulls were fed an additional 30 d. Increases in average daily gain improved lean texture (P 3 ̆c. 05), but had insignificant effects on lean color. Marbling scores and percentages of kidney and pelvic fat increased (P 3 ̆c. 01) with length of time fed. Quantities of carcass fat were reduced by reducing daily weight gains through restricting dietary intake. Neither length of time fed nor rate of change in live weight affected (P 3 ̆e. 05) muscle fiber characteristics. Increased age of bulls tended (P 3 ̆e. 05) to be associated with an increase in red muscle-fiber quantity. Length of time fed or rate of change in live weight did not affect collagen characteristics or tenderness of meat. It was concluded that the collagen content and solubility of muscle from bulls 14 to 15 mo of age cannot be varied through altering rate of weight change...|$|R

40|$|Seventy-seven tleifers {{weighing}} about 200 kg {{were assigned}} randomly to 1) intact control (C), 2) ovariectomized (OVX), 3) immunized against estradiol (BSA-E), 4) BSA-E + trenbolone acetate (BSA-E+TBA), 5) TBA or 6) ovx + TBA groups. The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the effects of ovariectomy, immunoneutralization of estradiol and trenbolone acetate treatment on growth rate and carcass merit. Heifers were fed a corn-corn silage diet and were slaughtered when treatment groups attained live-animal weights of 433 kg. Observations of rate of growth, efficiency of feed conversion, characteristics of carcasses and characteristics of organoleptic properties of the cooked meat were made. Average daily gains (ADG) were similar in the control and OVX groups and tended to be less than in other treatment groups (P 3 ̆c. 36). Although not statistically significant, the observed mean for the BSA-E+TBA treatment suggests improved ADG and TDN per unit of gain, indicating a possible immunization X TBA interaction. Data also suggested that heifers implanted with TBA had increased ADG and efficiencies of gain. Possibly, immunoneutralization of endogenous estradiol can improve ADG as compared with control and OVX groups. Treatments had no effect on color or texture of lean muscle at the 12 th <b>rib</b> <b>interface.</b> The OVX + TBA group had less (P 3 ̆c. O 1) 12 th rib fat cover than other groups and lower percent fat in the rib than C. The BSA-E+TBA and TBA groups also possessed larger (P 3 ̆c. 02) longissimus muscle areas than the control group. Observations of juiciness, tenderness and flavor were similar among all treatments. Results indicate that implanting heifers with TBA and (or) immunizing against endogenous estradiol may provide opportunities to increase gains, feed conversions and lean-to-fat ratios in heifers...|$|R
50|$|Next {{the lower}} jaw, {{which can be}} as long as twenty feet for a blue whale, was lifted skyward, {{wrenched}} off and the baleen cut out. The carcass was rolled over and a third strip of blubber was pulled off. The blubber was further cut into smaller pieces and fed into manholes in the deck which lead to the cookers. The carcass was brought forward where the lemmers, just like their Grytviken counterparts, {{took care of the}} meat, bone, and viscera. This allowed another whale to be brought up the slipway and unto the deck to be flensed. The meat was flensed similar to the blubber, while the bones were sliced by a steam-driven bone saw. The carcass was once again turned over, allowing more of the <b>meat</b> and <b>ribs</b> to be taken off. The good-quality meat was frozen, while virtually everything else was dropped down through the manholes into the cookers.|$|R
