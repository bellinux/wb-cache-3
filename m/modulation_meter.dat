40|$|Introduction. The paper {{proposed}} a block diagram of radiometric measuring {{the intensity of}} optical radiation from modulation conversion parameter input. To assess the intensity of use periodically comparing the reference signal (shaded) and measurement (open) photodiodes. Studies. The proposed radiometric <b>modulation</b> <b>meter</b> provides increased sensitivity and measurement accuracy by reducing the influence of dark current measurement and reference photodiodes and compensation intrinsic noise measuring channel through their periodic antiphase comparison. ? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ????? ????????????????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????? ???????. ??? ?????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????

50|$|It {{should address}} rhythmic issues {{presented}} by musics {{outside the realm}} of traditional tonal literature such as asymmetric <b>meters,</b> <b>modulation</b> of <b>meter</b> or tempo, complex syncopations, complex tuplet groupings, and passages that combine these in novel and challenging ways.|$|R
50|$|Techlite {{products}} are high precision equipment designed for aggressive military or telco applications. Source units can be {{are available at}} 850 nm, 1300 nm, 1310 nm, or 1550 nm and have four switchable <b>modulation</b> frequencies. <b>Meter</b> units can be switched to read all four wavelengths to an accuracy of +/-.2dBm and can be built with data storage and upload capability.|$|R
40|$|A {{pulse-width}} <b>modulation</b> <b>metering</b> {{system for}} anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) with a stacked manifold and one valve per knife {{was developed and}} tested for lateral distribution and flow characteristics. The manifold ensured that liquid ammonia was fed to the valves for correct metering. The distribution test was simulated on a trailer and flow rate from each shank was determined by a dynamic water absorption system. The flow was tested for valve duty cycle from 10 % to 90 % and recorded an average of 15. 3 kg/hr (34 lb/hr) per knife at 10 % to 106 kg/hr (235 lb/hr) per knife at 90 % duty cycle. The lateral coefficient of variation was between 5. 5 and 9. 3 %. The valve was modified with larger orifice and back-drilled increasing the flow rate {{to an average of}} 215 kg/hr (473 lb/hr) per knife at 90 % duty cycle. Ammonia flow was a function of valve duty cycle and pressure drop across the valve...|$|R
50|$|The {{integration}} and return times were determined {{after a series}} of experiments. At first it was intended to create a true peak meter to prevent transmitters from exceeding 100% <b>modulation.</b> A prototype <b>meter</b> was created with an integration time of about 1 ms. It was found that the ear is tolerant of distortion lasting a few ms, and that a 'registration time' of 4 ms would suffice. The return time had to be a compromise between a rapid return, which was tiring to the eye, and a slow return, which made control difficult. It was decided that the meter should take between 2s and 3s to drop back 26 dB.|$|R
