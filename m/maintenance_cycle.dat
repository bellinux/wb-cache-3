25|$|The Sm3 has {{received}} a lot of bad publicity in Finland for its reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and couplers. VR has tried to mitigate the problem by coupling trains only at termini instead of intermediate stations and switching the tilting system off during winter. The trains will go through an extensive <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycle</b> between 2012 and 2014, which will include changes to the couplers and the tilting system {{in order to make the}} train more reliable.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{features}} of the British metrication programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs and savings of metrication in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined and studies have {{tended to focus on}} specific programmes. The impact of a voluntary programme meant that industry was free to take the most cost-efficient approach, which in many cases has meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units as part of an ongoing <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycle</b> rather than as part of a specific metrication programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry where all newly installed meters record usage in cubic metres, but many older installations will measure in cubic feet.|$|E

25|$|On 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard {{completed}} the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycle</b> on Reagan. This PIA project came in under budget, and it marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard's largest off-site availability, {{as well as}} the largest public-sector work package ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island located near Coronado, California (pictured). During the maintenance period, Ronald Reagan received technological upgrades that prepared it for its next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment to improved ship's laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the 'One Shipyard' concept wherein the U.S. Navy mobilizes its work force across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the U.S. defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB).|$|E

40|$|Spreadsheets are {{a common}} tool in {{end-user}} program-ming. But even while important decisions are based on spreadsheet computations, spreadsheets are poorly docu-mented software and the differences between simple one-shot computations and large, long-living sheets are not well understood. Like other software, production spreadsheets are subject to repeated <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycles.</b> Consequently, as with conventional software, short <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycles</b> and poor documentation tend to decrease their quality. We introduce an approach to help maintainers under-stand the structure of large spreadsheets {{as well as to}} zoom into certain parts of the spreadsheet. To cope with large sheets, our approach features two levels of abstraction: log-ical areas and semantic classes. These abstractions are based on different degrees of relatedness of cells according to the formulas they contain. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Green roofs require {{significantly}} more maintenance and maintenance energy {{compared to a}} standard roof. Standard maintenance include removing debris, controlling weeds, deadhead trimming, checking moisture levels, and fertilizing. The maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including: climate, intensity of rainfall, type of building, type of vegetation, and external coatings. The most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required. During a 10-year roof <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycle</b> {{a house with a}} green roof requires more retrofit embodied energy than a house with a white roof.

40|$|Aerospace {{systems that}} fail in service are often {{repaired}} or refurbished {{and returned to}} service. 1 2 3 Repair/refurbishment may return the system to the equivalent of new condition, to some state less than new condition, or perhaps even to a better than new condition.

Depending on which reliability state the post-failure repair/refurbishment produces for the system, preventative maintenance schemes can differ dramatically. For example, should the repair/refurbishment return the system to a less than new condition with each subsequent failure, shorter preventative maintenance intervals as a function of number of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>cycles</b> increase overall availability and cost effectiveness.

50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, {{emerging}} trends towards increases in the costs to support fielded systems and decreases in the general reliability and operational readiness of weapon systems were recognized as issues that could continue if unabated.
