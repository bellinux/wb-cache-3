5|$|Soebadio Sastrosatomo {{wrote that}} Santoso's {{selection}} as social minister {{was important for}} several reasons. Firstly, her selection showed that the government truly respected women's contributions to the nationalist movement. Secondly, {{it was a way}} for Sjahrir to show that the Indonesian people were committed to the needs of their people, by having a woman deal with women's issues. After Santoso, other women have held government positions. The second female Indonesian minister, S. K. Trimurti, served as <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> from 1947 to 1948. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal Party's {{decision}} not to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin's unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald's first minority Labour government which took office in January 1924. According to Lansbury's biographer, Bondfield turned down the offer of a cabinet post; instead, she became parliamentary secretary to the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour,</b> Tom Shaw. This appointment meant {{that she had to}} give up the TUC Council chair; her decision to do so, immediately after becoming the first woman to achieve this honour, generated some criticism from other trade unionists.|$|E

5|$|In May 1929 Baldwin {{called a}} general election.

In Middlesbrough she was re-elected with an increased majority over her Conservative and Liberal opponents. Overall, Labour emerged from the election as the largest party, with 288 members (nine of whom were women), while the Conservatives and Liberals won 260 and 59 respectively. MacDonald formed his second minority administration, and included two women in ministerial posts: Margaret Bondfield as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> and Susan Lawrence as Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister) at the Ministry of Health.

5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction.

The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E
