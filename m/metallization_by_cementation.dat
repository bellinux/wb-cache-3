In comparison, the dolomite cements, authigenic kaolinite and quartz overgrowth in the fluvial sandstones have significantly occupied the pore space.

40|$|The {{nakhlite}} meteorites are {{samples of}} a 1300 million year old martian clinopyroxenite lava flow or sill [1, 2]. These rocks contain secondary minerals including hydrous silicates, carbonates, sulphates and Fe-(hydr) oxides that formed by watermediated alteration of the igneous body [3, 4]. A prerequisite {{for understanding the}} nature of the aqueous system from which these minerals formed, including water/rock ratio, the provenance of solutes and its longevity, is knowing whether the secondary minerals formed by replacement of primary igneous components (minerals and glasses), or <b>by</b> <b>cementation</b> of pores that were opened by fracturing. A replacive origin would suggest low water/rock ratios with solutions being close to saturation with respect to secondary minerals, and does not require a pre-existing network of pores for fluids to gain access to mineral grain interiors. An origin <b>by</b> <b>cementation</b> would suggest that solutes had been sourced by dissolution of other parts of the nakhlite parent rock or the martian crust and were introduced by fluid flow under relatively high water/rock ratio conditions; a means of fracturing the rock is also required. Here we have sought to answer the question of whether olivine-hosted veins in the nakhlites formed <b>by</b> <b>cementation</b> or replacement <b>by</b> comparing the microstructures of veins in the nakhlite Lafayette with veins in olivine grains from type I chondrules in Murchison (CM 2 carbonaceous chondrite).

30|$|Cementation–intergranular volume {{projection}} crossplot {{can explain}} the influence of cementation on reservoir petrophysics in this area. Figure  10 shows the effect of compaction and cementation on reservoir-pore volume in previous research results (Wang et al. 2018 a). As shown in the figure, the pore space of the reservoir is mostly affected by the compacting effect. A few samples are affected <b>by</b> <b>cementation</b> because of its postion adjacent to unconformity. This {{is due to the}} fact that the primary pores near the unconformity surface have not been dissolved but carbonate filled in a result of reduction of the pore <b>by</b> <b>cementation</b> obviously. But the main body is far from the unconformity surface, and the compaction effect causes the pore volume to decrease, the throat becomes fine or disappears, supplying no space for the cementation to fill, so the cementation content is low and the cementation effect is weaker. This indirectly indicates that the region’s cementation is not strong. Lack of cast core slice in the study makes dissolution hard to evaluate. So the main effect is compaction in a whole view.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{passivated}} emitter {{and rear}} cells (PERC) and other silicon solar cell concepts with evaporated aluminum (Al) as rear metallization are incompatible {{with a common}} solder process, in this work an annealing stable,solderable and long-term stable <b>metallization</b> scheme deposited <b>by</b> physical vapor deposition (PVD) is developed. The solder stack that complements the Al metallization consists of sputter deposited TiN/Ti/Ag or TiN/NiV/Ag, whereby the TiN layer serves as a diffusion barrier against Al. It is therefore optimized by varying sputter parameters and by stuffing the grain boundaries with oxygen. On the optimized stack a cell-interconnector can be conventionally soldered even after a strong annealing step of 15  min at 425 °C, which sets this concept apart from other PVD metallization approaches. Cell efficiency is not influenced by the solder stack compared to a reference rear <b>metallization</b> <b>by</b> plain evaporated Al. Additionally, long-term stability of the solder-joints on the <b>metallization</b> schemeis investigated <b>by</b> thermal aging of solder-joints and thermal cycling of demo moduleswith PERC cells...|$|R
