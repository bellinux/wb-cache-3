50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} {{cancer is the}} inability for a cell to regulate its gene expression. To characterise {{a specific type of}} cancer, the proteins that are produced from the altered gene expression or the mRNA precursor to the protein can be examined. CGAP works to associate a particular cell's expression profile, <b>molecular</b> <b>signature</b> or transcriptome, which is essentially the cell's fingerprint, with the cell's phenotype.

50|$|In a {{particular}} type of cell or tissue, only a small subset of an organism’s genomic DNA will be expressed as mRNAs at any given time. The unique pattern of gene expression for a given cell or tissue is referred to as its <b>molecular</b> <b>signature.</b> For example, the expression of genes in skin cells would be very different compared to those expressed in blood cells. Microarray analysis can provide quantitative gene expression information allowing for the generation of a <b>molecular</b> <b>signature,</b> each unique to {{a particular}} class of tumor. This idea was first shown experimentally in 2000 by researchers at Stanford University published in Nature Genetics. The authors measured the relative expression of 9,703 human cDNAs in sixty cancer cell lines previously studied and characterized by the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental Therapeutics Program. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to group cell lines based on the similarity by which the pattern of gene expression varied. In this study by Ross et al., the majority of cell lines with common organs of origin (based on information from the National Institutes of Health) clustered together at terminal branches, suggesting that cancer cells arising from the same tissue share many molecular characteristics. This allows for reliable identification of tumor type based on gene expression.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps the key {{difficulty}} in understanding pathogenesis of primary hyperoxaluria, or more specifically, why AGXT {{ends up in}} mitochondria instead of peroxisomes, stems from AGXT's somewhat peculiar evolution. Namely, prior to its current peroxysomal 'destiny', AGXT indeed used to be bound to mitochondria. AGXT's peroxisomal targeting sequence is uniquely specific for mammalian species, suggesting the presence of additional peroxisomal targeting information elsewhere in the AGT molecule. As AGXT was redirected to peroxisomes {{over the course of}} evolution, it is plausible that its current aberrant localization to mitochondria owes to some hidden <b>molecular</b> <b>signature</b> in AGXT's spatial configuration unmasked by PH1 mutations affecting the AGXT gene.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the ATL1 gene {{are also}} a common cause of early-onset {{hereditary}} spastic paraplegia (HSP) in humans.

However, the unique <b>molecular</b> <b>signature</b> of the mutations or the functional domains of the ATL1 gene that are affected in patients with HSAN ID and HSP that could explain the differences in clinical features between these two diseases are not clear.

5000|$|Tubifex tubifex: The sludge worm Tubifex tubifex {{has been}} shown to {{demonstrate}} an interesting asymmetric cell division at the point of first embryonic cleavage. Unlike the classic idea of cortical differences at the zygotic membrane that determine spindle asymmetry in the C. elegans embryo, the first cleavage in tubifex relies on the number of centrosomes. [...] Embryos inherit a single centrosome which localizes in the prospective larger CD cell cytoplasm and emits radial microtubules during anaphase that contribute to both the mitotic spindle as well as cortical asters. However, the microtubule organizing center of the prospective smaller AB cell emits only microtubules that commit to the mitotic spindle and not cortical bound asters. When embryos are compressed or deformed, asymmetric spindles still form, and staining for gamma tubulin reveals that the second microtubule organizing center lacks the <b>molecular</b> <b>signature</b> of a centrosome. Furthermore, when centrosome number is doubled, tubifex embryos cleave symmetrically, suggesting this monoastral mechanism of asymmetric cell division is centrosome dependent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background It is of {{particular}} interest to identify cancer-specific <b>molecular</b> <b>signatures</b> for early diagnosis, monitoring effects of treatment and predicting patient survival time. Molecular information about patients is usually generated from high throughput technologies such as microarray and mass spectrometry. Statistically, we are challenged by the large number of candidates but {{only a small number of}} patients in the study, and the right-censored clinical data further complicate the analysis. Results We present a two-stage procedure to profile <b>molecular</b> <b>signatures</b> for survival outcomes. Firstly, we group closely-related molecular features into linkage clusters, each portraying either similar or opposite functions and playing similar roles in prognosis; secondly, a Bayesian approach is developed to rank the centroids of these linkage clusters and provide a list of the main molecular features closely related to the outcome of interest. A simulation study showed the superior performance of our approach. When it was applied to data on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we were able to identify some new candidate signatures for disease prognosis. Conclusion This multivariate approach provides researchers with a more reliable list of molecular features profiled in terms of their prognostic relationship to the event times, and generates dependable information for subsequent identification of prognostic <b>molecular</b> <b>signatures</b> through either biological procedures or further data analysis. </p...|$|R

In this study, we have utilized <b>molecular</b> <b>signatures</b> identified through comparative genomic analyses in conjunction with genome based and multilocus sequence based phylogenetic analyses to clarify the phylogenetic and taxonomic boundary of these genera. We have identified large clusters of Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella species which represent the “sensu stricto” members of these genera.

We have also identified two different sets of CSIs that are unique characteristics of the pathogen containing genera Aggregatibacter and Mannheimia, respectively.

50|$|For its {{predecessor}} I-SPY 1, 10 cancer centers and the National Cancer Institute (NCI SPORE {{program and the}} NCI Cooperative groups) collaborated to identify response indicators that would best predict survival for women with high-risk breast cancer. During 2002-2006, the study monitored 237 patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Iterative MRI and tissue samples monitored the biology of patients to chemotherapy given in a neoadjuvant setting, or presurgical setting. Evaluating chemotherapy's direct impact on tumor tissue took much less time than monitoring outcomes in thousands of patients over long time periods. The approach helped to standardize the imaging and tumor sampling processes, and led to miniaturized assays. Key findings included that tumor response was a good predictor of patient survival, and that tumor shrinkage during treatment was a good predictor of long-term outcome. Importantly, {{the vast majority of}} tumors identified as high risk by <b>molecular</b> <b>signature.</b> However, heterogeneity within this group of women and measuring response within tumor subtypes was more informative than viewing the group as a whole. Within genetic signatures, level of response to treatment appears to be a reasonable predictor of outcome. Additionally, its shared database has furthered the understanding of drug response and generated new targets and agents for subsequent testing.|$|E
5000|$|Paolo Vineis is a {{professor}} of Environmental Epidemiology at Imperial College London. His main work is on the impact of environmental changes (including air pollution and climate change) on human health and molecules. This includes the use of omics technologies in epidemiological studies, that is the quantitative measurement of global sets of molecules in biological samples using high-throughput techniques, in combination with advanced biostatistics and bioinformatics tools. In particular, the study of epigenomic changes in DNA is currently {{one of the most promising}} fields for the identification of long-term environmental fingerprints. The development of the concept of exposome (with Chris Wild, Director of the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer, and Stephen Rappaport and Martyn Smith of University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health), led to Professor Vineis being awarded a grant from the European Commission (Seventh Framework Programme) in 2012 on exposome research (EXPOsOMICS). The exposome refers to the totality of internal and external exposures which interact at a cellular and systems level to generate a metabolic/ <b>molecular</b> <b>signature</b> which can be used to gain new understanding of the transition from health to disease. Paolo Vineis is also the coordinator of the Horizon 2020 [...] LIFEPATH project, whose aim is to understand the determinants of diverging ageing pathways among individuals belonging to different socio-economic groups. This is achieved by integrating social science approaches with biology, using omics measurements (particularly epigenomics). Paolo Vineis is also the director of the Unit of Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology, HuGeF Foundation, Turin, Italy.

It is widely recognized that <b>molecular</b> <b>signatures</b> constitute {{one of the most}} important translational and basic science developments enabled by recent high-throughput molecular assays. A perplexing phenomenon that characterizes high-throughput data analysis is the ubiquitous multiplicity of <b>molecular</b> <b>signatures.</b> Multiplicity is a special form of data analysis instability in which different analysis methods used on the same data, or different samples from the same population lead to different but apparently maximally predictive signatures. This phenomenon has far-reaching implications for biological discovery and development of next generation patient diagnostics and personalized treatments. Currently the causes and interpretation of signature multiplicity are unknown, and several, often contradictory, conjectures have been made to explain it. We present a formal characterization of signature multiplicity and a new efficient algorithm that offers theoretical guarantees for extracting the set of maximally predictive and non-redundant signatures independent of distribution. The new algorithm identifies exactly the set of optimal signatures in controlled experiments and yields signatures with significantly better predictivity and reproducibility than previous algorithms in human microarray gene expression datasets.
