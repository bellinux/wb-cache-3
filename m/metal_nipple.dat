25|$|PEX is a medium- to {{high-density}} polyethylene containing cross-link bonds {{introduced into the}} polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a thermoset. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a <b>metal</b> <b>nipple</b> and it will slowly return to its original shape, forming a permanent, water-tight connection.|$|E

This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the feasibility of using a joystick-controlled robotic needle driver to place a 22 -gauge needle for nerve and facet blocks. Materials and Methods. Biplane fluoroscopy and a robotic needle driver were used to place 12 needles into the lumbar paraspinal region of an embalmed female cadaver (age at death, 98 years). Small <b>metal</b> BB <b>nipple</b> markers (1 mm in diameter) were inserted percutaneously to serve as targets. Six needles were then placed near the nerve root, and six were placed near the facet root. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were obtained after each needle placement to assess its accuracy. Results. All needles were placed within 3 mm of the target BB. The average distance was 1. 44 mm � 0. 66 (standard deviation). Discussion. A robotic needle driver {{can be used to}} place needles accurately in the nerve and facet regions. Clinical studies are required to investigate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this system for interventional procedures involving needles. Key Words. Interventional procedures, experimental; spine, interventional procedure; cadaver. © AUR, 2002 Percutaneous spine interventions are performed with freehand passage of instruments, such as needles or trocars, from the skin surface to the spinal anatomy. By using imaging modalities such as x-ray fluoroscopy or computed tomography (CT), the physician identifies the ski...|$|R
