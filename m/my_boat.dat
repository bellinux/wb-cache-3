500|$|In 1721, British sailors of the East India Company were {{reported}} to be playing cricket at Cambay, near Baroda, {{and this is the}} earliest reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent. One of the players wrote: [...] "When <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> was lying for a fortnight in one of the channels, though the country was inhabited by the Culeys (sic), we every day diverted ourselves with playing Cricket and to other Exercises, which they would come and be spectators of".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E
2500|$|... "The after part of {{the ship}} then reared in the air, with the stern upwards, until it assumed an almost {{vertical}} position. It seemed to remain stationary in this position for many seconds (perhaps twenty), then suddenly dove straight down out of sight. It was 2.20 a.m. when the Titanic disappeared, according to a wrist watch worn {{by one of the}} passengers in <b>my</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] says Captain Maryon, [...] "I beg to {{volunteer}} on this service, with <b>my</b> <b>boats.</b> <b>My</b> people volunteer, to the ship's boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} are all anxious to go to sea--boys always are, for the first time. One of <b>my</b> <b>boats</b> is going out, tomorrow.|$|R

2500|$|The Argentine lead ship {{attempted}} to advance under fire, but having lost her pilot, she got {{stuck on a}} sand bank on {{the west of the}} island, under fire and bows-on to the enemy, suffering sustained fire {{and not being able to}} return it, directing their broadsides to the land batteries. Brown questioned the way in which the rest of the squadron [...] "conducted themselves during the action, even though having sent all the signals and having gone personally on <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> before midnight the night before and requested their support, all of which was in vain".|$|E
2500|$|The {{striking}} exterior {{design of}} A, which designer Starck had likened to being [...] "more {{like a fish}} than a building", polarized opinions from the outset. Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London yacht brokers Burgess, was initially skeptical, but changed his mind after seeing the boat in person in the Caribbean: [...] "I have to say I was impressed. It's a very exciting boat to watch. It's simply unlike anything that's ever been done before." [...] David Pelly of Boat International was also enamoured, saying she was [...] "...the most extraordinary yacht launched in recent memory. It is stunning." [...] And writing about the world's biggest mega yachts in the New York Times in 2011, Nazanin Lankarini argued that A was [...] "even more desirable than her larger sisters by virtue of lines reminiscent of a nuclear submarine". A {{was one of the}} featured vessels in the 2011 edition of The Superyachts, where she was described as [...] "bold and eccentric."By contrast, Power & Motoryacht magazine columnist Diane Byrne opined that [...] "overall she does not float <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> (sorry, kids, couldn’t resist), but I do quite like the inverted bow design", while Donald Starkey, a British yacht designer, commented that A [...] "...is aggressive, like a giant finger pointing at you. It seems to {{have nothing to do with}} the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea". Maritime commentator Peter Mello was even more scathing in his assessment, deriding her as [...] "one of the most hideous vessels ever to sail the seas". The Wall Street Journals Robert Frank was initially also an outspoken critic, calling A [...] "one of the ghastliest megayachts ever created" [...] and [...] "more like a cruiser for Darth Vader's navy than a family pleasure boat for the Mediterranean" [...] when she was launched. However, in a follow-up blog several months later, he confessed: [...] "I've gained a bit more respect for it. Technically, it's impressive: Because of her inverted bow, the boat barely makes a splash in the front when it's speeding along at 24knots. And it's different in a way few yachts are...So even though I still think it's a monster, A gets a tip of the hat for taking a risk and being different".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{had to come}} back. I'm {{going to}} Europe next week, and I {{had to come to}} look after <b>my</b> <b>boat,</b> here; and I wanted to say good-by to Maynard. I was just going to speak to Maynard, and then sail <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> over to Leyden." ...|$|E
6000|$|The blood flushed to Craddock's gaunt face. [...] "How is this, Master Hird?" [...] he cried, {{springing}} up the side. [...] "What mean you by giving orders to <b>my</b> <b>boat's</b> crew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “A boat is {{not made}} for racing; she is made to carry her crew in a heavy sea. <b>My</b> <b>boats</b> will live where yours would be swamped in five minutes, and with their great beam they will carry all sail, while you would not dare show a shred of canvas. It makes no {{difference}} to me whether I get to shore five minutes earlier or later; properly handled, the smallest of <b>my</b> <b>boats</b> ought to weather any ordinary gale, while the long-boat would be as safe to cross the Atlantic in as the Tiger herself, though I don’t say {{that she would be}} as comfortable.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{said with}} consequence. [...] "I've a {{thousand}} dozen eggs at Linderman, and <b>my</b> <b>boat's</b> just about got the last seam caulked. Consider myself in luck to get it. Boats are at a premium, you know, and none to be had." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder what}} time does <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> go? Ah! Here comes the waiter {{bringing}} me my little bill.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh sing, {{and wake}} the dawning-- Oh whistle for the wind; The night is long, the current strong, <b>My</b> <b>boat</b> it lags behind.' ...|$|E
60|$|And, {{without saying}} another word, I {{picked up my}} oars, which I had brought from the bushes, jumped into <b>my</b> <b>boat,</b> and pushed off.|$|E
6000|$|... "If by any chance," [...] he said suddenly, [...] "you're {{looking for}} a job, I could put {{something}} in your way. Walk {{down to the beach}} with me, and I'll tell you; <b>my</b> <b>boat's</b> at anchor, smartest little craft in these parts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had a {{good deal}} more than a morsel {{sticking}} to me once,' said Harry; 'it was owing to <b>my</b> <b>boat's</b> crew that I am not ever so many feet deep in it now, like many better men. They never lost sight of me, and somehow hauled me out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{come from}} the Island of Trees," [...] he continued. [...] "A hundred of <b>my</b> <b>boats</b> {{were lost in the}} great storm and all their crews drowned. Where is the land? What are you, and what strange thing is that which flutters from the little tree in the front of your canoe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't wish {{to leave}} <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> just anywhere," [...] said Larry. [...] "Somebody might {{run off with}} her,--and she cost quite some money." ...|$|E
60|$|Elfie {{held out}} her arms to be lifted on board <b>my</b> <b>boat.</b> Mrs. Van Brandt stepped between us as I stooped to take her up.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>boat</b> is small, the boatman cried, [...] This {{dangerous}} haste forbear! [...] Wait other aid, {{this little}} bark [...] But one from hence can bear.|$|E
6000|$|When that meal--a rather silent one--was over, Captain Eli felt better. [...] "There was rocks," [...] he said, [...] "and not a breaker to {{show where}} they lay, and I struck 'em bow on. So that's {{the end of}} that voyage. But I've tuk to <b>my</b> <b>boats,</b> cap'n, I've tuk to my boats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was troubled}} for <b>my</b> <b>boats</b> and sheers before the flood came. Now {{we are in}} the hands of the Gods. The Sahib will not eat and lie down? Take these, then. They are meat and good toddy together, and they kill all weariness, besides the fever that follows the rain. I have eaten nothing else to-day at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody must watch. Your {{people keep}} {{such a good}} look-out--don't they? Yes. Ever since dark one of <b>my</b> <b>boats</b> has been dodging astern here, in the deep water. I swore to myself I would never see one of you, never speak to one of you here, that I would be dumb, blind, deaf. And--here I am!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Did {{you send}} your chaps to sneak me out o’ <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> while I was having forty winks?’ roars the other. ’Damme! that’s English, ain’t it?’ ...|$|E
60|$|There were {{states of}} the tide when, having been down the river, I could not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and {{starlings}} of old London Bridge; then, I left <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> at a wharf near the Custom House, to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing this, as it served to make me and <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> a commoner incident among the water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do pray make {{a picture}} of <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> on a nice smooth sea of light; I don't like rocks and breakers, such as you have done there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't let the kai-kai worry you, Captain Munster,' says she; 'if I {{can find}} grub for eighty-four mouths on the Martha, {{the two of}} you can do as much by your two vessels.

6000|$|... "His Excellency {{promised that}} he would more fitly employ me in the future did I {{discharge}} this errand with secrecy and despatch. But by aiding Madonna Paola I have burned <b>my</b> <b>boats</b> against returning to claim the redemption of that promise; though {{had it not been}} for Madonna Paola and what I did, I scarce know how I should have penetrated here to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{satisfactory}} at any rate," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "Mr. Wylde, will {{you just take}} a look round these storehouses and see what there is worth taking away. You had better take <b>my</b> <b>boat's</b> crew as well as your own to help you to turn things over. Are you quite sure, lad, that there is no one beside yourselves on the island?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clive sent me the Gazette every month; and I {{read your}} romance of Walter Lorraine in <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> as I {{was coming down}} the river to Calcutta." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Parbleu," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, choking, [...] "it is a pity to disturb such a one. Gratiot, {{if it was}} <b>my</b> <b>boat,</b> I'd delay the {{departure}} till morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] Dag Daughtry sneered to his face. [...] "I reckon what's left of {{the beer}} goes with <b>my</b> <b>boat</b> [...] . {{unless you want to}} argue the matter." ...|$|E
