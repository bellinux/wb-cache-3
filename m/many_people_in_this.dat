Planning permission was finally granted on 28 September 2016. When the Prince of Wales visited the Black Cultural Archives in February 2017 and was made aware of the memorial, he said in a speech:"It’s so encouraging that now, at last, you have a centre such as this, which allows you to develop so many opportunities but also to bring the message to so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country and elsewhere about the remarkable contribution made over so long, by people of African and Caribbean descent who have contributed so much to this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Madonna instead used {{social media}} to promote MDNA, like posting minute-long snippets of several album tracks, behind-the-scenes {{pictures}} of tour rehearsals, and online polls asking her fans regarding set list {{choice for the}} tour. On March 24 she participated in a livestream chat on Facebook, which was hosted by Jimmy Fallon. In order to boost up the album streams, Madonna partnered with Spotify, and launched an opportunity for its listeners to win two tickets for The MDNA Tour. For eligibility, users had to stream the album in full thrice on Spotify, within two weeks since release. She later made a brief appearance on Ultra Music Festival in Miami a few days later, where she introduced Swedish DJ Avicii. During her appearance he played his own remix of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". At one point the singer asked the audience, [...] "How <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> crowd have seen Molly?" [...] It was met with negative reception, with producer Deadmau5 condemning her {{use of the word}} molly, which is a slang for MDMA. Madonna responded on Twitter by posting a 1989 picture of herself, wearing Minnie Mouse ears, and a comment: [...] "From one mouse to another. I don't support drug use and I never have.

2500|$|While {{the police}} were busy {{trying to control the}} crowds, some of the reporters warned the squatters that {{the police were}} {{planning}} something big, and the squatters quickly organized a plan to counter the upcoming attack. The 700 defenders were organized in six groups. [...] Each of the groups were charged with different parts of the defense. The barricades were divided into four sections, each with a group of defenders attached to it. [...] These four groups were the biggest of the six groups (about 130 people strong) and were named [...] "the standing units". The two other groups were named [...] "the mobile unit" [...] and [...] "the house unit". [...] The house unit was charged with defending the back entrance of the house and manning a lookout post on the roof. It was their responsibility to warn the others in case of an attack and to oversee many of the logistic tasks such as the making of more Molotov cocktails. They also had to prepare a final defense of the house in case the police broke through. The role of the mobile unit was as a reserve to support the standing units at the barricades. [...] It was not attached to any particular barricade, but was free to move from place to place and assist if the defenders were in danger of being overwhelmed. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> unit were given helmets and clubs for hand-to-hand fighting.|$|E

6000|$|It {{may be a}} very dreadful and tormenting thought. It {{does not}} torment the mere savage, who has no {{sense of right and}} wrong; who follows his own appetites and passions, and has never learnt to say, [...] "I ought," [...] and [...] "I ought not." [...] But it does torment the heathen when they begin to be civilized, and to think; it has tormented them in all ages. It tormented the old Greeks and Romans; it torments some Eastern peoples still--that terrible thought--I am I myself, and cannot be any one else. I am {{answerable}} for all that I ever did, or shall do; and no one can be answerable for me. All the bad deeds I ever did, the bad thoughts I ever thought, are mine, parts of me, and will be for ever. I can no more escape from them than I can spring off my own shadow. But men have been always trying to escape; to escape from the burden of their own self, and the dread of an evil conscience; and have invented religion after religion, often fantastic enough, often pathetic enough likewise, in hopes of hiding from themselves the secret thought--I am I, and must be myself for ever. But I am not what I ought to be, and therefore I may be wrong, and miserable for ever.

6000|$|After breakfast I took my fishing-rod, {{and went}} down through our orchard to the river-side; but as three or four boys were already in {{possession}} of the best spots along the shore, I did not fish. This river of ours is the most sluggish stream that I ever was acquainted with. I had spent three weeks by its side, and swam across it every day, before I could determine which way its current ran; and then I was compelled to decide the question by the testimony of others, and not by my own observation. Owing to this torpor of the stream, it has nowhere a bright, pebbly shore, nor is there {{so much as a}} narrow strip of glistening sand in any part of its course; but it slumbers along between broad meadows, or kisses the tangled grass of mowing-fields and pastures, or bathes the overhanging boughs of elder-bushes and other waterloving plants. Flags and rushes grow along its shallow margin. The yellow water-lily spreads its broad flat leaves upon its surface; and the fragrant white pond-lily occurs in many favored spots,--generally selecting a situation just so far from the river's brink that it cannot be grasped except at the hazard of plunging in. But thanks be to the beautiful flower for growing at any rate. It is a marvel whence it derives its loveliness and perfume, sprouting as it does from the black mud over which the river sleeps, and from which the yellow lily likewise draws its unclean life and noisome odor. So it is with <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world; the same soil and circumstances may produce the good and beautiful, and the wicked and ugly. Some have the faculty of assimilating to themselves only what is evil, and so they become as noisome as the yellow water-lily. Some assimilate none but good influences, and their emblem is the fragrant and spotless pond-lily, whose very breath is a blessing to all the region round about. [...] . Among the productions of the river's margin, I must not forget the pickerel-weed, which grows just {{on the edge of the}} water, and shoots up a long stalk crowned with a blue spire, from among large green leaves. Both the flower and the leaves look well in a vase with pond-lilies, and relieve the unvaried whiteness of the latter; and, being all alike children of the waters, they are perfectly in keeping with one another.
