500|$|Along with {{a talking}} drum, Badu used tuning forks when {{recording}} New Amerykah Part One to evoke a certain feeling through its frequency, a practice {{she had done}} on her previous albums: [...] "Each tuning fork has a certain vibrational energy that is conducive to a feeling or a color or a smell. They're related to different chakras in the body, too. Some <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel good or sexy or conscious of what you're saying." [...] The album was mastered at Electric Lady Studios in February 2008. Before it was edited down to 11 tracks, New Amerykah Part One was originally intended as a double album, with 18 songs over two discs.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} mild {{but generally}} positive reviews during its initial release in North America. GamePro magazine praised the game's originality and overall design but found fault with the visual {{presentation of the}} title, stating [...] "although this game has an interesting concept, the sluggish game play and average graphics <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> return to the caves." [...] The publication also found the background music lacking, stating the game's compositions ranged from [...] "soothing" [...] to [...] "annoying". Nintendo Power {{called attention to the}} game's ingenuity and theme, remarking that [...] "he idea of this game is great and the weird creatures you can evolve can be both bizarre and hilarious." [...] However, the magazine felt the game's representation of the concept of evolution was too fanciful, also stating the process of obtaining power-up items being [...] "tedious". Nintendo Power would later give the game an honorable mention during its [...] "Top Titles of 1993" [...] awards segment {{as one of the most}} innovative games of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Adele Reinhartz {{writes that}} the [...] "depth of Jules's transformation" [...] is {{indicated}} by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: [...] "In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness... In the second... {{he appears to be}} a different sort of man altogether... n true postmodern fashion, [...] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation." [...] Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him [...] "that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture. Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: [...] "he spiritual awakening at the end of Pulp Fiction, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser." ...|$|E

2500|$|After sailing {{far enough}} for safety, Every gave the non-conspirators {{a chance to}} go ashore, even deferentially {{offering}} to let Captain Gibson command the ship if he would join their cause. According to Charles Ellms, Every's words to Gibson were, [...] "if you have a mind to make one of us, we will receive you; and if you turn sober, and attend to business, perhaps in time I <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> up of my lieutenants; if not, here's a boat, and you shall be set on shore." [...] The captain declined and was set ashore with several other sailors. The only man who was prevented from voluntarily leaving was the ship's surgeon, whose services were deemed too important to forgo. All of the men left on board the Charles II unanimously elected Every captain of the ship. Some reports say that Every was much ruder in his dealings with Captain Gibson, but agree that he at least offered him the position of second mate. In either case, Every exhibited an amount of gentility and generosity in his operation of the mutiny that indicates his motives were not mere adventure.|$|E
2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film an [...] "old-fashioned monster movie {{dressed up in}} trendy new threads", praising the special effects, [...] "nihilistic attitude" [...] and [...] "post-9/11 anxiety overlay", but said, [...] "In the end, [...] not much {{different}} from all the marauding creature features that have come before it". Scott Foundas of LA Weekly was critical of the film's use of scenes reminiscent of the September 11 attacks in New York City and called it [...] "cheap and opportunistic". He suggested that the film was engaging in [...] "stealth" [...] attempts at social commentary and compared this unfavorably to the films of Don Siegel, George A. Romero and Steven Spielberg, saying, [...] "Where those filmmakers all had something meaningful to say {{about the state of the}} world and [...] human nature, Abrams doesn't have much to say about anything". Manohla Dargis in the New York Times called the allusions [...] "tacky", saying, [...] " [...] <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think of the attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination", but that [...] "the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence". She concludes that the film [...] "works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com calls the film [...] "badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic", and sums up by saying that the film [...] "takes the trauma of 9/11 and turns it into just another random spectacle at which to point and shoot". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune warned that the viewer may feel [...] "queasy" [...] at the references to September 11, but that [...] "other sequences [...] carry a real jolt" [...] and that such tactics were [...] "crude, but undeniably gripping". He called the film [...] "dumb", but [...] "quick and dirty and effectively brusque", concluding that despite it being [...] "a harsher, more demographically calculating brand of fun", he enjoyed the film. Bruce Paterson of Cinephilia described the film as [...] "a successful experiment in style but not necessarily a successful story for those who want dramatic closure". [...] Some critics also pointed out the similarity to the Half-Life video game series, in particular the [...] "Ant-lion" [...] monsters from Half-Life 2, and the constant first-person perspective.|$|E
