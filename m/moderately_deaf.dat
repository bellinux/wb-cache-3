40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper reviews {{literature}} on the use of gesture in musical contexts and reports an investigation of the gestures (spontaneous gesticulation) made by musicians with different levels of hearing impairment in rehearsal talk. Profoundly deaf musicians, who were also users of British Sign Language, were found to produce significantly more gestures than <b>moderately</b> <b>deaf</b> and hearing musicians. Analysis also revealed the presence of underlying spatial and cross-modal associations in the gestural representations produced by all the musicians. The second part of the paper discusses {{the results of the study}} and addresses some wider theoretical questions. First, a classification of 'musical shaping gestures' (MSGs) according to existing taxonomies is attempted. Second, the question of how a standardised 'sign language of music' could be formed is addressed and, finally, the potential uses of such a system are considered...|$|E
40|$|Uploaded file is {{the version}} of the paper (manuscript) as it is accepted; not the {{published}} versionThis case study provides a first exploratory study on the early Flemish Sign Language acquisition of a Deaf infant {{from the perspective of}} Halliday's Systemic Functional Theory. It highlights some remarkable aspects of the sign language acquisition with respect to interpersonal interaction between the child and its mother. The free play interactions of the Deaf mother and her <b>moderately</b> <b>Deaf</b> daughter were recorded when the child was 6 - 9 - 12 - 18 and 24 months old. These interactions were annotated in ELAN and transcribed in view of the analysis adapting Systemic Functional Linguistics. The analysis indicates that the early sign language development of the child chronologically correlates with Halliday's descriptions of the universal functions of language. The infant's first lexical signs appeared at 12 months. The child produced one-sign utterances (12 months and older), one-sign utterances along with a pointing sign (18 months and older) and two-sign utterances (24 months). The mother integrated attentional strategies to redirect the child's attention. She also adopted techniques that are appropriate for child-directed signing, i. e. questions, recasts and expansions. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact that hearing has on the perception of digital video clips, with and without captions, by discussing how hearing loss, captions and deafness type affects user QoP (Quality of Perception). QoP encompasses not only a user's satisfaction {{with the quality of}} a multimedia presentation, but also their ability to analyse, synthesise and assimilate informational content of multimedia. Results show that hearing has a significant effect on participants ’ ability to assimilate information, independent of video type and use of captions. It is shown that captions do not necessarily provide deaf users with a ‘greater level of information ’ from video, but cause a change in user QoP, depending on deafness type, which provides a ‘greater level of context of the video’. It is also shown that post-lingual mild and <b>moderately</b> <b>deaf</b> participants predict less accurately their level of information assimilation than post-lingual profoundly deaf participants, despite residual hearing. A positive correlation was identified between level of enjoyment (LOE) and self-predicted level of information assimilation (PIA), independent of hearing level or hearing type. When this is considered in a QoP quality framework, it puts into question how the user perceives certain factors, such as ‘informative’ and ‘quality’...|$|E
40|$|An {{electron}} microscopic {{study of}} the cerebral cortex of mutant deaf mice (Deol's dn gene) has shown differences in synaptic organisation between these mice and normally hearing ones. In the auditory cortex of the deaf mice, there are fewer synapses and these are larger than in the normally hearing, whereas {{there is no difference}} between these two categories in the visual cortex. These results are the reverse of those observed by other authors in the occipital cortex of rats raised in an enriched or impoverished environment. In humans, the functional consequences of early hearing loss have been investigated on <b>moderately</b> to severely <b>deaf</b> (60 - 80 db mean loss) youngsters, who have been tested for their capacity of categorical perception, auditory discrimination, and production of significant contrasts between stop consonants. Categorical perception was absent in all but one subject. Auditory discrimination was poor for both the voiced-voiceless contrast and the place of articulation contrast. In the production experiments, the subjects had greater difficulty in producing the voiced-voiceless than the place of articulation contrasts. The possible relevance of these animal and human studies to cochlear implantation is discussed. © 1984 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

Purpose: Text messaging (Short Messaging Service, SMS) is ubiquitous in Australia. It may prove a cheap and convenient method allowing bidirectional communication between participant and psychological researcher. A strength of applying SMS as a research tool is its inclusiveness, as it may be used to communicate with both hearing and deaf participants. This paper explores how the Australian deaf community engages with SMS, and how this engagement may be applied to using SMS to communicate with deaf participants in a psychological research setting. Methods: Sixty six hearing impaired participants aged 20 - 89 years, ranging from <b>moderately</b> to profoundly <b>deaf</b> took part by way of questionnaire (paper, online text, or online Auslan translation). At the end, they had the option to provide their mobile number and be sent a questionnaire via SMS. Results: Most participants owned mobile phones, and used SMS daily. 60 % believed that using SMS for research is a good idea. However, this did not translate into volunteering to participate in research using SMS – of the half who provided their mobile telephone numbers for subsequent participation, there was only a 17 % respons...|$|R

Introduction [...] The use of {{continuous}} discourse tracking to assess degree of FM advantage received by moderately to profoundly hearing impaired children in classroom conditions [...] Subjective preferences of hearing impaired children for listening through FM systems using a paired comparison procedure [...] Degree of FM advantage as measured using an adaptive speech test procedure with mildly o profoundly hearing impaired children [...] Benefits {{and use of}} FM systems : a survey of teachers, children and parents [...] Conclusions and recommendations. Only very limited research has examined {{the issue of how}} well FM systems are decreasing the speech perception difficulties of hearing impaired children. A comprehensive study of the effectiveness of FM fittings and factors associated with benefit was therefore undertaken using 4 different measures. Tracking {{of continuous}} discourse in classroom settings (12 subjects) showed significant improvement when FM aids were used compared to hearing aids alone. Also, significantly greater gains in tracking rate were made over 4 sessions for the FM condition compared to the hearing aid only listening condition. In order to investigate the subjective response of listeners to various features of FM processed signals, another experiment was conducted using a paired comparison procedure in noise with 21 <b>moderately</b> to profoundly <b>deaf</b> children and using two different types of FM systems. Overall results showed significant preferences for combined mode above both VOX/SOX settings and FM microphone alone settings. There were no significant preferences for microphone style, and a significant volume control setting preference (for a 5 dB higher than recommended setting) was shown for one of the two types of FM systems evaluated. The most interesting result was that, overall, listeners did not significantly prefer any FM settings to their hearing aids alone and, in fact, most listeners actually significantly preferred the aid alone to the FM alone or VOX/SOX settings. These results occurred despite the fact that a large FM advantage was shown in terms of improved S/N ratio on all these settings. However, judgements tended to be different for experienced users of {{at least one of the}} types of FM being evaluated, who significantly preferred the FM on any mode compared to their hearing aid alone. These results are discussed with regard to clinical practices and the need for demonstration to, and training and encouragement of, new users to ensure the available FM advantage is realised. A third study evaluated the clinical usefulness and accuracy of an adaptive speech test (NU-CHIPS) in noise to verify and measure degree of FM advantage. Results from 31 mildly to profoundly hearing impaired children showed that significant signal-to-noise ratio advantage was obtained overall, and that the advantage was greater on the FM alone than the C setting. Over all listening conditions through the FM, there were 28 out of a possible 51 occurrences of hearing impaired listeners performing equal to or significantly better than 11 normal hearing children also tested using this procedure. The predictive accuracy and clinical feasibility of this approach are discussed. The way in which these FM advantages are moderated by interactions with users in practical situations are described by the results from questionnaires or interviews of 75 teachers, 52 children and 14 parents regarding use, perceived benefits and problems associated with FM systems. Factors which seemed to affect perceptions and use included feelings of self-consciousness about the FM as age of users increased, lack of confidence in the systems due to frequent breakages and faults in combination with lack of knowledge about how to check the systems effectively and efficiently, problems with being able to securely attach the systems to the body, and lack of knowledge about how to make the best use of the units in a variety of situations. On the basis of all of these findings, some suggestions on how to improve FM acceptance and use are offered. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 209 p. il...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE A new {{statistical}} {{approach is}} needed to describe the clinical differences between type I and type II Usher syndrome and between the 2 most frequent mutations in the USH 2 A gene. OBJECTIVES To describe the primary phenotypic characteristics and differences between type I and type II Usher syndrome and to establish a phenotype-genotype correlation for the 2 most frequent mutations in the USH 2 A gene. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study at a genetics department, in which clinical evaluations were performed for 433 patients (297 unrelated families) who were classified as having type I, II, III, atypical, or unclassified Usher syndrome according to their clinical history, pedigree data, results from ophthalmological studies, and audiological, neurophysiological, and vestibular test results. Molecular studies were performed for 304 patients (256 unrelated families). The Mann-Whitney U test or the χ 2 test was used for calculating the differences between mean values for the analyzed parameters. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age at diagnosis; age at onset of night blindness, visual field loss, visual acuity loss, and cataracts; and severity and age at diagnosis of hearing loss. RESULTS The comparison between patients with type I Usher syndrome and those with type II Usher syndrome revealed P <. 001 for most items analyzed. The most frequent mutations in the USH 2 A gene were the p. Glu 767 Serfs* 21 and p. Cys 759 Phe mutations, with an allelic frequency of 23. 2 %(63 of 272 alleles) and 8. 1 % (22 of 272 alleles), respectively. The phenotypic analysis for patients carrying p. Cys 759 Phe showed P <. 001 for most items analyzed when compared with patients carrying p. Glu 767 Serfs* 21 and when compared with patients carrying other mutations in the USH 2 A gene. None of the p. Cys 759 Phe patients exhibited a severe hearing loss phenotype, and more than 60 %had only mild hearing loss. Most patients carrying the p. Glu 767 Serfs* 21 mutation (72. 1 %) were <b>moderately</b> <b>deaf.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our study presents the clinical differences between type I and type II Usher syndrome and between the 2 most frequent mutations in the USH 2 A gene. Detailed genotype-phenotype correlations, as presented in our study, allow for a better correlation of clinical signs with a known genotype and can improve the clinical management, genetic counseling, and risk assessment of patients with Usher syndrome because an estimated prognosis of their disease can be madeThis work was supported by grant PI 13 / 00226 (to Servicio de Genética, Instituto de Investigación–Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain), by grant PI 13 / 00638 (to Unidad de Genética y Diagnóstico Prenatal, Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain), and by grant 06 / 07 / 0036 (to Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Madrid, Spain) from Fundaluce and Organización Nacional de Ciegos Españole...|$|E
