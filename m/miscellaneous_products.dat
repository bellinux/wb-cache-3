50|$|By {{the late}} 1830s, Davids was prosperous {{enough that he}} wanted to buy a country place in New Rochelle, New York, a short {{distance}} from New York City. Leaving the business in the hands of his partner, he took some time negotiating for the New Rochelle property.

Instead of being wealthy, Davids was $700 in debt, but with hard work, he entered the business again for himself at 112 John Street in 1840. Davids intended to move the company to New Rochelle in 1854 however the old mill being renovated for the ink factory burned. This mill had been used for making sealing wax and wafers.

30|$|One {{highlight}} {{of this analysis}} is the decomposition of the technology and production effects on future emission inventories. By differentiating structural changes in production from changes in emission technology affecting the emission coefficients, this analysis found that fast-growing production from services and FIRE industries accounts for {{a large share of}} the increased future emissions regardless of technological advances in pollution reduction. This finding suggests that services and FIRE industries are important indirect sources of emission pollution. In contrast, higher technology effects to reduce the emissions are found in CX 04 (utilities), CX 08 (apparel and textile), CX 15 (rubber and <b>miscellaneous</b> plastic <b>products),</b> CX 18 (fabricated metal products) and CX 35 (real estate) even if their production effects increase.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{attributed to}} electronic devices {{in the typical}} U.

While the traditional sources behind this increasing energy consumption trend are office equipment and consumer electronics, other miscellaneous devices, such as power tools, portable appliances, and personal care products contribute as well. The growth in electricity consumption within the typical home from miscellaneous end uses is in addition to the rising costs of fuel, such as gasoline for automobiles and oil for home heating. These costs are intensifying, straining consumer budgets while adding to the climate change burden.

40|$|In a {{wide range}} of indoor air pollutants, {{formaldehyde}} is one of the most-used and best-known substances. In order to protect human health, many countries have established threshold values for the release of formaldehyde from <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>products</b> and revise them constantly. Compliance with these regulations is usually assessed by emission test chamber measurements or derived methods. To control and improve the mechanisms of an emission test chamber, a reliable reference source with sample mimicking emission properties is required but not available so far. This study describes a permeation-controlled reference source based on the application of paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde releasing polymeric compound. Interactions between the formaldehyde release of the source and the governing chamber parameters temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were investigated in 1 m 3 emission chambers. Depending on the conditions, constant formaldehyde concentrations between approximately 10 ppb and 150 ppb can be adjusted for up to 600 h. A linear correlation between the logarithm of the chamber concentration and the reciprocal temperature was found. The results support the feasibility of the source for validation of emission test chamber performance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTotal Factor Productivity (TFP) is {{analyzed}} for six Tunisian manufacturing sectors: food processing, electrical and metal products, chemical activities, textiles, clothing and leather, building materials and ceramics, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>products.</b> First, sector-based TFP are calculated {{over a long}} period (1983 – 2002) as well as some sub-periods reflecting changes of local economic policy. Then, using an accounting framework, we decompose the industrial productivity into a reallocation effect (i. e., variation in the relative distribution of sectoral value added), and a pure productivity effect (i. e., the sectoral value-added shares being constant). Secondly, through panel data unit root tests, TFP long-term convergence with or without catch-up is examined with respect to the productive performance of OECD members. Each of the six Tunisian manufacturing sectors is benchmarked by the productive performance of OECD members. The Dickey–Fuller type test that we use allows us {{to take into account the}} potential correlation across OECD countries. The empirical analysis highlights two main findings.

30|$|Even if the emissions’ {{technology}} could be advanced through new technological progress and policy regulations that mandate {{lower levels of}} pollution, {{it is obvious that}} services and FIRE sectors produce more pollution indirectly because of their increasingly dominant role in the volume of production in the future Chicago economy according to the result of this decomposition analysis. Hence, it is important to highlight which economic activity is more responsive to decreases in the emission inventory associated with their emission technology progress. In particular, Table  7 reveals that CX 04 (utilities), CX 05 (constructions), CX 08 (apparel and textile), CX 15 (rubber and <b>miscellaneous</b> plastic <b>products)</b> and CX 18 (fabricated metal products) will generate a large technology effect overall on the seven emission pollutants; these findings suggest that more direct approaches in technology development or policy instruments focused on these sectors would contribute most to the reduction in future emission pollutants in Chicago.|$|R
