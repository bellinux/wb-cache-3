The cause of concern is most varieties of HWW wheat are susceptible to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) which affects grain quality. Environmental conditions like high humidity, precipitation, heavy dew and hormonal activity at physiological maturity stimulate PHS in HWW. To alleviate these conditions research was carried out at KSU. KS 01 HW 163 - 4, a sprouting tolerance line was crossed with Heyne, a sprout susceptible cultivar. A total of 224 doubled haploid (DH) lines thus produced were phenotyped {{in the present study}} through experiments conducted in controlled environments. The objectives of this research were to (i) characterize and phenotype the doubled haploid lines for PHS in controlled environments; (ii) understand the impact of growth environment (high temperature and/or drought) and; (iii) impact of exogenous application of growth hormones on tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting in the parental lines of the doubled haploid population. The phenotypic data collected from this research will be ultimately combined with the genotypic data to identify DNA markers related to PHS tolerance and provide DNA markers for marker assisted selection. Based on my results of the germination percentages from the 224 DH lines, the population was distributed as susceptible, and tolerant to PHS showing a bimodal distribution and X[superscript] 2 analysis indicating a complimentary gene action. From the study of the influence of environmental factors on PHS, my results confirmed a definite influence of stress on sprouting. Under optimum temperature (OT), KS 01 HS 163 - 4 was tolerant to PHS, but at HT and/or drought it became susceptible to PHS. Growth under stressed conditions changed the tolerance levels to PHS. Seed dry-weight, and harvest index were also influenced negatively due to stress. Therefore <b>multi-location</b> <b>tests</b> must be conducted with variable environments to test the stability of a variety to PHS. From the study of the influence of phytohormones on PHS, the results suggest that tolerance to sprouting was seen in seeds from plants sprayed with abscisic acid (ABA) and paclobutrazol (GA-inhibitor) treatments where as those from gibberellic acid (GA) treatment showed susceptibility to sprouting...|$|E

30|$|Given the {{relatively}} small size of MAGIC populations (1, 000 - 1, 500 lines), they are amenable for sequencing and <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> (Verbyla et al. 2014). By exposing these populations to diverse conditions and environments, novel gene-phenotypes relationships can be discovered and extracted for the regular breeding programs.

This study aimed to implement and to identify wetland rice genotypes. <b>Multi-location</b> <b>test</b> was conducted on some rice genotypes in Southeast Sulawesi in 2010 at various locations. Randomized block design was used with three replications in different locations. Data were analyzed using AMMI model. Results showed that rice production had the main effect with the genotype of KUI 1 and KUI 2. Moreover, BIPLOT test found that the genotype 2 of S 3393 - 2 F- 17 - 1 - 1 {{was the only one}} of unstable genotype, and the rest were stable genotype. Not surprisingly, genotype (G) 4 (S 3382 - 2 D-PN- 4 - 1), G 5 (S 3382 - 2 D-PN- 6 - 3 - 3), G 7 (S 3382 - 2 D-PN- 2 D- 1 - 1), G 11 (S 3382 - 2 D- 1 - 1), G 13 (Ciherang) and G 14 (Cisantana) were relatively stable. Those genotypes could be recommended as the high potential yield due to higher average production compared with general average. This study also indicated that G 3 (S 3381 - 2 D-PN- 27 - 2), G 9 (S 4359 -E- 11 - 2), and G 12 (IR 64) are very suitable for growing in location A at Ladongi. Moreover, in location B study suggested that G 11 (OBS- 9595) should be recommended at Wundulako. Finally, in Lambuya, particularly in location C, study indicated that some genotypes can grow well, viz. G 6 (S 3382 - 2 D-PN- 17 - 3), G 8 (S 4690 G-KN- 4 - 3) and G 14 (Cisantana) ...|$|R

In West-Africa, where adaptation to specific zones of rainfall distribution {{is crucial for}} the success of a variety, these multi-location trials need to be conducted within any specific zone of adaptation. As most West-African countries lack sufficient research station capacity for this type of yield testing, we have developed a trial design and experiments with a sharing of roles and responsibilities between farmers, NGO's and researchers that allow for effective varietal differentiation in the target environment across a wide range of production conditions within a zone. The added advantage of farmer participation in this early stage of variety evaluation is that farmers also evaluate a wide range of other traits that are essential for making a variety a success...|$|R

We were successful in identifying superior recombinations for three BB resistance genes (Xa 21, xa 13 and xa 5) in the homozygous condition in a long duration, photosensitive and deepwater rice variety. The pyramided genotypes can be further be used for <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> to be released as variety in the country or be used as potential BB resistance donors. The BB pyramided deepwater breeding lines, which are developed through MAS and phenotypic selection, will be of practical value in providing durable bacterial blight resistance in the deepwater growing region where control through chemicals under deepwater situation was less effective. These BB pyramided lines are expected to have a high impact on the yield stability and sustainability of deep water rice production.|$|R

There are many high Zn lines under evaluation in research station trials within the Philippines Rice Research Institute (Inabangan-Asilo et al. 2015). In Indonesia and India, high Zn rice lines are in the advanced stages of evaluation in the <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> and in station trials. These first and second sets of high Zn lines have 18 – 22  mg kg − 1 of Zn with acceptable yield potential, grain quality and agronomic traits (Swamy et al. 2015). These lines can meet 16 – 20  % of the estimated average requirement of Zn, which is sufficient to overcome severe health problems caused by Zn deficiency. In the coming years we are hopeful of releasing several high Zn rice lines in the target countries and seeing them deployed on a large scale. The initial success of high Zn rice and high Zn cultivars of other crops which have been developed and released has provided further impetus to expand the program to other poor countries of Asia.|$|R

It was found that 100 % of wheat acreage in the country were planted to modern varieties. Wheat area, production and yield in the country increased by 10, 14 and 3. 5 % per annum during 1971 - 92. The farmers found to have moderate knowledge gap {{in most of the}} practices of modern wheat technology. However, high knowledge gap was observed for recommended fertilizer dose. There were significant difference between the practices recommended and the existing knowledge of the farmers for different production practices. The demonstration farmers of farming system research sites and <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> sites had less knowledge gap than the other farmers. Wheat planting before November is not recommended, late planting {{is one of the main}} causes of lower yield of wheat in Bangladesh.

The disease is particularly severe under cool and humid weather conditions. Breeding for host resistance is an efficient means to combat this disease. In this paper, {{attempts have been made}} to summarize the progress made in identifying resistance sources, genetics and breeding for resistance, and genetic variation among the pathogen population. The search for resistance to AB in chickpea germplasm, breeding lines and land races using various screening methods has been updated. Importance of the genotype × environment (GE) interaction in elucidating the aggressiveness among isolates from different locations and the identification of pathotypes and stable sources of resistance have also been discussed. Current and modern breeding programs for AB resistance based on crossing resistant/multiple resistant and high-yielding cultivars, stability of the breeding lines through <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> and molecular marker-assisted selection method have been discussed. Gene pyramiding and the use of resistant genes present in wild relatives can be useful methods in the future.

40|$|Chili pepper {{is a very}} {{important}} and high economic value horticultural crop. One effort to increase productivity of chili pepper is the use of hybrid cultivar. However, newly developed cultivars have to pass multi-location evaluation before being released to farmers. This study was a part of a <b>multi-location</b> <b>test</b> and aimed to evaluate the growth and yield of six hybrid genotypes at medium elevation during wet season. The research was carried out during the peak of rainy season (November 2014 to February 2015) at Padang Lekat village, Kepahiang, Bengkulu Province. The experiment was arranged in a randomized completely block design (RCBD) with 3 replications. Six newly developed hybrids, H 5, H 14, H 17, H 20, H 23, and H 39, and a commercial cultivar, Dimas, were used as treatments. The results showed that hybrid H 39 was the highest vegetative growth among hybrids. Hybrid H 20 show the highest yield components. Other hybrids were about similar to Dimas in vegetative growth and yield components. Yield per plant and per plot of hybrid H 20 and H 23 were similar to that of Dimas.

This study was, conducted to determine the adaptation of new advanced generation soybean lines to identify high yielding stable lines, the most ideal testing environment and to determine the presence of soybean production mega environments in the country. Twenty one advanced generation soybean lines and three standard check varieties were evaluated in five sites and three consecutive rainy seasons. Results of AMMI analysis indicated the presence of a scale genotype-by-environment interaction for soybean grain yield. Through AMMI estimates and GGE visual assessment, BSPS 48 A was the highest yielding genotype in the most discriminating and stable environment, Nakabango.

40|$|Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ] is an {{important}} food legume of semi-arid tropics. In spite of releasing several varieties, its productivity has remained unchanged. To overcome this bottleneck, a commercial hybrid breeding technology, {{the first of its}} kind in any grain legume was developed. To achieve this, as a first step a stable cytoplasmic – nuclear – male –sterility (CMS) system was bred, which in combination with natural out-crossing was used to develop the hybrid technology. A breakthrough was achieved in 2005, culminating more than three decades of research, by developing a stable CMS system using the cytoplasm of a wild relative (C. cajanifolius) of pigeonpea. This male-sterility was transferred to diverse lines through backcrossing. Simultaneously, an efficient hybrid seed production technology was also developed. So far over 700 experimental hybrids have been tested and promising hybrids exhibited 30 - 100 % yield advantage over control. The most promising hybrid is ICPH 2671. In <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> this hybrid recorded 35. 8 % superiority over the ruling variety. This hybrid is also resistant to major pigeonpea diseases. ICPH 2671 performs well under moisture stress conditions and is suitable for intercropping. In 2008, this hybrid was launched for commercial cultivation in India. In the on-farm trials conducted in four provinces, mean yields of this hybrid varied from 250 to 2830 kg ha- 1 with upto 160 % advantage.

40|$|Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is {{the major}} biotic {{constraint}} to sorghum production. Its control is difficult and can only be achieved through integrated management strategies that depend mainly on host plant resistance and enhanced soil fertility. However, breeding for resistance is hampered by the complexity of host parasite interactions and lack of reliable screening methods. The invention of molecular markers has enhanced the effectiveness of breeding for resistance. Five genomic regions (QTLs) with linked markers associated with Striga resistance were mapped in sorghum variety N 13 by [10]. In this study, {{to increase the efficiency}} of marker-assisted selection (MAS), 27 EST-SSR markers in close association with Striga resistance QTLs were also identified and mapped. Populations of backcross (BC 3 S 4) derived from N 13 (Striga resistant) X three farmer preferred sorghum cultivars: Tabat, Wad Ahmed and AG- 8 (Striga susceptible) were generated. Thirty-one lines (BC 3 S 4) with confirmed Striga field resistance were genotyped with foreground and background selection makers.

Microfiche. xiii, 151 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmEconomic {{evaluations of}} <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing</b> results at the Thailand Farming Systems Research Institute {{have not been}} sufficient in terms of whole-farm decision planning. If no risk is involved in farm decision planning, farmers should act as profit maximizers. since risk is inherent in agriculture, farmers should be concerned with risk when they make decisions on farm investments. Therefore, it is hypothesized that risk decision making models predict northern Thai rice farmers' behaviors better than profit maximization models. Two elements in the mean-variance (E-V) decision analysis are farmer's risk preferences and risk perceptions. A quadratic function is used to represent farmer's attitudes to risk. Farmer's risk perceptions concerning crop production are measured by farmer's expectations of yields and prices. The expected mean-variance (E-V) efficiency frontier for each farmer is derived by a quadratic programming algorithm. The E-V efficiency frontier together with the utility function are used to derive optimal farm plans. The Target MOTAD model, using a linear programming algorithm, is included as an alternative decision model, which involves safety-first considerations (i. e., cash cost and variable cost as a target income level). The {{results show that the}} expected utility maximization model predicts actual farmers' behavior more accurately than the expected profit maximization model. Moreover, the Target MOTAD model performs quite well and better than the expected profit maximization model in predicting actual farmers' behavior when the selected target income level portrays their risk preferences and goals, such as variable cost of farm investment. The results suggest the importance of risk in farm decision making. Investment decisions of farmers concerning the amount of land allocated to mungbean production preceding the rice crop in the yearly rotation are significantly affected by competition from alternative crops for limited farm resources, such as land, labor and cash capital. Therefore, formulation of programs or policies, such as the integration of a new crop into farmer's existing cropping systems, should take risk and interdependency among cropping enterprises into consideration...|$|R

Results of a <b>multi-location</b> outfield <b>test</b> to determine the optimum rate of N fertilizer for LCP 85 - 384 indicated the optimum rate was on {{the low end of}} present recommendations. Results of ratoon crop response to N application rates were similar to those of previous years in this large outfield study. Cane yield optimized between 80 and 100 lb N/acre on light soils and 100 to 120 lb N/acre on heavy soils. Sugar yields were optimized at slightly lower rates. Overall, the data indicate optimal response occurs for the variety LCP 85 - 384 at rates 20 to 40 lb N/acre less than now recommended. Nitrogen fertilizer rates from 60 to 180 lb N/ac had minimal effect on cane or sugar yield of first ratoon crops for three varieties. Nitrogen use efficiency for biomass declined with increasing N rate, but tended to be higher across rates for LCP 85 - 384 than the other varieties. Applying a range of N fertilizer rates in early April vs late May for 3 rd ratoon LCP 85 - 384 harvested in late September resulted in a slight N rate x timing interaction for cane yield.

40|$|A {{large portion}} of the world’s poor farm in rainfed systems where the water supply is {{unpredictable}} and droughts are common. In Thailand there are approximately 6. 2 million ha of rain fed lowland rice which account for 67 % of the country’s total rice-growing area. This rice system is often characterised by too much and too little water in the same season. Farmers’ estimates of their annual losses to drought are as high as 45 % in the upper parts of the toposequence. In contrast to irrigated rice systems, gains from crop improvement of rainfed rice have been modest, in part because there has been little effort to breed and select for drought tolerance for the target rainfed environments. The crop improvement strategy being used in Thailand considers three mechanisms that influence yield in the drought prone targets: yield potential as an important mechanism for mild drought (where yield loss is less than 50 %), drought escape (appropriate phenology) and drought tolerance traits of leaf water potential, sterility, flower delay and drought response index for more severe drought conditions. Genotypes are exposed to managed drought environments for selection of drought tolerant genotypes. A marker assisted selection (MAS) scheme has been developed and applied for selection of progenies in the backcrossing program. The plant breeding program uses rapid generation advance techniques that enable early yield testing in the target population of environments (TPE) through inter-station (<b>multi-location</b> yield <b>testing)</b> and on-farm trials. A farmer participatory approach has been used to identify the TPE for the breeding program. Four terrace paddy levels have been identified, upper (drought), middle (drought prone to favorable) and lower (flooded).

40|$|To promote {{breeding}} for Ascochyta blight in lentil, {{the genetics}} {{of resistance to}} lentil Ascochyta blight was investigated. In addition, some techniques needed to support the genetic research and breeding were developed in this study. An efficient procedure for producing genetically true-type plantlets was established based on stimulating elongation of the axilary buds. This technique was then used to multiply F₁ hybrid populations to make the population sizes of different generations large enough for careful genetic analyses. Two regeneration systems, one based on multiple shoot induction from intact seedlings and the other based on cotyledonary node culture, were developed to facilitate the transfer of useful genes from wild lentils and/or other sources into cultivated lentil using tissue culture and genetic engineering techniques. Ten major genes were identified for foliar resistance. The inheritance models for these genes were: one dominant gene for high resistance and one dominant gene for moderate resistance (ILL 5588); a single dominant gene (ILL 5684 and W 6 3241), two complementary dominant genes (W 3 3192 and Titore), two recessive genes with additive effect (Indian head); one recessive gene (Laird); and one partial dominant gene with large effect and one dominant gene with less effect (W 3 3261). The gene in ILL 5684 is allelic {{to the one in}} ILL 5588 for high resistance. The contributions of minor genes to Ascochyta blight resistance were established for the first time by creating recombinant inbreds with the same major genotypes but different minor genotypes from two crosses (ILL 5684 x Titore, W 6 3241 x Titore). A mixed model based analysis carried out for the cross ILL 5588 x Titore indicated that about 30 % of the phenotypic variations in segregating populations were due to the minor genes. The overall genetic effect and the partition of the genetic effect into additive, dominant and epistatic effects were done for four crosses using generation-mean analysis. The underlying genetic mechanisms for seed infection rate were more complicated than that for foliar disease severity. The six basic generations were sufficient to model foliar disease severity, whereas they were not sufficient for seed infection rate in two crosses. Dominance {{played an important role in}} all crosses for both seed and foliar resistance. Except for foliar resistance in the cross ILL 5684 x Titore, at least one type of inter-gene effect (epstastic) contributed to the increased/reduced resistance. Therefore, selection for resistance would be more efficient if the dominance and epistasis effects were reduced after a few generations of selfing. The major gene for foliar resistance in ILL 5684 is linked to the genes for seed yield/plant or it has pleiotropic effect on seed yield/plant. The gene is independent of the genes for plant height and days to flowering. Within each set, there were significant differences among inbreds for all the three traits. The estimates of heritability based on inbred means were high for seed yield/plant and days to flowering, and moderate for plant height. For the set with major resistance gene, 1) disease severity was not correlated with seed yield/plant and plant height, but weakly and negatively correlated to days to flowering when measured under disease pressure. 2) Seed yield/plant was strongly and positively correlated with plant height, moderately and negatively correlated with days to flowering, and plant height was weakly and positively correlated with days to flowering under both testing conditions. 3) Inbred x environment interaction was not important and selection can be done with or without artificial inoculation. Thus, selection within the set of inbreds with the major resistance gene is required and is feasible for the improvements of yield and other traits and for the utilisation of resistance conferred by minor genes. Based on the results from this study and previous studies, a breeding procedure suitable for the current situation was developed. This procedure is based on crossing resistant and high yielding cultivars and <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing.</b> Gene pyramiding, exploring slow blighting and partial resistance, and using genes contained in wild relatives will be the methods of the future. Identification of more sources of resistance genes, good characterisation of the host-pathogen system, and identification of molecular markers tightly linked to resistance genes are suggested to be the key areas for future study...|$|R

Traditional institution of farmer group called in Indonesia as “Gapoktan” and the Religious teaching stage called as “Ponpes” have been known as non-formal institution which have high potency and unique networking access to surrounding public citizen and other informal institutions. As so did, they can be as a producer and virtual guarantor or good marketing agent of many agricultural products as well. Therefore, a mutual partnership model established between breeder and them is very important {{and to be a}} prospective idea to short cut breeding process and hybrid seed production. Scientific accountability and efficiency of whole breeding – seed production would be kept into main consideration. The concept was “Gapoktan” and “Ponpes” firstly would be trained to adopt technology for crossing to set F 1 Hybrid seed, then the results would be evaluated and compared with those done by breeder to determine whether they eligible or not.

Three nominated Gapoktan and Ponpes from separated regencies, i. e., Pasuruan, Malang and Batu were determined as the model. The results showed that F 1 seed production variable as indicator achievement of them were not significantly different from those of breeder in any place. Even though in between the places they did differ in several vegetative and productive factors each other.

40|$|Empowering {{breeding}} {{programs with}} {{new approaches to}} overcome constraints for selecting superior quality traits of rice Mariafe N. Calingacion Most rice breeding programs have focused on improving agronomic traits such as yield, while enhancing grain quality traits such as flavour and aroma, especially of non-fragrant rices, has not been given high priority. In this study, we utilised a multi-disciplinary approach to understand better quality traits of aroma and flavour in rice grains, and to determine whether good flavour in the grain could be combined with stress tolerant genotypes. To understand what factors drive rice preferences, an extensive survey {{among members of the}} International Network for Quality Rice who are local experts in grain quality evaluation programs in 25 countries was conducted (Chapter 2). The objective was to identify the grain quality characteristics of the popular rice varieties in each region. Eighteen combinations of size and shape of the grain, amylose content (AC), gelatinisation temperature (GT) and fragrance were identified. These trait combinations reveal the complexity of consumer preferences. The two most popular combinations both have long and slender grains, while one has low amylose, low GT and is aromatic, and the other has intermediate AC and intermediate GT and is non-aromatic. Further evaluation of varieties having the same combination of grain quality traits showed that consumers readily identify differences between these varieties. For example, BRS Primavera and IR 64 that are popular in Brazil and in the Philippines, respectively, have the same combination of all 18 traits, however, panellists of sensory evaluation can easily perceive differences in aroma and flavour of BRS Primavera and IR 64. This emphasises that the current tools we have available to assess rice quality are unable to capture all the quality traits consumers are looking for in rice. In Chapter 3, a novel multiplatform metabolomic and ionomic approach with genome-wide genotyping was utilised to investigate the effect of different nitrogen fertiliser regimes on the biochemical profile of three premium waxy rice varieties, Hom Nang Nouane (HNN), Kai Noi Leuanag (KNL) and Tha Sa No (TSN) from Lao PDR. The current tools used to phenotype grain quality such as GT, values from viscosity curves, and hardness and stickiness, were unable to differentiate between HNN, KNL and TSN either on the basis of nitrogen treatment nor genotype. However, metabolite profiling of metabolites and minerals followed by multivariate statistical methods readily separated the genotypes on each platform, and discriminatory compounds that were identified were relevant to consumers in terms of flavour, taste and nutrition. However, despite yield differences, nitrogen treatment did not significantly affect the overall metabolite and mineral profiles of the samples. Using 1536 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, the Euclidean distance between each variety was calculated and compared to the distance between each variety for each metabolomic platform. Procrustes analysis was used to rotate and scale the variety mean scores on the metabolite principal components to give the best fit to the genetic principal coordinates. Comparing the triangles whereby each vertex of the triangle is a variety and the length of each side is equal to the scaled Euclidean distance, mineral elements, polar metabolites and volatile compounds all associate very well with the genetic distance between each variety. This study highlights that multiple metabolomic platforms are potential phenotyping tools to characterise rice quality in a comprehensive and efficient way, and in a way that provides data that is relevant to consumers. To gain insights on the influence of water availability to the metabolomic profile of drought tolerant rice, two contrasting varieties, Apo and IR 64, and a mapping population derived from them were extensively characterised in Chapters 4 and 5. Apo is drought tolerant but has unacceptable grain quality while IR 64 is drought susceptible with premium grain quality. Apo and IR 64 were grown under irrigated and drought conditions. Yield of Apo from both water conditions was higher than yield of IR 64 under the same conditions. Moreover, metabolite profiling and sensory analysis showed that grains of Apo were not affected by drought conditions i. e. panellists perceived no difference in the aroma of Apo from both conditions and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the volatiles showed one cluster of Apo from both conditions. However, grains of IR 64 formed two clusters based on water condition in the PCA and panellists were able to perceive ‘water-like metallic’ aroma in IR 64 that was grown under drought conditions but this was not detected in grains from the irrigated treatment. This suggests that response to water stress in the metabolomic profile of the grain is variety dependent. In Chapter 5, a mapping population derived from Apo and IR 64 was grown, with the parents, under irrigated and drought conditions. The yield of {{more than half of the}} population was higher than the yield of Apo and IR 64 under both irrigated and drought conditions; this indicates significant transgressive segregation. Using a dense linkage map based on genotyping by sequencing data, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of drought stress identified one major QTL on chromosome 3 that is likely to be qDTY 3. 1 which was previously detected in a population derived from Apo as the drought tolerant parent. All the lines of the population carrying this QTL showed significantly higher yield under drought than those without it, indicating the potential importance of this QTL in drought tolerance.     Metabolite profiling and sensory analysis were also conducted in the grains of the population. More than a hundred volatiles were detected in the headspace of rice samples and PC 1 and PC 2 explained 55. 6 % of the variation in the metabolite profiles with many of the lines clustering in between the Apo and IR 64 parent values. Six novel metabolite QTLs for volatile compounds were identified - 1 QTL was detected in chromosome 1 for 3, 7 -dimethyl-octen- 1 -ol, 1 QTL for hexanol in chromosome 2, and 4 QTLs for pentanol, hexanol, hexanal, and heptanone in chromosome 3. Interestingly, three lines were observed by the panellists to have similar aroma as IR 64 while four lines were observed to have similar aroma as that perceived in Apo. Lines 20, 164 and 28 were perceived by the panellists to have high levels of corn, dairy and sweet aromatic features. Moreover, the yield of these 3 lines under both irrigated and drought conditions was similar to that of the Apo parent under the same conditions with Line 28 yielding the highest under drought and has the QTL associated with yield under drought on chromosome 3. Finally, the potential of metabolomics as a phenotyping tool in characterising grain quality is further highlighted in Chapter 6. Combining metabolomics with high throughput genotyping and sensory analysis offers new breadth of approach in understanding grain quality of rice. Three lines identified that carry IR 64 quality along with high yield in both irrigation and drought, are recommended to enter a rice breeding program at the stage of advanced replicated and <b>multi-location</b> <b>testing.</b> By using advanced tools of phenotyping and genotyping, with validation by sensory panels, these three advanced lines have been selected in just three years.  ...|$|R
40|$|Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is {{a native}} grass species {{to much of the}} US. It has shown great {{potential}} for use in production of fuel ethanol from cellulosic biomass (Lynd et al., 1991). Work in Alabama demonstrated very high dry matter yields can be achieved with switchgrass (Maposse et al. 1995) in the southeastern US. Therefore, this region is thought to be an excellent choice for development of a switchgrass cropping system where farmers can produce the grass for either biomass or forage. Another report has shown success with selection and breeding to develop high yielding germplasm from adapted cultivars and ecotypes of switchgrass (Moser and Vogel 1995). In the mid 1990 s, however, there was little plant breeding effort for switchgrass with a potential for developing a cultivar for the southeast region. The main goal of the project was to develop adaptive, high-yielding switchgrass cultivars for use in cropping systems for bioenergy production in the southeastern US. A secondary objective was to assess the potential of alternate herbaceous species such as bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.), bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge.), and napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.) that may compete with switchgrass for herbaceous bioenergy production in the southeast. During the conduct of the project, another goal of developing molecular markers useful for genetic mapping was added. The ''lowland'' cultivars, Alamo and Kanlow, were found to be the highest yielding switchgrass cultivars. Although most summers during the project period were hot and dry, their annual dry matter yield continue to outperform the best ''upland'' cultivars such as Cave-in-Rock, Shawnee, NE Late, and Trailblazer. The use of a breeding procedure based on the ''honeycomb design'' and <b>multi-location</b> progeny <b>testing,</b> coupled with the solid heritability and genetic gain estimates for dry matter yield in lowland type switchgrass germplasm, indicated excellent potential to isolate parental genotypes for producing higher yielding synthetic cultivars. The four experimental synthetics produced thus far, and now in performance tests, could provide this cultivar. Initial performance results of these experimentals have been very promising demonstrating a 30 % yield enhancement over Alamo and Kanlow. Future testing, including testing in other states, will be critical before a determination can be made to release {{one or more of these}} into the commercial seed trade. In the genetic mapping project, 42 genotypes of switchgrass were surveyed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes from different grass species. The different genotypes included 24 from Alamo, 15 from Kanlow, and 3 from ''Summer. '' A majority of the probes (87 %) hybridized to the switchgrass DNA and 81 % were polymorphic. Most of the polymorphism observed was between the cultivars. A mapping population consisting of 100 progeny from a cross between the most dissimilar Kanlow and Summer genotypes was produced during 2001. The parents and progeny population are now maintained at the University of Georgia and will be used to construct a map based on the polymorphic RFLP probes. When compared to ''Tifton 85 '' bermudagrass, ''Tifton 9 '' bahiagrass, and ''Merkron'' napier-grass, Alamo switchgrass was found to show poorer yields than Merkron and Tifton 85, but better yields than Tifton 9 in the coastal plain region. The exceptional performance of Tifton 85 bermudagrass is extremely noteworthy because this hybrid bermudagrass is also a variety of choice for many commercial hay producers in the lower south and would give any producers a very good option to produce either biomass for a biofuels initiative or sell as hay on the open market. Merkron has consistently showed the highest dry matter yields. However, there continues to be some winter damage each year on this species at the Athens location indicating its real potential lies mainly in the Gulf Coast region of the southeastern United States. The excellent characteristic of Tifton 85 and Merkron should therefore be enough to initiate more basic research for their chemical ability as a biofuels crop...|$|R
