50|$|The fovea centralis (the term fovea {{comes from}} the Latin, meaning pit or pitfall) is a small, central pit {{composed}} of closely packed cones in the eye. It {{is located in the}} center of the <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> of the retina.|$|E

50|$|Also, it is {{possible}} that meso-zeaxanthin is generated from other carotenoids consumed in the diet, as carotenoids are known to convert into different carotenoids for functional reasons.

50|$|The yellow {{color and}} {{name of the}} corpus luteum, {{like that of the}} <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> of the retina, is due to its {{concentration}} of certain carotenoids, especially lutein. In 1968, a report indicated that beta-carotene was synthesized in laboratory conditions in slices of corpus luteum from cows. However, {{attempts have been made to}} replicate these findings, but have not succeeded. The idea is not presently accepted by the scientific community. Rather, the corpus luteum concentrates carotenoids from the diet of the mammal.|$|E
5000|$|The yellow {{color of}} the human <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> (literally, yellow spot) in the retina of the eye results from the lutein and {{zeaxanthin}} it contains, both xanthophylls again requiring a source in the human diet {{to be present in}} the eye. These xanthophylls protect the eye from ionizing blue and ultraviolet light, which they absorb. These two specific xanthophylls do not function in the mechanism of sight, since they cannot be converted to retinal (also called retinaldehyde or vitamin A aldehyde). Their arrangement {{is believed to be the}} cause of Haidinger's brush, an entoptic phenomenon that allows to perceive the polarization of light.|$|E
50|$|The central retina is cone-dominated and the {{peripheral}} retina is rod-dominated. In total {{there are about}} seven million cones and a hundred million rods. At {{the centre of the}} macula is the foveal pit where the cones are smallest and in a hexagonal mosaic, the most efficient and highest density. Below the pit the other retina layers are displaced, before building up along the foveal slope until the rim of the fovea or parafovea which is the thickest portion of the retina. The macula has a yellow pigmentation from screening pigments and is known as the <b>macula</b> <b>lutea.</b> The area directly surrounding the fovea has the highest density of rods converging on single bipolars. Since the cones have a much lesser power of merging signals, the fovea allows for the sharpest vision the eye can attain.|$|E

50|$|The fovea {{is located}} {{near the center of}} the macula. It is a small pit that {{contains}} the largest concentration of cone cells. The retina contains two types of photosensitive cells, the rod cells and the cone cells. The normal human eye contains three different types of cones, with different ranges of spectral sensitivity; hence the cones enable us to distinguish different colors. There is only one type of rod, but the rods are more sensitive than the cones, so in dim light we rely on them and do not discriminate colors. In the fovea centralis or <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> or simple yellow spot, cones predominate and are present at high density. The macula is thus responsible for the central, high-resolution, color vision that is possible in good light; and this kind of vision is impaired if the macula is damaged, for example in macular degeneration.|$|E
5000|$|The macula or <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> (from Latin macula, [...] "spot" [...] + lutea, [...] "yellow") is an oval-shaped {{pigmented}} {{area near}} the center of the retina of the human eye and some other animalian eyes. The macula in humans has a diameter of around 5.5 mm and is subdivided into the umbo, foveola, foveal avascular zone (FAZ), fovea, parafovea, and perifovea areas. After death or enucleation (removal of the eye) the macula appears yellow, a color that is not visible in the living eye except when viewed with light from which red has been filtered. The anatomical macula at 5.5 mm is much larger than the clinical macula which, at 1.5 mm, corresponds to the anatomical fovea. The clinical macula is seen when viewed from the pupil, as in ophthalmoscopy or retinal photography. The anatomical macula is defined histologically in terms of having two or more layers of ganglion cells. [...] The umbo is the center of the foveola which in turn is located at the center of the fovea.|$|E
50|$|Sachs, who {{recognized}} that the disease had a familial basis, proposed that the disease should be called amaurotic familial idiocy. However, its genetic basis was still poorly understood. Although Gregor Mendel had published his article on the genetics of peas in 1865, Mendel's paper was largely forgotten {{for more than a}} generation - not rediscovered by other scientists until 1899. Thus, the Mendelian model for explaining Tay-Sachs was unavailable to scientists and doctors of the time. The first edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia, published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906, described what was then known about the disease:It is a curious fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews.

Opponents of immigration often questioned whether immigrants from southern and eastern Europe could be assimilated into American society. Reports of Tay-Sachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race.|$|E

40|$|A case of ophthalmomyiasis interna {{posterior}} (OIP) {{caused by}} the larva of the Reindeer warble fly is reported.

40|$|ACCORDING to Michaelson (1948, 1954), neo-vascularization {{is due to}} {{an unknown}} vasoproliferative factor that appears in the tissues in hypoxic conditions. This factor is {{supposed}} to be responsible for the development of embryonic retinal vessels and for pathological neovascularization. The role of hypoxia in vascularization is confirmed by observations that areas of the retina well supplied with oxygen, such as the outer layers, <b>macula</b> <b>lutea,</b> and the neighbourhood of arteries, contain no vessels and that at the beginning of vascu-larization hypoxic conditions prevail in the inner retinal layers. At that stage of development the retina thickens and its inner layers become insufficiently supplied with oxygen. Campbell (1951) and Ashton and Cook (1954) showed in animal experiments that the width of the avascular zone in the neighbourhood of retinal arteries depends on the oxygen tension. At higher oxygen concentrations a wide zone (and, alternatively, at lower oxygen concentrations a narrow zone) developed. With high oxygen tension, Ashton, Ward, and Serpell (1953, 1954), Michaelson, Herz, Lewkowitz, and Kertesz (1954), and Ashton and Blach (1961) were able t...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease(AD), a {{neurodegenerative}} disease, {{can result}} in memory loss,cognitive and behavioral deficits. The pathological hallmarkes are β amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which lead loss of neurons in brain. As {{the extension of the}} central nervous system, retina has a similar tissue anatomy with central nervous system. The β amyloid plaques have also been detected in retina of AD. Furthermore, according to eye examinations of AD patients, we have found the loss of retinal ganglion cells, the attenuation of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, the smaller changes of <b>macula</b> <b>lutea,</b> the decline of vascular density and so on. And then, there occurs the visual field loss and the decline of contrast sensitivity and so on in AD patients. Thus, the retina has occurred nerve degenerative changes in AD.

In addition,curcumin, a natural and safe fluorescent dye, can be used to label β amyloid plaques in retina. The above suggests that retina can be a window for the early diagnosis of AD...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research to}} elucidate the molecular pathology of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), from phenotype to genotype. PXE is an autosomally inherited disorder of connective tissue, affecting the skin, Bruch's membrane of the eye, and cardiovascular system. The most apparent clinical features of PXE is the skin manifestation. Ocular features include angioid streaks, peau d'orange, and comet-like streaks in the retina.

40|$|AbstractThere {{is now a}} consensus, {{based on}} histological, {{biochemical}} and spectral absorption data, that the yellow colour observed at the <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> {{is a consequence of}} the selective accumulation of dietary xanthophylls in the central retina of the living eye. Scientific research continues to explore the function(s) of MP in the human retina, with two main hypotheses premised on its putative capacity to (1) protect the retina from (photo) -oxidative damage by means of its optical filtration and/or antioxidant properties, the so-called protective hypothesis and (2) influence the quality of visual performance by means of selective short wavelength light absorption prior to photoreceptor light capture, thereby attenuating the effects of chromatic aberration and light scatter, the so-called acuity and visibility hypotheses. The current epidemic of age-related macular degeneration has directed researchers to investigate the protective hypothesis of MP, while there has been a conspicuous lack of work designed to investigate the role of MP in visual performance. The aim of this review is to present and critically appraise the current literature germane to the contribution of MP, if any, to visual performance and experience...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarotenoids {{comprise}} {{a class of}} natural fat-soluble pigments which are found in numerous fruits and vegetables. The consumption of a diet rich in carotenoids has been epidemiologically correlated with a lower risk for several diseases. The antioxidant activity of carotenoids and biochemical properties influencing signaling pathways have been discussed as basic mechanisms of prevention. Conflicting data from intervention studies with β-carotene to prevent cancers and cardiovascular disorders have challenged the concept. However, there is convincing evidence that carotenoids are important components of the antioxidant network. Photooxidative damage is suggested {{to be involved in}} the pathobiochemistry of several diseases affecting the skin and the eye, and carotenoids may protect light-exposed tissues. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the predominant carotenoids of the retina and are considered to act as photoprotectants preventing retinal degeneration. The unique distribution, localization and high levels of both carotenoids within the <b>macula</b> <b>lutea</b> as well as their physicochemical properties make them suitable candidates for photoprotection. β-Carotene is used as an oral sun protectant for the prevention of sunburn and has been shown to be effective either alone or in combination with other carotenoids or antioxidant vitamins.
