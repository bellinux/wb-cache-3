This paper analyzes the <b>main</b> access <b>fairways</b> to the Split City Port, {{as well as those}} leading to the Kaštela Bay and the North Port of Split. Small vessel maritime traffic is also analyzed, although it is neither continuous, nor follows any established main routes. The AIS vessel movement data served as the basic source of data for larger vessels, and arrival/departure reports of port authorities for other maritime traffic. <b>Main</b> access <b>fairways,</b> maritime traffic concentration and structure, as well as assessment of collision and grounding risk are defined in keeping with the obtained data...|$|R

The Donggu Fishing Port Channel runs north of the Dagusha Channel, close to the Nanjiang island, and separates fishing boats from the deep water channel.Harbor basins are breakwater-protected, and include the in-harbor Channels and the approaches to the wharves. The Main Harbor Basin extends 16.5 km from the Xingang Shipping Lock to breakwater mouth, and there are four secondary basins within the main basin, formed by the four jutting piers of the Beijiang port area. The North Harbor Basin is 8.5 km long by 1,100-900 m wide, and has two secondary basins (in construction). The Dagukou Harbor Basin is 14 km long, and tapers down from 1,500 to 900 m wide as it goes up the old Haihe mouth. It also has two secondary basins (in construction).|$|R
40|$|The depositional {{setting of}} the McMurray Formation within the main McMurray fairway has been {{extensively}} studied by geologists and is well documented in the literature. Most provincial crown land in the easternmost part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Deposit (AOSD) has been leased, and is currently being drilled and geologically characterised {{with the aim of}} in-situ or mining bitumen extraction, mostly from reservoir channel sand bodies. There are, however, new plays being discovered in the northwestern part of the AOSD, notably in the Ells and Dover areas that represent different depositional environments. Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. (AOSC) is a private oil sands company that holds extensive oil sands assets in this western region of Athabasca (Fig. 1), where it has discovered thick bitumen pay within the McMurray Formation. Other major companies holding rich bitumen leases close-by include the tripartite partnership of Chevron Canada Limited, Shell Canada Limited and Marathon (formerly Western Oil Sands Inc.), as well as TOTAL E&P Canada, and land brokers holding lands for undisclosed clients. Chevron has claimed as much as 7. 5 billion barrels of bitumen in-place on their leases which may be exploitable by in-situ SAGD methods 1. Across its leases in the Dover area, AOSC has extensive in-place volumes of bitumen, and plans to develop a 2, 000 bpd in-situ thermal pilot in 2010, followed by 25, 000 to 30, 000 bpd tranches commencing 20142. Depositional environments of the McMurray Formation in this region contrast significantly to those reservoirs located within the <b>main</b> <b>fairway</b> to the east. This presentation aims at describing the sedimentology and reservoir characterisation of a small area of the AOSC properties and will compare the reservoir types associated with this new play area to those more traditional channel sand plays found further to the east...|$|E
40|$|The Rotliegend gas {{play in the}} Southern Permian Basin {{has yielded}} over 200 gas fields in the Netherlands; they are found in an E-W fairway along the {{southern}} flank of the basin. Sandstones generally pinch out basinward, but localized, isolated sands are present north of the <b>main</b> <b>fairway.</b> The Rotliegend of the Markham gas field {{and a number of}} smaller fields in its vicinity ("Markham area") provides a good example of such an isolated sand occurrence, and it may {{serve as a model for}} exploration in the "feather edge" of the Rotliegend desert lake. The reservoir interval (Lower Slochteren Member) is a diachronous sequence, 20 - 50 m thick, from aeolian-dune sandstones to desert-lake mudstones. Periodic fluctuations of lake level, probably controlled by short-period Milankovitch rhythms (precession or obliquity) resulted in the formation of desert-lake mudstone drapes that compartmentalize the reservoir over kilometers. The Lower Slochteren interval consists of four aeolian cycles, 5 - 15 m thick, which are retrogradational from sharpbased aeolian sandstone, via sandflat and mudflat deposits to desert-lake mudstone. Toward the south the clay-bearing facies pinch out and aeolian sandstones merge into a compound aeolian sandstone body 20 m thick. The aeolian cycles accumulated in an eastward-dipping, 10 -km-wide palaeovalley in the Base Permian Unconformity. The cycles onlapped onto the valley margins until the entire valley was filled and a depositional plain came into place. The plain was flooded by the Rotliegend desert lake, followed by the formation of progradational cycles about 5 m thick, each consisting of a basal desert-lake mudstone grading upward into mudflat and sandflat deposits. The change from retrogradational (fining-upward) cycles to progradational (coarsening-upward) cycles seems controlled by the rate of formation of accommodation space during lake-level rise. Initially palaeotopography restricted the creation of accommodation space, thus allowing sediment supply to keep up with rising lake level and forcing dune sands to stack up against rising palaeogeography, resulting in aggradational to retrogradational sequences. However, lake-level rise across the depositional plain caused regional flooding and rapid and far retreat of the lake-margin depositional system, causing accommodation space to be filled after the flooding and resulting in progradational sequences. The Markham case shows that the presence of isolated Rotliegend sandstones is related to palaeotopography and that their internal architecture is controlled by periodic expansion and contraction of the desert lake. It emphasizes the importance of accurate seismic definition of the Base Permian Unconformity and detailed, sedimentology-driven correlation for future exploration at the fringes of the Rotliegend-play fairway.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results from a combined aerial survey performed with a hexacopter and a gyrocopter over {{a part of the}} Elbe estuary near Hamburg, Germany. The survey was conducted by the Federal Institute of Hydrology, Germany, and the Fraunhofer Application Center for Multimodal and Airborne Sensors as well as by a contracted engineering company with the aim to acquire spatial thermal infrared (TIR) data of the Hahnöfer Nebenelbe, a branch of the Elbe estuary. Additionally, RGB and NIR data was captured to facilitate the identification of water surfaces and intertidal mudflats. The temperature distribution of the Elbe estuary affects all biological processes and in consequence the oxygen content, which is a key parameter in water quality. The oxygen levels vary in space between the <b>main</b> <b>fairway</b> and side channels. So far, only point measurements are available for monitoring and calibration/validation of water quality models. To better represent this highly dynamic system with a high spatial and temporal variability, tidal streams, heating and cooling, diffusion and mixing processes, spatially distributed data from several points of time within the tidal cycle are necessary. The data acquisition took place during two tidal cycles over two subsequent days in the summer of 2015. While the piloted gyrocopter covered the whole Hahnöfer Nebenelbe seven times, the unmanned hexacopter covered a smaller section of the branch and tidal mudflats with a higher spatial and temporal resolution (16 coverages of the subarea). The gyrocopter data was acquired with a thermal imaging system and processed and georeferenced using the structure from motion algorithm with GPS information from the gyrocopter and optional ground control points. The hexacopter data was referenced based on ground control points and the GPS and position information of the acquisition system. Both datasets from the gyrocopter and the hexacopter are corrected for the effects of the atmosphere and emissivity of the water surface and compared to in situ measurements, taken during the data acquisition. Of particular interest is the effect of the observation angle on the brightness temperature acquired by the wide angle lenses on the platforms, which is up to 40 ° at the margins of the imagery. Here, both datasets show deviating temperatures, which are probably not due to actual temperature differences. We will discuss the position accuracy achieved over the water areas, the adaptation of atmospheric and emissivity correction to the observation angle and subsequent improvement of the temperature data. With two datasets of the same research area at different resolutions we will investigate the effects of the acquisition platforms, acquisition system and resolutions on the accuracy of the remotely sensed temperatures as well as their ability to represent temperature patterns of tidal currents and mixing processes...|$|E
40|$|The Southern Permian Basin (SPB) {{formed a}} large, {{elongated}} saucer-shaped inland depression {{extending from the}} UK to Poland and from Belgium to Denmark. During the Middle to early Late Permian the SPB was filled progressively by playa sediments from its centre in northwestern Germany before it was flooded {{at the onset of}} the Zechstein. The Netherlands were situated at the southern part of the saline playa lake. The sediment fill has an onlap configuration upon the underlying Carboniferous and Lower Rotliegend strata. Although regional contour maps suggest a fairly gradual thinning of the Upper Rotliegend interval towards the basin edge, more careful examination reveals that there are prominent steps in thickness and facies. It can be concluded that these steps are defined by steps in the palaeotopography of the basin. These topographic steps are related to pre-Variscan and Variscan structural elements. During deposition of the Upper Rotliegend these large-scale topographic steps defined the location of the <b>main</b> fluvial <b>fairways</b> towards the basin centre, extensive (mud) flat areas, and the relative highs on which the dune fields developed. Next to these large topographic elements relief inversion, differential erosion, and faults caused smaller-scale topographic relief elements. This relief exerted prominent influence on the sediment dispersal patterns and sediment type both laterally and vertically. This holds especially true for the basal Rotliegend sandstones and in the pinch-out area near the playa margin. Copyright © 2011 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology) ...|$|R
40|$|In coastal {{countries}} like Vietnam, sea transportation has always contributed {{greatly to the}} development of the national economy. The development of sea transportation depends on many factors. Among these factors marine traffic safety in ports and adjacent waterways is one which directly influences this development. The launch of the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) has contributed significantly to improving safety in waterways such as harbor waters, fairways and straits which have high traffic density. After six months of official operation, the Vung Tau VTS Center in Vietnam has helped to reduce the number of accidents in the VTS area by 60 %, compared to the same period in the previous year, 2012. However, the rate of accidents related to traffic in the Vung Tau VTS area is still high, about 70 % of total accidents. It is because of the ?쐂is-order??traffic in the waterway. Navigation assistance and traffic organization are two of the main functions of a VTS system. So that improving the effectiveness of the Vung Tau VTS Center in these two functions is one of the feasible and effective solutions to solve this problem. After studying the work of VTS officers (VTSO), it was found that the key factor in deciding the performance of a VTSO is his/her ability to assess the risk of vessels. In fact, at all VTS centers this process totally depends on the assessment of the VTSO. These assessment results greatly depend on human factors such as working experience, working conditions, human error, etc. An effective solution for this problem is the application of a quantitative risk assessment model to evaluate the risk of a vessel?셲 traffic safety. For this reason this dissertation researches and develops the Real Time Supporting System (RTSS) for VTS officers. It is able to help VTSOs determine the collision risk of vessels quantitatively and alert vessels which have un-acceptable risk of collision. In addition, the RTSS is also able to alert vessels which have the possibility of going aground or being off-route or over-speed. This RTSS was designed for application in the Vung Tau VTS Center to improve marine traffic safety in the three <b>main</b> <b>fairways</b> in the Vung Tau Waterway. It will contribute to the economic development of the Important Triangular Economic Zone in the southern part of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai Province, and Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province). For the purpose of this research a survey of traffic in the Vung Tau Waterway was conducted. Traffic environment factors were studied and statistical data of marine traffic and marine accidents in the waterway were collected. To find the assessment model most appropriate for the Vung Tau Waterway, this data was then analyzed, evaluated, and compared using various methods such as evaluation based on experts??surveys or based on assessment models, comparison evaluation results with statistical data, etc. Results showed that the PARK model (Potential Assessment of Risk model, developed in Korea) is the most appropriate model for the Vung Tau Waterway. This RTSS was developed based on this model. Its functions and user interface were designed according to survey responses of VTSOs in the Vung Tau VTS Center. After development this RTSS has gone into trial operation at the Vung Tau VTS Center where it obtainned data about traffic through the AIS (Automatic Identification System) receiver device. Then the feedback of VTS officers was collected and analyzed for further study on improving the RTSS. The findings of the dissertation are summarized as follows: 1. The affects of marine environment factors such as winds, currents, tides, waves, fog, rain, width and depth of waterway on marine traffic safety were analyzed. It was found that they have a small negative affect on traffic safety in the Vung Tau Waterway 2. Through traffic survey and quantitative assessment by the IWRAP model, it was found that the ?쐂is-order??movement of traffic in this area by ocean vessels, barges, tug boats, fishing boats, etc. is the main factor which affects traffic safety in this waterway. This problem can be looked into by many ways. However, an effective and feasible solution is improving the effectiveness of the Vung Tau VTS Center 3. The effectiveness of the Vung Tau VTS Center is still restricted because of lack of sea and working experience of VTS officers. So a supporting system to support VTS officers for improving their competency and the Vung Tau VTS Center?셲 efficiency needs to be established. The supporting system should be able to help VTS officers to assess collision risks of vessels quantitatively in real time. It must be built based on an assessment model that takes into account the risk of human factors 4. Through analysis it was found that some models other than the ES model and the PARK model use statistical measures or the opinions of experts, but they do not take into account the risks of human factors. So these models cannot be used to assess collision risks of vessels in real time. By qualitative analysis and assessment of VTS officers about the ES model and the PARK model, it was shown that the PARK model is the most appropriate model for evaluating risks of collision in the Vung Tau Waterway in real time 5. The Real Time Supporting System (RTSS) for VTS officers was developed. It is able to evaluate collision risks of vessels based on the PARK model in real time and alert vessels that run a risk of collision. In addition, it can alert officers about vessels??going aground, being off-route and over-speed vessels. The RTSS was put in trial operation in the Vung Tau VTS Center. Most VTS officers have given the same feedback, i. e., that it is a useful tool and should be improved to become an indispensable part of the VTS system From these results this dissertation recommends to the Maritime Administration of Ho Chi Minh City, which manages the Vung Tau VTS Center, to give permission for connecting the RTSS with the VTS system to enable complete traffic data gathering for implementing the subsequent trial operation steps. In this way the RTSS will continue to be assessed, modified, and then put into official operation. List of Tables	vii List of Figures	ix Acknowledgments	xiv Abstract	xvi Chapter 1.
