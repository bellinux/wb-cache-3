25|$|Former President George H. W. Bush, {{management}} expert Dr. Ken Blanchard (author of the One-Minute Manager books), {{and former}} First Lady Barbara Bush were recent distinguished guest speakers on campus. Johnson Hall, an all-girls dormitory on the UMHB campus, {{was named after}} Rebekah Baines Johnson, mother of President Lyndon B. Johnson and granddaughter of Baptist preacher Reverend George Washington Baines, who {{served as president of}} the college from 1861â€“1864. President Johnson, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> and several other family members were present when the building was dedicated on September 26, 1968.President George W. Bush made a visit to the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor in Fall of 2014.|$|E
25|$|President Andrew Johnson had {{the public}} {{rooms on the}} State Floor {{refurbished}} in 1866. His wife, Eliza McCardle Johnson, was in frail health and did {{little in the way}} of entertaining or overseeing the White House. Johnson instead relied on his daughter, Martha Patterson (wife of Senator David T. Patterson). In May, the East Room was cleared of furnishings. Mrs. Patterson oversaw the selection of new yellow wallpaper with a black and gold border, lace curtains, and reupholstered furniture. The ceiling was repainted and frescoes added, and the ceiling centerpieces and cornices were regilded. Only once did <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> intervene, and that was to request that the paint applied to ceiling be of the highest quality. Patterson also had the three large marble-topped tables removed from the East Room and placed in the family private quarters, and two of the four pier tables added to the Family Dining Room. The East Room was finished in early 1867.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{and a few}} {{scenes are}} often cut in reproductions. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> is the Younger family's neighbor. [...] She is nosy and loud, and cannot understand how the family can consider moving to a white neighborhood. [...] Her lines are employed as comic relief, but Hansberry also uses this scene to mock those who are too scared {{to stand up for}} their rights.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 January 2016 the BBC {{broadcast}} a new {{production of the}} play by director/producer Pauline Harris. [...] This version restores the character of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{and a number of}} scenes that were cut from the Broadway production and subsequent film, with the following cast: ...|$|E
2500|$|Her remarks {{reportedly}} caused <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{to burst}} into tears {{and led to a}} derailment in Kitt's career. Publicly ostracized in the United States, she devoted her energies to performances in Europe and Asia. It is said that Kitt's career in the United States was ended following her comments about the Vietnam War, after which she was branded [...] "a sadistic nymphomaniac" [...] by the CIA.|$|E
2500|$|St. Barnabas Episcopal Church {{began in}} 1946 as {{meetings}} in individual homes. President and Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson attended the 1964 groundbreaking {{for the church}} building. [...] Lady Bird Johnson presented the church with a stone from St. Barnabas Church in Cyprus that she had received from Archbishop Makarios on a 1962 visit to the island nation. [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{was a member of}} St. Barnabas in Fredericksburg, which became the Texas home church for the Johnsons. The President took communion there.|$|E

60|$|So <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{pretending to}} be a princess, comes out of a wobbly thing that we agree to pretend is a castle; and old man Johnson, {{pretending to be}} a pirate, is pushed up and down on another wobbly thing that we agree to pretend is the ocean. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> pretends to be in love with him, which we know she is not. And Johnson pretends to be a very terrible person; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> pretends, till eleven o'clock, to believe it. And we pay prices, varying from a {{shilling}} to half-a-sovereign, to sit for two hours and listen to them.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{who was a}} {{dark and}} {{somewhat}} forbidding-looking lady, smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now look}} here! You {{are going in}} that cabin with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> where she can look after you, but I can't. So I'll {{have to take your}} word, for I'm {{not going to give you}} away before <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> that you won't try that foolishness--you know what I mean--before I see you again. Can I trust you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{shuffling}} step of {{the stewardess}} was heard slowly approaching. [...] "Yes," [...] continued Jack abruptly, lightly lifting his voice as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> opened the door,--"yes, if you'd only had some of those spearmint drops of your aunt Rachel's that she always gave you when these fits came on you'd have been all right inside of five minutes. Aunty was no slouch of a doctor, was she? Dear me, it only seems yesterday since I saw her. You were just playing round her knee like a kitten on the back porch. How time does fly! But here's <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> coming to take you in. Now rouse up, Sophy, and just hook yourself on to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> on that side, and we'll toddle along." ...|$|E
60|$|Bellum lacteum: or, The milky battle, fought {{between the}} Dean {{and the crew}} of Quilca; the latter insisting on their {{privilege}} of not milking till eleven in the forenoon; whereas <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> wanted milk at eight for her health. In this battle the Dean got the victory; but the crew of Quilca begin to rebel again; for it is this day almost ten o'clock, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> hath not got her milk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! here's May Punt!" [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{and a small}} woman {{dressed in}} the {{borrowed}} mourning of a large woman and leading a very small long-haired observant little boy--it was his first funeral--appeared, closely followed by several friends of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{who had come to}} swell the display of respect and made only vague, confused impressions upon Mr. Polly's mind. (Aunt Mildred, who was an unexplained family scandal, had declined Mrs. Johnson's hospitality.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's Aunt Larkins," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> as {{an elderly}} and stouter {{edition of the}} three young women {{appeared}} in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|He was distraught at supper. Afterwards, when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{had gone}} to bed with a slight headache, he opened a {{conversation}} with Johnson.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{accepted}} Philippa's {{hand and}} the inevitable. Her good-by to Lessingham was most affable. She walked up the road with the vicar.|$|E

60|$|Jack {{shuddered and}} glanced quickly round. But luckily no one heard this {{crushing}} sentimentalism, {{and the next}} moment the door closed upon her and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{does not}} look so much like Sophy's old nurse as she used to," [...] remarked the second, {{following}} his example. Still Jack remained unmoved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, O' Man?" [...] said Johnson, when Mr. Polly {{came down}} to breakfast, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> looked up brightly. Mr. Polly had never felt breakfast so unattractive before.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> made {{a strange}} noise, half chuckle and half death-rattle, in her throat. [...] "All wrong, sah. Hippy's off again; and I've {{been all over}} the city after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll {{have to be}} {{a walking}} party," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> cheerfully. [...] "There's only two coaches. I daresay we can put in six in each, but that leaves three over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's not hating them now," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "you may {{be sure of}} that. It's {{just because}} of that I {{think they ought to}} come--all of them--even your Aunt Mildred." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{made every}} preparation, {{and on the}} eve of our {{departure}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> went into the city to engage her son's passage to Bangor, while we awaited her return in untroubled security.|$|E
6000|$|Things crowded upon Mr. Polly. Everyone, he noticed, took sherry with {{a solemn}} avidity, {{and a small}} portion even was {{administered}} sacramentally to the Punt boy. There followed a distribution of black kid gloves, and much trying on and humouring of fingers. [...] "Good gloves," [...] said one of Mrs. Johnson's friends. [...] "There's a little pair there for Willie," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> triumphantly. Everyone seemed gravely content with the amazing procedure of the occasion. Presently Mr. Podger was picking Mr. Polly out as Chief Mourner to go with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Mrs. Larkins and Annie in the first mourning carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope everyone'll take a {{glass of}} sherry and a biscuit," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson.</b> [...] "We don't stand on ceremony," [...] and a {{decanter}} appeared {{in the place of}} Uncle Pentstemon's vegetables.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dingley and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> say, truly {{they don't}} {{care for your}} wife's company, though they like your wine; but they had rather have it at their own house to drink in quiet.|$|E
60|$|Lady Cranston's {{guests were}} all {{conscious}} {{of a little}} indefinable disappointment. The gossip concerning this stranger's appearance in Dreymarsh was practically strangled. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> however, fired a parting shot as she rose to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Walk up! walk up!" [...] he cries, [...] "we {{are going}} to pretend that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> is a princess, and old man Johnson is going {{to pretend to be}} a pirate. Walk up, walk up, and be in time!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} to the fence, and stood with his hands on it staring away at nothing. He stayed there for what seemed a long time. From the house came a sound of raised voices that subsided, and then <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> calling for Bessie.|$|E
6000|$|... 1 This letter, {{the first}} of the series {{published}} by Hawkesworth, of which we have the originals (see Preface), was addressed [...] "To <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> at her Lodgings over against St. Mary's Church, near Capell Street, Dublin, Ireland"; and was endorsed by her [...] "Recd.

6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Dr. William Tisdall, a clergyman in {{the north}} of Ireland, who had paid his {{addresses}} to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson.</b> He is several times mentioned in the Journal to Stella, and is {{not to be confused with}} another Tisdall or Tisdell, whom Swift knew in London, also mentioned in the Journal.--W.

60|$|Mrs. Dingley[47] full of {{cares for}} herself, and blunders and {{negligence}} for her friends. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Johnson</b> sick and helpless.
