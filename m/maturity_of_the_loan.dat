50|$|Mortgage borrowers can be {{individuals}} mortgaging {{their home}} {{or they can}} be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made {{either directly or indirectly}} through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full first.|$|E
50|$|Royalties are {{contractual}} obligations of the Issuer of the royalty, {{made for the}} benefit of the holder of the royalty. Royalties require the payment of an agreed percentage of revenue of the Issuer, for an agreed period of time. In the event a royalty is purchased from an Issuer, the future revenue upon which the royalty is based is unknown at the time of the original transaction. Therefore, the cumulative amount of the future royalty payments is also an unknown. Royalty payments are not interest and royalties expire without value at their maturity. To be usurious payments made and received for the use of funds must be considered interest for loaned funds which require repayment at the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan.</b> The value in gains by the use of the royalty should equal its payment value, excess cost or interest beyond its tangible value is illicit interest or usury.|$|E

Large loans relative to home value are perceived as riskier, as are loans with large mortgage payments relative to income and loans linked to investment vehicles. Homeowners with riskier mortgages indicated that they could encounter financial problems should house prices or their income decline.

More sophisticated borrowers knew to look for the APR figure and were less susceptible to deflecting attention away from this term, but irresponsible lenders were still able to deceive even these relatively sophisticated borrowers by structuring loans with more hidden charges such as a “prepayment charge” (a charge, which can run into thousands <b>of</b> dollars, that <b>the</b> borrower is obligated to pay if the borrower pays off <b>the</b> principal balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> prior to <b>the</b> <b>maturity</b> date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan).</b> <b>The</b> lender or mortgage broker could then employ <b>the</b> same technique <b>of</b> diverting attention away from these fees by pointing out the favorable APR figure and deflecting attention away from the prepayment charge.|$|R

40|$|Syndicated {{loans are}} very {{important}} tools for financing investments of firms in a country and consequently {{for the development of}} the country as a whole. The emerging markets like ASEAN poses significantly high information asymmetry problem compared to Europe and United States, so that research on syndicated loans in this region is very necessary and important. This necessity also arises from the very promising growth and economic potential of the ASEAN region. The research uses Logit regression model to determine whether the loan size, loan maturity, public status of companies, secured loans, and country risks could affect the decision of the lead arranger to syndicate the loan in the ASEAN region over the period 2006 - 2010. Robustness check that uses the Probit regression model were performed to check the efficiency of the results. It was found that the lead arranger tends to syndicate the loans when the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> is shorter, the loan is secured, and the country risk is higher. The size of the loan and the public company status has insignificant effects to the decision of the lead arranger to syndicate the loan.

This contradicts with the findings in the United States and Europe market as developed countries.

40|$|Banks {{have always}} been the primary finance methods for shipowners. However, after the finance crisis in the end of 2007, the {{offshore}} market, similar to international shipping community, has experienced tighter credit facilities from the banks. Banks have become focused on maintaining existing clients; hence the shipowners that are not well-established have been struggling to get bank finance. In addition, new financial regulatory standards like the BASEL III have been introduced. This has increased the total capital requirements to 10. 5 - 18. 0 per cent, up from 8 per cent, providing a further limit in accessing bank loans. This has resulted in higher prices on the bank finance. Thus, this study has identified how Norwegian shipowners have handled the increasing prices and their expectations for the future. In order to answer the aims and objectives in this study, a quantitative analysis was conducted of the Oslo Børs listed shipowers, and their stock exchange notification when taken delivery of new vessels. To support this analysis, different stakeholders in the Norwegian offshore market was interviewed through semi-structured interviews. The stakeholders was from three different industries within the offshore market; shipowners, banks and shipbrokers. This study revealed that the Norwegian shipowers had used eight different methods to finance their new vessels in the time period from 2008 to 2013. Of these the Norwegian Export Credit Agency is the most used method. This method has financed 60 per cent of the new delivered vessel in the period. Bank loans have in the same period only financed 11 per cent. Alternative methods such as bond issuing and sale and leaseback agreements amount for 12 per cent. From the study it can be concluded that bank finance will return to be more important in the future than it has been the last years. However, this will depend on how the new regulations affect the banks. Further, the banks have reduced the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> and the borrowing limit. The shipowners are therefore forced to get the needed capital from other sources. Consequently, the use of alternative methods will increase in the future...|$|E
