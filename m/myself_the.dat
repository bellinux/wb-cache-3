5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed <b>myself</b> <b>the</b> equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E

25|$|When I grew {{up there}} weren't many other guitarists... There was one other guitarist {{in my school}} who {{actually}} showed me the first chords that I learned and I went on from there.

25|$|Early in {{his college}} years, {{probably}} {{during the spring}} of 1854 while Ludlow was still at Princeton, his medical curiosity drew him to visit his “friend Anderson the apothecary” regularly. During these visits, Ludlow “made upon <b>myself</b> <b>the</b> trial of the effects of every strange drug and chemical which the laboratory could produce.” A few months before, Bayard Taylor’s Putnam’s Magazine article The Vision of Hasheesh had been devoured by Ludlow, and so when the cannabis-based tetanus remedy called Tilden’s extract came out he had to try some.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For <b>myself,</b> <b>the</b> experience was invigorating. It {{made it possible to}} dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse <b>myself</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E

25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to <b>myself</b> <b>the</b> act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

500|$|Messiaen wrote a {{large body}} of music for the piano. Although a {{considerable}} pianist himself, he was undoubtedly assisted by Yvonne Loriod's formidable piano technique and ability to convey complex rhythms and rhythmic combinations; in his piano writing from Visions de l'Amen onwards he had her in mind. Messiaen said, [...] "I am able to allow <b>myself</b> <b>the</b> greatest eccentricities because to her anything is possible." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{is a song}} by American R singer Usher. It was {{released}} on February 22, 2012, by RCA Records as the lead single from 2012 studio album Looking 4 <b>Myself.</b> <b>The</b> song was written by Usher, Ariel Rechtshaid, Redd Stylez, and Diplo, who also produced the song. Usher and Diplo worked on the song for two months {{as part of their}} collaboration for the former's album. The song is a quiet storm slow jam with electronic influences, and lyrics about the turning point of a relationship. According to Usher, the song is primarily about the complications of a relationship, despite the lyrics' sexual overtones.|$|E
500|$|... "Euphoria" [...] is a dance-pop and euro-trance song which [...] "include the DJs' glimmering synths while Usher croons in his coolly-controlled falsetto."

Upon the release of Looking 4 <b>Myself,</b> <b>the</b> song debuted at number 60 on the South Korea Gaon International Chart, with sales of 6,029 digital copies. This song appears as DLC along with [...] "Twisted" [...] in Dance Central 3 with choreography from both Usher and his choreographer Aakomon “AJ” Jones.|$|E
500|$|Ornstein's {{follow-up}} performance {{provoked a}} near-riot: [...] "At my second concert, devoted {{to my own}} compositions, I might have played anything. I couldn't hear the piano <b>myself.</b> <b>The</b> crowd whistled and howled and even threw handy missiles on the stage." [...] The reaction, however, {{was by no means}} universally negative—the Musical Standard called him [...] "one of the most remarkable composers of the day... that germ of realism and humanity which is indicative of genius." [...] By the next year, he was the talk of the American music scene for his performances of cutting-edge works by Schoenberg, Scriabin, Bartók, Debussy, Kodály, Ravel, and Stravinsky (many of them U.S. premieres), as well as his own, even more radical compositions.|$|E

Director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel was asked about using Arri Alexa-M cameras; he said, [...] "For Bryan and <b>myself,</b> <b>the</b> Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, 2012 Japanese {{multinational}} conglomerate Sony revealed their Q1 {{earnings for}} the year, with Looking 4 Myself largely contributing to the companies $92 million in revenue for the music sector. In an interview with singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger by Rap-Up, the former explained that he, along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Brian Alexander Morgan, were working on Usher's next album. Bellinger compared the album's music to Usher's Confessions (2004), {{saying that it is}} [...] "more R, more urban" [...] than Usher's Looking 4 <b>Myself.</b> <b>The</b> latter declared that his next album would show that he is [...] "still Usher". The singer's eighth studio album, entitled UR (2014), had its lead single—"Good Kisser"—released on May 5, 2014 through digital download.|$|E
500|$|... "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] {{was based}} on a real-life event: lead singer Gaz Coombes' arrest and caution for {{possession}} of cannabis at age fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting <b>myself.</b> <b>The</b> song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E
