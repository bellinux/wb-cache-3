50|$|Together {{with their}} Afghan {{partners}} the 5 RAR battle group achieved relatively good success against the insurgents in Uruzgan {{in a range}} of deliberate clearances, strike operations, and framework activities that resulted in the recovery or capture of weapons, ammunition, enemy combatants, and the like. Perhaps most importantly, these operations assisted the Afghans to exert influence in areas where the army or police presence had been contested or where it had not previously existed. Members of 5 RAR engaged in battle with the enemy on a regular basis in contacts ranging from only a number of minutes to several hours and involving direct fire, indirect fire and improvised explosive devices. All three mortar sections fired in anger supporting troops in contact, and U.S. artillery and close air support were also utilised. MTF-2 suffered three fatalities during the tour. Corporal Richard Atkinson, an engineer from 1st Combat Engineer Regiment (1 CER) attached to CT-C was killed by an IED on 2 February 2011. Sapper Jamie Larcombe, an engineer from the 1 CER attached to CT-B, was killed by small arms fire on 19 February 2011. Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, a cook from 9th Force Support Battalion attached to CT-D as a cook at Combat Outpost Mashal was murdered by a rogue Afghan National Army soldier on 30 May 2011. In addition another nine members of MTF-2 were wounded during the deployment, a number of them seriously. 5 RAR completed its mission as the <b>mounting</b> <b>unit</b> of MTF-2 in June 2011, handing over to MTF-3, a battle group led by 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm for automated generation of multi-parted airplane wings from a cross-section {{given by a}} point cloud and the top view of the wing. The relative thickness of the wing (thickness/chord) can be varied from section to section. A rounded tip with two design parameters and GC 1 -continuity at the crossing to the wing is automatically computed. Constrained approximation and fairing lead to a very smooth geometry especially suited for wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulation. A <b>mounting</b> <b>unit</b> with GC 1 fillets to the wing and a simplified half of a fuselage are computed, too. The geometries of those can be modified by changing only a few significant parameters...|$|E
40|$|A flat <b>mounting</b> <b>unit</b> with {{electronically}} variable {{thermal resistance}} [1] {{has been presented}} {{in the last year}} [2]. The design was based on a Peltier cell and the appropriate control electronics and software. The device is devoted especially to the thermal characterization of packages, e. g. in dual cold plate arrangements. Although this design meets the requirements of the static measurement we are intended to improve its parameters as the settling time and dynamic thermal impedance and the range of realized thermal resistance. The new design applies the heat flux sensor developed by our team as well [3], making easier the control of the device. This development allows even the realization of negative thermal resistances.

40|$|Basing on the {{damaging}} statistics obtained {{during the}} on-site inspections of industrial multi-span building structures with under-crane secondary trusses which have continuous lower plinth, we simulated the scenario {{of the most}} likely damage development of under-crane secondary trusses. The first scenario {{is the development of}} cracks along the total cross section of plinth. In the process of calculations we defined a real deformation scheme of plinth of under-crane secondary trusses with damage and its stress condition. The second scenario is the destruction of a support or support <b>mounting</b> <b>unit</b> to the lower plinth of under-crane secondary trusses. The destruction of this kind can occur {{as a result of a}} crack in a support or as a result of destruction of high-strength fasteners of a support to plinth. We discovered that a system with such damage is geometrically unchanged; there is no possibility of sudden destruction of both the under-crane secondary trusses and the entire building frame. The third scenario is the upper plinth separation from one of the walls of lower plinth of under-crane secondary trusses. The scenario is developed to define the viability of under-crane secondary trusses as a result of cracks in the area of wall junction with the upper shelf of lower plinth, their further development and the appearance of discrete cracks developing into a backbone along the entire span length of under-crane secondary trusses. Based on the calculations of the stress strain state of under-crane secondary trusses with damages in the emergency nature in a separate span of the lower plinth and a truss member, we estimated the viability of structure. The analysis of viability limits makes it possible to find the measures of collapse preventing and avoid possible victims...|$|E
40|$|In {{sounding}} rocket experiment CLASP, I have placed a slit a mirrorfinished around {{the focal point}} of the telescope. The light reflected by the mirror surface surrounding the slit is then imaged in Slitjaw optical system, to obtain the alpharay Lyman secondary image. This image, not only to use the realtime image in rocket flight rocket oriented direction selection, and also used as a scientific data showing the spatial structure of the Lyman alpha emission line intensity distribution and solar chromosphere around the observation area of the polarimetric spectroscope. Slitjaw optical system is a two offaxis mirror unit part including a parabolic mirror and folding mirror, Lyman alpha transmission filter, the optical system magnification 1 x consisting camera. The camera is supplied from the United States, and the other was carried out fabrication and testing in all the Japanese side. Slitjaw optical system, it is difficult to access the structure, it is necessary to install the low place clearance. Therefore, influence the optical performance, the fine adjustment is necessary optical elements are collectively in the form of the mirror unit. On the other hand, due to the alignment of the solar sensor in the US launch site, must be removed once the Lyman alpha transmission filter holder including a filter has a different part from the mirror unit. In order to make the structure simple, stray light measures Aru to concentrate around Lyman alpha transmission filter. To overcome the difficulties of performing optical alignment in Lyman alpha wavelength absorbed by the atmosphere, it was planned following four steps in order to reduce standing time alignment me. 1 : is measured in advance refractive index at Lyman alpha wavelength of Lyman alpha transmission filter (121. 567 nm), to prepare a visible light Firuwo having the same optical path length in the visible light (630 nm). 2 : The mirror structure CLASP before <b>mounting</b> <b>unit</b> standing, dummy slit and camera standing prescribed position in leading frame is, to complete the internal alignment adjustment. 3 : CLASP structure F mirror unit and by attaching the visible light filter, as will plague the focus is carried out in standing position adjustment visible flight products camera. 4 : Replace the Lyman alpha transmission filter, it is confirmed by Lyman alpha wavelength (under vacuum) the requested optical performance have come. Currently, up to 3 of the steps completed, it was confirmed in the visible light optical performance that satisfies the required value sufficiently extended. Also, put in Slitjaw optical system the sunlight through the telescope of CLASP, it is also confirmed that and that stray light rejection no vignetting is in the field of view meets request standing...|$|E
