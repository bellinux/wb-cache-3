40|$|Abstract—This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} poly(dimethyl-siloxane) (PDMS), polyurethane (PU), epoxy, and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as <b>mandrils</b> to fabricate metallic heat exchangers having 300 – 700 m internal channels. The <b>mandrils</b> were prepared using two soft lithographic techniques-replica molding, and microembossing. To fabricate the heat exchangers, the polymeric <b>mandrils</b> were coated with {{a thin layer of}} metal by thermal evaporation or sputtering; this layer acted as the cathode for electrodeposition of a shell of nickel or copper that was 100 m thick. The polymers were removed by burning them out at 400 C in air, or by dissolving them with a tetrahydrofuran solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride. Studies of heat dissipation showed that the nickel heat exchangers with features that range in size from 150 – 750 m have thermal resistances ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 12 2 C W 1 cm at flow rates of water of 20 L h 1 and pressures of 8. 6 – 83 103 N m 2.

5000|$|By {{the fourth}} {{game in the}} series, Escape from Monkey Island, LeChuck has been freed from his icy prison by Ozzie Mandrill, an Australian capitalist. LeChuck sympathises with <b>Mandril's</b> hatred of pirates and assists his efforts to gentrify the Caribbean {{through the use of}} a voodoo talisman, the Ultimate Insult—LeChuck wants to use the talisman on Elaine to make her his obedient wife. Due to her long absence from Mêlée Island, Elaine has been {{declared}} dead and the position of governor of the Tri-Island Area is opened for election. LeChuck assumes the guise of [...] "Charles L. Charles" [...] and defeats Elaine in the election: the townspeople, feeling neglected by Elaine's long absence, do not believe her efforts to convince them of Charles' true nature. Now in control of Mêlée Island, Mandrill and LeChuck acquire the Ultimate Insult and maroon Guybrush on Monkey Island. However, while on Monkey Island, Guybrush discovers that resident castaway Herman Toothrot is actually Elaine's presumed dead grandfather Horatio Marley; the two escape {{through the use of a}} large robot monkey and disable the apparatus needed to project the Ultimate Insult across the whole Caribbean. LeChuck loses patience and uses his voodoo powers to inhabit a giant statue of himself he has had built on the island, with the intent of using the statue to personally crush all resistance to his rise to power, but is brought to heel when Mandrill exposes him to the Ultimate Insult. Guybrush's monkey robot and LeChuck's statue engage in Monkey Kombat. Eventually, LeChuck grows exasperated and crushes Mandrill and the Ultimate Insult, the side effect of which destroys his statue.|$|R

5000|$|The show {{featured}} many fictional guests, usually {{interviewed by}} Casper Christensen in an [...] "absurd talkshow" [...] style. They were usually {{played by the}} <b>Mandril</b> crew. While many characters appeared only once, some would re-appear in many episodes.|$|E
60|$|But {{while this}} cause {{accepted}} by these few {{is a true}} cause, since unquestionably during {{the life of the}} individual organism changes of function produce changes of structure; and while it is a tenable hypothesis that changes of structure so produced are inheritable; yet it was manifest to those not prepossessed, that this cause cannot with reason be assigned for the greater part of the facts. Though in plants there are some characters which may not irrationally be ascribed to the direct effects of modified functions consequent on modified circumstances, yet the majority of the traits presented by plants are not to be thus explained. It is impossible that the thorns by which a briar is in large measure defended against browsing animals, can have been developed and moulded by the continuous exercise of their protective actions; for in the first place, the great majority of the thorns are never touched at all, and, in the second place, we have no ground whatever for supposing that those which are touched are thereby made to grow, and to take those shapes which render them efficient. Plants which are rendered uneatable by the thick woolly coatings of their leaves, cannot have had these coatings produced by any process of reaction against the action of enemies; for there is no imaginable reason why, if one part of a plant is eaten, the rest should thereafter begin to develop the hairs on its surface. By what direct effect of function on structure, can the shell of a nut have been evolved? Or how can those seeds which contain essential oils, rendering them unpalatable to birds, have been made to secrete such essential oils by these actions of birds which they restrain? Or how can the delicate plumes borne by some seeds, and giving the wind power to waft them to new stations, be due to any immediate influences of surrounding conditions? Clearly in these and in countless other cases, change of structure cannot have been directly caused by change of function. So is it with animals to a large extent, if not to the same extent. Though we have proof that by rough usage the dermal layer may be so excited as to produce a greatly thickened epidermal layer, sometimes quite horny; and though it is a feasible hypothesis that an effect of this kind persistently produced may be inherited; yet no such cause can explain the carapace of the turtle, the armour of the armadillo, or the imbricated covering of the manis. The skins of these animals are no more exposed to habitual hard usage than are those of animals covered by hair. The strange excrescences which distinguish the heads of the hornbills, cannot possibly have arisen from any reaction against the action of surrounding forces; for even were they clearly protective, {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the heads of these birds need protection more than the heads of other birds. If, led by the evidence that in animals the amount of covering is in some cases affected by the degree of exposure, it were admitted as imaginable that the development of feathers from preceding dermal growths had resulted from that extra nutrition caused by extra superficial circulation, we should still be without explanation of the structure of a feather. Nor should we have any clue to the specialities of feathers--the crests of various birds, the tails sometimes so enormous, the curiously placed plumes of the bird of paradise, &c., &c. Still more obviously impossible is it to explain as due to use or disuse the colours of animals. No direct adaptation to function could have produced the blue protuberances on a <b>mandril's</b> face, or the striped hide of a tiger, or the gorgeous plumage of a kingfisher, or the eyes in a peacock's tail, or the multitudinous patterns of insects' wings. One single case, that of a deer's horns, might alone have sufficed to show how insufficient was the assigned cause. During their growth, a deer's horns are not used at all; and when, having been cleared of the dead skin and dried-up blood-vessels covering them, they are ready for use, they are nerveless and non-vascular, and hence are incapable of undergoing any changes of structure consequent on changes of function.|$|R

40|$|The {{inadequacy}} of conventional synthetic grafts {{has led to}} efforts to construct a superior vascular graft. In vivo tissue engineering is one approach to this problem that has been investigated {{for half a century}} and enables the construction of autogenous vascular prostheses. Three types of in vivo engineering are explored: remodelling of implanted scaffolds, fibrocollagenous tubes, and the artificial artery generated in the peritoneal cavity. Scaffolds designed to be remodelled may be synthetic or biological and have been remodelled in animal models to form vasoactive neoarteries with arterial morphology. The differences in vascular remodelling ability, particularly spontaneous endothelialisation, between animal models and humans may impair the effectiveness of this approach in the clinic.

40|$|Do planejamento à execução da prótese mucosa-dento-suportada, a {{literatura}} apresenta trabalhos que aponta m as dificuldades do desempenho de uma prótese que se relaciona com tecidos de comportamentos distintos, dente e fibromucosa. Estes trabalhos abordam os problemas biomecânicos e os prejuízos que sofrem o osso e os dentes, sob pressão, durante a mastigação, bem como as dificuldades de distribuição das cargas sobre os tecidos bucais no movimento ocluso-gengival. Porém, essa prótese também sofre forças de tração, por diversas situações clínicas, as quais levam a sela a se deslocar da fibromucosa num movimento gêngivo-oclusal. O objeto desta pesquisa foi desenvolver e testar, em laboratório, um método que possibilitasse à prótese mucosa-dento-suportada dispor de maior retenção na região da fibromucosa, reduzindo o movimento gêngivo-oclusal, e conferindo maior estabilidade à prótese e conforto ao paciente. Para realizar o experimento, foi construída uma base acrílica modificada, correspondente à sela da prótese, com uma canaleta na região que contata a fibromucosa. Esta canaleta foi preenchida com reembasador macio para prótese, à base de silicone. Em seguida, a base foi reembasada no modelo resiliente, especialmente construído para simular a fibromucosa. Uma haste metálica foi fixada em suas extremidades, sendo uma à base acrílica, e a outra extremidade fixada ao <b>mandril</b> do equipamento utilizado para o tracionamento (Versa-Test). Estando a base posicionada sobre o modelo, foram realizados os movimentos de pressão e de tração. A avaliação dos testes foi realizada na base acrílica convencional (sem canaleta) e na base acrílica modificada, cujos valores foram registrados em newton. As bases acrílicas sobre os modelos eram imersas em óleo vegetal, devido ao necessário meio viscoso, com tensão superficial, possibilitando os fenômenos de adesão. Os resultados demonstraram que, na presença de silicone, foi necessária força de tração maior e estatisticamente significante para remover a base do modelo, em relação à base sem silicone. From {{the planning}} to {{the execution of}} the tissue-dento-supported prosthesis, the literature presents a range of works standing out the difficulties related to the prosthesis performance when facing distinctive tissues, tooth and fibromucous. These works approach the biomechanical problems and the damages suffered by osseous tissues and teeth under pressure, during the mastication, as well as the difficulties of distribution of the loads on oral tissues in the oclusal-gengival movements. However, this prosthesis also suffers traction forces, in several clinical situations, leading the saddle to move of the fibromucous in a gengival-occlusal movement. The aim of this research was to develop and to test, in a laboratory, a method to improve the tissue-dento-supported prosthesis retention in the fibromucous area reducing the gengival-occlusal movement and allowing a larger stability to the prosthesis and comfort to the patient. In order to accomplish the experiment, a modified acrylic base was confectioned, corresponding to the saddle of the prosthesis and constituted by a small channel in the fibromucous contact area. This channel was filled out with soft reliner for prosthesis, silicon composed. Afterwards, the base was rebased in the resilient model, especially confectioned to simulate the fibromucous. A metallic stem was fixed in two extremities, being one to the acrylic base, and other extremity fixed to the equipment arbor used for the traction (Versa-Test). With the base positioned on the model, the pressure movements and traction were accomplished. The evaluation of the tests was accomplished in the conventional acrylic base (without channel) and in the modified acrylic base, whose values were registered in Newton. The acrylic bases on the models were immersed in the vegetable oil, due to the necessary viscous condition, with superficial tension, making possible the adhesion phenomena. The results demonstrated that in the presence of silicon was necessary a larger and statistically significant traction force to remove the base of the model in relation to the base without silicon...|$|E

Métodos Estudo {{longitudinal}} e intervensionista, envolvendo 24 mulheres de idade igual ou superior a 60 anos freqüentadoras da Casa do Idoso e de Unidades Básicas de Saúde de Gravataí, RS. Do total de participantes, 13 estavam no grupo caso e 11 no grupo controle. Como instrumento de avaliaçãoutilizou-se o “King´s Helth Questionnaire” (KHQ) traduzido e validado, inicialmente e ao término de 12 semanas de tratamento. O grupo controle realizou 12 sessões com acupuntura, utilizando-se os pontos sugeridos pela Organização Mundial de Saúde, com agulhas de acupuntura descartáveis sendo introduzidas com <b>mandril</b> à profundidade de 1, 5 mm durante 25 minutos e sendo estimuladas por movimentos de rotação duas vezes a cada sessão. As variáveis medidas através do questionário de qualidade de vida foram analisadas utilizando-se o procedimento de comparação de médias ANOVA two-way. Considerou-se um nível de significância de 5 %. Resultados A média de idade das participantes do estudo foi de 67, 08 anos e 6, 10 de desvio padrão. O grupo da acupuntura apresentou uma melhora no escore total de qualidade de vida e incontinência urinária em relação ao grupo controle (p< 0, 0001). Considerando o desdobramento no tempo de acompanhamento de 12 semanas, observa-se diferença entre os grupos (p< 0, 0003). Alguns quesitos como: Quanto você acha que seu problema de bexiga atrapalha você? (p= 0, 0001 no grupo acupuntura); Limitação do desempenho de tarefas (p= 0, 0084 nas médias dos grupos); Limitação física e social (p= 0, 0004 nas médias e p< 0, 0001 no grupo acupuntura); Quanto eles afetam você? (p= 0, 0008 nas médias dos grupos) e, uso de protetor higiênico (p= 0, 0004 no grupo acupuntura), tiveram resultados suficientemente satisfatórios, e graças a estes bons resultados, aliados aos demais quesitos que apresentaram-se apenas clinicamente positivos, porém não significativos estatisticamente é que as médias do escore total tiveram resultado positivo (p= 0, 0003). Conclusões O estudo demonstrou que a acupuntura melhorou os sintomas de incontinência urinária no período de 12 semanas e, consequentemente, melhorou a qualidade de vida das mulheres idosas, sendo os resultados demonstrados positivamente pelos escores obtidos no KHQ. This {{project is}} meant to verify the use of acupuncture on the treatment for urinary incontinence in socially active elderly women.

The "King’s Health Questionnaire" (KHQ) has been adopted as the evaluation tool at the beginning {{and at the end of}} a 12 -week treatment. The KHQ has been translated and validated. The control group went under 12 sessions with acupuncture, making use of the suggested points by the WHO, with disposable acupuncture needles being introduced with the help of a chuck to the depth of 1, 5 mm during 25 minutes being stimulated by rotating movements twice in each session. The variables measured through the life quality questionnaire have been analyzed with the two-way ANOVA procedure. Significance at a level of 5 % has been considered. Results The age average of the subjects on this study was 67, 08 years of age and XX of standard deviation. The acupuncture group has shown an improvement on the total score of life quality and urinary incontinence in relation to the control group (p< 0, 0001). Considering the period of a 12 -week observation, it is possible to notice the difference between both groups (p< 0, 0003). Some aspects like: How much do you think your bladder problem bothers you? (p= 0, 0001 in the acupuncture group); Impairment on task performance (p= 0, 0084 in the average of the groups); Physical and social limitation (p= 0, 0004 in the averages and p< 0, 0001 in the acupuncture group); How much do they affect you? (p= 0, 0008 in the average of the groups), and the use of hygienic protector (p= 0, 0004 in the acupuncture group) showed pretty satisfactory results, and because of that, in addition to other positive clinical factors found, although not significant statistically led to a positive total average score (p= 0, 0003). Conclusions This study has shown that acupuncture has improved the symptoms of urinary incontinence in a 12 -week period and, consequently, has improved the quality of life of elderly women, obtaining positive results according to the scores from the KHQ...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia QuímicaA crescente preocupação com o meio ambiente leva as empresas, nomeadamente as indústrias de tintas, a tomar medidas que reduzam as emissões de COV e os efluentes a tratar. Nesse sentido, pretende-se com este estudo substituir um esmalte de estufa de base solvente por um esmalte de estufa de base aquosa. Inserido no âmbito da disciplina dissertação/estágio do Mestrado em Engenharia Química – Tecnologias de Protecção Ambiental, o estágio decorreu nas instalações da empresa Barbot - Industria de Tintas S. A, onde foram realizados estudos e procedimentos laboratoriais com vista aos objectivos propostos. O esmalte de estufa aquoso resulta da combinação entre resinas alquidicas e melaminas ou da combinação entre resinas de poliester e resinas de melamina. Foram estudados os dois casos, bem como diferentes proporções entre resinas. As formulações utilizadas tinham por base a informação adquirida junto dos fornecedores e dos resultados que se iam obtendo. O estudo foi realizado por fases. Na primeira estudaram-se três tipos de resinas alquidicas, três tipos de resinas poliester e quatro tipos de resinas melamina. Os ensaios realizados diferiam também nas proporções entre resina alquidica ou poliester e resina melamina. Avaliaram-se as características de viscosidade, densidade, brilho e dureza, concluindo-se que a melhor combinação e de 80 % de resina alquidica para 20 % de resina melamina e 91 % de resina poliester para 9 % de resina melamina. A resina alquidica mais adequada foi a Alquidica A ou Alquidica C, a resina de poliester mais adequada foi a Poliester B e a resina melamina mais adequada foi a Melamina C ou Melamina D. Na segunda fase foi feita uma selecção dos esmaltes com base nas características de brilho e dureza. Foram seleccionados os ensaios com que se obtiveram maiores valores para estas características. Nesta fase foram realizados testes aos escorridos, as resistências químicas (a solventes, óleo lubrificante e detergentes), as resistências mecânicas (embutido, <b>mandril</b> e impacto), a resistência a quente, a aderência, a resistência ao nevoeiro salino, ao QUV (e ao QSun (equipamento para avaliação de envelhecimento acelerado), e calcularam-se os valores de PVC (Concentração de Pigmentos em Volume) e custo de materias-primas. Dos testes realizados concluiu-se que os esmaltes de estufa aquosos tem boa resistência química e mecânica, e tem muito boa aderência. São esmaltes do tipo semi-brilho de acordo com o PVC e o custo de materia-prima e de cerca de 2, 50 €/L. Finalmente procedeu-se a uma terceira fase, onde foram seleccionadas quatro formulações que reuniam um maior número de características favoráveis. Seleccionaram-se assim as combinações: 89 % resina Alquidica A para 11 % resina Melamina B; 80 % resina Alquidica A para 20 % resina Melamina D; 91 % resina Poliester B para 9 % resina Melamina C e 80 % resina Alquidica C para 20 % resina Melamina D. Tendo em conta que a selecção do produto e feita consoante as características que o cliente pretende, pode-se seleccionar um destes quatro produtos, usufruindo da sua melhor característica e tentando optimizar as restantes. The {{growing concern}} with {{environment}} leads many companies, including paints industries, {{to take measures}} that can reduce the emission of VOCs or the effluents to be treated. Considering this fact, {{the aim of the}} following study is to replace solvent-based stove enamel by aqueous stove enamel. In the frame of the subject Dissertation / Stage of the Masters in Chemical Engineering - Technologies for Environmental Protection, the work was developed at the facilities of Barbot - Paint Industry SA, where there were carried laboratorial studies and procedures with a view on the proposed objectives. Aqueous stove enamel results from the combination of alkyd resins and melamine or from the combination of polyester resins and melamine resins. Both cases were studied as well as their different ratios. The formulations used were based on the information obtained from the suppliers and from the results that were produced. The study was conducted in different stages. In the first stage, it was studied three kinds of alkyd resins, three kinds of polyester resins and four kinds of melamine resins. The tests also differed in terms of the proportions between alkyd resin or polyester resin and melamine resin. It was evaluated their viscosity, density, brightness and hardness. The study found that the best combination is 80 % of alkyd resin to 20 % of melamine resin and 91 % of polyester resins to 9 % of melamine resin. It was concluded that the most appropriate alkyd resin were the alkyd A or alkyd C, the most appropriate polyester resin was polyester B and the most appropriate melamine resin were melamine C or melamine D. In the second stage, there was made a selection of enamels where the tests that showed best results in brightness and hardness were selected. At this stage there were made several tests to understand the performance of each enamel selected. Therefore, it was made sagging test, and tests to chemical resistance (solvents, lubricating oil and detergents) and to mechanical resistances (inlay, chuck and impact). The resistance when hot, adherence, salty fog resistance and solar radiation exposure (QUV and the QSUN) was also made. Then there were calculated the values of PVC and cost. Based on these tests, it was concluded that the aqueous stove enamels have good chemical and mechanical resistance and very good adhesion. They are enamels of the kind of semi-gloss according to the PVC and the cost of formulation is about 2. 50 €/L. In the end, we proceeded to the third stage where they were selected four tests that met the highest number of favorable characteristics. The combinations were selected as follow: 89 % Alkyd resin A to 11 % Melamine resin B (Test 4); 80 % Alkyd resin A to Melamine resin D (Test 11); 91 % Polyester resin B to 9 % Melamine resin C (Test 17) and 80 % Alkyd resin C to 20 % Melamine resin D (Test 20). Considering that the product selection is made according to what the client wants, we can choose one of these four products making use of their best characteristic and trying to improve the others...|$|E
