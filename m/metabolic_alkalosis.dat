5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with <b>metabolic</b> <b>alkalosis</b> and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E

40|$|Stewart’s {{quantitative}} physical chemical approach {{enables us}} to understand the acid–base properties of intravenous fluids. In Stewart’s analysis, the three independent acid–base variables are partial CO 2 tension, the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acid (ATOT), and the strong ion difference (SID). Raising and lowering ATOT while holding SID constant cause <b>metabolic</b> acidosis and <b>alkalosis,</b> respectively. Lowering and raising plasma SID while clamping ATOT cause <b>metabolic</b> acidosis and <b>alkalosis,</b> respectively. Fluid infusion causes acid–base effects by forcing extracellular SID and ATOT toward the SID and ATOT of the administered fluid. Thus, fluids with vastly differing pH can have the same acid–base effects. The stimulus is strongest when large volumes are administered, as in correction of hypovolaemia, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Zer...|$|R

25|$|Hyponatraemia is {{an almost}} {{universal}} finding due to water retention and a shift in intracellular sodium transport from inhibition of Na/K ATPase. Hypoglycaemia (due to depleted hepatic glycogen store and hyperinsulinaemia), hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia and <b>Metabolic</b> <b>alkalosis</b> are often present, independent of renal function. Lactic acidosis occurs predominantly in paracetomol (also known as acetaminophen) overdose.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide is {{injected}} either intramuscularly or intravenously, usually 0.5-1.0mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, {{it can cause}} dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including loss of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a <b>metabolic</b> <b>alkalosis</b> due to hypochloremia and hypokalemia. The drug should, therefore, {{not be used in}} horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory <b>metabolic</b> <b>alkalosis.</b> The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E

50|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} had potentially serious consequences, sometimes {{leading to}} significant morbidity and death. Patients with mild intoxication frequently have nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, ringing in the ears, and dizziness.

30|$|As for toxicity/risk of citrate accumulation, Chadha et al.

The risks in terms of biochemical values (<b>metabolic</b> acidosis or <b>alkalosis,</b> hypocalcemia) should be known and closely monitored using point-of-care testing. Concentrated citrate increases the risk of citrate toxicity [93], whereas lower concentrations may increase effluent flow rate to above recommended values [94]. These risks {{must be taken into account}} when choosing the concentration of citrate solution, which varies between suppliers, whence the need for specialist medical expertise.|$|R
25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is {{hyperplastic}} and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and <b>metabolic</b> <b>alkalosis.</b> These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.|$|E

An AS bolus injection of 10  mg/kg improved the survival rate, but a 20  mg/kg AS bolus injection did not because <b>metabolic</b> and respiratory <b>alkalosis</b> developed in the 20  mg kg AS group more severely than in the 10  mg/kg AS group (Additional file 15 : Fig. S 6).

2500|$|Liddle {{syndrome}} is generally caused by mutations in the PY motif or truncation of the C-terminus including {{loss of the}} PY motif in the β or γ ENaC subunits. [...] Even {{though there is a}} PY motif also in the α subunit, so far Liddle disease has not observed in association with a mutation in the α subunit. Liddle {{syndrome is}} inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with a phenotype that includes early onset hypertension, <b>metabolic</b> <b>alkalosis</b> and low levels of plasma renin activity and mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone. In the absence of a recognizable PY motif, ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 cannot bind to the ENaC subunit and hence cannot attach a ubiquitin to it. Consequently, proteolysis of ENaC by proteasome is inhibited and ENaC accumulates in the membrane leading to enhanced activity of ENaC that causes hypertension.|$|E

30|$|The {{survival}} {{rate of the}} CS-only group was 0 % (0 / 10) 48  h after reperfusion.

The increase in mortality in the C- 20 AS-one group compared {{to that in the}} C- 10 AS-one group was caused by the development of significant <b>metabolic</b> and respiratory <b>alkalosis</b> in the former group (Additional file 2 : Table S 1). Moreover, the mean blood pressure (MBP) of the C- 10 AS-one group was more stabilized than that of the CS-only group 1 and 3  h after reperfusion (Additional file 3 : Fig. S 2). Therefore, we used 10  mg/kg AS-containing saline in CS rats in further studies.|$|R
30|$|Some {{observations}} and {{conclusions of the}} study must be considered with caution. Although the authors claim a dramatic improvement in survival in AS-IV-treated animals, mortality is still 60 %. Expression of heme oxygenase- 1 which mediates protection against myoglobin toxicity does not markedly differ between animals treated with either saline alone or saline plus AS-IV at 6 and 24  h of reperfusion. The increased mortality associated with significant and unexplained <b>metabolic</b> and respiratory <b>alkalosis</b> in animals that received a 20  mg/kg AS-IV bolus injection is cumbersome. Finally, suggesting a relationship between improved immunosuppression and an excessive inflammatory response following resuscitation with AS-IV is very speculative. Concomitant pro- and anti-inflammatory activity is complex, patient-related, and varies over time. Interpreting or manipulating post-insult immunosuppression definitely requires more insight in metabolic or endocrine pathways, neutrophil and macrophage behavior, epigenetic reprogramming, myeloid-derived suppressor cell activity, and processes of apoptotic and/or autophagic cellular “housekeeping” [10].|$|R

40|$|Metabolism {{of blood}} glucose by the intact {{functioning}} kidney of the dog.

Correcting the apparent 14 CO 2 produced in the kidney from glucose for the 14 CO 2 produced from lactate yields that produced directly from glucose. Differences in production of CO 2 from glucose in chronic <b>metabolic</b> acidosis and <b>alkalosis</b> are small and probably are not significant.

40|$|The close {{relationship}} of muscle composition to the electrolyte pattern of extracellular fluid {{was described by}} Darrow (1) and confirmed by others (2).

In these states serum pH varies inversely with serum bicarbonate concentration or serum pCO 2, in contrast to metabolic disturb-ances in which serum pH varies directly with se-rum bicarbonate concentration and serum pCO 2. Thus, by the study of tissue composition in re-spiratory disturbances, it can be established whether muscle composition is related under all circumstances to serum pH, serum bicarbonate concentration or serum pCO 2.

30|$|There is {{a central}} {{question}} {{of great interest to}} neurointensivists. Namely, does hyperosmolar therapy by altering serum sodium concentration improve neurological outcomes after TBI? There is a clear paradox here that highlights a gap in the literature. On one hand, hyperosmolar therapy from mannitol or HTS has a strong biologic rationale and lowers ICP in randomised studies [12, 15 – 17, 36]. On the other hand, this systematic review raises concerns of hypernatremia, an endpoint for HTS therapy [21]. Authors have expressed concerns using HTS given the small size and nonrandomised nature of the available literature [22]. The dose, duration, and serum sodium target of the intervention remains unclear. Furthermore, HTS and mannitol have serious adverse effects on their own. Mannitol administration can lead to renal failure, <b>metabolic</b> derangements (hypochloremic <b>alkalosis),</b> and rebound increases in ICP. HTS can lead to volume expansion, heart failure, and hyperchloremic acidosis [12]. Although further observational studies may help to delineate a role for hypernatremia for the management of patients with TBI, whether or not a causality link exists with the use of therapies aiming to target high levels of natremia will need to be established.|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{bicarbonate}} reabsorption (JHCO 3) by {{in vitro}} initial collecting tubules (ICT) from aquatic- and land-phase Ambystoma tigrinum was measured.

JHCO 3 was abolished when ICT from aquatic animals were perfused with solutions equilibrated with 1 % CO 2 and returned toward the control value when 3 % CO 2 was reintroduced. The effect of plasma CO 2 partial pressure on JHCO 3 of the ICT may explain, at least in part, the observed difference in plasma bicarbonate of the aquatic- and land-phase animals. JHCO 3 was reduced to 22 % of control with amiloride and to 42 % of control when a Na+-free perfusate was used, but was insensitive to ethoxzolamide.
