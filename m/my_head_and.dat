5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff out of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about {{the right amount of}} blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love. I had 10 kilos of hair on <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> special contact lenses and a manicure that prevented me from eating with my fingers, and gaffer tape around my waist and high clogs so I couldn't walk easily".|$|E
500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E

Growing up, {{his parents}} {{took him to}} First Baptist Church in Longview, but Davis {{said it was not}} until after his {{difficult}} 2010 season that he [...] "finally grasped true faith", according to Joshua Cooley. Davis says, [...] "It's not about how hard you’re working to go against the grain. It's just about surrendering every day. Give God the glory no matter what happens. After every at bat after every play, it just keeps me grounded and keeps my faith strong and keeps <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> heart in the right place." [...] He reads the Bible daily.|$|E

500|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Jocelyn Russell of Reckless carrying ammunition {{shells and}} other combat equipment was unveiled on July 26, 2013, in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, {{one day before}} the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There is a lock of her tail hair {{in the base of}} the statue. The statue's plaque includes a quote from Sergeant Harold Wadley, who served in battle alongside Sergeant Reckless: [...] "The spirit of her loneliness and her loyalty, in spite of the danger, was something else to behold. Hurting. Determined. And alone. That's the image I have imprinted in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> heart forever." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Ono {{recorded}} Between <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> <b>and</b> the Sky, {{which was}} her first album to be released as [...] "Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band" [...] since 1973's Feeling the Space. The all-new Plastic Ono Band lineup included Sean Lennon, Cornelius, and Yuka Honda. On February 16, 2010, Sean organized a concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music called [...] "We Are Plastic Ono Band", at which Yoko performed her music with Sean, Clapton, Klaus Voormann, and Jim Keltner {{for the first time}} since the 1970s. Guests including Bette Midler, Paul Simon and his son Harper, and principal members of Sonic Youth and the Scissor Sisters interpreted her songs in their own styles.|$|E
500|$|... "The Middle," [...] {{the second}} single from the album, {{includes}} a guitar solo that, according to Adkins, [...] "is {{a tribute to}} Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices". Its lyrics speak about [...] "fitting in" [...] and self-acceptance of oneself. In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. I almost didn’t bring it to the band because I was thinking to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing. I can’t just use all these sort of alyrical whoahs for this much of a song.’" ...|$|E

500|$|Diane Warren wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] in 1995. When {{asked about}} her songwriting process, she said that songs usually come to her from a title, a chorus, or a drum beat. [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it popped into <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I thought, 'I don't think I've heard that before, that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, {{because that was the}} way she heard it. She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Skipper Dan", a style {{parody of}} Weezer, was {{released}} on July 14, 2009. The song describes {{a man who has}} a fine arts degree and dreamed of pursuing an acting career, but is forced to work as a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland. Yankovic later explained in an interview with The A.V. Club that the song was [...] "a bit more poignant [...] bittersweet [...] than what I usually write." [...] He was inspired to write the song after going on a ride on the Disneyland Jungle Cruise with his family. During the cruise, one of the tour guides referred to his failed acting career. Yankovic then noted that [...] "the bells went off in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I thought, [...] "Well, here's a song right here."" ...|$|E
500|$|Mars {{started writing}} the song {{while he was}} on The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, [...] "I was just writing to write. I had my guitar with me on tour when I was in the States. I never {{finished}} it", he explained. Afterwards he got a call to provide something to the soundtrack, the singer saw some scenes of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] and thought to himself [...] "that song I started might be perfect for this". He admitted to have the tune halfway done before visualizing an early cut of the film and, inspired by its characters, put together the finishing touches. In an interview with Billboard, he went on detail [...] "I just had this melody in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> basically laid it down after I saw the film." [...] He had to watch [...] "most of the movie" [...] to feel [...] "the vibe", as well as its direction.|$|E

500|$|The film {{rights for}} The Time Traveler's Wife were optioned by Brad Pitt's {{production}} company Plan B Entertainment, {{in association with}} New Line Cinema, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked {{about the prospect of}} her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, [...] "I've got my little movie that runs in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me." [...] In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. [...] For example, The New York Times wrote that the film was an [...] "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E

500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was stupid enough to toss <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E
