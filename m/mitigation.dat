It indicates that the <b>mitigations</b> were very effective in places where applied in system on basis of their occurrences. These security metric values indicate the effectiveness of applied <b>mitigations</b> and provide comparative analysis between different <b>mitigations.</b>|$|R

Also, we found evidence of <b>mitigations</b> that increased social debt rather than the opposite. It is worth mentioning that about 40 % of the <b>mitigations</b> adopted did not yield positive outcomes and, in some cases, they made things worse. Also, over 80 % of the reported <b>mitigations</b> were generated by “BadExperience” as a malevolent effect connected to social debt (see the relation between “BadExperience” and “Mitigation” in Figure 1).|$|R
5|$|The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy {{allows a}} state to add {{unconventional}} forms of heat island <b>mitigation.</b> This can include removing pollution after {{it has already been}} emitted into air, water, or soil. These measures are not implemented into law, but they do make it possible for certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient. The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of <b>mitigation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Memory {{corruption}} vulnerabilities {{remain a}} grave threat to systems software written in C/C++. Current best practices dictate compiling programs with exploit <b>mitigations</b> such as stack canaries, address space layout randomization, and control-flow integrity. However, adversaries quickly {{find ways to}} circumvent such <b>mitigations,</b> sometimes even before these <b>mitigations</b> are widely deployed. In this paper, we focus on an "orthogonal" defense that amplifies the effectiveness of traditional exploit <b>mitigations.</b> The key idea is to create multiple diversified replicas of a vulnerable program and then execute these replicas in lockstep on identical inputs while simultaneously monitoring their behavior. A malicious input that causes the diversified replicas to diverge in their behavior will be detected by the monitor; this allows discovery of previously unknown attacks such as zero-day exploits. So far, such multi-variant execution environments (MVEEs) have been held back by substantial runtime overheads. This paper presents a new design, ReMon, that is non-intrusive, secure, and highly efficient. Whereas previous schemes either monitor every system call or none at all, our system enforces cross-checking only for security critical system calls while supporting more relaxed monitoring policies for system calls that are not security critical. We achieve this by splitting the monitoring and replication logic into an in-process component and a cross-process component. Our evaluation shows that ReMon offers same level of security as conservative MVEEs and run realistic server benchmarks at near-native speeds...|$|R
