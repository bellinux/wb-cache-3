One commissioner stated that either all religions should be allowed or no religion should be represented, but without support from the other commissioners the motion was rejected. Another commissioner stated that this petition garnered <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> any he had seen before.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which {{encompassed}} several unconventional personal relationships, received <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> her writing. After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by {{whom she had}} a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft {{died at the age}} of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E

5|$|Women in {{athletics}} often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, {{wore a black}} leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Runner Florence Griffith-Joyner mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged tights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, earning her <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> her record breaking performance in the women's 200 meters event. In the 2007 South Pacific Games, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the West Asian Games in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes {{and asked them to}} wear long shorts.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

25|$|Negative priming is {{believed}} to {{play a crucial role}} in attention and memory retrieval processes. When stimuli are perceived through the senses, all the stimuli are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own internal representation. In this perceiving process, some of the stimuli receive <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in short-term memory. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature of attention and memory.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire has a rich {{heritage}} of folk music and folk dance including particularly Long Sword dance.

It {{was not until the}} second folk revival in the 1950s that Nigel and Mary Hudleston began to attempt to redress the balance, collecting a large number of Yorkshire songs between 1958 and 1978.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a bar {{or two of}} {{consecutive}} thirds embellish {{the otherwise}} more complex toccata-occasionally {{there is a whole}} section written in that manner; and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> the rest are in fact slightly more complex.|$|E

30|$|In this study, MD are {{employed}} for embedding watermark. Note {{that it is}} not meaningful to analyze the KOA for this study, since the watermark extraction of the proposed method does not require the original image. Besides, the attacker can deduce more knowledge about the secret key from the watermarked content than from pairs of original and watermarked contents, so WOA context deserves much <b>more</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>than</b> the KOA. Thus, only the case of KMA and WOA are considered in this study. The following section will investigate if our scheme can withstand KMA and WOA.|$|R

Confirmation of such fossilized or living organisms on a nearby planet or moon could still have acute effects on individuals’ world-views and raise many ethical and practical issues.|$|E
25|$|In his 1979 book Architecture and its Interpretation, Juan Pablo Bonta {{put forward}} a theory about how {{buildings}} and architects achieve canonic status. He argued that a building and its architect achieve iconic or canonic status after a period when various critics and historians build up an interpretation that then becomes unquestioned for a significant period. If the text itself receives canonical status, then {{the status of the}} architect is further endorsed. For example, in the first edition of Siegfried Giedion's book Space Time and Architecture (1949) the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto was not mentioned at all. In the second edition he received <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> any other architect, including LeCorbusier, who until then had been understood as the most important modernist architect.|$|E

25|$|A Pew Research poll {{conducted}} August 14–17 among 1,000 adults, found stark racial and political divisions in {{reactions to the}} shooting.

The divide in public opinion was also observed across partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats (including 62% of white Democrats) believing the incident raises important issues about race that merit discussion, compared with 40% of Independents and 22% of Republicans. Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to view the police response as appropriate (43%), compared with 21% of Democrats; 65% of Republicans expressed confidence in the investigations into the incident, compared with 38% of Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In August 1955, black {{teenager}} Emmett Till {{was brutally}} murdered after reportedly flirting {{with a young}} white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi. On November 27, 1955, four days before she would make her stand on the bus, Rosa Parks attended a mass meeting at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery that addressed this case {{as well as the}} recent murders of the activists George W. Lee and Lamar Smith. The featured speaker was T. R. M. Howard, a black civil rights leader from Mississippi who headed the Regional Council of Negro Leadership. Howard brought news of the recent acquittal of the two men who had murdered Till. Parks was deeply saddened and angry at the news, particularly because Till's case had garnered much <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> any of the cases she and the Montgomery NAACP had worked on—and yet, the two men still walked free.|$|E
25|$|The second PPV {{match of}} the night carried the {{stipulation}} that {{the captain of the}} losing team (El Zorro or Charly Manson) would receive 10 lashes with a Singapore cane. The real development came after the match as the storyline of the 10 lashes received <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> the preceding match. After nearly 20 minutes of wrestling X-Pac executed his X-Factor finishing move on El Zorro twice and then pinned him. Following the loss Zorro calmly removed his shirt and then knelt down to take his punishment. X-Pac and Rocky Romero delivered the first three strikes to the back of El Zorro who took the punishment without complaining. When Charly Manson returned to the ring wearing a Zorro style mask and mockingly offering El Zorro a paper rose El Zorro became enraged and started to fight back. He took the Singapore cane from Romero and began hitting his opponents, moments later Dark Ozz and Dark Escoria's team mates Dark Espiritu and Dark Cuervo ran to the ring, giving the rudo side a five on three advantage. El Zorro and the Black Family beat up all three members and successfully fought off Real Fuerza Aérea who came to the ring to make the save. In the closing minutes of the segment El Zorro confronted Marisel Peña who sat at ringside, Peña slapped El Zorro, a move that seemingly shocked El Zorro.|$|E
