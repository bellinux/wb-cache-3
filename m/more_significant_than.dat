5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E
5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> many other rustbelt cities. Several major development projects incomplete and the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in office that assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures to homeowners. Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small resurgence in 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of von Neumann's papers, the methods of {{argument}} he employed are considered even <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem {{in the case of}} compact groups. In 1938, he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in analysis.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{narratives}} depict Scotland as largely converted by Irish missions {{associated with}} {{figures such as}} St. Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries, {{but many of these}} figures were later constructs or founded monasteries and collegiate churches in areas to which Christianity had already spread. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed, and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican–American War, Beauregard {{served as}} an {{engineer}} under General Winfield Scott.

He {{was one of the first}} officers to enter Mexico City. Beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> those of his engineer colleague, Captain Robert E.

5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Canadian horse and the Newfoundland pony {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. The Canadian horse showed high haplotype diversity, sharing haplotypes with all Canadian populations, as well as draft breeds, Nordic pony breeds and British mountain and moorland pony breeds also tested in the study. The Canadian horse had been shown to be related to draft horse breeds, including the Percheron, Belgian and Clydesdale, in previous microsatellite loci studies. This relationship was supported by findings in the 2012 study. The high levels of diversity in the Canadian horse supported the conclusions of a 1998 study, which determined that the small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation. The 1998 paper also stated that the Canadian horse did not show inbreeding any <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> other, more popular, breeds.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of the bee venom(BV) aqua-acupuncture on the neuronal activities of catecholaminergic(tyrosine hydroxylase : TH, dopamine hydroxylase : DH) system in the brainstem. After the BV aqua-acupuncture was applied on Chok-Samni(ST 36) and the gluteal part(Blank locus) in rats. Also, the number of colocalization between catecholamine containing neurons and Fos immunoreactive neurons were analyzed by using the double immunohistochemical technique. The results of the experiments were summarized as follows : 1. In DR and LC, Chok-Samni group and the Blank locus group showed <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> {{increase in the number of}} colocalization between TH containing neurons and Fos immunoreactive neurons than the control group. Furthermore, Chok-Samni group showed <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> increase <b>than</b> the Blank locus group. Also, in Arc, Chok-Samni group showed <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> increase <b>than</b> the Blank locus group and the control group. 2. In LC, Chok-Samni group showed <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> increase in the number of colocalization between DH containing neurons and Fos immunoreactive neurons than the Blank locus group and the control group. Also, in A 5, Chok-Samni group and the Blank locus group showed <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> increase <b>than</b> the control group. Chok-Samni group showed <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> increase <b>than</b> the Blank locus group. However, there was no significant change in A 7. Consequently, the BV aqua-acupuncture increased more potent the number of Fos immunoreactive neurons and the activity of catecholaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the BV aqua-acupuncture was more effective on Chok-Samni than Blank locus group. These results indicate that the BV aqua-acupuncture is very effective therapy to control pain. The therapeutic effect of BV aqua-acupunture may associated with the endogenous modulatory system such as catecholamine. Those data from the study can be applied to establish the effective treatment of the BV for pain control in the clinical field...|$|R
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake. Apart from the reduced {{suitability}} of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows, in western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms. This bird is good eating; when they were common in England, Mrs Beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer. <b>More</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> direct hunting is the loss of many birds, up to 14,000 a year, in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E
5|$|Christianity in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all aspects of}} Christianity in the modern borders of Scotland in the Middle Ages. Christianity was probably introduced {{to what is now}} Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced. Scotland was largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as St Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions founded monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> <b>than</b> bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century. After the reconversion of Scandinavian Scotland in the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Previous theory {{indicates}} that zygotic linkage disequilibrium (LD) is more informative than gametic or composite digenic LD in revealing natural population history.
