5|$|<b>Microbiology</b> {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in <b>microbiology,</b> particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Microbiology</b> Laboratory in Winnipeg {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of {{biosafety}} level 4 <b>microbiology</b> laboratories in the world. The NML houses laboratories of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease collocated in the same facility. Research facilities are also operated through hospitals and private biotechnology companies in the city.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Base was {{established}} as a project to promote polar sciences, {{as well as to}} demonstrate the possibility of building a zero emission station.

5|$|Burnet's major {{achievements}} in <b>microbiology</b> included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis; developing assays for the isolation, culture and detection of influenza virus; describing the recombination of influenza strains; demonstrating that the myxomatosis virus {{does not cause}} disease in humans. Modern methods for producing influenza vaccines are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in hen's eggs.|$|E
5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, <b>microbiology</b> tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Like biochemistry, the {{overlapping}} disciplines of bacteriology and virology (later combined as <b>microbiology),</b> situated {{between science and}} medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. Félix d'Herelle's isolation of bacteriophage during World War I initiated {{a long line of}} research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms can {{be found}} almost {{anywhere}} on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a subfield of <b>microbiology</b> is virology, the study of viruses.|$|E
5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical <b>microbiology,</b> worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his {{research}} into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if an organism {{is the cause of}} a disease, and these postulates are still used today.|$|E
5|$|Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article {{describing}} a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, {{and the discovery}} of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail, although there are millions of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most abundant type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of <b>microbiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{dedicated}} Science Research Centre, {{built in}} 2008, has ten purpose-built laboratories {{in which students}} experience different research disciplines outside of the usual curriculum, including labs for Robotics and Engineering, Biotechnology and <b>Microbiology,</b> and the Pharmaceutical Sciences. The centre provides resources to support the research and innovation programmes, serving as a central facility for student research activities.|$|E
5|$|The work of Pasteur and Koch did not {{accurately}} reflect the true {{diversity of the}} microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of <b>microbiology</b> was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on <b>microbiology</b> by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{held his}} {{job with the}} Bureau of Chemistry until 1927, when the {{position}} was abolished. He was then appointed Principal Mycologist of the Division of Soil <b>Microbiology</b> for the newly created Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. In a few years, Thom became known as an authority on soil <b>microbiology,</b> and was often invited to present papers at national and international meetings. In one of Thom's important contributions to the field, he led the research group responsible for advances that enabled the control of cotton root rot, {{which at the time}} was a major problem in the southwestern United States. In collaboration with his protégé Kenneth Raper, they published the Manual of Penicillin in 1940. Thom formally retired in 1942, although he remained active as a consultant and guest speaker until shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Thom was the U.S. Delegate to the 1905 International Dairy Congress held in Paris, France. He helped {{establish}} a graduate education {{program at the}} USDA. In 1907, he became a charter member of the Dairy Association of America, and in 1918, was appointed President of the Bacteriological Association of Washington. He attended the 1935 International Soil Congress in Oxford, England and was Vice President of the 1939 International Microbiological Congress in New York. He {{was a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences, a charter member of the Mycological Society of America, and president of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1940 and the Society of Industrial <b>Microbiology</b> in 1950. Thom was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science degree by Lake Forest College in 1936. For his work on penicillin, he and his research group received the Lasker Group Award in 1946, and the USDA Distinguished Service Award in 1947. The same year, he received a gold medal from the Spanish National Research Council for his contributions to <b>microbiology</b> and medicine.|$|E

The holotype specimen of A.exitialis {{is located in the}} Mycological Herbarium of Guangdong Institute of <b>Microbiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the University of Maryland, Faber {{earned a}} B.S. in 1926, a M.S. in 1928, and a Ph.D. in {{bacteriology}} in 1937. In 1945, {{he was appointed}} {{the head of his}} alma mater's Department of <b>Microbiology,</b> a position he held for 18 years. During World War II, Faber joined the United States Army and served from 1942 to 1946, attaining the rank of major. He spent three years working at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent {{ten days}} at the site {{analyzing}} the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long-term preservation. In June, Germany agreed to contribute $130,000 to UNESCO for {{the second phase of}} rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, <b>microbiology,</b> structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.|$|E
5|$|Moser was {{promoted}} to Associate University Professor in 1964. Two years later, the Faculty of Science of the University of Innsbruck recommended that a chair of <b>microbiology</b> should be created at the Botanical Institute in Innsbruck. The Federal Ministry of Education accepted the recommendation. Moser was the only candidate for the position, and was unanimously named {{by a number of}} leading European botanists and mycologists for the post in 1967. Subsequently, in 1968, Moser {{was promoted}} to full professor, and, in 1972, Moser became the head of the newly established Institute of <b>Microbiology,</b> {{the first of its kind}} in Austria. He remained in charge of the Institute until his retirement. He taught on a wide range of subjects, including the taxonomy of fungi, ecology of fungi, mycogeography, bacteria, viruses, chemotaxonomy, molecular genetics, microbial toxicology, immunology and symbiosis. During his career at the university, he oversaw over 60 doctoral theses, in addition to a number of diploma theses. In 1970, Moser became the president of the Austrian Mycological Society, taking over after the death of the previous post-holder, Kurt Lohwag. Lohwag, in turn, had taken up the position after the death of his predecessor, Thirring, earlier that year. Moser remained the society's president for 21 years.|$|E
5|$|O'Gara {{was born}} in San Diego, California, where his father, Fergal, {{was working as a}} post–doctoral fellow in <b>Microbiology.</b> His father had also played wing for the UCG club in Connacht. His family moved back to Ireland while he was only six months old. The family home was in Central Avenue in Bishopstown, a middle class suburb on the southside of Cork city. They later moved to the Model Farm Road, also on the southside.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} in this genus include the widespread fluke Prosthogonimus ovatus(which {{lives in the}} oviducts of birds), the parasitic worm Plagiorchis elegans, the larvae of parasitic flies, the feather mite Metanalges elongatus, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes. During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, <b>microbiology</b> tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory (FeMO), {{funded by}} the National Science Foundation and Microbial Observatory Program, has led cruises to Lōʻihi {{investigate}} its <b>microbiology</b> every October. The first cruise, on the ship R/V Melville and exploiting the submersible JASON2, lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study {{the large number of}} Fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi's extensive vent system is characterized by a high concentration of CO2 and Iron, while being low in sulfide. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in.|$|E
5|$|Since {{microbes}} {{were not}} known until the Early Modern period, {{they appear in}} earlier literature indirectly, through descriptions of baking and brewing. Only with {{the invention of the}} microscope, as used by Robert Hooke in his 1665 book Micrographia, and by Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s, the germ theory of disease, and progress in <b>microbiology</b> in the 19th century were microbes observed directly, identified as living organisms, and put to use on a scientific basis. The same knowledge also allowed microbes to appear explicitly in literature and the arts.|$|E
5|$|Sonnabend {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in <b>microbiology,</b> virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his own expense, and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was fired from the journal).|$|E
5|$|The {{bacterium}} can {{be grown}} and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy. E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species {{in the fields of}} biotechnology and <b>microbiology,</b> where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes only 20 minutes to reproduce.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, {{such as in}} Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India, and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro. <b>Microbiology,</b> {{the scientific study of}} microorganisms, began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{received}} his Doctor of Medicine {{degree from the}} University of Melbourne in 1924, and his PhD from the University of London in 1928. He went on to conduct pioneering research in <b>microbiology</b> and immunology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, and served {{as director of the}} Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, Burnet worked at the University of Melbourne. Throughout his career he played {{an active role in the}} development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.|$|E
5|$|Charles Thom (November 11, 1872 – May 24, 1956) was an American {{microbiologist}} and mycologist. Born {{and raised}} in Illinois, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri, the first such degree awarded by that institution. He was {{best known for his}} work on the <b>microbiology</b> of dairy products and soil fungi, and in particular his research into the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. His work influenced the establishment of standards for food handling and processing in the USA. He pioneered the use of culture media to grow microorganisms, and, with food chemist James N. Currie, developed a process to mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus. Thom {{played an important role in}} the development of penicillin in World War II.|$|E
5|$|His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, {{died from}} lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a {{four-year}} struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas {{to spend more}} time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the <b>microbiology</b> department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical <b>Microbiology</b> and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E
5|$|Notable German {{physicists}} {{before the}} 20th century include Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, among others. Albert Einstein introduced the special relativity and general relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively. Along with Max Planck, he {{was instrumental in}} the introduction of quantum mechanics, in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions. Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays. Otto Hahn was a pioneer in the fields of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission, while Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch were founders of <b>microbiology.</b> Numerous mathematicians were born in Germany, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, David Hilbert, Bernhard Riemann, Gottfried Leibniz, Karl Weierstrass, Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein.|$|E
5|$|After showing {{interest}} {{in natural sciences}} in his youth, he studied at the University of Innsbruck. However, his university career was interrupted {{by the need to}} complete military service. He was stationed as a translator in eastern Europe during World War II, before being captured and placed in a prisoner of war camp. He was released in 1948, subsequently returning to Innsbruck to complete his studies. After completing his doctorate in 1950, Moser worked in England for six months, researching the symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi. Upon his return to Austria, he took up a position with the Federal Forestry Research Institute, where he remained until 1968, taking part in influential research on the use of mycorrhizal fungi in reforestation. He began lecturing at the University of Innsbruck in 1956, and in 1972 he became the inaugural head of the first Institute of <b>Microbiology</b> in Austria. He remained with the Institute until his retirement in 1991. His studies continued until his death in 2002. An influential mycologist, he received a number of awards throughout his life, and numerous fungal taxa have been named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of <b>Microbiology.</b> While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
