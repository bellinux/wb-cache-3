However, he decided against this at the last <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E
25|$|In The Adventures of Nero album Het Zeespook (1948) Nero meets a {{character}} who claims to be Diogenes. Two scenes in the comic depict famous anecdotes of Diogenes' life, namely the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was looking for a}} human and the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> asked Alexander to get out of his sun. He is also portrayed living in a barrel.|$|E

There was no question of applause. It was the silence of Gettysburg...No man has ever dominated the House as he dominated it tonight, and he knows it.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September 1946, {{the royal}} family was exiled from Bulgaria. Simeon II has never signed any abdication papers—neither at that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was nine years old}} and his legal {{capacity}} to sign such an instrument would be questionable in any event, nor at any time later. The royal family first went to Alexandria, Egypt, where Queen Giovanna's father Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy, lived in exile. There, Simeon II finished Victoria College (along with Crown Prince Leka of Albania). In July 1951, General Franco's dictatorship in Spain granted asylum to the family.|$|E
25|$|Sizing up the situation, Sgt Owens {{decided that}} the only way to {{neutralize}} the gun was to charge it directly from the front. Calling on four volunteers to assist him, he positioned them where they could place supporting bunkers under fire. At the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> judged he had a fair chance of reaching his objective, the six-feet-three, 232-pound Marine charged right into the very mouth of the still rapidly firing cannon. Entering the emplacement through the fire port, he chased the Japanese out the back where they were cut down by his rifleman. Pursuing them, he in turn was instantly killed.|$|E

25|$|Clarkson {{was born}} in Doncaster, the son of Shirley Gabrielle Clarkson, a teacher, and Edward Grenville Clarkson, a {{travelling}} salesman. His parents, who ran a business selling tea cosies, put their son's name down in advance for private schools, with no idea how {{they were going to}} pay the fees, until at the last <b>moment,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 13, they made two Paddington Bear stuffed toys for each of their children. These proved so popular that they started selling them through the business with sufficient success to be able to pay the fees for Clarkson to attend Hill House School, Doncaster, and later Repton School.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of either June 17 or June 18, the band of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions of {{the day before and}} awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips decided to go to his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a <b>moment,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> did he heard the crack of a rifle outside. Phillips dropped to the ground, struck by two musket balls, and the band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks. Phillips was the only person killed or injured in the raid.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, {{as if to make}} him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Rakovsky's life between that moment and July 1932, the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was allowed a medical leave. Towards {{the end of the}} same year, Trotsky was {{informed}} that he had attempted to flee the Soviet Union, and, in March 1933, it was announced that he had been deported to Yakutia. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Researcher Tova Yedlin proposed that the problem was caused by Gorky's distress over having recently separated from his mistress Moura Budberg, {{as well as to the}} writer's close surveillance by OGPU agents.|$|E
25|$|After the {{old regime}} is ousted and Historia ascends to the throne in his place, Eren {{and the rest of}} the Survey Corps depart to Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria by sealing its breach with his new power. However, upon {{arriving}} there, they face an army of Titans led by Zeke, the Beastly Titan, as well as Bertoldt and Reiner. The vicious battle ends with almost all members of the expedition killed, including Erwin, save for Eren and his companions, but Zeke ends up forced to flee, leaving a captured Bertoldt behind, which is later consumed by Armin to save his life. With Shiganshina secured, Eren fulfills his promise to his father by reaching the basement of their old house, where he and his friends retrieve some books and a photograph of Grisha, his first wife, Dina, who Eren recognizes as the same Titan who killed his mother, and their son, who is no other than Zeke. Upon returning home, Eren realizes that to control the power of the coordinate, he must obtain the blood of someone from the royalty, as the only <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> managed to use it was when he got into contact with Dina, a descendant of the Eldian kings herself, in her Titan form.|$|E
25|$|Things became awkward {{during the}} periods when {{a number of}} provinces refused to appoint a stadtholder (Friesland always had a stadtholder during these periods). During the First Stadtholderless Period the {{function}} of captain-general of the union was simply left vacant until the very end, in 1672, when William III was appointed, at a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was not yet a stadtholder. In this period the supreme command of the army was first entrusted to the Field-Marshal who was in office at the death of William II in 1650, Johan Wolfert van Brederode. But {{after his death in}} 1655 even this function was left vacant, because it was politically awkward for the States of Holland to appoint either of the candidates for the function, the Frisian stadtholder William Frederick, or John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. The latter was however appointed to the position in 1668, together with the Holstein general Paulus Wirtz as second Field-Marshal, in view of the advanced age of John Maurice. Henceforth the States Army usually had two Field-Marshals, and after 1689 for a short time even three (when Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz was appointed to the function; he resigned, however, when he did not receive the appointment of first Field-Marshal after the death of Waldeck in 1692).|$|E

25|$|He had {{excellent}} parts, {{which had}} been improved by parliamentary and diplomatic experience; but the infirmities of his temper detracted much from the effective strength of his abilities. Negotiator and courtier as he was, he never learnt the art of governing or of concealing his emotions. When prosperous, he was insolent and boastful; when he sustained a check, his undisguised mortification doubled the triumph of his enemies: very slight provocations sufficed to kindle his anger; {{and when he was}} angry he said bitter things which he forgot {{as soon as he was}} pacified, but which others remembered many years. His quickness and penetration would have made him a consummate man of business but for his selfsufficiency and impatience. His writings prove that he had many of the qualities of an orator: but his irritability prevented him from doing himself justice in debate: for nothing was easier than to goad him into a passion; and, from the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went into a passion, he was at the mercy of opponents far inferior to him in capacity. Unlike most of the leading politicians of that generation, he was a consistent, dogged, and rancorous party man, a Cavalier of the old school, a zealous champion of the Crown and of the Church, and a hater of Republicans and Nonconformists. He had consequently a great body of personal adherents. The clergy especially looked on him as their own man, and extended to his foibles an indulgence of which, to say the truth, he stood in some need, for he drank deep, and when was in a rage—and he very often was in a rage—he swore like a porter.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} about the [...] "rebirthing" [...] scene, Kit Harington {{said that it}} intended to mirror the Daenerys Targaryen scene {{at the end of}} the third-season episode [...] "Mhysa" [...] when Daenerys is held up by freed Yunkai slaves; in [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Jon Snow emerges from the crushing crowd of the battle: [...] "When the crush starts happening, he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks: 'I could just stay here and let it all end.' And then something drives him to fight up, and that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again, which I found weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E

500|$|Mac {{experiences}} {{his spiritual}} resurrection {{even as he}} wrestles with death, in both the past—Sonny's father in the Vietnam War—and present—his own daughter in a car accident. The latter threatens to derail Mac's new life, captured in the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> learns of it and [...] turns off the radio that is playing his new song. Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like a pall over Tender Mercies [...] what makes this film inspiring {{is that it is}} also about the joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, [...] "Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life." ...|$|E
500|$|VanDerWerff {{said that}} Morrison had [...] "a nice <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> underplays {{the scene where}} he talks about how Will once {{contemplated}} suicide after getting caught cheating on a test", though while Lynch thought the [...] "idea of the scene was nice", it was [...] "more awkward than meaningful". Slezak called it [...] "the worst moment of the episode", and criticized the [...] "utter lack of context" [...] regarding what else Will might have been going through. Kubicek described it as an [...] "embarrassingly uncomfortable speech", and Will's implicit comparison of cheating on a test to the stresses of teenage homosexuality was [...] "just wrong". VanDerWerff thought that the next part of the sequence had [...] "a smallness, a realness to the scene that's kind of beautiful, really", and that it feels [...] "like they're actual high school kids"; Votta commented that [...] "as the kids admit {{all the things they}} are looking forward to", it reminds viewers why they are [...] "rooting for this ragtag bunch".|$|E
500|$|Between 1977 and 1989 Home was Governor of I Zingari, the nomadic cricket team. In {{retirement}} {{he published}} three books: [...] The Way The Wind Blows (1976), described by Hurd as [...] "a good-natured autobiography, with perhaps more anecdotes than insights", Border Reflections (1979), and his correspondence with his grandson Matthew Darby, Letters to a Grandson (1983). In the 1980s Home increasingly {{spent his time}} in Scotland, with his family. He was a keen fisherman and enjoyed shooting. Hurd writes that [...] "there was no sudden <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> abandoned politics", rather that [...] "his interventions became fewer and fewer". His last speech in the House of Lords was in 1989, when he spoke against Hurd's proposals for prosecuting war criminals living in Britain: [...] "After such a lapse of time justice might not {{be seen to be}} done. It would be dangerous to rely on memories of events that occurred so long ago. It was too late to reopen the issue." [...] His withdrawal from public affairs became more marked {{after the death of his}} wife in 1990, after 54 years of marriage.|$|E
60|$|I {{have seen}} him, at <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has fancied himself {{alone with his}} Maker, adopt so gay and chivalrous a bearing, and {{represent}} his own part with so much warmth and conscience, that the illusion became catching, and I believed implicitly in the Great Creature's pose.|$|R
60|$|But he {{reflected}} {{that he had}} only seen him in his leisure <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> might naturally be expected to unbend and be full of the milk of human kindness. Probably in business hours he was quite different. After all, pleasure is one thing and business another.|$|R
60|$|Cadmus, quite out of breath, stood leaning {{upon his}} sword, and {{wondering}} what was to happen next. He had waited but a few <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> began to see a sight, which was as great a marvel as the most marvellous thing I ever told you about.|$|R
