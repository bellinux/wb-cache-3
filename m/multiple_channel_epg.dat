40|$|A {{computer}} network {{consists of a}} set of computing nodes interconnected via communication channels. It is commonly assumed that, for each pair of network nodes u and v, there is at most one channel from u to v. However, it is often desirable to have <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes. That is, for every pair of network nodes u and v, there may be <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> from u to v. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing deterministic quality of service guarantees when there are <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes. We show that any packet scheduling protocol that operates over a single channel can be modified to operate over <b>multiple</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, this transformation increases the packet delay through the node by only a small amount. However, having <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes may cause packet reorder. This reorder significantly increases the upper bound on end-to-end delay. We show how this increase in delay is avoided through the use of efficient sorting techniques. ...|$|R

The IEEE 802. 11 standard allows {{for the use of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> available at the physical layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. A single-channel MAC protocol does not work well in a multi-channel environment, because of the multi-channel hidden terminal problem. Our proposed protocol enables hosts to utilize <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> by switching channels dynamically, thus increasing network throughput while increasing network analysis time. The protocol requires only one transceiver per host, but solves the multi-channel hidden terminal problem using temporal synchronization. Our scheme improves network throughput significantly, especially when the network is highly congested. The simulation results show that our protocol successfully exploits <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> to achieve higher throughput than IEEE 802. 11 and DCA protocol...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:- The {{aggregate}} capacity of wireless mesh networks {{can be improved}} significantly by equipping each node with multiple interfaces and by using <b>multiple</b> <b>channel</b> {{in order to reduce}} the effect of interfaces. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have the potential for improving network capacity by employing multiple radios and <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> (MRMC). Several efforts have been made to increase capacity. One such effort is by utilization of multiple radios and <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> for data transmission which improves network throughput. Research is in progress to offer optimal network throughput by efficiently utilizing <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> in multi-hop networks. This paper focuses on the channel assignment algorithm for multi-interface multichannel wireless mesh networks based on the traffic flow of the link, which equitably distribute equalization for the business flow between nodes so that the distribution through the link on the flow is equal. The channel assignment improves network capacity by setting the value to reduce interference with the overall network interference...|$|R
