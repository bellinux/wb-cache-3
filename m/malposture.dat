40|$|What is {{the ideal}} human upright posture? Where did it come from, how did it develop, what is its significance, how is it measured? What are the cause and effect of <b>malposture?</b> Much has been {{published}} {{on the role of}} posture in physical as well as mental and emotional states of the individual. This study was undertaken to investigate these issues, {{while at the same time}} aiming to find the position and role of posture in the physical and psychological context of human life. The first aspect of posture investigated was its definition. What constitutes good posture is still a debated issue. The conclusion drawn was that good posture represents the state of balance in an individual at rest and during motion. Ideally this state should be achieved with all the body parts aligned on top of each other requiring minimal effort and energy expenditure. The evolutionary origin of the upright posture in man was traced in order to come to a clearer understanding of the anatomical, biomechanical and physiological mechanisms involved in posture. The positions and functions of some muscles and bones have remained, and some have changed during the development of the upright human from its quadrupedal ancestors. Maintenance of balanced posture depends mainly on the coordinated action of the stabilizing mono-articulated muscles, and their place and purpose in upright man were viewed in the light of their origins. By so doing one is able to uncover their intended use and to identify misuse of these muscles. Development throughout childhood mimics the evolutionary process. A series of postural exercises was described, which follows the childhood/evolutionary pattern, and have proven to be successful in postural rehabilitation and bodyÂ¬mind integration. In order to understand the concept of the upright standing posture, control mechanisms responsible for maintaining upright posture were reviewed. These included the sensory and the neuromusculo-skeletal systems. This was duly undertaken in accordance with existing literature, it was concluded that posture is controlled in association with all human functions. Following the concept that posture affects the mind and emotions, the work and theories of prominent researchers in the body-mind and postural integration field such as Frederick Alexander, Raymond Dart, Moshe Feldenkrais, Alexander Lowen, Wilhelm Reich and Ida Rolf were reviewed and distilled. This led to evidence that treatment of the body has an effect on the mind, that structure influences function and that postural equilibrium has a beneficial influence on both mind and body. According to numerous workers <b>malposture</b> in man is pandemic. Ensuing literature and empirical research on total body posture, and the position of each area of the body, from the head to the feet, revealed divergent causes of this problem as well as effects of <b>malposture,</b> including negative self-image, psycholological problems, pain, fatigue and the inability to achieve the full human potential. Although there is no obvious cause of postural imbalance, there are many ways of preventing or rectifying the disorder. During the course of a postural rehabilitation therapy, there is a good chance of uncovering the underlying cause of the postural imbalance. This can be as deep seated as a personality disorder or as clear as the fear of an old sport injury. The incidence and extent of postural defects were investigated in two small groups of subjects with the aim to determine the range of postural deviations, and the body areas most commonly affected. All subjects studied, leaned forward with the gravity line anterior to the ankle joint. Postural defects were prevalent in all subjects. Most of the subjects were categorized as having severe postural defects or gross deformity. Postural asymmetry and kyphosis were the most common defects. The conclusions drawn from these studies were that most people, in any age group, suffer from some type of postural defect, supporting the general consensus that <b>malposture</b> is a pandemic condition. The effects of postural rehabilitation were also investigated. Postures improved in all the subjects over a period of twelve weeks, with a more vertical body alignment the most obvious change. Postural rehabilitation has physical and psychological consequences. This was demonstrated by improvement in posture and increased body awareness, a decrease in the tendency to become fatigued, an decrease in back and neck stiffness and improvement in mental attitudes. Postural training in general could therefore be profitable for both body and mind, and an appreciation of good posture and its resulting efficiency represents the best kind of preventative medicine. Postural training should have a place in both Education and Health. Thesis (D Phil (HMS)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Arts, Languages and Human Movement Studies EducationUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Dystocia in Jenny is a {{very rare}} and occur occasionally, about 1 to 4 % of foaling. A present case of fetal dystocia in seven year old jenny has been {{reported}} due to dorso-pubic position and <b>malpostures</b> (includes left shoulder flexion and flexed neck). Fetus was corrected in normal position and posture through application of mutational operation and removeed dead male fetus through vagina after applying the proper traction. Then, she was treated with fluid therapy, antibiotic, analgesic, tetanus toxoid, nutrients etc. and discharged from the veterinary dispensary with advising the owner for post-operative care and management for further few days.

40|$|Dystocia in the {{camelids}} is rare, {{however the}} exceptionally long {{neck and the}} fetal extremities predispose to flexion of these as a common cause of dystocia. A prolonged (< 2 hr) second stage of labor, bloody vaginal discharge or colic is the frequent sign of dystocia. The maternal causes of dystocia for camelids include uterine torsion, pelvic immaturity, uterine inertia and cervical dilation failure, whereas the fetal causes described are fetal <b>malpostures</b> and rarely fetal monsters like Schistosoma reflexus and Pero-somus elumbis or fetal dropsical conditions such as hydrocephalus. Dromedary camels must be restrained in a sternal recumbency for examination and vicious animals must be given xylazine (0. 25 - 2. 2 mg/Kg IM or IV). South American camelids may be restrained by using either xylazine or butarphanol (0. 5 - 0. 1 mg/Kg IM). Uterine torsion is much more common in llamas and alpacas whereas it is infrequent in the dromedary camel. The methods of dystocia correction by using mutations, fetotomy and cesarean section are described...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to test the}} effect of clenbuterol, a smooth muscle relaxant, as an aid for the manual correction of bovine dystocias in a rural Quebec practice. The drug was given initially by intravenous coccygeal or jugular injection at a dose of 0. 6 micrograms- 0. 8 micrograms/kg of body weight to parturient cows affected with fetal malpresentations (n = 37), <b>malpostures</b> (n = 112), or uterine torsions (n = 70). These cases comprised 32 % (219 / 688) of the manually corrected dystocias encountered in cattle during the trial. Ease provided for obstetrical maneuvers {{of different types of}} dystocias was the evaluation criteria used in this report. The drug's myometrial relaxant effect made corrections easier for the veterinarian, and shorter and less traumatic for the dam. The success rates achieved for vaginal corrections and delivery of uterine torsions were 84 % (76 / 91) and 77 % (70 / 91), respectively. Other recorded benefits included the need for less frequent use of epidural anesthesia and a significantly lower incidence of retained fetal membranes (chi 2 = 11. 18, p < 0. 001). No adverse reactions were observed at any time. Clenbuterol proved to be a useful drug for manual correction of dystocias in cattle...|$|R
