40|$|Effective English {{writing has}} long been a {{challenge}} in English language teaching. With the development of cognitive psychology, metacognition has drawn more and more researchers’ attention and provides a new perspective for EFL writing. Metacognitive theory mainly includes metacognitive knowledge and <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategy.</b> Among all the learning <b>strategies,</b> <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategy</b> is a higher-order executive skill which includes planning, monitoring and evaluating. Once learners have a good command of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategy,</b> they will become more independent and autonomous and will be more capable of planning, monitoring and evaluating their learning process and thus become efficient learners. However, the study of metacognitive strategies-based writing instruction for vocational college students has been neglected for the past years. The author, therefore, carried out an empirical study to investigate the effect of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategy</b> training on students’ writing performance in the hope of finding an optimal teaching approach for English teachers of vocational colleges. This teaching approach really embodies the teaching idea “student-centered” and is targeted to foster students’ <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategy,</b> monitoring and evaluating abilities in English writing. </p...|$|R

In spite of its importance, <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategy</b> has long been the ignored skill in English language teaching, research, learning, and assessment. This lack of good <b>metacognitive</b> reading <b>strategy</b> skill is exacerbated by the central role of reading comprehension in education success.

The present study is an attempt to find out whether "meta-cognitive reading strategy awareness" enhances EFL students’ reading comprehension. Furthermore, it attempts to detect the relationship between <b>metacognitive</b> reading <b>strategy</b> awareness and reading comprehension. This paper focuses on the four main issues. First, it discusses the definition of <b>metacognitive</b> reading <b>strategy,</b> the significance of <b>metacognitive</b> reading <b>strategy.</b> Second, it reviews the process of <b>metacognitive</b> reading <b>strategy.</b> Third, definition of reading comprehension and different models of reading comprehension are reviewed.

The following questions are addressed: 1) What types of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> are used by ITS students? 2) Which types of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> are more frequently and appropriately used by ITS students? This is a descriptive research searching the <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> {{and the types of}} metacognitve strategies used more frequently and appropriately by ITS students on reading comprehension. The primary instrument of this study is the researcher. He used questionnaires and interviewed students to collect data. The writer had to choose the 'opportunistic sample', due to the limitation of time and unfavorable situation and condition when the data collection was held. Forty five students in the sixth semester were chosen as the subjects of the study. The types of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> used are: preparing and planning for learning (in this context it is for reading), selecting and using learning strategy use, monitoring strategy use, orchestrating various strategies, and evaluating strategy use and learning. The types of metacognitve strategies which are used more frequently are: selecting and using learning strategy and evaluating strategy and learning. The successful students use many types of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> and they use them more frequently and appropriately than less successful students.

The issue I addressed in this study was that we know little from the literature about the scope and practices of university professors as they attempt to use appropriate <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> while teaching. For these reasons, I proposed to study the use of <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> of three university professors at a small private Midwestern university to explore how these university professors used <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> while teaching. Qualitative data was collected through observations and interviews. The data yielded in-depth descriptions of each case and across cases, an analysis of the issues, and overall assertions.

This study concluded that professors teach as they have learned and include specific <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> that assisted them in their learning as they teach. Instructional practices of the professors reflected their <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies.</b> However, these professors did not seize the opportunities to explicitly use their <b>metacognitive</b> <b>strategies</b> while teaching or with student-involved activities.
