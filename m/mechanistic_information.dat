Inexpensive positive-pressure devices {{that can be used}} easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and allopurinol have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane, {{to be used as a}} bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. <b>Mechanistic</b> <b>information</b> based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy.

Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.|$|E

With the discovery of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and its involvement in inflammatory responses of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, attention has turned to lung diseases and whether knowledge of this receptor can be applied to therapy of the human airways. In this article, we explore the prospect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ as a marker and treatment focal point of lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, lung cancer and cystic fibrosis.

50|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignment is {{an extension}} of pairwise alignment to incorporate more than two sequences at a time. Multiple alignment methods try to align all of the sequences in a given query set. Multiple alignments are often used in identifying conserved sequence regions across a group of sequences hypothesized to be evolutionarily related. Such conserved sequence motifs can be used in conjunction with structural and <b>mechanistic</b> <b>information</b> to locate the catalytic active sites of enzymes. Alignments are also used to aid in establishing evolutionary relationships by constructing phylogenetic trees. Multiple sequence alignments are computationally difficult to produce and most formulations of the problem lead to NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, the utility of these alignments in bioinformatics has {{led to the development of}} a variety of methods suitable for aligning three or more sequences.|$|E
50|$|There remain some {{limitations}} with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life cycle tests, they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds {{of fish and}} 1 to 5 months to complete. Other issues include the lack of <b>mechanistic</b> <b>information,</b> differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's mechanism of action. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case. ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and MATCs are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This {{could be due to}} the mode of action of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design. Additionally, growth response {{has been found to be}} an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an MATC. Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests.|$|E

40|$|There are {{significant}} gaps {{in our understanding}} of the pathways by which drugs act. This incomplete knowledge limits our ability to use <b>mechanistic</b> molecular <b>information</b> rationally to repurpose drugs, understand their side effects, and predict their interactions with other drugs. Here we present DrugRouter: a novel method for generating drug-specific pathways of action by linking target genes, disease genes and pharmacogenes using gene interaction networks. We construct pathways for over a hundred drugs, and show that the genes included in our pathways (1) co-occur with the query drug in the literature, (2) significantly overlap or are adjacent to known drug-response pathways, and (3) are adjacent to genes that are hits in genome wide association studies assessing drug response. Finally, these computed pathways suggest novel drug repositioning opportunities (e. g., statins for follicular thyroid cancer), gene-side effect associations, and gene-drug interactions. Thus, DrugRouter generates hypotheses about drug actions using systems biology data...|$|R

Another issue presents itself when attempting to expand substrate scope. This is often achieved by increasing the P450 active site size, which in turn can result in multiple substrate docking orientations, resulting in poor regio-/stereoselectivity.|$|R
30|$|The {{adverse outcome pathway}} (AOP) {{framework}} is intended to structure evidence of <b>mechanistic</b> toxicity <b>information</b> for a more effective use in risk assessment and regulatory decision making [301]. An AOP is triggered by a molecular initiating event (MIE), which is the interaction of a compound with a molecular target such as a receptor, and further outlines the sequence of key events (KE) along different levels of biological organization from the molecular level up to the adverse outcome {{at a level of}} regulatory concern. The latter is generally the organismal level in human toxicology and the individual or population level in ecotoxicology. One of the earliest conceptual AOPs proposed concerned the neurotoxicity of domoic acid [302]. The OECD has taken on the task of coordinating international collaboration and harmonization of AOP development. The AOP-Wiki [303] aims at centralizing AOP descriptions into a publicly available repository to facilitate their application by the (eco)toxicologist community from industry, academia and regulatory institutions.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The {{understanding}} of the molecular sources for diseases like cancer can be signicantly improved by computational models. Recently, Boolean networks have become very popular for modeling signaling and regulatory networks. However, such models rely {{on a set of}} Boolean functions which are in general not known. Unfortuna-tely, while detailed information on the molecular interactions becomes available in large scale through electronic databases, the information on the Boolean functions does not become available simultaneously and has to be included manually into the models, if at all known. Results: We propose a new Boolean approach which can directly utilize the <b>mechanistic</b> network <b>information</b> available through modern databases. The Boolean function is implicitly dened by the reaction mechanisms. Special care has been taken for the treatment of kinetic features like inhibition.

40|$|This article {{reports a}} kinetic {{study of the}} thermal {{degradation}} of insulating/conducting epoxy/Al composites, {{in order to obtain}} their <b>mechanistic</b> <b>information.</b> A Comparison of thermo-analytical data obtained from epoxy/Al composites with pure epoxy under non-isothermal conditions, showed that aluminum affects the thermal behavior of epoxy complexly and the produced effect depends on the quantity of aluminum in epoxy. The influence of aluminum contents on the thermal degradation of epoxy was fairly explained on the basis of variations in catalytic activity and heat capacity of aluminum with temperature. Different differential and integral isoconversional methods were used to determine the activation energies and consequently the appropriate reaction model for the processes, which was found to be Šestâk-Berggren.

40|$|This work {{presents}} near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as an in-line process analyzer {{for monitoring}} protein unfolding and protein-lyoprotectant hydrogen bond interactions during freeze-drying. By implementing a noncontact NIR probe in the freeze-drying chamber, spectra of formulations containing a model protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) were collected each process minute. When sublimation {{was completed in}} the cake region illuminated by the NIR probe, {{the frequency of the}} amide A/II band (near 4850 cm(- 1)) was monitored as a function of water elimination. These two features were well correlated during protein dehydration in the absence of protein unfolding (desired process course), whereas consistent deviations from this trend to higher amide A/II frequencies were shown to be related to protein unfolding. In formulations with increased sucrose concentrations, the markedly decreased amide A/II frequencies seen immediately after sublimation indicated an increased extent. of hydrogen bond interaction between the protein's backbone and surrounding molecules. At the end of drying, there was evidence of nearly complete water substitution for formulations with 1 %, 5 %, and 10 % sucrose. The presented approach shows promising perspectives for early fault detection of protein unfolding and for obtaining <b>mechanistic</b> process <b>information</b> on actions of lyoprotectants...|$|R
