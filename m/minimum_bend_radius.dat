50|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> is of {{particular}} importance in the handling of fiber-optic cables, which are often used in telecommunications. The minimum bending radius will vary with different cable designs. The manufacturer should specify the minimum radius to which the cable may safely be bent during installation, and for the long term. The former is somewhat smaller than the latter. The <b>minimum</b> <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> is in general also a function of tensile stresses, e.g., during installation, while being bent around a sheave while the fiber or cable is under tension.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} correlation between bendability and tensile prop-erties of high-strength steels. Strength and elongation in tensile test have traditionally been basic values in evaluating bending properties. Advanced high-strength (AHS) steels often have tendency for strain localization, causing risk of fractures and impairing the shape of the bend. Practice has shown that tensile test results, indicating bendability well, are not sufficiently accurate when using AHS steels. Since tensile test is a fast, simple and cheap testing method, it would be beneficial to rework it to suit better for predicting of bendability. In this study, the usability of tensile test results to predict failures in bending AHS steels has been investigated. The most common failures and failure mechanisms in bending are also presented. Test materials used were 6 mm thick AHS wear-resistant, protection and structural steels with good and poor <b>bending</b> properties. <b>Minimum</b> <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> were determined and then compared with ten-sile test results to estimate the correlation. Conventional tensile test results, fracture surfaces and necking through width and thickness were analyzed. Correlation coefficient for measured tension properties and <b>minimum</b> <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> was calculated. Results showed that in tensile test, have the best correlation with <b>minimum</b> <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> with necking through the thickness and actual strain in necking area...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers.

The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's <b>minimum</b> <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting.

5000|$|Labour Cost: During {{installation}} MI cable {{must not}} be bent repeatedly as this will cause work hardening and cracks in the cladding and cores. A <b>minimum</b> <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> must be observed and the cable must be supported at regular intervals. The magnesium oxide insulation is hygroscopic so MICC cable must be protected from moisture until it has been terminated. Termination requires stripping back the copper cladding and attaching a compression gland fitting. Individual conductors are insulated with plastic sleeves. A sealing tape, insulating putty or an epoxy resin is then poured into the compression gland fitting to provide a watertight seal. If a termination is faulty due to workmanship or damage then the magnesium oxide will absorb moisture and lose its insulating properties. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between 1 and 2 hours of labour (an electrician {{should be able to}} make a termination in 10 to 15 minutes on up to 4 core smaller sizes). Installation of a three-conductor MI cable (size No. 10 AWG — about 5 square mm) takes about 65% more time than installation of a PVC-sheathed armoured cable of the same conductor size. Installation of MICC is therefore a costly task. Certain PTFE, silicone or other polymer-insulated cables have been substituted in applications which require similar properties in terms of flame spread, which use less labour to terminate. MICC is still used in applications which are particularly suited to its combination of properties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Utilisation of ultra-high-strength steels (UHS) has increased, {{particularly}} in the automotive industry. By using these materials vehicle structures can be lightened. However, {{one of the problems}} of UHS is weak formability. Materials fracture easily with small <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> and the <b>minimum</b> <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> are rather large. In this study, the tested materials were complex phase (CP) bainitic-martensitic UHS steels (YS/TS 960 / 1000 and 1100 / 1250). The steels were incrementally bent with a press brake in the rolling direction and perpendicular to it, and the final bending angle was 90 degrees. The incremental bending angles were 150 °, 130 °, 110 ° and 90 °. The punch was unloaded after every incremental bending step. The test materials were bent with different <b>bending</b> <b>radii.</b> The aim was to find the <b>minimum</b> <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> which produces an acceptable bend. Every incremental bend was compared with a bending performed in the traditional manner. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how well the results of incremental bending compare to roll forming. In addition, clarification studies of when the bend started to fracture were made. It is well known that steels are more efficiently bent by roll forming compared with traditional bending. The results presented in this study demonstrate that incremental bending does not produce better results than traditional bending. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the examined steels can be bent incrementally against manufacturer’s recommendations...|$|R

This combination allows for highly intelligent products of unprecedented thinness, flexibility and cost.

During use the ultra-thin chips in these products can be bent to a very high curvature, which puts a large strain on the chips. In this paper the strength of ultra-thin chips at very high curvatures is evaluated, using a modified four-point bending method.
