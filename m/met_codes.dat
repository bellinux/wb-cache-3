40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess raters’ {{agreement}} and objectivity in using the Compendium of Physical Activities to code physical activity diaries. This study assessed agreement in assigning metabolic equivalent (<b>MET)</b> <b>codes</b> and values and raters’ objectivity in estimating energy expenditure were assessed. Asecondary {{purpose of this}} studywas to compare agreement and objectivity in coding English and Spanish physical activity diaries. In total, 48 diaries were coded by 4 trained raters. Generalizability theorywas used to determine raters’objectivity. Agreementin assigningMETcodes andMETvalues to individual activities ranged from 44 % to 92 %. The generalizabilty analyses indicated the raters’ objectivity was high for the English and Spanish diaries (>. 80). Objectivity in coding increased with 2 raters but remained adequate with just 1 rater. Therefore, using detailed diaries and trained ratersmaypreclude the need for double coding physical activity diaries. Furthermore, eliminating codes from the Compendium of Physical Activities that are redundant or have overlapping descriptions may reduce disagreement in <b>MET</b> <b>codes</b> and values between raters...|$|E
40|$|The thiopurine 6 -thioguanine (S 6 G) is used {{to treat}} acute leukaemia. Its {{cytotoxic}} effect requires an active DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. S 6 G is incorporated into DNA where a small fraction undergoes in situ conversion to S 6 -thiomethylguanine (S 6 meG). After replication, S 6 meG-containing base pairs interact with MMR. This interaction is ultimately lethal and MMR-defective cells are resistant to S 6 G. Here, we report that growing human cells extensively incorporate the thiopyrimidine nucleoside 4 -thiothymidine (S 4 TdR) into their DNA. The incorporated thiopyrimidine (S 4 T) can also undergo facile S-methylation to 4 -thiomethylthymine (S 4 meT). The rate of methylation of S 4 TdR in model substrates {{is similar to that}} for the conversion of S 6 G to S 6 meG indicating that the DNA of cells grown in S 4 TdR will contain significant levels of S 4 meT. Despite this, S 4 TdR is not associated with MMR-related cell death. We demonstrate that, in contrast to S 6 meG, neither DNA S 4 T nor S 4 <b>meT</b> <b>codes</b> ambiguously. S 4 T retains the coding properties of unmodified T, whereas S 4 meT behaves like a normal cytosine and exclusively directs the incorporation of guanine. The preferred S 4 meT:G base pair is also a poor substrate for binding by the hMutSα mismatch recognition factor. We suggest that the ability of S 4 meT to produce a structurally acceptable base pair during replication underlies the absence of MMR-related death in cells treated with S 4 TdR. ...|$|E

Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is <b>met.</b> <b>Code</b> can be stepped over, i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time.

During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{have been considered}} as an enabling technology for constructing smart cities. One important feature of wireless sensor networks is that the sensor nodes collaborate in some manner for communications. In this manuscript, {{we focus on the}} model of multiway relaying with full data exchange where each user wants to transmit and receive data to and from all other users in the network. We derive the capacity region for this specific model and propose a coding strategy through coset encoding. To obtain good performance with practical codes, we choose spatially-coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes for the coded cooperation. In particular, for the message broadcasting from the relay, we construct multi-edge-type (<b>MET)</b> SC-LDPC <b>codes</b> by repeatedly applying coset encoding. Due to the capacity-achieving property of the SC-LDPC codes, we prove that the capacity region can theoretically be achieved by the proposed <b>MET</b> SC-LDPC <b>codes.</b> Numerical results with finite node degrees are provided, which show that the achievable rates approach the boundary of the capacity region in both binary erasure channels and additive white Gaussian channels...|$|R

Fuzzy Hamming distinguishabilities appear to be quite a promising tool to extend Muljacic approach from linguistic classification to linguistic evolution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe L 3 gene is {{responsible}} for the hypersensitive response in Capsicum plants against infection by tobamoviruses. The resistance conferred by this gene {{is one of the most}} effective so far described against tobamoviruses. Certain isolates of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) are the only tobamoviruses able to overcome the L 3 resistance. Chimeric viral genomes between PMMV-S (to which L 3 plants are hypersensitive) and PMMV-I (an L 3 resistance-breaking isolate) led us to conclude that sequence variation within the coat protein gene of both isolates determines their different virulence in L 3 L 3 plants. Furthermore, the results indicate that a single amino acid substitution, Asn to Met, at position 158 of the PMMV-I coat protein is sufficient to induce the hypersensitive response and localization of vital infection in C. chinense plants. Finally, the use of a mutant coding for a truncated coat protein (maintaining the <b>Met</b> 138 <b>coding</b> sequence at the RNA level) demonstrates that a functional coat protein is required for elicitation of the L 3 gene-mediated resistance...|$|R
