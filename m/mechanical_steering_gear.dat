40|$|The {{automotive}} {{steering system}} inevitably presents internal friction that affects its response. This is why internal friction phenomena are carefully monitored either by OEMs and by vehicle manufacturers. An algorithm {{to predict the}} mechanical efficiency and the internal friction of a steering gear system has been developed by the ZF-TRW Technical Centre of Gardone Val Trompia and the University of Brescia, Italy. It is focused on <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> of the rack and pinion type. The main contributions to the overall friction have been identified and modelled. The work is based on theoretical calculation {{as well as on}} experimental measurements carried out on a purpose-built test rig. The model takes into account the materials used and the gear mesh characteristics and enables the prediction of the steering gear friction performance before the very first prototypes are built...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The rudder and <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the most}} widely used ship {{maneuvering}} equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, <b>steering</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem.
