25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance. In addition, <b>methoprene</b> in the form of sustained release bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methoprene</b> {{does not}} kill insects. Instead, {{it acts as}} an insect growth regulator, {{mimicking}} natural juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone must be absent for a pupa to molt to an adult, so methoprene-treated larvae {{will be unable to}} successfully change from pupae to adults. This breaks the biological life cycle of the insect, preventing recurring infestation. <b>Methoprene</b> is used in the production of a number of foods, including meat, milk, mushrooms, peanuts, rice, and cereals. It also has several uses on domestic animals (pets) for controlling fleas. <b>Methoprene</b> is considered a biological pesticide because rather than controlling target pests through direct toxicity, <b>methoprene</b> interferes with an insect’s lifecycle and prevents it from reaching maturity or reproducing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Methoprene</b> is a {{juvenile}} hormone (JH) analog which {{acts as a}} growth regulator when used as an insecticide.

5000|$|Flea [...] in {{the home}} are treated in various ways. A spot-on {{insecticide}} kills the fleas on the pet and in turn the pet itself collects and mops up newly hatched fleas.

50|$|Modern flea {{control is}} {{approached}} using {{integrated pest management}} (IPM) protocols at the host (pet) level. IPM is achieved by targeting fleas during at least two separate life stages, {{with at least two}} separate molecules.

50|$|Insect growth {{regulator}} (IGR) {{is a term}} coined {{to include}} insect hormone mimics and an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit chitin (exoskeleton) biosynthesis in insects Diflubenzuron {{is a member of}} the latter class, used primarily to control caterpillars that are pests. The most successful insecticides in this class are the juvenoids (juvenile hormone analogues). Of these, <b>methoprene</b> is most widely used. It has no observable acute toxicity in rats and is approved by World Health Organization (WHO) for use in drinking water cisterns to combat malaria. Most of its uses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including mosquitoes, several fly species, and fleas. Two very similar products, hydroprene and kinoprene, are used for controlling species such as cockroaches and white flies. <b>Methoprene</b> was registered with the EPA in 1975. Virtually no reports of resistance have been filed. A more recent type of IGR is the ecdysone agonist tebufenozide (MIMIC), which is used in forestry and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects than other insect orders.|$|E

50|$|Synthetic analogues of the {{juvenile}} hormone are used as an insecticide, preventing the larvae from developing into adult insects. JH itself is expensive to synthesize and is unstable in light. At high levels of JH, larvae can still molt, but the result will only be a bigger larva, not an adult. Thus the insect's reproductive cycle is broken. One JH analogue, <b>methoprene,</b> is approved by the WHO for use in drinking water cisterns to control mosquito larvae due to its exceptionally low toxicity (LD50 >35,000 mg/kg in the rat).|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem in}} {{controlling}} German cockroaches {{is the nature}} of their population behaviour. Though they are not social and practise no organised maternal care, females carry oothecae of 18-50 eggs (average about 32) during incubation until just before hatching, instead of dropping them as most other species of cockroaches do. This protects the eggs from certain classes of predation. Then, after hatching, nymphs largely survive by consuming excretions and moults from adults, thereby establishing their own internal microbial populations and avoiding contact with most insecticidal surface treatments and baits. One effective control is insect growth regulators (IGRs, hydroprene, <b>methoprene,</b> etc.), which act by preventing molting, thus prevent maturation of the various instars. Caulking baseboards and around pipes may prevent the travel of adults from one apartment to another within a building.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of burying beetles feed {{partly by}} begging for predigested carrion {{from parents and}} partly by self-feeding. In this species, {{juvenile}} hormone, a major regulatory insect hormone, stimulates begging and growth. Elevating larval juvenile hormone levels (by topical application of the analogue <b>methoprene)</b> increase begging indicating that juvenile hormone in insects could have a similar function to that of testosterone and corticosterone in birds. Elevated juvenile hormone levels {{have a negative effect}} on larval growth regardless of whether larvae forage by begging or by self-feeding. This shows that the effects of juvenile hormone on larval growth are independent of the effects on begging, suggesting that the mechanisms by which juvenile hormone affects offspring growth in insects differ from those by which testosterone and corticosterone affect growth in birds.|$|E

Sterile insect technique (SIT) is {{an environmentally}} benign pest management technique {{that relies on}} released sterile males mating with, and curtailing reproduction of, wild females. Juvenile hormone analogue <b>methoprene</b> (M+) incorporated into pre-release diet (Y+ sucrose plus yeast, Y- sucrose only) was studied as a potential enhancer of reproductive organ development, sexual maturation, and longevity of Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggart), or 'Q-fly' used for SIT. Incorporatoration of <b>methoprene</b> into diets that also contain yeast was found to strongly accelerate reproductive organ development (testes and apodeme) in males, but had much weaker effects on females (ovaries). Age, detary yeast and <b>methoprene</b> application all increased male mating success at early ages. Yeast and <b>methoprene</b> had synergistic effects on sexual maturation, since M+Y+ treated males exhibited increased mating propensity at younger ages than either M+Y- or M-Y+ flies. Flies provided yeast had increased mating success in comparison to yeast-deprived flies. In the absence of yeast, <b>methoprene</b> (M+Y-) treatment had only a modest effect on sexual maturation. In contrast to males, female Q-flies exhibited little response to <b>methoprene</b> treatment. Both when held individually in small cages and in groups in larger cages, yeast supplementation resulted in longer life spans {{for both males and}} females with and without <b>methoprene,</b> but <b>methoprene</b> did not significantly affect longevity.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. <b>Methoprene</b> is a {{pesticide}} {{that acts}} as a juvenile hormone agonist. Although developed initially against insects, it has since been shown to have toxic effects on larval and adult crustaceans. <b>Methoprene</b> was one of several pesticides applied to the Western Long Island Sound (WLIS) watershed area during the summer of 1999; the other pesticides were malathion, resmethrin, and sumethrin. These pesticides were applied as part of a county-by-county effort to control the mosquito vector of West Nile Virus. Subsequently, the seasonal lobster catches from the WLIS have decreased dramatically. The lethality of the pesticides to lobsters had been unknown. We studied the effects of <b>methoprene</b> while other investigators studied effects of the other pesticides. We questioned whether <b>methoprene,</b> through its effects on larvae, adults or both, could have contributed to this decline. We found that low levels of <b>methoprene</b> had adverse effects on lobster larvae. It was toxic to stage II larvae at 1 ppb. Stage IV larvae were more resistant, but did exhibit significant increases in molt frequency beginning at exposures of 5 ppb. Juvenile lobsters exhibited variations in tissue susceptibility to methoprene: hepatopancreas appeared to be the most vulnerable, reflected by environmental concentrations of <b>methoprene</b> inhibiting almost all protein synthesis in this organ. Our results indicated that <b>methoprene</b> concentrates in the hepatopancreas, nervous tissue and epidermal cells of the adult lobster. <b>Methoprene</b> altered the synthesis and incorporation of chitoproteins (cuticle pro...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} <b>methoprene</b> and its {{derivatives}} can stimulate gene transcription in vertebrates by acting through the retinoic acid-responsive transcription factors, the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). <b>Methoprene</b> is an insect growth regulator in domestic and agricultural {{use as a}} pesticide. At least one metabolite of <b>methoprene,</b> <b>methoprene</b> acid, directly binds to RXR and is a transcriptional activator in both insect and mammalian cells. Unlike the endogenous RXR ligand, 9 -cis-retinoic acid, this activity is RXR-specific; the <b>methoprene</b> derivatives do not activate the retinoic acid receptor pathway. <b>Methoprene</b> is a juvenile hormone analog that acts to retain juvenile characteristics during insect growth, preventing metamorphosis into an adult, {{and it has been}} shown to have ovicidal properties in some insects.
