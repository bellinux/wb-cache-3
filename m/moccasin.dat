The Plains Indians wore hard-sole <b>moccasins,</b> given that their territorial geography featured rock and cacti. The eastern Indian tribes wore soft-sole <b>moccasins,</b> for walking in leaf-covered forest ground. <b>Moccasins</b> are usually all brown, the same color.|$|R

5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} <b>moccasin,</b> but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards.

50|$|The Niitsitapi, {{also known}} as the Blackfoot or Blackfeet Indians, reside in the Great Plains of Montana and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

They had {{typically}} dyed or painted the soles of their <b>moccasins</b> black. One legendary story claimed that the Siksika walked through ashes of prairie fires, which in turn colored the bottoms of their <b>moccasins</b> black.|$|R

25|$|Many early natives in North America wore {{a similar}} type of footwear, {{known as the}} <b>moccasin.</b> These are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes {{typically}} made out of leather or bison hides. Many moccasins were also decorated with various beads and other adornments. Moccasins were not designed to be waterproof, and in wet weather and warm summer months, most Native Americans went barefoot.|$|E
25|$|About 20 matrilineal clans were {{recognized}} by the Acoma. Traditional child rearing involved very little discipline. Couples were generally monogamous and divorce was rare. Funerary rites involved ceremony and quick burial after death, followed by four days and nights of vigil. Women would wear cotton dresses and sandals or high <b>moccasin</b> boots. Traditional clothing for men involved cotton kilts and leather sandals. Rabbit and deer skin was used for clothing and robes, as well. In the seventeenth century horses {{were introduced to the}} Pueblo by the Spanish. Education was overseen by kiva headmen who taught about human behavior, spirit and body, astrology, ethics, child psychology, oratory, history, dance, and music.|$|E

25|$|Baldy Smith was {{assigned}} two brigades under Brigadier Generals William B. Hazen and John B. Turchin {{as well as}} the Engineer Brigade under Col. Timothy Robbins Stanley. Turchin's men would march overland across a bend in the Tennessee River known as <b>Moccasin</b> Point and hold the east bank at Brown's Ferry. Hazen's men had the more hazardous task. Organized into 50 squads of 21 men each (20 soldiers and 1 officer) Hazen's men would ferry down the river in pontoon boats manned by Stanley's men. A third column under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker would advance from Bridgeport, Alabama, for relief of Hazen's men if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, either June 17 or 18, {{the band}} of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the <b>moccasin</b> tracks around the property. Phillips {{decided to go to}} his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, and once inside he heard the sound of musket fire outside. Phillips, mortally wounded, fell to the ground, struck by two musket balls. The band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April Captain Charles Barnard of the American sealer Nanina was sailing off {{the shore}} of Eagle Island, with a {{discovery}} boat deployed looking for seals.

This suspicion was heightened, when the crew of the discovery boat came aboard and informed the captain they had come across a new <b>moccasin</b> as well as the partially butchered remains of a seal. At dinner that evening, the crew observed a man approaching the ship who was shortly joined by eight to ten others. Both Barnard and the survivors from the Isabella had harboured concern the other party was Spanish and were relieved to discover their respective nationalities.|$|E

25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam {{would take away}} a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and <b>Moccasin</b> powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E
