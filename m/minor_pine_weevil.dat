The adult weevil feeds on the stem-bark of young seedlings, frequently killing a large proportion of newly planted seedlings. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to investigate whether additional food supplies could decrease the damage caused by <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> to seedlings, and to determine whether access to extra food might explain why seedlings beneath shelter trees receive less damage from <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> compared to seedlings planted in a clear-cutting.

Finally, the influence of factors including fertilization, establishment and soil scarification on the growth and tolerance of Norway spruce seedlings to <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding was studied. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to seedlings was significantly reduced when extra food (fresh branches of Scots pine) was regularly provided nearby. Feeding by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> in the crowns of large trees occurred during a limited period following their migratory flight but {{did not seem to be}} sufficient enough to explain the lower feeding pressure observed on seedlings in shelterwoods over the entire season. During the first year after cutting, roots in the humus layer seemed to be an important food source but were utilized to similar extent in both clear-cuts and shelterwoods.

Before the removal of shelter trees, Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings need to have reached diameters of 10 - 12 mm in order to avoid lethal levels of damage from <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> attack. Loading Norway spruce seedlings with nutrients in the autumn before plantation did not lead to more feeding from <b>pine</b> <b>weevils.</b> Treatments that postpone the start of <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding enhanced the ability of seedlings to sustain <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage later on, probably as a result of reduced stress allowing a more rapid establishment of seedlings...|$|R

The adult <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeds on the stem bark of young seedlings, frequently killing a large proportion of newly planted seedlings. Planting beneath a shelterwood has proved to reduce <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on conifer seedlings, but the reasons for this are not yet fully understood. One suggestion that has been put forward is that the shelterwood provides alternative food sources, which are not present in clearcuts, for the weevils. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to investigate the possibility that additional food supplies could decrease damage to seedlings, to quantify <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding on roots in the humus layer and to examine the possibility that increased feeding on roots in the shelterwood could explain the observed difference in feeding damage to planted seedlings. The effect of removing shelter trees on <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to seedlings was examined in a survey study. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on seedlings was significantly reduced when extra food (fresh branches of Scots pine) was regularly provided close to the seedling. The above ground part of natural field vegetation, mainly bilberry, did not reduce the damage to the same extent. Roots in the humus layer comprised an important food resource for the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> and during the first year after cutting it was utilised to similar extents in both clearcuts and shelterwoods.

Thus, it has been proposed that planting young conifer seedlings in clear-cut areas may reduce the damage caused by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils.</b> In attempts to determine why mini seedlings appear to be less damaged by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> than “conventional” seedlings, the volatiles released by Norway spruce and Scots pine mini seedlings were investigated, since such chemicals are of great importance in herbivore-plant communication, inter alia acting as repellents, attractants or antifeedants.

The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis L.) {{is one of}} the economically most important pest insects in Europe and Asia.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on three inter-related studies: the first part deals with the {{microbial}} consortium, the identification of microbes and their volatiles, the second part deals with the study of bio-chemical control methods of two conifer pests; the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis (L.) and the root rot fungi Heterobasidion spp., and the third part describes the production of styrene by a fungus using forest waste. The large <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis L.) is an economically important pest insect of conifers in reforestation areas of Europe and Asia. The female weevils protect their eggs from feeding conspecifics by adding frass (mixture of weevil feces and chewed bark) along with the eggs. In {{order to understand the}} mechanism behind frass deposition at the egg laying site and to find repellents/antifeedants for <b>pine</b> <b>weevils,</b> microbes were isolated from the aseptically collected <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> frass. Microbial produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were collected by solid phase micro extraction and analyzed by GC-MS after cultivating them on weevil frass broth. The major VOCs were tested against <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> using a multi-choice olfactometer. Ewingella sp., Mucor racemosus, Penicillium solitum, P. expansum, Ophiostoma piceae, O. pluriannulatum, Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida sequanensis were identified as abundant microbes. Styrene, 6 -protoilludene, 1 -octene- 3 -ol, 3 -methylanisole, methyl salicylate, 2 -methoxyphenol and 2 -methoxy- 4 -vinylphenol were the VOCs of persistently isolated microbes. In behavioral bioassay, methyl salicylate, 3 -methylanisole and styrene significantly reduced the attraction of <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> to their host plant volatiles. Heterobasidion spp. are severe pathogenic fungi of conifers that cause root and butt rot in plants. Bacterial isolates were tested for the antagonistic activity against fungi on potato dextrose agar. Bacillus subtilis strains significantly inhibited the growth of H. annosum and H. parviporum. Styrene is an industrial chemical used for making polymeric products, currently produced from fossil fuel.

The damage increase in areas were the silvicultural practice is to use clear cuttings were the insects gather and breed. During egglaying the female protects her offspring by creating a cave in roots and stumps were she puts her egg and covers it with frass, a mixture of weevil feces and chewed bark. Adult <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> have been observed to feed {{on the other side of}} the egg laying site and antifeedant substance has been discovered in the feces of the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> We think it is possible that microorganisms present in the frass contribute with antifeedant/repellent substances. Little is known about the <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> associated bacteria community and their symbiotic functions. In this thesis the bacterial community is characterized in gut and frass both from <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> in different populations across Europe as well as after a 28 day long diet regime on Scots pine, silver birch or bilberry. Volatile substances produced by isolated bacteria as well as from a consortium of microorganisms were collected with solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and analyzed with GC-MS. The main volatiles were tested against <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> using a two-choice test. Wolbachia, Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia and Pseudomonas syringae was commonly associated with the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> 2 -Methoxyphenol, 2 -phenylethanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol were found in the headspace from Rahnella aquatilis when grown in substrate containing pine bark. 2 -Methoxyphenol and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, phenol and methyl salicylate were found in pine feces. Birch and bilberry feces emitted mainly linalool oxides and bilberry emitted also small amounts of 2 -phenylethanol. A second part of the thesis discusses the role of fungi in forest insect interactions and the production of oxygenated monoterpenes as possible antifeedants. Spruce bark beetles (Ips typhographus L.) aggregate with the help of pheromones and with collected forces they kill weakened adult trees as a result of associated fungi growth and larval development. A fungi associated with the bark beetle, Grosmannia europhoides, was shown to produce de novo 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol, the major component of the spruce bark beetle aggregation pheromone. Chemical defense responses against Endoconidiophora polonica and Heterobasidion parviporum were investigated using four clones of Norway spruce with different susceptibility to Heterobasidion sp.

The extent of feeding damage on seedlings and its effect on their vitality were examined in a field study in south-central Sweden and a laboratory experiment, which gave largely consistent results.

40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis), a major pest of conifer forests {{throughout}} Europe, {{feeds on}} the bark and cambium, tissues rich in terpenoid resins that are toxic to many insect herbivores. Here we report {{the ability of}} the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut microbiota to degrade the diterpene acids of Norway spruce. The diterpene acid levels present in ingested bark were substantially reduced on passage through the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut. This reduction was significantly less upon antibiotic treatment, and supplementing the diet with gut suspensions from untreated insects restored the ability to degrade diterpenes. In addition, cultured bacteria isolated from <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> guts were shown to degrade a Norway spruce diterpene acid. In a metagenomic survey of the insect′s bacterial community, we were able to annotate several genes of a previously described diterpene degradation (dit) gene cluster.

40|$|Ants {{interact}} with plants {{in various ways}} and ant presence on plants can decrease local abundance or activity of herbivores, which in turn increases plant fitness. Red wood ants (Formica rufa group) are common species in forests of northern Europe. A large part of their diet consists of honeydew produced by ant-tended arboreal aphids and ants {{have been shown to}} affect a wide range of herbivores both in tree canopies and undergrowth. The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hylobius abietis (L.), is an economically important forest pest species. Adult beetles feed on stem bark of transplanted conifer seedlings and cause severe seedling mortality in forest regeneration areas. In this thesis, interactions between ants and <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> were investigated to evaluate whether ants can affect weevils’ damage to conifer seedlings. The results showed that <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to conifer seedlings with a food source attended by ants was significantly lower (by ca. 30 %) compared to control seedlings. This effect was mainly ascribed to non-consumptive interactions i. e., the presence of ants distracted <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> from feeding. Observations of ant-weevil interactions supported this hypothesis, as ants frequently attacked <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> close to ant-attended seedlings and weevils’ locomotion behaviour increased during ant attacks. The effects of ant-attendance may be generalized to other aggressive ant species, as ant-attended seedlings visited by Lasius ants suffered lower damage by weevils compared to ant-excluded seedlings. Differences in ant abundance on the ground, however, did not affect damage to unbaited spruce seedlings, because similar feeding damage was recorded in areas with high and low abundance of red wood ants. Further, weevils’ damage to seedlings that were planted in close proximity to ant-attended seedlings was comparable to that of ant-excluded seedlings. This suggests that seedling protection by ants is probably mainly related to the ants' protection of food sources whereas abundance of ants has less effect on weevils’ feeding.

A number of studies show the importance of ants in pest management in different systems. In this study I test the hypothesis that a high density of ants reduces damage on conifer seedlings by the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> The study was conducted on two clearcut areas in the Lunsen forest S of Uppsa-la, Sweden. In total, 900 Norway spruce seedlings (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were planted (divided into plots with 25 seedlings) and different measures of the weevil’s damage were assessed, i. e. proportions of attacked and girdled seedlings, and mean feeding area. Densities of the ant species Formica polyctena and Myrmica ruginodis were obtained weekly by pitfall traps placed in each planting plot. No significant relationship between ant density and weevil damage was found when tested by means of the Spearman’s correlation.

40|$|Light {{is a major}} {{environmental}} factor that may determine the interaction between plants and herbivores in several ways, including top-down effects through changes in herbivore behavior and bottom-up effects mediated by alterations of plant physiology. Here we explored the relative contribution of these two regulation processes to {{the outcome of the}} interaction of pine trees with a major forest pest, the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis). We studied to what extent light availability influence insect feeding behavior and/or the ability of pines to produce induced defenses in response to herbivory. For this purpose, 3 -year old Pinus pinaster plants from three contrasting populations were subjected to 6 days of experimental herbivory by the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> under two levels of light availability (complete darkness or natural sunlight) independently applied to the plant and to the insect in a fully factorial design. Light availability strongly affected the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding behavior. The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> fed more and caused larger feeding scars in darkness than under natural sunlight. Besides, under the more intense levels of weevil damage (i. e., those registered with insects in darkness), light availability also affected the pine’s ability to respond to insect feeding by producing induced resin defenses. These results were consistent across the three studied populations despite they differed in weevil susceptibility and inducibility of defenses. Morocco was the most damaged population and the one that induced more defensive compounds. Overall, results indicate that light availability modulates the outcome of the pine–weevil interactions through both bottom-up and top-down regulation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Regeneration of {{northern}} conifer forests is commonly performed by reforestation with genetically improved materials obtained from long-term breeding programs focused on productivity and timber quality. Sanitary threats can, however, compromise {{the realization of}} the expected genetic gain. Including pest resistance traits in the breeding programs may contribute to a sustainable protection. Here we quantified the variation in different components of resistance of Norway spruce to its main pest, the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis. We followed insect damage in two large progeny trials (52 open-pollinated families with 100 - 200 individuals per family and trial) naturally infested by the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> <b>Pine</b> <b>weevils</b> damaged between 17 and 48 % of the planted seedlings depending on the trial and year, and mortality due to weevil damage was up to 11. 4 %. The results indicate significant genetic variation in resistance to the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> and importantly, the variation was highly consistent across trials irrespective of contrasting incidence levels. Individual heritability estimates for the different components of seedling resistance were consistently low, but family heritabilities were moderate (0. 53 to 0. 81). While forward selections and breeding for higher resistance seem not feasible, backwards selections of the best parent trees emerge as a putative alternative to reduce weevil damage. A positive genetic correlation between early growth potential and probability of being attacked by the weevil was also observed, but the relationship was weak and appeared only in one of the trials. Overall, results presented here open the door to a new attractive way for reducing damage caused by this harmful pest...|$|R
50|$|The large <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> have a {{tendency}} to attack artificially fertilized trees, especially those fertilized with phosphorus which causes greater nutritional quality of phloem for the weevils or make faster more attractive plants for the weevils due to faster growing.|$|R
40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis (L.) (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) is, economically, {{the most}} {{important}} forest pest over large areas of Europe. The adults feed on the stem bark of newly planted conifer seedlings, causing severe damage and mortality. The aim of this thesis was to obtain knowledge about behaviours of the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> associated with its feeding, which may be of use in designing measures to protect seedlings. A field experiment showed that the <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> use both olfaction and vision to find conifer seedlings. Their response to the combination of odour and visual stimuli were additive. Visual stimuli were {{at least as important}} as odour in finding an undamaged conifer seedling. Soil scarification, which usually exposes mineral soil, is widely used in Scandinavian forest regeneration. In a field experiment, half as many seedlings on mineral soil were attacked by weevils as on undisturbed humus. However, somewhat more weevils approached seedlings surrounded by mineral soil than by humus. It is concluded that the surrounding soil type strongly influences whether a <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> decides to feed on a seedling, and that this decision is taken in close proximity to the seedling. Another field experiment showed that feeding was less common on mounds of sand than on flat sand surfaces, but that there was more feeding in sandy pits. This effect of sandy slopes is attributed to the observed difficulty for the weevils to climb these slopes. Many insects spend a large proportion of their life inactive, hiding in shelters. The presence of shelters may, therefore, influence where insects feed. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> were highly attracted to shelters both above and below ground. Visual stimuli were used for orientation towards shelters. Visual stimuli also increased the probability of an individual remaining for a long period in a shelter. The presence of wind increased the weevils’ propensity to use shelters both above and below ground. The results of this thesis highlight the importance of planting seedlings in mineral soil, preferably on mounds, and of avoiding planting locations where the weevils can use above or below ground shelters in the vicinity of seedlings...|$|R

40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis (L.); Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{has a high}} {{economic}} impact on forest regeneration in Europe. The general biology of the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> has received considerable attention, but there is insufficient knowledge about its diel behaviour and time budget. Therefore, the feeding and locomotion behaviour of individual adult weevils on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings is observed for 24 hour-periods in the laboratory. Both girdled and non-girdled seedlings are used to assess how the weevils’ behaviour {{is influenced by the}} plants physiological response to the girdling. The locomotion pattern shows a distinct maximum during the beginning of the dark phase whereas most feeding occurs {{during the second half of}} the dark phase and the first hours of the subsequent light phase. The girdling treatment increase the time that weevils spend on the seedlings during the first part of an observation session, but has no effect on their feeding pattern. The weevils’ time budgets on girdled and non-girdled seedlings are similar. On average, they spend 34 % of their time in locomotion and 6 % on feeding. Females spend more time feeding than males (7. 1 % vs. 4. 2 %), possibly because they have higher food requirements, e. g. for egg production. Females also spend more time in total on the seedlings than males (26. 3 % vs. 7. 0 %). This study reveals, in high temporal resolution, the diel feeding and locomotion behaviour and time budget of male and female <b>pine</b> <b>weevils...</b>|$|R
