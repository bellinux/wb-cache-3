40|$|We present simple, {{analytic}} {{solutions to}} the Einstein-Maxwell equation, which describe an arbitrary number of charged black holes in a spacetime with a positive cosmological constant Λ. In the limit Λ= 0, these solutions reduce to the well-known Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) solutions. Like the MP solutions, each black hole in a Λ 3 ̆e 0 solution has charge Q equal to its mass M, up to a possible overall sign. Unlike the Λ= 0 limit, however, solutions with Λ 3 ̆e 0 are highly dynamical. The black holes move with respect to one another, following natural trajectories in the background de Sitter spacetime. Black holes moving apart eventually go out of causal contact. Black holes on approaching trajectories ultimately <b>merge.</b> To <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> these solutions give the first analytic description of coalescing black holes. Likewise, the thermodynamics of the Λ 3 ̆e 0 solutions is quite interesting. Taken individually, a |Q|=M black hole is in thermal equilibrium with the background de Sitter Hawking radiation. With more than one black hole, because the solutions are not static, no global equilibrium temperature can be defined. In appropriate limits, however, when the black holes are either close together or far apart, approximate equilibrium states are established...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{learning}} approach for the merging process in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR). To conduct the learning approach, we also present {{a large number}} of features that may influence the MLIR merging process; these features are mainly extracted from three levels: query, document, and translation. After the feature extraction, we then use the FRank ranking algorithm to construct a <b>merge</b> model; to <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> this practice is the first attempt to use a learning-based ranking algorithm to construct a merge model for MLIR <b>merging.</b> In <b>our</b> experiments, three test collections for the task of crosslingual information retrieval (CLIR) in NTCIR 3, 4, and 5 are employed to assess the performance of our proposed method; moreover, several merging methods are also carried out for a comparison, including traditional merging methods, the 2 -step merging strategy, and the merging method based on logistic regression. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve merging quality on two different types of datasets. In addition to the effectiveness, through the merge model generated by FRank, our method can further identify key factors that influence the merging process; this information might provide us more insight and understandingintoMLIRmerging...|$|R
40|$|We present PFDCMSS, a novel message-passing based {{parallel}} algorithm for mining time-faded heavy hitters. The {{algorithm is}} a parallel {{version of the}} recently published FDCMSS sequential algorithm. We formally prove its correctness by showing that the underlying data structure, a sketch augmented with a Space Saving stream summary holding exactly two counters, is mergeable. Whilst mergeability of traditional sketches derives immediately from theory, we show that <b>merging</b> <b>our</b> augmented sketch is non trivial. Nonetheless, the resulting parallel algorithm is fast and simple to implement. To the best of <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> PFDCMSS is the first parallel algorithm solving the problem of mining time-faded heavy hitters on message-passing parallel architectures. Extensive experimental results confirm that PFDCMSS retains the extreme accuracy and error bound provided by FDCMSS whilst providing excellent parallel scalability.

40|$|We {{present a}} hybrid model {{combining}} {{two types of}} probabilistic forecast, a kernel density estimation (KDE) and a quantile regression, {{as part of the}} load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom 2014). The KDE method is initially implemented with a time-decay parameter. We later improve this method by conditioning on the temperature or the period of the week variables to provide more accurate forecasts. Secondly, we develop a simple but effective quantile regression forecast. The novel aspects of our methodology are two-fold. First, we introduce symmetry into the time-decay parameter of the kernel density estimation based forecast and secondly we <b>merge</b> <b>our</b> forecasts with a weighted combination of the three main forecasts with different weights for different periods of the month, which, to <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> has not been applied to electricity load forecasts before...|$|R
