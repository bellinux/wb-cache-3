40|$|Sex {{differences}} are often reported in spatial abilities. However, some studies show conflicting results, {{which can be}} ascribed {{to the complexity of}} the variables involved in the visuo-spatial domain. Until a few years ago, it was widely accepted that men outperformed women on almost all spatial tasks. However, recently some studies [A. Postma, G. Jager, R. P. C. Kessels, H. P. F. Koppeschaar, J. van Honk, Sex differences for selective forms of spatial memory, Brain Cogn. 54 (2004) 24 - 34; D. H. <b>McBurney,</b> <b>S.</b> J. C. Gaulin, T. Devineni, C. Adams, Superior spatial memory of women: stronger evidence for the gathering hypothesis, Evol. Hum. Behav. 18 (1997) 165 - 174; Q. Rahman, G. D. Wilson, S. Abrahams, Sexual orientation related differences in spatial memory, J. Int. Neuropsychol. Soc. 9 (2003) 376 - 383] found sex differences for selective forms of spatial memory and described a female advantage in specific spatial abilities. In this paper, we studied sex differences by testing object locations and route memories with the Corsi Block-Tapping test (CBT), one of the non-verbal tasks most used in clinical settings, and its modified, large-scale version. Our results showed a performance advantage for males in both tests and a more homogeneous pattern of memory in females. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{laparoscopic surgery}} {{underwent}} a huge investment {{from both the}} clinical and research points of view to perform classic procedures through a single (<b>S)</b> <b>incision</b> or single port, resulting {{in the development of}} different instruments and ports. The main advantage of the S-access laparoscopy (SAL) is cosmesis. Future investigations will provide other potential advantages, such as improvement in postoperative pain and patient satisfaction. We report our initial experience on 115 patients utilizing a SAL (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, incisional hernia repair, Nissen fundoplication, upper gastrointestinal surgery, diagnostic laparoscopy, hepatic resection, splenectomy), along with the new curved reusable instruments (Karl Storz-Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany). The curves of the instruments enable the surgeon to work in an ergonomic position similar to classic laparoscopy, establishing a working triangulation inside the abdomen as well as outside. The cost of SAL is similar to classic laparoscopy as only reusable products are used. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In mountainous landscapes {{throughout}} the world bedrock dominated river channels record {{a history of the}} tectonic and climatic evolution of the drainage basins that contain them. In traditional analysis of river profiles, uplift and erosion are considered to be in balance in a steady state. In this study the transient state of a drainage basin is explored and numerically modeled, where a Gaussian shaped pulse of tectonic uplift overwhelms the river 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incision</b> and forces a diversion of the drainage network. I review the derivation of and use the detachment limited stream power equation to execute a model to find the physical condition that produce these dramatic drainage response. The Eel River and the unique tectonics of the nearby Mendocino Triple Junction, a well-researched case study in this phenomenon, provide context and parameters. The results of my models suggest that a rapid increase in uplift and a low erosion factor are the two most important conditions for a diversion response...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the learning needs expressed by women who experienced an abdominal hysterectomy and the teaching provided these women by advanced practice nurses. The women were followed from one to two days post-surgery until eight weeks post-hospital discharge. The data for this study were collected as part of a larger research program grant on early discharge and nurse specialist care at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing from 1988 to 1991. One of the three original studies investigated Early Discharge and Nurse Specialist Follow up Care of Women Having Hysterectomies. The women were followed by advanced practices nurses and received hospital visits, home visits, and telephone contacts. An integration of Orem 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Care Framework and Knowles 2 ̆ 7 Andragogy Theory of adult learning was used to guide this study. ^ The sample consisted of 56 nursing process recordings kept for the early discharge patients. The secondary analysis of content included the process recordings of women who had a hysterectomy for benign or pre-cancerous reasons. The process recordings were coded for expressed learning needs, and teaching provided by the advanced practice nurses. There were 1597 learning needs identified. To summarize, the learning needs were placed into 83 lower level categories according to their similarities and differences. The lower level categories were further collapsed into 14 higher level categories. The most frequent higher level learning needs were issues surrounding the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incision</b> and women 2 ̆ 7 s activity level. Teaching was provided 6014 times. The teaching provided was placed into 95 lower level categories and further collapsed into 17 higher level categories. The most frequently taught items were issues surrounding activity levels, the role of the advance practice nurse in the study, and women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incisions.</b> When possible, examination of paired learning needs categories and teaching provided categories were conducted. In 57 of the 65 learning/teaching pairs relationships were found to be non-significant (p 3 ̆c. 05). These findings suggest that the teaching was provided at the time the learning needs occurred. ...|$|R

40|$|Sign {{language}} typology is {{the systematic}} {{comparative study of}} linguistic structures across sign languages, and {{has emerged as a}} separate linguistic sub-discipline over the past 15 years. It is situated at the crossroads between linguistic typology and sign language linguistics, the latter itself a relatively young discipline with its roots in the 1960 s and 70 <b>s</b> (<b>McBurney</b> 2001). The cross-fertilisation initiated by the advent of sign language typology is obvious: Typologists gain an entirely new dimension in their study of linguistic diversity, and sign language linguists gain a rich tool box of concepts and methods for discovering typological patterns across sign languages. Beyond theory and methodology, the impact that sign language typology research has on the deaf communities who are the primary users of these languages is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 discusses some areas in which sign language typology has made unique contributions to linguistic theory and has prompted discussions that may otherwise not have come to the surface...|$|R
40|$|Channel {{evolution}} was analysed {{along the}} Brenta River (Northern Italy) using historical maps, aerial photographs and cross sections. The study reach, from Bassano to S. Giorgio in Bosco, {{is in the}} Upper Venetian Plain and is 23 km long. The fluvial processes and channel adjustments {{that occurred in the}} Brenta River are strongly connected to various human interventions, such as sediment mining, which was very intense in the study reach between the 1950 s {{and the beginning of the}} 1980 s, dams and other interventions carried out both in the drainage basin and along the river. Notwithstanding some differences within the study reach, the following reconstruction can be drawn as for channel adjustments. During the first period, from the 1950 s to the beginning of the 1980 <b>s,</b> channel <b>incision</b> (up to 7 - 8 m) and narrowing (about 50 %) were the dominant processes, whereas in the more recent period (approximately the last 20 years) bed-level changes have had a lower magnitude (besides aggradation has occurred more frequently than incision) and channel widening has taken place. From cross sections was estimated that 30, 7 million m 3 of sediments were removed/eroded from the river bed in the period 1932 - 1997, but most of that process took place from the early 1950 s to early 1980 s, when sediment mining was very intense...|$|R
30|$|Under {{brachial plexus}} block an <b>S</b> italic skin <b>incision</b> was {{performed}} on the dorso-ulnar surface of the wrist; the deep dissection showed a circumscribed and well-cleavable lesion like a tenosynovitis of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) without a pedicle joint that was removed en bloc. Surprisingly, the pathologist found a 20 -mm diameter, well-circumscribed and multilobulated tumor: each lobule was composed of abundant myxoid stroma with cellular elements in part fusal, in part epithelial and in part giant; all lobules showed a tendency to confluence but there was no cellular polymorphism or nuclear hyperchromia. Margins were tumor free. With immunohistochemistry there was positivity to vimentin but S 100 -protein, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin AE 1 - 3, CD 99 and CD 34 were all negative. There was a mitotic activity of 7  % (Ki 67). This pattern suggested a myxoid tumor form of neurothekeoma, mixed subtype.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hyperthrophic scar and keloid is a {{big problem}} after many operation. Hypertrophic scar {{depended}} on many factor one of them is Incision. &# 13; Method: This is a randomized clinical trial and sequential sampling in Alzahra hospital and Kashani hospital. we selected two groups, one group we used <b>S</b> shape <b>incision</b> and observed group linear incision. Age was between 10 - 30 years and dermatological problems and cigaret smoking was Negative in two groups perforated and secondly skin closure was excluded in our study. patient divided in two group each group was twenty and fllowed for one year. Patients satisfaction and skin collor normality and itchiny was evaluated in two groups. &# 13; Results: Appearance of scar was different in collor much and shape. Normality for collor of <b>incision</b> in <b>s</b> shape groups were 68. 4 % but in linar incision was 31. 6 % (Pvalue= 0. 026) with statically meaningful. Mean of scar width: In 5 -shape = 1. 33 + 0. 49 mm in Linear shape = 2. 23 + 0. 92. P = 0. 001. Prevalence of itching was same in both groups. &# 13; Discussion: patients overall satisfaction and itching were the same for both groups. skin color normality was 68. 4 % in 5 shape incision groups versus 31. 6 % in linear incision groups which {{has been shown to be}} statistically meaningful using chi-square test so it seems reasonable to conclude that calor mathing is more favorable in 5 shape incisions rather than linear incision. Mean of scare width in licear incision group was 2. 23 + 0. 92 mm versus 1. 32 + 0. 49 mm in 5 shape incision group. this difference is also statistically meaningful using T test. 50 it can be concluded that using 5 shape incision is better because post operative scar is smaller and exposure is like linear incision...|$|R
40|$|Background. {{the skin}} neurogenic {{inflammation}} is mainly related to Substance P (SP) and Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide (CGRP). There is no data on their availability in {{the dynamics of}} skin nerve endings, concerning their release and replenishment after a nociceptive stimulus, so this was investigated. Materials and methods. 25 rats were randomly distributed in 5 groups. the animals of the control group (CG) determined the baseline levels of neuropeptides in the skin. the groups S 0 and S 30 did not receive any cutaneous stimulus at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. in the group <b>S</b> 1, an <b>incision</b> stimulus was made at 30 minutes. in the group S 31, a nociceptive stimulus was performed by subdermal scratching at 30 minutes and, at 60 minutes, the incision stimulus {{was carried out in}} the same location (nociceptive hyperstimulation). the skin samples of the other animals were harvested from the back 1 minute after their death. SP, pro-CGRP and CGRP were quantified by Western Blotting. Results. the incision stimulus released SP, S 1 compared to S 0 (p < 0. 05) detected in the first minute, and the replenishment time was more than 30 minutes. Also, it cleaved pro-CGRP, S 1 compared to S 31 (p < 0. 05) in the first minute, and its replenishment time less than 30 minutes. Release of CGRP was not detected. Conclusion. the incision released SP already detected in the first minute; its replenishment time is more than 30 minutes. the incision decreased pro-CGRP, also detected in the first minute; and its replenishment time is less than 30 minutes.

40|$|Intimal {{hyperplasia}} {{development in}} the downstream anastomosis of a peripheral bypass grafts {{has been the subject}} of much investigation due to its site specific focal development at specific sites within the junction. Compliance mismatch between the synthetic graft and host artery is seen as a major cause of intimal hyperplasia formation along the suture line of synthetic graft/host artery anastomoses, with wall stress, wall shear stress, and local mass transport also playing an important role in intimal hyperplasia formation. The majority of previously published computational and experimental analyses focus on flow dynamics and the distribution of wall shear stress at distal End-To-Side bypass anastomoses. Studies associated with anastomotic mechanics and associated wall stress have reported abnormal wall stress at graft/artery anastomoses associated over excessive response by arterial tissue to the aforementioned stresses may correlate to intimal hyperplasia formation at anastomotic sites. The aim of this study is to further investigate abnormal wall stresses at the synthetic graft/artery anastomoses and to correlate abnormal wall stresses to sites of intimal hyperplasia formation at the distal End-To-Side anastomosis of the femoropopliteal system. To this end, computational investigation was undertaken to examine mechanical factors affecting the wall stresses of the arterial tissue at anastomoses. These mechanical factors included variations in geometry and compliance mismatch between the graft and host artery. Results show that abnormal wall stresses exist at the suture line of End-To-Side anastomoses, and the geometry of an idealised End-To-Side anastomosis significantly affect these abnormal wall stresses. Peak abnormal equivalent Cauchy stress magnitudes reach a peak are 113 times baseline values along the suture line, with an average deviation of 38 times baseline equivalent Cauchy stress across the suture line of an idealised End-To-Side anastomosis. This large deviation of wall stress deviation correlates to intimal hyperplasia formation at the suture line, which is reportedly induced by compliance mismatch between the graft and host artery. To quantify the affect of compliance mismatch, a compliant graft was employed at an idealised End-To-Side anastomosis. Abnormal equivalent Cauchy stress magnitudes were significantly reduced across the suture line, with the average and peak equivalent Cauchy stress reduced by 46. 58 % and 32. 99 %, respectively. But significant abnormal wall stresses are still present at the suture line with a compliance matching graft, with approximately 16 and 46 fold increase for average and peak abnormal equivalent Cauchy stress. The Prolong°R bypass graft was considered as an alternative arterial bypass configuration to the End-To-Side procedure. The analysis included four different configurations of End-To-End anastomoses, including a novel technique for joining synthetic grafts to host arterial tissue, which comes in the form of an <b>S</b> shaped <b>incision</b> (S-cut). Resolved abnormal wall stresses along the suture line for the four different End-To-End configurations were compared to the resolved abnormal wall stresses along the suture line of the End-To-Side anastomosis. It was demonstrated that a percentage reduction for the normalised equivalent Cauchy stress of 85. 77 %, 78 %, 77. 77 %, and 74. 11 %, for the Planar, Bevel, S-cut 1, and S-cut 2 anastomosis configurations was achieved for the Prolong°R graft when compared to the idealised End-To-Side anastomosis. It is common perception that the compliance mismatch between the graft and the host artery is a major cause of graft failure. In the case of the distal End-To-Side nastomosis, this study has shown that it is the geometry that influences the wall stresses the most, and that a compliance matching graft material reduces abnormal wall stress of the arterial tissue, but they still do not approach the idealised healthy case of a healthy arterial vessel...|$|R
