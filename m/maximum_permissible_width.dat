40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} {{the presence}} of explosive gas atmospheres have to be specially designed to prevent them from igniting the explosive gas. Flameproof design implies that electrical components producing incendiary electrical sparks, e. g. relays and switches, be contained in enclosures that not only withstand the maximum pressure of an internal gas explosion. In addition any holes or slits in the enclosure wall have to be designed {{in such a way that}} they will not transmit a gas explosion inside the enclosure to an explosive gas atmosphere outside it. Designs of a variety of flameproof enclosure joints, including plane flanged joints, are specified in detail in international standards (IEC) requiring that the maximum permissible average roughness of any flame gap surface has to be < 6. 3 μm. The standards also require that any damaged joint surface has to be restored to the original quality prescribed in standards (IEC). However, the standards do not provide any guidance as to what level of damage is considered significant. As a result even minor mechanical or corrosive damage of flame path surfaces gives rise to expensive overhaul and repair of flame proof apparatuses. In fact, this is mandatory in spite of the fact that a generous safety factor is included in the requirements to maximum permissible gap widths. For example, for the plane-flange configuration and explosive gas (propane) used in the present investigation, the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>width</b> in a practical apparatus is only 0. 4 mm, whereas the real limiting value is 0. 92 mm. The purpose of the present investigation has been to obtain some experimental guidance as to what level of damage of flame gap surfaces is required to significantly reduce the flame-proofing effect of flame gaps in flameproof electrical apparatuses. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width between the two parts of a circular plane joint of 25 mm breadth in a standardized test, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to an outside explosive gas mixtures. Normally the purpose of MESG experiments is to compare MESGs of different gases and vapours, using the same smooth flame gap surface in all experiments. However, in the present investigation MESG has been used as a parameter for judging whether various kinds of significant damage of the gap surface had any noticeable effect on the ability of the flame gap to prevent flame transmission. A significant reduction of MESG compared with that obtained with a standard undamaged surface (standard roughness of < 6. 3 μm) would mean that the particular type of damage under test had destroyed the gap efficiency significantly. On the other hand a significant increase of MESG compared with that for the undamaged surface would mean the damage had in fact significantly increased the gap efficiency. In the experiments performed in the present work premixed 4. 2 vol. % propane in air was used as the test gas mixture in all the experiments. Two different apparatuses were used, viz. a plane circular-flange apparatus (PCFA) and a plane rectangular-slit apparatus (PRSA). For both apparatuses the optimal distance between the ignition point and the gap entrance for flame transmission was 14 mm. Consequently this distance was used in all the experiments. The flame gap surfaces were damaged mechanically by [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 the ECC {{examined}} {{the impact of}} pulsed Low-Duty Cycle (LDC) UWB signals {{on the quality of}} various services (FTP, VoIP, video streaming) provided via a fixed WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 d) link, and published its findings in ECC Report 94 [1]. The resulting spectrum regulation and standardization stipulate a maximum UWB activity (Ton) of 50 ms per second, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pulse <b>width</b> of 5 ms. Report 94 showed that for activity factors of 5 % there was no measurable impact on any of the victim services if a minimum distance of 4 meters (LOS) between the UWB interferer and the WiMAX terminal was maintained. As fixed WiMAX terminals are typically mounted outdoors in elevated positions the isolation between a WiMAX terminal and LDC UWB devices will in most cases be sufficiently high to avoid interference. Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 e- 2005) terminals, however, may be operating indoors, in close vicinity to a UWB device. On the other hand, mobile WiMAX was designed to be more robust against fading and interference than fixed WiMAX. The objective of the measurement campaign described in this document was to determine the impact of UWB LDC signals on different types of services provided by a mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 e- 2005, further on referred to as “WiMAX”) victim system, and in particular to examine LDC pulses with a width of more than 5 ms, whilst maintaining an overall activity limit of 5 %, equalling 50 ms per second.

40|$|Extending {{the life}} of the HFIR {{pressure}} vessel from 26 to 50 EFPY (100 MW) requires an updated calculation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure for a range in vessel operating temperatures (40 - 120 F). The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure is calculated using the equal-potential method, which takes advantage of knowledge gained from periodic hydrostatic proof tests and uses the test conditions (pressure, temperature, and frequency) as input. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure decreases with increasing time between hydro tests but is increased each time a test is conducted. The minimum values that occur just prior to a test either increase or decrease with time, depending on the vessel temperature. The minimum value of these minimums is presently specified as the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure. For three vessel temperatures of particular interest (80, 88, and 110 F) and a nominal time of 3. 0 EFPY(100 MVV) between hydro tests, these pressures are 677, 753, and 850 psi. For the lowest temperature of interest (40 F), the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure is 295 psi...|$|R

40|$|Commonly used compact {{fluorescent}} lamps (CFLs) with electronic gear are characterized by extremely distorted current, with total harmonic distortion (THD) usually exceeding 100 %. That is why they cause a significant voltage distortion in electrical installations. The principal goal {{of this research was}} to determine their <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> share in the total load installed for commercial customers, at which voltage distortion is still acceptable (according to international standards). An analysis regarding a low-voltage electrical installation of a hotel, representing a typical commercial customer, showed that <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> share should not exceed 10 %. As this <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> share could restrict the installment of the intended quantity of CFLs, the costs of two possible solutions for this problem - the use of filters or a new generation of CFLs with a high power factor - are compared.
