Not all of the country could get access to the BBC and ITVs signals, so they were introduced to television by the new Irish television service Teilifís Éireann, by the time the 1960 Broadcasting Act had been produced around 50,000 television set had been sold in Ireland. During this time Ireland experienced economic growth and the beginnings of Community Antenna Television (CATV) or Cabled television broadcasts. RTÉ set up their relays service for viewers in Ballymun providing both the BBC and Ulster Television on their service known as RTÉ Relays.

50|$|In the 1990s, cable {{providers}} {{began to}} invest heavily {{in this new}} <b>multi-channel</b> digital <b>TV</b> technology to expand the number of channels and services available to subscribers. Increased competition and programming choices from Direct-broadcast satellite services such as DirecTV, Dish Network, and PrimeStar caused cable providers to seek new ways to provide more programming.

40|$|At a {{stage of}} major change of {{television}} landscapes (digital <b>TV,</b> <b>multi-channels,</b> mobile <b>TV</b> on cellphones) the book revolves around {{the impact of the}} presence of television in our daily life over the past fifty years. The author places at the centre of her analysis the human experience of place and time, {{and the way in which}} the medium has dramatically modified it. Connection; mobility; plurality; liveness. Television can establish links between individuals and distant events; make invisible meetings to happen and imagined communities to exist; create conditions for vicarious journeys to far away places; act as a genuine multiplier of opportunities and indirect social experience; flatter the human desire to transcend time boundaries. All this in turn flow into the ‘imagination’, conceived as the big engine that drives modern mediatized society – television supplying ample fuel for this purpose. The Age of Television. Experiences and theories, is in its own special way a book of theory. Each chapter draws on classic concepts and theories of television – from the flow to media events and media imperialism – but without any undue reverence. The author is engaged in demonstrating how theories are knowledge tools at the same time crucial and flexible, open to criticism and to reworking in a new context...|$|R

Among many genres, such as music and film, this paper focuses on Korean TV dramas as they are the most important driving force in the Korean Wave industries. By examining push and pull factors in both importing and exporting countries, it indicates that in Vietnam and Thailand, the carefully-planned strategic economic support of the Korean government for these industries and the rapid expansion of <b>multi-channel</b> <b>TV</b> and multi-media industries, which are in want of attractive content, are the most important factors that have contributed to the Hallyu expansion...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>multi-channel</b> <b>TV</b> services, a {{prohibited}} amount of IPTV program contents becomes available to user’s sides. Furthermore, the number of IPTV service providers is rapidly increasing over internets. Therefore such information overload requires large amounts of efforts for users to search and navigate the program contents that they like to watch. In this paper, we incorporate collective intelligence by utilizing collaborative filtering (CF) for grouping community users to recommend user’s preferred (IP) TV programs so that the users can easily find and watch their preferred contents with significantly reduced efforts. The CF is performed {{in conjunction with a}} previous probabilistic framework but incorporates similarity-based grouping in terms of the attributes of IPTV programs for which each program is modeled as an n-tuple item with genre, actors/actress, channels, emission times, user’s ages and genders etc. So the item-user relevance of each user group becomes trustier. We also incorporate the time weighting factor into program preference computation which leads to reflecting timely changing user preference on (IP) TV programs. Experimental results show that proposed scheme yields 86. 4 % of prediction accuracy for top 5 recommended programs...|$|E

Australia 2 ̆ 7 s biggest TV audiences have come not in the ancient past, but recently - the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony, the biggest audience for an event shown on a single channel, and Princess Diana’s funeral, shown across four networks in 1997, which, like her wedding, attracted about four in five Australian TV households. The policy-making parents of these global media synchronisers, however, have been proclaiming the end of mass media. They’ve been celebrating the expansion of traditional media outlets, such as new radio stations, the arrival of new media, such as <b>multi-channel</b> pay <b>TV</b> and the internet, and the alleged decline {{of the power of the}} moguls. They’ve concluded it’s high time for some loosening of the rules that restrict how much media any one mogul can control. Australia’s looming contribution to the current global policy thought is to show that it, too, is big enough to tolerate some ownership consolidation. It 2 ̆ 7 s not entirely clear why. The domestic restrictions that are argued to have cramped the global ambitions of Australia’s restless mini-moguls don’t seem to have kept Rupert Murdoch at home, or Britain’s Daily Mail Group (which owns about a third of the country’s commercial radio stations) or Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s Singtel (which controls Optus) away. Cross-media limits do not seem to have stopped Big Brother integrating elements of television, radio, print, mobile telephony, and the web, or Fairfax, owner of the Age, incorporating audio and video into its online activities. Activities and services can be creatively converged without also converging ownership. The internet has greatly increased access to different viewpoints, a fact strikingly demonstrated during the Iraq war. But that is a positive and exciting thing, long overdue in Australia’s already concentrated media market place, not a reason to throw in the towel on diversity of control of the still-most-used media forms - free-to-air television, radio and daily newspapers. What is truly bewildering is that Australia’s four independent senators, whose votes would be enough to get the new laws over the line, appear to be considering various deals on the issue. Of course, media proprietors are persuasive people. But we need to be cautious before believing everything they tell us, even about what will serve their own interests - much less the public interest. The last time Australia had a big change in its media ownership rules, when the cross-media rules were passed in 1987 and just about every media asset in the country changed hands at absurd prices, the television and radio industries were plunged into debt-ridden catastrophe. That Hawke government legislation got through the Senate with the support of rogue Queensland National Party senators who split from the federal party as premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen launched his ‘Joh for PM’ campaign. The trivial concessions they extracted from the government have long since disappeared into history. What they got, for all its flaws, was legislation that trebled the number of commercial TV services in major regional markets in the eastern states, and ensured that different people would control the major media outlets in any area. What the legislation now before Parliament offers is no wholly new services, but the opportunity for consolidation of ownership of existing services. The one certain result is that, if it were to pass, there would soon be fewer owners of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s media enterprises. It 2 ̆ 7 s a recipe for increased media concentration, pure and simple.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of free-to-air digital TV {{has been an}} utter failure, writes Jock GivenBY ALL measures, TV was a superb technology for its time,? wrote American George Gilder in 1990. ?Indeed, its presence and properties defined the time. But now its time is over. ?Eight years later, Australia?s communications minister Richard Alston thought otherwise. He announced {{a new kind of}} TV ? digital TV. It would offer ?a quantum leap in television technology? providing the capacity for the humble TV set to become a central information point in every home?. Metropolitan services began on 1 January 2001. When bills proposing changes to Alston?s regime were introduced a fortnight ago, senators were told: ?Conversion to digital is the most fundamental change in broadcasting since the {{introduction of}} television itself 50 years ago. ?So is this medium dead or alive? Clearly very much alive, if you count the roughly three hours a day the average Australian spends watching it. But {{if you look at the}} take-up of Alston?s new kind of TV, you might think George Gilder was closer to the mark. In March, five years after its introduction, fewer than one in five Australian households had bought a set-top box to receive free-to-air digital TV, although there are many models now available for under $ 200. It?s not that they aren?t interested in using their TVs this way. About a quarter now get pay TV and most of those are digital subscribers, despite the fact that it is much more expensive than free-to-air digital TV. The $ 200 that buys a set-top box and ongoing access to all free-to-air digital services transmitted in an area, funds just a few months of Foxtel or Austar?s digital basic packages. Three-quarters of households have DVD players, also readily available for less than $ 200, and happily spend more money buying or renting discs. That?s the kind of take-up rate needed for digital TV if the government is to meet its original timetable for shutting down the analogue TV transmissions we?ve been watching for 50 years. What went wrong? First, some underestimated the strength of free-to-air television, as a leisure activity and a business, in a country where three commercial competitors and two public broadcasters provided a wider range of services than many countries enjoyed before <b>multi-channel</b> pay <b>TV</b> arrived. Second, the government placed too many restrictions on what those allocated spectrum for digital TV could do with it; nor did it do enough to ensure people other than incumbent broadcasters got the chance to offer new services. Third, consumers were not as easily seduced as policy-makers by the promise of a digital revolution. They sized up the options and the relative prices and made sensible choices. Free-to-air digital TV, Australian-style, has been a turkey. A bit of high-definition programming, though rarely in sport; an extra TV channel each from the ABC and SBS, put together on shoestrings; some radio-on-your-TV; limited interactivity. In Melbourne, there is still no single on-screen program guide covering all networks ? the basic building block of any sophisticated TV system. And if you do move to digital, you lose access to the community channel, Channel 31, because it?s transmitted only in analogue. The bills now before the Senate propose changes. Some will help: removing restrictions on the programs the ABC and SBS can carry on their extra channels; allowing commercial networks to run separate programs in high definition and standard definition from the start of next year and to introduce another channel from 2009. More changes, to be included in further legislation, are designed to get to air two wholly new services. One will offer ?datacasting? and ?narrowcasting? services to households, although we still don?t know exactly what this will include. The other will transmit mobile TV to people, though new handsets will be required to receive both the video content already available on 3 G phones, and the new mobile TV services, which will use different technology. There is still not enough in this to allow the potential of digital TV to be fully explored. No more broadcast TV to households, just datacast and narrowcast. No major live sport on the new multi-channels. The government is still trying to micro-manage the use of uncertain technology. But it is not nearly so careful about who gets to use it. It is allowing the powerful players that are already well positioned in the multi-channel future, including Foxtel, Telstra, News Limited and PBL (owners of the Nine Network), to acquire more spectrum. At the same time, it is proposing the liberalisation of ownership rules, whose impact is certain ? more consolidated power in an already concentrated media landscape. The government is too radical on ownership but too cautious on digital TV. It is time to stop tiptoeing around TV?s future, crafting complex new deals between media players, the logic and impact of which will be lost on anyone with a lazy few dollars to spend at Harvey Norman or Clive Peeters. ?Jock Given is the author of Turning off the Television: Broadcasting?s Uncertain Future.

40|$|The Productivity Commission is right, says Margaret Simons. Datacasting is no {{more than}} a "a {{regulatory}} artifice" DATACASTING has become the key to assessing the success or otherwise of the federal government?s attempts to push Australia into the digital age. So what on earth is it? The answer, I?m afraid, is that datacasting is bullshit. Or, as the Productivity Commission put it in its 2000 report, datacasting is ?a regulatory artifice?. Nevertheless, for a while it looked as though we should make the best of it. In early drafts of Senator Helen Coonan?s media reform package the two new datacasting licences to be made available next year looked like the only big benefit for consumers in the short term, and the main means by which she would try to shoehorn some diversity into the media landscape while keeping the existing free to air networks if not happy then at least manageably disgruntled. Six months ago I wrote for Crikey. com. au that these licenses were crucial in deciding whether or not the outcome of Coonan?s reforms would be an acceptable compromise between the politically possible and the public interest. I still believe they are crucial ? but the signs have all gone the wrong way. With opposition within the Coalition government hardening, most commentators are now predicting that Coonan?s package of reforms will not proceed, or at least not in their entirety. Senator Coonan is pushing on regardless, and is reported by those in the know to be very determined indeed. Her latest show of grit was on Tuesday 3 rd of October, when she gave a speech insisting that she wanted her legacy to be ?the new services that emerge for Australian consumers ? whether it is new digital channels, digital <b>multi-channels</b> or mobile <b>TV.</b> ? But what is she actually talking about? What new services are in the offing? In the immediate future, the answer is simple: two new datacasting licences, and nothing else. Why is datacasting important? The answer lies in understanding the sad history of the government?s attempts to persuade Australians to invest in digital broadcasting technology. Digital broadcasting is important because it uses spectrum much more efficiently than the old analogue methods. If all Australian television stations were able to switch off analogue tomorrow, vast amounts of spectrum would be opened up, meaning that dozens, probably hundreds, of new services could be offered. Existing television stations could offer multiple channels. More importantly for diversity, the justification for preventing new entrants would disappear. There is, in theory, an era of media plenty just around the corner. Failing to make the transition to digital broadcasting would be a disaster ? the modern day equivalent of choosing the telegraph over the telephone. But the problem is that Australians have not yet invested in enough digital televisions and set top boxes to receive digital signals, and this makes it impossible to switch off the analogue signal. All this is largely the Government?s fault, and in particular the fault of Coonan?s predecessor, Senator Richard Alston, who in 1998 was responsible for what has been described as one of the worst packages of policy ever presented by an Australian government. Then, as now, the government was trying to give Australians an incentive to invest in the technology, but at the same time avoid annoying the existing television moghuls ? Packer in particular. The Packer organisation, which owns Channel Nine, feared multichannelling and new entrants because they would fragment the audience and undermine the ability to charge advertisers big dollars for access to mass audiences. The government was therefore left with the impossible task of trying to provide for new digital services to encourage uptake of technology, without threatening the free to air television business model. The result was a ban on a fourth digital television network, and also a ban on multichannelling, except for the public broadcasters, ABC and SBS. They were to be allowed a multichannel subject to ?genre restrictions? so heavy that any prospect of taking audiences from free to air commercial television was eliminated. Packer was appeased. But how was the government to encourage uptake of technology when there was no new content on offer? Datacasting was the answer ? digital broadcasting using exactly the same technology as digital television, but defined by government regulations restricting what it could be used for. Datacasting was not to include sport, or comprehensive news services, or drama. In short, as the media commentator Mark Day has put it, it must not include anything that people might actually want to watch. The result was so unattractive that when the spectrum was put up for auction in 2000, there were no bidders. Coonan has now admitted that this was the government?s fault. The regulations were too restrictive. Not surprisingly, only a few Australians bought digital televisions and set top boxes, meaning that eight years later the government has been forced to push forward the date for analogue switch off from 2008 to 2010 ? 12 ? and there is no reason to think that date will stick, either. Enter Senator Helen Coonan. When she released her first discussion paper in March this year, it looked as though she would do her best to unwind the Alston ?reforms? as well as relaxing cross media ownership regulations. I for one thought there might well be an acceptable result. If the public interest were the only consideration, Coonan would surely do what the Productivity Commission recommended back in 2000 ? drop the datacasting nonsense and get on with the business of opening up the spectrum to new services and new entrants. Multichannelling should be permitted, and a fourth digital-only television licence granted to a new player. But no politician will lightly threaten the business model of the commercial television organisations from which most Australians get their news and information. So that left datacasting as the main wriggle room, and on this Coonan made hopeful noises. First, she said the definition of datacasting should be broadened. Second, she said the spectrum should be used for innovative services, not just more of the same. Third, and most important, the spectrum should go to new entrants, not to existing broadcasters. At the same time she indicated that the relaxation of cross media ownership regulations might be put off until analogue switch off, at which time there would be the potential for new entrants to balance the tendency for greater concentration of old media ownership. But now all hope has faded. Coonan has given too much away. A few weeks ago she announced the detail on datacasting, and it was all bad. One datacasting licence will be for in-home services. The free to airs will be banned from bidding for it, but it will probably be so limited that nobody will want it in any case. And just in case it is worth watching, then the existing free to air networks are allowed to enter into agreements with the licence holders to provide content. As for the other licence, it will be used for mobile television services, and will likely be very attractive, particularly since technology means there will be little to prevent you watching it anywhere you want, including in your living room. And guess what? The existing free to air broadcasters will be allowed to bid. Given that they already have the content they will probably be able to bid higher than any emerging competitors. Meanwhile cross media ownership regulation will be relaxed, not at the distant and constantly shifting horizon of analogue switch-off, but next year. Back in 2000, the Productivity Commission recommended the fastest possible opening of up of the spectrum, and the relaxation of cross media ownership regulation at analogue switch off, and no sooner. The commission asked why existing free to air networks were so protected from competition by government regulation. Arguably, the commission said, it was because they were saddled with the cost of meeting other government requirements, such as Australian content levels and the like. But the commission pointed out that lots of other industries ? building and pharmaceuticals for example ? had to carry the cost of meeting government requirements without dominant players expecting to be protected in return. The real reason for protection is of course the politically pragmatic one. It is a brave politician who takes on the owners of the population?s main source of news and information. For all Coonan?s grit and determination, there is no longer any reason to support her package of reforms. She is right when she says it is essential that Australia make the transition to digital broadcasting. But this package of reforms is unlikely to achieve that end. It?s hard to see a way forward from this point, but one possibility is that Australia will largely bypass digital television broadcasting as a mass market medium, and that it will be overtaken by internet protocol television ? which uses no spectrum, and is probably almost impossible to regulate. Whether or not that is a good thing remains to be seen. ? Margaret Simons is a freelance journalist and author, presently writing a book about the media for Penguin.
