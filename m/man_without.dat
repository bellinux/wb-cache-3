5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate <b>man</b> <b>without</b> a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation of Nazi Germany. His relationship with Eva Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was hidden from the public and all but his inner circle. Braun biographer Heike Görtemaker notes that the couple enjoyed a normal sex life. Hitler and Braun married in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E

5|$|Later in his career, Vonnegut {{published}} several autobiographical {{essays and}} short-story collections, including Fates Worse Than Death (1991), and A <b>Man</b> <b>Without</b> a Country (2005). After his death, he {{was hailed as}} a morbidly comical commentator on the society in which he lived, and {{as one of the}} most important contemporary writers. Vonnegut's son Mark published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled Armageddon in Retrospect. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles in}} this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan {{widespread}} adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading <b>man</b> <b>without</b> ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{starred in}} Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet in 1990, as the eponymous {{character}} of the Shakespearean tragedy of the same name. It was the first film produced by Icon Productions, a production company he co-founded with Bruce Davey. Gibson's directorial debut was The <b>Man</b> <b>Without</b> a Face (1993), an adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. Two years later he directed and produced Braveheart, a historical epic drama in which he also portrayed Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish knight. The film earned him a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won an Academy Award for Best Picture.

5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate <b>man</b> <b>without</b> a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E

He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death {{was a source of}} deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for <b>man</b> <b>without</b> God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E

5|$|After graduating college, Briskin {{worked as}} an accountant. Briskin entered the film {{industry}} as an accountant at Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales in 1920. In 1924, when the Cohn brothers incorporated CBC as Columbia Pictures, he left the studio and created an independent production company with George H. Davis named Banner Productions. The company was scheduled to produce 8 films, four {{on the east coast}} and four in California. The company was incorporated in May 1924, and produced over 20 films between 1925 and 1927. Briskin gave his brother, Irving, his start in the film industry, as an auditor for Banner. Irving would go on to be a film producer in his own right. The company's first film was The Truth About Women, a 1924 melodrama directed by Burton King, and starring Hope Hampton and Lowell Sherman. The picture was filmed at the Whitman Bennett Studios near Yonkers, New York. The next film Briskin would produce was The <b>Man</b> <b>Without</b> a Heart, again directed by King and filmed at the Bennett Studios, this time starring Kenneth Harlan and Jane Novak. In addition to producing the films, Briskin would also travel around the country making sales deals for the company's films. In 1925 Briskin would produce the melodrama, The Phantom Express, starring Ethel Shannon and George Periolat. This was followed in 1926 by the film Brooding Eyes, starring the legendary Lionel Barrymore.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Sheppard was {{recommended}} to Tuscaloosa Theological Institute (now Stillman College, which dedicated its library in Sheppard's honor in 1959) in Alabama. He met Lucy Gantt {{near the end}} of his time there and the two became engaged, although they would not marry for ten years. Sheppard cultivated a desire to preach in Africa, but despite the support of Tuscaloosa founder Charles Stillman, the Southern Presbyterian Church had yet to establish its mission in the Congo. He was ordained in 1888 and served as pastor to a church in Atlanta, Georgia, but did not adapt well to the life of an urban black in a heavily segregated area of the Southern United States. After two years of writing to the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Board in Baltimore, Maryland to inquire about starting a mission in Africa, he became frustrated by the vague rationale of the rejection letters and took a train to Baltimore to ask the chairman in person. The man politely informed Sheppard that the board would not send a black <b>man</b> <b>without</b> a white supervisor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{wished to}} {{determine}} if there were differences in pelvic and non-pelvic tenderness between men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) Type III and <b>men</b> <b>without</b> pelvic pain. Methods We performed the Manual Tender Point Survey (MTPS) as described by the American College of Rheumatology on 62 men with CP/CPPS Type IIIA and IIIB and 98 <b>men</b> <b>without</b> pelvic pain. We also assessed tenderness of 10 external pelvic tender points (EPTP) and of 7 internal pelvic tender points (IPTP). All study participants completed the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Inventory (NIH CPSI). Results We found that men with CPPS were significantly more tender in the MTPS, the EPTPS and the IPTPS. CPSI scores correlated with EPTP scale but not with IPTP scale or prostate tenderness. Prostatic tenderness was present in 75 % of men with CPPS and in 50 % of <b>men</b> <b>without</b> CPPS. Expressed prostatic fluid leukocytosis was not associated with prostatic tenderness. Conclusion Men with CP/CPPS have more tenderness compared to <b>men</b> <b>without</b> CPPS. Tenderness in men with CPPS is distributed throughout the pelvis and not specific to the prostate. </p...|$|R
