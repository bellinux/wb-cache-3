50|$|One day he saves a {{young woman}} Sheetal (Rajshree) from {{committing}} suicide. She's in love with Ravi Khanna (Pran) who is promiscuous. Brahmachari promises to unite her with Ravi in return for money. Day and night he works on her appearance to make Ravi like her, but Brahmachari {{falls in love with}} her along the way. When Ravi proposes to Sheetal, she realises she loves Brahmachari. Ravi, however, brings in pressure on Brahmachari in terms of forfeiture of the mortgage on Brahmachari's house, due to non-repayment of loans. Ravi convinces Brahmachari into giving up Sheetal by promising to repay the <b>mortgage</b> <b>dues</b> in exchange, to which Brahmachari reluctantly agrees. In order to convince Sheetal, Brahmachari pretends to be romantically involved with Rupa. However, when Rupa tries to leave her newborn child at Brahmachari's house, Brahmachari finds out that the child's father is Ravi. He also gets hold of love letters written by Ravi to Rupa, which he intends to use to convince Ravi to marry Rupa. Ravi however doesn't relent and instead orders the kidnapping of Brahmachari's orphans. A fight ensues and the children are rescued. A repentant Ravi apologizes to Brahmachari and agrees to marry Rupa. Brahmachari and Sheetal get married and along with the children, set off on a road trip in Brahmachari's car.|$|E

Using newly-discovered archival documents and a newly-compiled dataset from 1934, Natacha Postel-Vinay looks at the lessons of the Great Depression. She writes that the prevalence of ‘second mortgages’ (loans which supplemented regular <b>mortgages</b> <b>due</b> to borrowing limits) led to higher rates of foreclosure. This, in combination with a protracted foreclosure process, helped to severely weaken the liquidity of banks in the 1930 s, contributing to their failure...|$|R
50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that this interest rate is not fixed, and will generally increase 1%/year until it reaches what ever the current rate is 5 years after the modification. Often it includes a balloon payment {{at the end of}} the first 5 years. This practice has been found controversial by many in the financial world as it is expected to bring about a slurry of new foreclosures in 5 years when homeowners will once again not be able to pay their <b>mortgage</b> <b>due</b> to the interest rate hike, or the balloon payment.|$|R

50|$|This {{insurance}} {{can provide}} financial protection to the policyholder or their dependents on the repayment of a <b>mortgage</b> <b>due</b> to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition {{or on the}} death of the policyholder. In this type of product design, some insurers may choose to structure the product to repay a portion of the outstanding mortgage debt on the contracting of a critical illness, whilst the full outstanding mortgage debt would be repaid {{on the death of}} the policyholder. Alternatively, the full sum assured may be paid on diagnosis of the critical illness, but then no further payment is made on death, effectively making the critical illness payment an 'accelerated death payment'.|$|R
50|$|Carr {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in the founding of Duke University (where the history building on East Campus is named after him). As Trinity College struggled to overcome postwar dependency on uncertain student tuition and church donations, interested Methodist laymen were crucial to its survival. Carr's name first appears in college records signing a note to forestall foreclosure on a <b>mortgage</b> <b>due</b> in 1880. Carr was elected a trustee of Trinity College in 1883, and {{over the course of}} the decade acted as benefactor and administrator of the struggling institution that was eventually renamed Duke University. He engineered the selection of John F. Crowell as the institution's new president, and along with Washington Duke won support to remove the school from its rural setting to Durham. The move was made possible by Carr's gift of 62 acre of land for the site.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the size of}} the mark-up on the lending rate for endowment <b>mortgages,</b> <b>due</b> to expected prepayment by the borrower. For this type of mortgage, prepayment is mostly the result of mobility in the housing market. We control for the risk of default by using a unique data set of Dutch borrowers insured against default. The estimates indicate that households with a higher liquidity constraint are less likely to prepay, as they have a lower mark-up on the lending rate. In contrast, the collateral constraint has a very limited influence on the mark-up. We explain this result as follows. Usually, income constraints are generated at the household level, whereas constraints on housing wealth pertain to the regional level. Hence, income changes may improve the relative position of households in the housing market, but an increase in homeowners. housing wealth does not improve their relative position in the housing market.

40|$|Despite strong {{beliefs that}} {{property}} titling and registration will enhance credit access, empirical {{evidence in support}} of such effects remains scant. The gradual roll-out of computerization of land registry systems across Andhra Pradesh’s 387 sub-registry offices (SROs) allows us to combine quarterly administrative data on credit disbursed by all commercial banks for a 11 year period (1997 - 2007) aggregated to the SRO level with the date of shifting registration from manual to digital. Computerization had no credit effect in rural areas but led to increased credit-supply in urban ones. A marked increase of registered urban <b>mortgages</b> <b>due</b> to computerization supports the robustness of the result. At the same time, estimated impacts from reduction of stamp duty are much larger, suggesting that, without further changes in the property rights system, impacts of computerization will remain marginal.

5000|$|The reverse <b>mortgage</b> comes <b>due</b> - {{the loan}} plus {{interest}} must be repaid - when the borrower dies, sells the property, or {{moves out of}} the house. Depending on the program, the reverse mortgage may be transferable to a different property if the owner moves. Prepayment of the loan - when the borrower pays the loan back before it reaches term - may incur penalties, depending on the program. In addition, if interest rates have dropped since the reverse mortgage was signed, the mortgage terms may include an [...] "'interest-rate differential' penalty." [...] In Canada a reverse mortgage can not accumulate debt beyond the fair {{market value of the}} property, nor can the lender recover losses from the homeowner's other assets. If the borrower lived long enough that the principal and interest together exceed the fair market value when the <b>mortgage</b> is <b>due,</b> the borrower or heirs do not have to pay more than the house's value at the time.|$|R

5000|$|Due {{to being}} unable to repay an $41 million ($40,574,382.57) <b>mortgage</b> <b>due</b> on July 11, 2013 the mall went into {{foreclosure}} on March 7, 2014 as requested by mortgage servicer LBUBS 2003-CV Lackawanna Retail GP (LNR Partners), {{with the approval of}} then owner Steamtown Mall Partners. Included in the foreclosure is the Marquee theater, but not the Oppenheim and Samter buildings. [...] Contributing factors that caused the foreclosure include debt and low rent revenue (at the time of the foreclosure, the mall was only 65 percent occupied), along with competition from The Shoppes at Montage, Viewmont Mall, and online businesses. Boscov's department store planned to bid for the mall at the auction or purchase it beforehand, even though Al Boscov is a partner in Steamtown Mall Partners the mall's foreclosed owner, but could not reach an agreement. Out of 43 Boscov's, the location at Steamtown is the 5th best performing with annual sales of $31 million. Boscov expressed hope that other mall groups would bid on the mall as they have more resources to fill it. Boscov's continued with renovations to its store during the foreclosure.|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{entering}} office, Obama {{focused on}} handling {{the global financial}} crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The tax provisions of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second stimulus bill passed. Obama also launched a second bailout of US automakers, possibly saving General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy {{at the cost of}} $9.3 billion. For homeowners in danger of defaulting on their <b>mortgage</b> <b>due</b> to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013. Short-term interest rates remained near zero for much of Obama's presidency, and the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates during Obama's presidency until December 2015.|$|R
