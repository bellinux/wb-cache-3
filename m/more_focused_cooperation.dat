V diplomskem delu je poudarek na sodelovanju platforme s programi iz paketa Microsoft Office 2010, manj namestitvi in uporabi portala. V uvodu je predstavljeno ozadje izbire teme in izdelava diplomskega dela. Naslednji poglavji opisujeta platformo SharePoint ter programski paket Microsoft Office 2010. Sledi krajši opis namestitve platforme, kar je osnova za nadaljnje delo. Nadaljevanje pa je namenjeno opisovanju in raziskovanju možnosti sodelovanja SharePoint 2010 in Microsoft Office 2010. Diplomsko delo postane celota z zaključkom. My diploma work {{includes the}} presentation of SharePoint 2010 platform, {{the installation of the}} portal using only this platform, and the research of its ability to integrate with the software package Microsoft Office 2010. The thesis is <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on <b>cooperation</b> of the platform with the programs from Microsoft Office 2010 package and is less oriented to its installation and the use of portal itself. The introduction of the assignment presents the background of the theme choice as well as the elaboration of my diploma work. The following sections describe the SharePoint 2010 platform and Microsoft Office 2010 software package. Later follows a short overview of the platform as a basis for further work. The remain chapters are intended to describe and explore the possibilities to cooperate SharePoint 2010 platform with Microsoft Office 2010. The assignment becomes a whole with the Ending...|$|R

The agents are processes formalised in a Markovian Process Algebra, which enables the reversed stationary Markov process of a cooperation to be determined symbolically under appropriate conditions. From the reversed process, a separable (compositional) solution follows immediately for the equilibrium state probabilities. The well known solutions for networks of queues (Jackson’s theorem) and G-networks (with {{both positive and negative}} customers) can be obtained simply by this method. Here, the reversed processes, and hence product-form solutions, are derived for <b>more</b> general <b>cooperations,</b> <b>focussing</b> on G-networks with chains of triggers and generalised resets, which have some quite distinct properties from those proposed recently. The methodology’s principal advantage is its potential for mechanisation and symbolic implementation; many equilibrium solutions, both new and derived elsewhere by customized methods, have emerged directly from the compositional approach. As further examples, we consider a known type of fork-join network and a queueing network with batch arrivals. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} {{factors that influence}} the likelihood of IFRS adoption in developing countries. Research {{that focuses on the}} IFRS adoption in developing countries is limited. Developing countries are supposed to get many benefits from the adoption of IFRS as it is a cheap shortcut {{to improve the quality of}} financial reporting to attract foreign capital and to finance its development. In addition to macroeconomic factors, this research also examines the influence of institutional factors and the development of local accounting standards. Using the binomial logit regression, the result shows that the regulatory quality of a country positively af-fects the possibility of IFRS adoption in developing countries. It means that the better quality of the regulator in those countries, the higher possibility to fully adopt the IFRS. Furthermore, there is a tendency that the countries will fully adopt the IFRS when they already have local accounting standards that previously referred to international standards. The results imply that the IASB strategy should <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> on <b>cooperation</b> with local regulators or groups of regional cooperation to reach its objective to develop single set of high quality international standard...|$|R

40|$|Buildings have {{a massive}} {{environmental}} impact, {{both in terms}} of energy use and GHG emissions. However, the improvement potential is substantial. With the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, the construction sector must contribute to reach the set goals and requirements and utilize its full potential. Plus houses are one alternative to reducing the environmental impact of the construction industry. This study provides a qualitative analysis of plus houses and other sustainable buildings and the possibilities for its expansion in Norway. Special focus is given to construction policy and existing standards for sustainable buildings. By reviewing existing research, conducting interviews and case studies, and putting the study in the context of strategic analysis, a model is created to guide decision makers on whether to construct plus houses or not. The model contains the most important factors found in this study that can influence the decision towards constructing more plus houses. The study has indicated several important factors that are vital to consider when constructing a plus house. These include <b>more</b> <b>focus</b> on the <b>cooperation</b> process, setting BHAGs and budgetary restrictions and exceeding the prevailing regulations. Also, exploiting the current technology, being committed and ambitious, and using BREEAM as a basis. In addition, it can {{be a good idea to}} consider the environmental savings that can come from renovating instead of constructing new buildings. Further, the building policies in Norway are lagging behind. This is at the core of the development in the construction industry. If regulations are tightened, the construction industry must follow and the industry as a whole will reduce its environmental impact and see an increasing development. The study has produced several recommendations, both on policy level and decision maker level. The main recommendation to policy makers are to tighten regulations today and be more ambitious when setting demands. For the decision makers, the main recommendation is to have a stronger focus on the early stages of the cooperation process and include all relevant actors in the earliest possible stage...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} {{monetary}} policy frameworks in the East Asia and Pacific region are heterogeneous, with exchange rate policies being subordinate to domestic price stability objectives in most regional economies. We then argue that in this environment it is undesirable to <b>focus</b> regional <b>cooperation</b> on exchange rate policies {{because of the risk}} of creating conflicts with domestic objectives that would lead to loss of central bank credibility and possibly speculative attacks. We also argue that the case for coordinated exchange rate policies is in fact weak, even after taking into account the region¡¦s traditional emphasis on export performance and increasing regional trade integration. Rather than <b>focusing</b> <b>cooperation</b> on the setting of policy instruments, we suggest an alternative that centres on developing more liquid financial markets in the region in the foreseeable future, and on harmonising the objectives of monetary policy and designing institutions that could form the basis of deeper forms of cooperation in the longer-term future.
