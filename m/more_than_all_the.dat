5|$|The 1972 Winter Games, held in Sapporo, Japan, {{were the}} first to be hosted outside North America or Europe. The issue of professionalism became {{contentious}} during the Sapporo Games. Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States. Brundage reasoned that the skiers had financially benefited from their status as athletes and were therefore no longer amateurs. Eventually only Austrian Karl Schranz, who earned <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other skiers, was not allowed to compete. Canada did not send teams to the 1972 or 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest at not being able to use players from professional leagues. Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first (and as of 2017 only) Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal; he triumphed in the slalom.|$|E

25|$|Müller and {{his wife}} had seven daughters and a son, who died early.

25|$|In 29 BC, the Roman Senate {{ordered the}} closure of the doors to the Temple of Janus in the Roman Forum {{for the first time in}} over 200 years.

But the closure could not have been less appropriate. As Dio himself points out, there were ongoing major operations against the Treveri in Gaul, and the Cantabri and Astures in Spain. Furthermore, the closure inaugurated nearly half a century of virtually incessant warfare, as a result of which the Roman Empire assumed the borders it would hold, with a few modifications, for its entire history.|$|E

25|$|The divine {{nature of}} Jesus {{was a major}} issue for the {{community}} of Matthew, the crucial element marking them from their Jewish neighbors. Early understandings of this nature grew as the gospels were being written. Before the gospels, that understanding {{was focused on the}} revelation of Jesus as God in his resurrection, but the gospels reflect a broadened focus extended backwards in time. The gospel of Mark recounts prior revelations in Jesus' lifetime on earth, at his baptism and transfiguration. Matthew and Luke go back further still, showing Jesus as the Son of God from his birth. Matthew <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other gospels identifies how his coming to earth was the fulfillment of many Old Testament prophecies. Finally John calls God the Word (Jesus) pre-existent before creation, and thus before all time.|$|E
25|$|Mariella, {{the first}} of five ferries to reach {{the scene of the}} accident, arrived at 02:12. MRCC Turku failed to {{acknowledge}} the Mayday immediately and Mariellas report was relayed by Helsinki Radio as the less urgent pan-pan message. A full-scale emergency was only declared at 02:30. Mariella winched open liferafts into the sea onto which 13people on Estonias rafts successfully transferred, and reported the location of other rafts to Swedish and Finnish rescue helicopters, {{the first of}} which arrived at 03:05. The former took survivors to shore, while the latter—Finnish border guard helicopters Super Puma OH-HVG and Agusta Bell 412 OH-HVD—chose the riskier option of landing on the ferries. The pilot of OH-HVG stated that landing on the ferries was {{the most difficult part of}} the whole rescue operation; despite that, this single helicopter rescued 44people, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ferries. Isabella saved 16 survivors with her rescue slide.|$|E
25|$|Between 1780–1867, over 780 000 {{slaves were}} brought to Cuba. This was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rest of Spanish America combined. Slavery was leaned upon heavily by {{the owners of the}} highly {{profitable}} sugar plantations. By 1886, people of colour – the majority being ex-slaves – made up 1/3 of the population of Cuba. The issue of integration was a complex and highly contentious issue. Rights were hard to come by for many former slaves and also for those who lived and worked in rural communities. Emancipation was a slow process that started in 1868 and continued until 1886. As a preliminary step, the Moret Law of 1870 granted freedom to children and those over the age of sixty but offered little else. As the skirmishes continued and losses compounded during the 10 Years’ War, the anti-colonial forces spoke more openly about the idea of a free Cuban citizen. Even though there was still a strong racial divide, many slaves joined up with the revolutionaries. Although this initial rebellion did not force any significant changes, the participation of slaves did not go unnoticed. By the early 1890s, Spain was willing to offer fairly considerable civil rights and voting rights to many former slaves in a vain attempt to weaken another attempt at rebellion. Prior to the 1890s, suffrage had been granted uniquely to taxpayers (it was further expanded in 1895 and again in 1898 when all links between property and suffrage were severed). This back-fired, however, as it only provoked white elites who intensified their criticism directed at colonial policies.|$|E

He decided to publish a newspaper, [...] "La Independencia." [...] This four-page daily was filled with articles, short stories, patriotic songs and poems. The staff was installed in one of the coaches of the train that ran from Manila to Pangasinan. The paper came out in September 1898, and was an instant success. A movable feast of information, humor, and good writing, 4,000 copies were printed, which was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other newspapers in circulation put together.|$|E

It was set to music and set in stone, declaimed in opera houses and vaudeville theaters, intoned at ceremonies each April on Arbor Day." [...] According to Robert Holliday, Kilmer's friend and editor, [...] "Trees" [...] speaks [...] "with authentic song to the simplest of hearts". Holliday added that this [...] "exquisite title poem now so universally known made his reputation <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rest he had written put together" [...] and was [...] "made for immediate widespread popularity".|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{timing was}} too late for his name to be added the South Carolina primary ballot, and South Carolina law would not allow for {{write-in}} candidates. [...] Polling showed that 21% of the potential Republican primary electorate reported they would be [...] "more likely" [...] to vote for former candidate Herman Cain, who remained on the ballot, if that vote served as encouragement for Colbert. Herman Cain received 6,338 votes in the South Carolina Republican Primary, which was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other withdrawn candidates received combined. On the next episode of The Colbert Report broadcast on January 23, 2012, Colbert boasted about passing the 1% threshold and for Cain receiving many more votes in South Carolina than in Iowa and New Hampshire. Colbert then announced that he would no longer be exploring a run for President of the United States of South Carolina.|$|E

500|$|As a result, Chamberlain {{was less}} dominant, taking only 14% of the team's shots (in his 50.4 ppg season, it was 35.3%), but {{extremely}} efficient: he averaged a career-low 24.1 points, but {{he led the}} league in rebounds (24.2), ended third in assists (7.8), had a record breaking [...]683 field goal accuracy, and played strong defense. For these feats, Chamberlain earned his third MVP award. The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68–13 season, including a record 46–4 start. In addition, the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates, lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the [...] "ultimate power forward", calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter, and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer. Off the court, the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill, knowing he earned 10 times <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> others. Greer, who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude, spoke positively of the new Chamberlain: [...] "You knew in a minute the Big Fella [...] was ready to go... and everybody would follow." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{his injury}} in 1924, Gilligan {{could no longer}} bowl fast and, as a player, had little {{influence}} on the 1924–25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan [...] "revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, {{for the first time}} since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4–1. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain Herbie Collins proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan [...] "was too easygoing on the finer points of law". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan [...] "was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical Cricket described him as [...] "'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable", while former Australian Test captain Monty Noble wrote that Gilligan was the [...] "type of man who, in the most unostentatious way, can do <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> politicians and statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions". His sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him, according to Noble, a perfect English gentleman and an [...] "Empire builder".|$|E
