50|$|Precision stages such {{as those}} used for optics do not use a lead screw, but instead use a fine-pitch screw or a {{micrometer}} which presses on a hardened <b>metal</b> <b>pad</b> on the stage platform. Rotating the screw or micrometer pushes the platform forward. A spring provides restoring force to keep the platform {{in contact with the}} actuator. This provides more precise motion of the stage. Stages designed to be mounted vertically use a slightly different arrangement, where the actuator is attached to the movable platform and its tip rests on a <b>metal</b> <b>pad</b> on the fixed base. This allows the weight of the platform and its load to be supported by the actuator rather than the spring.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of lingual orthodontic brackets with resin or <b>metal</b> <b>pads,</b> {{the location of}} bond failure and the adhesive remnant index (ARI). Methods: A total of 40 extracted upper premolars were randomly {{divided into two groups}} of 20 each: bonding with brackets having (1) pads with extended resin directly on the lingual surface of teeth, and (2) <b>pads</b> with <b>metal</b> custom base on the lingual surface of teeth. The debonding force was measured with an Instron universal testing machine. A Student’s t-test was used to assess the difference between groups (α = 0. 05). Results: The results showed {{a significant difference between the}} groups (p < 0. 001). The shear bond strength of <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> was significantly higher than resin pads. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it was concluded that the bond strength of lingual brackets with <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> was higher than that of brackets with composite resin pads, due to the metal part being a single unit and welded. The failure location in the region between the bracket and the resin pad affected a higher percentage of the resin <b>pads</b> than the <b>metal</b> <b>pads...</b>|$|R

40|$|Deep {{submicron}} {{gaps between}} <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> of around 100 [*]μm in size {{are difficult to}} fabricate on III-V substrates using electron beam lithography, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist, and metal lift-off. In device fabrication, gold is commonly used to form metal contacts. However, gold etch methods are not well suited to high resolution patterning and lift-off methods are frequently employed. In this paper, the authors investigate {{a number of different}} methods for realizing long 100 [*]nm scale gaps for structures fabricated on III–V substrates. Initially, they explain why the fabrication of long narrow gaps between <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> using PMMA resist and metal lift-off is difficult. The authors show that 15 [*]nm gaps can be fabricated using a double patterning method and discuss the limitations of this technique. They show that good undercut profiles for metal lift-off can be realized by the controlled etching of a sacrificial polymer layer placed beneath the resist. The authors demonstrate that reliable 100 [*]nm scale gaps can be fabricated between 100 [*]μm square <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> using these methods...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{lead-free}} interconnect technique using {{a variable}} frequency microwave (VFM) was investigated. Melting the Sn- 3. 5 Ag, Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu and Sn 46 Pb solder pastes and their wetting on the <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> were achieved by heating the organic flux vehicle through a radio frequency microwave. The lead-free solder interconnection between the component chips and the <b>metal</b> <b>pads</b> through VFM was first demonstrated. The microstructures of the lead-free solders/Cu and Sn surface joints formed by a conventional thermal reflow process and VFM were analyzed. From the intermetallic compound (IMC) formation study, {{it was found}} that more heat energy could be employed into the solder paste by the VFM heating process than by the thermal reflow process at the peak temperatures used in this study, because VFM provided more uniform heat than the reflow oven that may lead a temperature gradient in the test boards.

50|$|A common {{accessory}} for laptops is {{a laptop}} sleeve, laptop skin, or laptop case, {{which provides a}} degree of protection from scratches. Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of neoprene, with sturdier ones made of low-resilience polyurethane.
