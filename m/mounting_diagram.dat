In the first part there is mentioned an introduction into methods of lean manufacturing, value stream mapping and throughput time calculations. In the next section the flow of values is mapped and the map of current state is created. Futhermore, the throughput time of selected parts is computed and the <b>mounting</b> <b>diagram</b> of measured products is assembled. On to these materials are founded the sources of wasting and solutions are suggested. Afterwards {{on the basis of}} the obtained data are given solutions eveulated in terms of economic indicators...|$|E

This is a small square structure with a skillion roof, clad with metal sheeting, and has aluminium-framed windows. A modern water tank collects rainwater from gutters of the signal cabin. The signal cabin building and the rain water tank are not of cultural heritage significance, but the cabin houses two culturally significant elements: a steel, 15 lever frame, set into timber floorboards, and a timber-framed cabin <b>diagram</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear wall.|$|R

40|$|Engraving on t. p. with Medici arms, not by Callot; see Lieure. Headpieces, one ornamented woodcut initial. Another {{work on the}} festival, {{published}} {{in the same year}} by Zanobi Pignoni at Florence, was Andrea Salvadori's Guerra d'amore. Two of its four full-sheet etchings by Jacques Callot were re-used in the present ed. One of these depicts four floats, two horsemen and six actors on foot, and the other consists of 16 diagrams of participants' positions at various stages of the spectacle. In the present ed. these were intended to be cut apart and mounted at blank places reserved for them in the text. The tournament and horse ballet Guerra d'amore took place in the Piazza Santa Croce during carnival on Feb. 11 or 12, 1616 (1615 by Lady Day reckoning). Cosimo II took the role of Indamoro, King of Narsinga. For a full description see Nagler. Nagler, A. M. Theatre festivals of the MediciLieure, J. Jacques Callot,Mode of access: Internet. Centered on front pastedown is the armorial bookplate, printed in green, of Alberti (Florence-Sienna, ca. 1790; see Gelli, n. 11). The 3 extra plates are stamped at the lower right-hand corner with the collector's mark of Friedrich August II, King of Saxony, 1797 - 1854 (Lugt 972). Binding: thick gray paper, backed in vellum. Now in a modern chemise (tan paper backed in red goatskin), within a slipcase of decorated paper backed in red goatskin, with gilt title and imprint on spine. The Getty copy also includes impressions of the two other plates from Salvadori's work. They are bird's-eye views of the Piazza with the spectacle in progress. The first, tipped at its left margin onto a stub following A 2, has the legend "Mostra della gverra d'amore, festa del ser. mo grand dvca di Toscana fatta l'anno 1615. " The second is tipped at its left margin onto a stub following E 2 and has the legend "Vno de gl' abbattimenti della gverra d amore, festa del serenissimo gran dvca di Toscana. "In Getty copy the two plates with performers and position diagrams have been cut apart and mounted in the appropriate places, except for one of the six performers on foot. It has no caption and Lieure gives no position in the text for it, so perhaps it was not intended to be <b>mounted.</b> The position <b>diagrams</b> are pasted in upside down. In addition the Getty copy includes an additional uncut copy of the plate depicting performers, tipped at the centerfold onto a stub after B 2...|$|R
