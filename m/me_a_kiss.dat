Antony's speech conveys {{pain and}} anger, but he acts in {{opposition}} to his emotions and words, all {{for the love of}} Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: [...] "Antony's agony is curiously muted for someone who has achieved and lost so much." [...] This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: [...] "the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves". However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in Antony and Cleopatra is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: [...] "Tell me how much you love." [...] Prominent professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tzachi Zamir, points out: [...] "The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty" [...] and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.|$|E
