40|$|Humans achieve {{locomotor}} dexterity {{that far}} exceeds {{the capability of}} modern robots, yet this is achieved despite slower actuators, imprecise sensors and vastly slower communication. We propose that this spectacular performance arises from encoding motor commands in terms of dynamic primitives. We propose three primitives {{as a foundation for}} a comprehensive theoretical framework that can embrace a wide range of upper- and lower-limb behaviors. Building on previous work that suggested discrete and rhythmic movements as elementary dynamic behaviors, we define submovements and oscillations: As discrete movements cannot be combined with sufficient flexibility, we argue that suitably-defined submovements are primitives. As the term rhythmic may be ambiguous, we define oscillations as the corresponding class of primitives. We further propose <b>mechanical</b> <b>impedances</b> as a third class of dynamic primitives, necessary for interaction with the physical environment. Combination of these three classes of primitive requires care. One approach is through a generalized equivalent network: a virtual trajectory composed of simultaneous and/or sequential submovements and/or oscillations that interacts with <b>mechanical</b> <b>impedances</b> to produce observable forces and motions. Reliable experimental identification of these dynamic primitives presents challenges: Identification of <b>mechanical</b> <b>impedances</b> is exquisitely sensitive to assumptions about their dynamic structure; identification of submovements and oscillations is sensitive to their assumed form and to details of the algorithm used to extract them. Some methods to address these challenges are presented. Some implications of this theoretical framework for locomotor rehabilitation are considered...|$|R

This selection not only brings an improvement in the transmitted power when it is used as a transmitter, but also improves the noise figure when it is used as a receiver.

Methods: BCI dummy implants were installed in 3 sheep skulls in vivo to study the vibration transmission characteristics over time. <b>Mechanical</b> point <b>impedances</b> and vibration transfer response functions of the BCI implants were measured at the time of surgery and after a healing period of 8 months.
