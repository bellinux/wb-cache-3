50|$|Roasting is {{a process}} of heating of {{sulphide}} ore to a high temperature in presence of air. It is a step of the processing of certain ores. More specifically, roasting is a <b>metallurgical</b> <b>process</b> involving gas-solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth flotation. The concentrate is mixed with other materials to facilitate the process. The technology is useful but is also a serious source of air pollution.|$|E
50|$|In {{the powder}} <b>metallurgical</b> <b>process,</b> a fine powder {{is created by}} {{spraying}} a stream of liquid steel with nitrogen under high pressure. The average diameter of the powder is 50-100 µm. The powder is filled into capsules directly {{in order to avoid}} contamination. With hot isostatic pressing (HIP), the powder is consolidated to 100% density. The advantage with powder metallurgical tool steels is to have a high degree of alloys without getting segregations in the material. This makes it possible to combine high material hardness with wear resistance.|$|E

The Hông-hee vases (1426) of China {{were said to}} be made of a similarly-mixed metal {{allegedly}} formed when the Imperial palace was burnt to the ground. These vessels are of priceless value. [...] An alloy of gold and copper, known as tumbaga was in widespread use in Pre-columbian Mesoamerica, and has an essentially identical composition to Corinthian brass.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from met-allurgical processes located {{in the town of}} Sisak, Croatia, this research has built on experiences from developed countries, where the emission factor values from individual <b>metallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> have been taken from the reference data and used for the estimate of the emission of these pollutions in the European countries. The calculation of the emission polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from <b>metallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> located in the town of Sisak took into account annual outputs of sinter, pig iron, steel blooms and steel billets, as well as steel casts. The <b>metallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> installed in the town of Sisak between 1950 and 2010 emitted from QI−TEQ = 17 mg a− 1 PCDDs/Fs in 2001 to QI−TEQ = 5823 mg a− 1 in 1989, depending on the activity of these processes. Within the observed period, the largest source of PCDDs/Fs emission was the iron ore sintering plant. Within the observed timeframe, the town of Sisak did not experience any excessive air, soil or water pollution by polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from the local <b>metallurgical</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Gasification of {{carbonaceous}} {{materials is}} an important category of reactions in <b>metallurgical</b> <b>processes.</b> Carbon in different forms (graphite, coke, coals) reacts with hydrogen, water and carbon dioxide at high temperatures to produce gaseous methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. In ironmaking blast furnace, gasification reaction does not only provide the reducing gas, but also affects the coke degradation. It may reduce coke strength and deteriorate the permeability of the solid burden with {{a negative effect on}} the blast furnace productivity. Carbon gasification reaction also {{plays an important role in}} the carbothermal reduction of metal oxides. Therefore, further understanding of the gasification reactions under specific conditions of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>processes</b> is paramount to development of these processes...|$|R
50|$|From {{approximately}} 1000 BCE {{money in}} the shape of small knives and spades made of bronze were in use in China during the Zhou dynasty, with cast bronze replicas of cowrie shells in use before this. The first manufactured coins seems to have taken place separately in India, China, and in cities around the Aegean sea between 700 and 500 BC. While these Aegean coins were stamped (heated and hammered with insignia), the Indian coins (from the Ganges river valley) were punched metal disks, and Chinese coins (first developed in the Great Plain) were cast bronze with holes in the center to be strung together. The different forms and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>process</b> implies a separate development.|$|E

S. Navy. In 1961, Barton returned to R.P.I. for graduate work in Engineering. Upon earning an M.S. and Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering, he joined US Steel's Research Laboratory in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, as a research manager in the Advanced Applied Research Division. While at U.S.S., he authored several research papers in refereed journals, submitted patent applications for novel steel compositions, and completed a project sponsored by the U. S. Air Force for improvements and problem solving in a complex high-strength, high-performance family of steels.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, renewed {{interest}} by Canadian investors {{led to the}} establishment of a new mining claim. Subsequent exploration established that vast amounts of copper ore, as well as commercial quantities of cobalt, zinc, and manganese still existed on the site. Over a fifteen year period, two test mining programs, two process pilot campaigns, and a +38,000 metre in-fill drill program were carried out, culminating in a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). The DFS was completed in 2007 by the current lease holder - Minera y Metallurgica del Boleo - and followed by a Technical Report update issued in March 2010. Boleo is expected to yield copper-cobalt-zinc-manganese and is fully permitted. However, the old <b>metallurgical</b> <b>process</b> used by previous operators is unfit for the recovery of these values. Small scale testing has established that a hydrometallurgical process can effectively recover all four metals, with competitive economics. The hydrometallurgical process, and the lack of fresh water at the site requires the construction of a desalination plant.|$|E

5000|$|The {{context for}} the word [...] "dross" [...] in two {{passages}} in the Book of Mormon record suggests that the speaker and audience understood the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>process</b> the metaphor implies (cf. Ps. 119:119; Prov. 25:4; 26:23; Isa. 1:22, 25; Ezek. 22:18-19). [...] "Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness," [...] the text explains. [...] "Therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart" [...] (Alma 32:3). Later it is explained, [...] "Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men" [...] (34:29). Such apt metaphors suggest that metallurgical processes were an important and generally understood feature of Nephite life.|$|E
