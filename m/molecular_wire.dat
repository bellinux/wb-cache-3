5000|$|The first {{measurement}} of the conductance of a single molecule was realised in 1994 by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewski and published in 1995 (see the corresponding Phys. Rev. Lett. paper). This was the conclusion of 10 years of research started at IBM TJ Watson, using the scanning tunnelling microscope tip apex to switch a single molecule as already explored by A. Aviram, C. Joachim and M. Pomerantz {{at the end of}} the 80's (see their seminal Chem. Phys. Lett. paper during this period). The trick was to use an UHV Scanning Tunneling microscope to allow the tip apex to gently touch the top of a single [...] molecule adsorbed on an Au(110) surface. A resistance of 55 MOhms was recorded along with a low voltage linear I-V. The contact was certified by recording the I-z current distance property, which allows {{measurement of the}} deformation of the [...] cage under contact.

40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent method for the {{evaluation}} of the electronic current flowing through a multi-terminal <b>molecular</b> <b>wire.</b> The method is based on Buttiker- Landauer theory which relates the current to one-electron scattering probabilities. The scattering problem is solved using a tight-binding form for Schroedinger's equation that incorporates a self-consistent evaluation of the electro-static potential in the region of the <b>molecular</b> <b>wire.</b> We apply the method to a three-terminal <b>molecular</b> <b>wire</b> connected to metallic leads. The <b>molecular</b> <b>wire</b> is a pi-conjugated carbon chain with thiol end groups, self-assembled on the cleaved edge of a multilayer of alternating thin metal and insulating films. The ends of the chain bond to two outer metal layers that act as source and drain, and the chain bridges a third (inner) metal layer that acts as a gate. We show that transistor action should occur in this device if {{on the surface of the}} metal gate there are absorbed atoms that acquire charge as the gate voltage is increased, thereby enhancing the interaction between the gate and molecule and creating a strong potential barrier that hinders electron flow along the <b>molecular</b> <b>wire.</b> We find that electronic solitons play an important role in the response of this system to applied voltages.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{study the}} effects of {{molecular}} structure on the electronic transport and mechanical stability of single-molecule junctions formed with Au point contacts. Two types of linear conjugated <b>molecular</b> <b>wires</b> are compared: those functionalized with methylsulfide or amine aurophilic groups at (1) both or (2) only one of its phenyl termini. Using scanning tunneling and atomic force microscope break-junction techniques, the conductance of mono- and difunctionalized <b>molecular</b> <b>wires</b> and its dependence on junction elongation and rupture forces were studied. Charge transport through monofunctionalized wires is observed when the molecular bridge is coupled through a S−Au donor− acceptor bond on one end and a relatively weak Au−π interaction on the other end. For monofunctionalized <b>molecular</b> <b>wires,</b> junctions can be mechanically stabilized by installing a second aurophilic group at the meta position that, however, does not in itself contribute to a new conduction pathway. These results reveal the important interplay between electronic coupling through metal−π interactions and quantum mechanical effects introduced by chemical substitution on the conjugated system.
