40|$|The need of {{accurate}} and reliable methods for DNA isolation and plant species identification in foodstuffs {{is of great}} importance, especially in the protection of high added value products. Fresh foods, which are not subjected to any modifications, are suitable for many kind of analysis; for processed products, such as <b>musts,</b> wines, olive oils, and pasta, the situation may be more complicated due to DNA fragmentation and, in the worst case, by its degradation. This work aimed to establish an exhaustive and reproducible analytical procedure for table grape DNA tracing in industrial <b>musts.</b> Three different DNA extraction methods were initially compared and DNA was tested in PCR for its suitability for the amplification reaction of microsatellite markers or simple sequence repeats (SSRs). An optimized DNA extraction method for microsatellite amplification was developed and adapted for industrial <b>musts.</b> Two SSR-based molecular methods, High Resolution Melting and capillary electrophoresis, were tested and the markers VrZAG 62 and VrZAG 79 {{were found to be}} the most informative. High Resolution Melting analysis, here applied {{for the first time on}} <b>musts,</b> proved to be the method of choice for a preliminary screening using four cultivars chosen as references and different DNA mixtures prepared in laboratory. Capillary electrophoresis, providing allele size, allowed a fine genotyping of <b>musts</b> in comparison with reference cultivars. The LOD 6 of a single grape cultivar in mixture with other varieties was also determined at 2. 5 ng. Merging the information of the two molecular analyses applied to real samples, we demonstrated that is possible to discover case of <b>musts</b> adulterated with table grapes, and we propose our procedure in controlling <b>musts</b> quality and origin certification...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} defend varietal aromas from {{oxidation}} before alcoholic fermentation, two <b>musts</b> were prepared from white grapes pre-cooled and added with ascorbic acid and solid CO 2 (trial ACO 2) or SO 2 (trial BSO 2). Experiments were performed with grapes {{of a white}} grape variety indigenous to western Sicily, the wines from which, obtained by vinification of <b>musts</b> protected from oxidation and poor in copper, as previously proven, have aroma descriptors ascribed to passion fruit and grapefruit skin. The smaller content in flavanols in the ACO 2 trial, demonstrated {{that the use of}} solid CO 2, instead of SO 2, reduced the extraction of such polyphenols from grape solids. The higher content in hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids of the wine from ACO 2 trial with respect to BSO 2 was ascribed to the minor grape polyphenol-oxidase activity induced by the loss of oxygen stripped by CO 2 in ACO 2 or to the combination of caftaric acid quinone to the SO 2 in BSO 2. Although the grapes were very ripe (alcohol in wines ~ 14. 5 % vol), wines made with <b>musts</b> prepared by the two techniques were characterised by aroma descriptors like passion fruit and grapefruit skin not detected in wines prepared from <b>musts</b> not protected from enzymatic oxidations...|$|R
