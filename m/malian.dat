5|$|On {{the north}} side of the roadway was the <b>Malian</b> Gulf, into which the land shelved gently.

25|$|The varied {{everyday}} {{culture of}} <b>Malians</b> reflects the country's ethnic and geographic diversity.

5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the <b>Malian</b> and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} Xerxes sent his {{commander}} Hydarnes that evening, {{with the men}} under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were. The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day, so {{it is possible that}} Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including {{what was left of the}} Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission. The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the <b>Malian</b> Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of Locris.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} <b>Malian</b> Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E

He wanders through the wilderness, acquiring supporters along the way and eventually ends up encamping in Kangaba, from where musters his forces to destroy the Sosso scouts' forward base. He then seeks to undermine the power of Sumanguru with his allies, Tabon and Wagadou by taking a sacred relic cart to his enemies Niger, Sangaran, Labe, forcing these villages to submit to his rule. He then cuts off Sumanguru's resources by plundering gold {{from the city of}} Djenne; following that, he then takes over the Niger River and destroys all of Sumanguru's military camps in the region, acquiring the allegiance of Sumanguru's former vassals Fakoli and Mema. Sundjata finally assaults the enemy base in Koumbi Saleh, killing Sumanguru once and for all and establishing his sovereignty over the <b>Malian</b> Empire.|$|E

This agreement held throughout 2008, and by the end of the year the <b>Malian</b> conflict seemed resolved.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{cultural}} ties that bind many <b>Malians</b> with other ethnic groups in West Africa, many <b>Malians</b> regularly attend events and meetings of other West African organizations in Chicago and, although these groups are largely organized along national lines, there is much fluidity among the organizations.

25|$|On 19 August 2008, it was {{announced}} by the Nigerien television broadcast someone they claimed to be rebel leader Aghaly ag Alambo, announcing that the Tuareg would lay down arms in both Mali and Niger following a peace brokered by Libya. The MNJ later discounted this as a hoax. This was likely a film of <b>Malian</b> rebel leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga discussing the April peace talks with the <b>Malian</b> government in Libya, hence the reference to <b>Malian</b> leadership and Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The current peace deal in the <b>Malian</b> conflict took place in July {{under the auspices of}} Libya's regional rival Algeria. Aghaly ag Alambo released a statement saying that although they were willing to engage in peace negotiations, they would not lay down their arms unilaterally, and the <b>Malian</b> and Nigerien rebels cannot speak for one another.|$|E

25|$|<b>Malian</b> Tuareg former insurgents {{took part}} in a long series of peace processes, splintering, and raids between formal peace in 1995 and 2006. The peace deals which ended the 1990s Tuareg {{insurgency}} in Mali created a new self-governing region, Kidal Region, and provided opportunities for <b>Malian</b> Tuaregs to join the central government in Bamako and the <b>Malian</b> Armed Forces. Unlike the Niger ex-combatants, who appeared successfully integrated into national the Nigerien Armed Forces, small numbers of <b>Malian</b> Tuaregs remained restive, complaining of the Kidal region's poverty. Some were involved in cross border smuggling, and crime was endemic in the region. A splinter faction of the Tuareg ex-combatants rose as the ADC in 2006. After agreeing to a ceasefire, these forces apparently splintered further in 2007.|$|E

25|$|In September 2007, {{fighting}} {{shifted to}} Mali, with {{a portion of}} the Tuareg groups which had come under a 2006 ceasefire returning to combat. A swift <b>Malian</b> military response, coupled with the diplomatic intervention of other <b>Malian</b> Tuaregs, led to a new, unofficial ceasefire in December 2007. In April, with the help of Libya, a formal ceasefire was declared, though it was quickly followed by new, retributive attacks from both sides. Resumed diplomatic and military pressure, with the intervention of Algerian diplomacy, brought {{what appeared to be a}} final reintegration of the <b>Malian</b> rebel factions in July 2008, along much the same lines of the 2006 peace plan. After both Libyan and Algerian sponsored peace talks, <b>Malian</b> rebel leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga relocated to Libya and the remaining <b>Malian</b> rebels and government concluded a settlement to the conflict. In December 2008, Ag Bahanga's faction of the ADC (Alliance Touareg Nord Mali pour le Changement—ATNMC) returned to conflict in a series of attacks and counterattacks in the far north. This splinter group, despite a series of daring raids deep into populated areas, were decisively defeated by the <b>Malian</b> Army during January 2009, supported by an increasing number of former rebels. In February 2009, elements surrounding Ag Bahanga again fled Mali for Libya, while both Libya and Algeria pledged support to end rebel attacks and support negotiations. ADC fighters negotiated a return to the disarmament agreed in 2008, and began being processed for integration into the <b>Malian</b> Armed Forces in camps near Kidal.|$|E
