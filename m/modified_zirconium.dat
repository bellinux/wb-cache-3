40|$|Abstract—A {{high density}} {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) polymer was catalytically degraded using two sulfate <b>modified</b> <b>Zirconium</b> catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor at 400 OC {{with the aim of}} converting plastic wastes to obtain valuable and recyclable liquid products. The TGA results revealed that the onset of degradation was moved from 420 OC for HDPE alone to less than 300 OC {{in the presence of the}} catalysts. The catalysts improved the polymer degradation by achieving high conversion of about 99. 8 %. The two catalysts appeared to promote different product composition. CAT 1 (7 %SO 3) was more selective to higher gaseous products (68 %) and liquid (32 %) of mainly aromatics, whereas CAT 2 (3. 5 %SO 3) promoted high liquid products (about 53 %) of mainly olefinic compounds. It can be concluded that the catalysts can be used for catalytic conversion of plastic wastes to obtain valuable products, most especially CAT 2 (3. 5 %SO 3) which gave high liquid content that is composed of mainly olefinic, naphthenic and paraffinic compounds whose carbon number distribution is within the gasoline range. Thus, catalytic conversion using these catalysts may be use as an alternative method for recycling plastic wastes to more valuable and renewable energy sources.

XRD and SAXS results have pointed out the presence of Si- and Zr-based nanobuilding blocks (NBBs) dispersed into the organic phase. Inter-NBBs correlation distances have been estimated for the pure di-ureasil and a model compound obtained. by hydrolysis/condensation of Zr(OPr(n)) (4) :McOH (molar ratio 1 : 1) : d(Si) approximate to 26 +/- 1 angstrom and d(Zr) approximate to 16 +/- 1 angstrom, respectively. In {{the case of the}} di-ureasil-zirconium oxo-cluster hybrids, these distances depend on the Zr relative molar percentage (rel. mol. Zr %) (d(Si) ranges from 18 to 25 angstrom and d(Zr) from 14 to 23 angstrom, as the rel. mol. Zr % increases from 5 to 75), suggesting that the Si- and Zr-based clusters are interconstrained. Complementary data from FT-IR, FT-Raman, (29) Si and (13) C NMR, and AFM support to a structural model where McOH-modified Zr-based NBBs (Zr-OMc) are present over the whole range of composition.

The structure changes from orthorhombic to tetragonal with strontium doping up to x = 0. 3 and with further addition, changes to cubic. The scanning electron micrographs show that the grain size decreases with increase in strontium content. The temperature dependent dielectric behavior shows three phase transition in the parent material which merges with an increase in Sr content The transition temperature and dielectric constant decreases with an increase in Sr concentration. The phase transition becomes more diffused with increment in doping concentration. The ferroelectric behavior of the ceramics is studied by the hysteresis loop. The optical behavior is studied by the UV-visible spectroscopy and found that the optical band gap increases with Sr concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of natural fibres {{has been carried}} out using different methods for such purposes as reinforcement in polymer matrices and heavy metals adsorption. In this work, palm fibres were <b>modified</b> by <b>zirconium</b> oxychloride in situ. The palm fibres that had been chemically modified were compared to those in nature using fibres that passed through 20 and 40 mesh screens to evaluate the influence of particle size on modification. Palm fibres were modified with ZrO 2 center dot nH(2) O nanoparticles through the use of zirconium oxychloride in an acidic medium in the presence of palm fibres using ammonium solution (1 : 3) as the precipitating agent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR), and atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES) were used to characterize the hybrid materials. Results indicated that the particle size of the palm fibres influenced in the modification, because the fibres with smaller particle size had a greater deposition of inorganic material. The ICP technique revealed an increase of 21 % nanoparticles ZrO 2 center dot nH(2) O deposited on fibres (40 mesh) when compared to fibres (20 mesh). The diameter of nanoparticles ZrO 2 center dot nH(2) O deposited on fibres was about 50 to 220 nm, as observed by SEM...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of basalt single fibres (BF) of different length (10 to 50 mm) has been examined and {{compared to that}} of E-Glass (EGF) and <b>Zirconium</b> <b>modified</b> glass (ZGF) fibres. The {{strength of}} BFs was found to lie between those of EGFs and ZFGs. The Weibul parameters indicated that the flaw size in BFs increased with fibre length at a higher rate than for EGFs and ZFGs. This indicates that, at the present stage of production technology, BFs are better suited for short-fibre composites than for long-fibre applications. The effect of exposure to alkaline environment was also investigated. It was found that the weight loss of BFs was substantially the same as for ZFGs; much higher was the loss for EGF (notoriously prone to chemical attack in alkaline media). However, the mechanical properties of BFs, after alkaline attack, deteriorated at faster rate than for ZFGs...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} paper is the {{determination}} of the effect of the chemical composition and temperature of deformation of standardized tin bronzes and bronze <b>modified</b> with <b>zirconium</b> on the Portevin – Le Chatelier (PLC) phenomenon, mainly basing on the shape of stress-strain curves within the temperature range of 100 - 300 oC and observations of their structure. The reasons of the occurrence of such en effect are so far no fully known and explained and the opinions concerning is physical basis vary. Design/methodology/approach: Of essential design in this research is determination of the dependence of PLC effect on the chemical composition, temperature and strain rate and the preliminary heat treatment and grain size. The main method used in this investigation is tensile test at elevated temperature. Findings: The main conclusions are following: the PLC effect on tin bronzes with a micro-addition of zirconium in an amount of 0. 01 - 0. 05 % depends the temperature of deformation in the tensile test in the range of 100 - 300 oC and the chemical composition of the alloys; the type of serration revealed on the σ–ε curve depend mainly on the temperature of deformation and can be differ during the respective stages of the analyzed curves. Practical implications: In this paper implications for practice are not taken into consideration. Originality/value: In this paper an additive type of serration observed on the curves σ–ε, denoted by the symbol D, is new...|$|R
40|$|Bulk {{screen-printed}} electrodes (bSPEs) <b>modified</b> with <b>zirconium</b> phosphate (ZrP) and Meldola blue (MB) and by {{electrochemical deposition}} of a Reineckate film (bMBZrPRs-SPEs) {{have been constructed}} and used as NADH sensors. Cyclic voltammetric investigation of these bulk electrochemically modified screen-printed electrodes revealed stable catalytic activity in oxidation of the reduced form of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Flow-injection analysis (FIA) coupled with amperometric detection confirmed the improved stability of the bMBZrPRs-SPEs (10 (- 4) mol L- 1 NADH, %RSD= 4. 2, n= 90, pH 7. 0). Other conditions, for example applied working potential (+ 50 mV relative to Ag-AgCl), flow rate (0. 30 mL min(- 1)) and pH-dependence (range 4. 0 - 10. 0) were evaluated and optimized. A glycerol biosensor, prepared by immobilizing glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) on the working electrode area of a bMBZrPRs-SPE, was also assembled. The biosensor was most stable at pH 8. 5 (%RSD= 5. 6, n= 70, 0. 25 mmol L- 1 glycerol). The detection and quantification limits were 2. 8 x 10 (- 6) and 9. 4 x 10 (- 6) mol L- 1, respectively, and the linear working range was between 1. 0 x 10 (- 5) and 1. 0 x 10 (- 4) mol L- 1. To assess the effect of interferences, and recovery by the probe we analyzed samples taken during fermentation of chemically defined grape juice medium and compared the results with those obtained by HPLC.
