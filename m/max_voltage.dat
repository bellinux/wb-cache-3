40|$|APPLICATION NOTE 2013 Voltage {{reference}} scaling technique increases ADC accuracy to {{keep costs}} down Abstract: In this design note a circuit uses a 10 -bit ADC, voltage divider, and external reference to improve the ADC's virtual accuracy to 13 bits. The article shows a voltage scaling technique that extends 10 -bit ADC range to 13 bits. The MAX 159 10 -bit ADC, <b>MAX</b> 5420 <b>voltage</b> divider, and <b>MAX</b> 6141 <b>voltage</b> reference are featured. A data acquisition board, in order to provide flexibility, must be able to accommodate various input voltage ranges. Handling low amplitude signals generally requires {{an increase in the number}} of bits of resolution, increasing cost. This application note describes a simple circuit that uses a low cost 10 -bit ADC but increases the virtual accuracy to 13 -bit. Figure 1. 1 LSB (least significant bit) for an ADC is FSR/ 2 n, where n is the number of bit. FSR (full-scale range) depends from the amplitude of the voltage reference. The input voltage range of the external reference for MAX 159, a low power, 108 ksps serial ADC available in µMAX®- 8 package, is 0 to V DD + 50 mV. This large input range permits to accommodate different input range using a scaling technique. The output of a low-cost 3 -pin voltage reference is scaled using a digitally programmable <b>voltage</b> divider (<b>MAX</b> 5420). This device provides four precision divider ratios of 1, 2, 4, 8.

50|$|In a {{switching}} subcircuit, switching noise must be suppressed. When a load {{is applied}} to a voltage source, it draws {{a certain amount of}} current. Typical power supply lines show inherent inductance, which results in a slower response to change in current. This in turn affects the transient voltage levels, since if the load current is zero the voltage across the load is zero as well. This sudden voltage drop would be seen by other loads as well if the inductance between two loads is much lower compared to the inductance between the loads and the output capacitors of the power supply. This is only temporary; the inductor ultimately saturates (that is the magnetic field around the conductor reaches its <b>max),</b> the <b>voltage</b> drop across the inductor reaches zero, and the supply voltage comes back to normal. But even a temporary reduction in voltage can disturb adjacent subcircuits. Decoupling caps provide instantaneous current jolt which helps maintain constant voltage across a subcircuit (or provide a low impedance path for the transient currents; different descriptions are used by different industries).|$|R

A similar {{version of this article}} appeared in the Decmeber 15, 2006 issue of EDN magazine. USB ports can be a handy source of 5 V power. Not only can a USB port power a microcontroller and other essential circuitry, it often has enough current headroom left over to charge an energy-storage element such as a small battery or super-capacitor. The typical approach is to estimate the maximum current drawn by the essential circuitry, and then place an appropriate current-limiting device {{in the path of the}} energy-storage device (Figure 1). Though simple, this method doesn't utilize all of the available USB current. It therefore takes longer to charge the energy-storage device. Figure 1.

During the exposure to [Ca]o 8 mM the toxic manifestations of calcium overload developed and we observed a reduction in heart rate, coronary flow rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, dp/dt max and an increase in voltage epicardial electrogram.

A remarkable resistive switching was obtained, and the memory cell can be switched between HRS and LRS reversibly. Moreover, the resistive switching was of bipolar type because a reversal polarity of voltage {{was applied to the}} cell for transforming the resistance state. It is worth noting that there is no current jump in HRS or LRS as in Ag/STO and Ag/electrolyte/Pt structure resistive switching devices, in which formation and dissolution of Ag filaments are ascribed for the resistive switching mechanism[13, 14]. In addition, the filaments show localization feature; however, we can find obvious size dependence of current of HRS and LRS. The Ag electrodes with two different areas have 0.1 and 0.3  mm diameters. The resistance of the device is scaling with the area size of the top electrode as shown in the inset of Figure  1 d.

40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are widely used as a filter or bulky capacitor after rectification stages of switching power supplies (SMPS). Fly-back, forward, and resonant converter topologies, which are widely used in consumer electronics products, computer power supplies, and various kind of adapters, require electrolytic capacitors (EL. CAP.) in primary stage and secondary stages for rectification to smooth non-DC current. Electrolytic capacitors must be used because of size and capacitance, unit price, and to withstand voltage. Overall reliability of an SMPS mainly depends on electrolytic capacitors used, because they have extremely short lifetime compared to other active and passive components. Failure modes of electrolytic capacitors are either catastrophic failures or degradation failures. Catastrophic failures generally occur because of fabrication processes. Degradation failures are seen during gradual aging of electrolytic capacitors. During degradation, electrochemical aging occurs between Al 2 O 3 foils and electrolytic solvent, and this creates hydrogen gas inside cap. Degradation process also increases equivalent series resistance (ESR) and decreases capacitance. This degradation is mainly dependent on heat and is somewhat predictable, because main degradation agent is a heat-triggered accelerated electrochemical reaction. Previous works in the literature disclose the obvious fact that this degradation process due to heat can be modeled by a modified Arrhenius Equation, and therefore, it is an exponential curve [1][2]. All commercially available capacitors have their base rated life duration specified in their datasheets, given in hours, such as 1000 hrs, 2000 hrs, 5000 hrs, etc. Those values are measured according to the international standard IEC 60384 (or Japanese equivalent JIS-C- 5101) and are called “base life”. In an SMPS design, the real usage life of a capacitor is calculated based on the temperature that i- is used at. The acceleration factor is calculated with a modified approximation formula and multiplied with base life to calculate the predicted life. Low grade capacitors cause many capacitor plague issues and products of different manufacturers show completely different lifetime performance even their specifications and base lifetime are the same. In this paper, low and medium-grade capacitors from three different manufacturers and high-grade capacitors from two different Japanese manufacturers are selected and tested at their maximum allowable temperature limits, allowable <b>max</b> <b>voltage</b> and ripple current. Total of 100 samples are used during tests from each different manufacturer. Degradation of each capacitor brand, required life and unit cost are evaluated, and a cost/life optimization has been formulized between low-grade capacitors and high-grade capacitors. In the literature, {{there are a number of}} notable works carried out on degradation analysis of electrolytic capacitors; however, there is no comparative analysis of low cost capacitors used in consumer devices. The derived novel method is a useful tool to choose electrolytic capacitors for consumer products that use high voltage (≤ 450 V) on the primary side and low voltage (≤ 65 V) on the secondary side of SMPS. This cost-benefit approximation for capacitor selection process gives good opportunity to design engineers to do the selection based on reliability and overall cost. Results show that the optimized capacitor is not the cheapest, most expensive, or most reliable one; optimal capacitor is a modest Chinese “CAP. B”. It is the most desirable solution that minimizes overall cost inside the warranty duration...|$|E

Forty-five male rats were randomized into 3 groups. In the control group, after a 15 min period of stabilization, hearts were perfused by ischemic perfusion for 30 min and then reperfused. In group I, magnesium sulfate was given after stabilization and before the ischemic period. In group II, calcium concentration was increased by 0. 5 mM and magnesium sulfate was given after stabilization and before the ischemic period. In the control group, we observed during ischemia a reduction in HR, CFR, LVSP, dP/dt max {{and an increase in}} VEE.

An electron beam test apparatus Juelich Divertor Test Equipment in Hot Cells (JUDITH) has been installed in the Hot Cells of the Zentralabteilung Forschungsreaktoren und Kerntechnische Betriebe, complementing the test equipment available in Japan, USA, France and RF. Gamma ray emitting specimens are to be tested under thermal shock, thermal cycling and long-term loading conditions. The apparatus consists of an electron beam unit with a beam power of 60 kW. The <b>max.</b> acceleration <b>voltage</b> is 150 kV, the max. beam current 400 mA. The beam can be deflected with a frequency of 100 kHz in xy-direction with and amplitude of #+-# 50 mm. Short pulses between 1 and 10 ms for the simulation of disruptions are possible, also longer pulses on actively cooled samples. The samples are positioned in a vacuum chamber by remote handling. The sample holder is mounted on a cross-table, allowing the appropriate beam position for each specimen to be defined. Actively cooled divertor elements can be inserted through a flange {{at the side of the}} chamber. The water cooling circuit has a flow rate of 5 m" 3 /h and a pressure of 4 Mpa, enabling a continuous thermal power operation. To handle beryllium and highly radioactive components additional precautions has been taken. An inner vacuum chamber was installed to avoid contamination of the electron beam unit as far as possible. To test small divertor mock-ups without integrated cooling circuit connectors a special clamping mechanism was installed. The measurements of temperatures and material changes are performed by pyrometers, infrared camera systems, thermocouples and visual monitoring by video camera. (orig.)

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} the modalities and the safety aspects for operation of a tabletop monochro-matic (2. 45 MeV) neutron generator from the company NSD-Fusion in our laboratory 15 R- 018. The generator is designed to run at an intensity of up to 107 n/s and serves as the replacement for an existing AmBe source (370 MBq, 2 · 104 n/s). The system does not contain significant amounts of radioactive material and the reaction rate is fully controlled by the applied DC high <b>voltage</b> (<b>max.</b> 120 kV, 15 mA). It is guaranteed to run stable down to 104 n/s. We envisage operation at 106 n/s with an average duty time of 100 hours per month. Unshielded operation at 107 n/s would create an equivalent radiation dose of 120 µSv/h in 1 m distance. A massive but still movable cylindrical radiation shield (diam. 1 m) and a lockable enclosure (3. 5 x 3. 5 m 2) brings the radiation level down to well below 0. 6 µSv/h at places of human access during operation. Operational interlocks are provided by a neutron dose monitor, door switches and the global slow control (temperatures, voltages, currents). ...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{three types of}} {{fullerene}} derivatives were prepared through the electrospray deposition (ESD) method. The optimized conditions for the fabrication of the thin films were investigated for different types of fullerene derivatives: [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester, [6, 6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester, and indene-C 60 -monoadduct. The spray diameter during the ESD process was observed {{as a function of}} the supply rate achieved by changing the applied voltage. In all cases, the spray diameter increased with increasing applied voltage, reaching the maximum diameter (D <b>max)</b> in the <b>voltage</b> range 4 to 6 kV. It was clear that D max was influenced by the dipole moments of the fullerene derivatives (as calculated by density functional theory methods). Scanning electron microscopy observation of the fabricated thin films showed that imbricated structures were formed through the stacking of the fullerene-derivative sheets. Atomic force microscopy images revealed that the density of the imbricated structure was dependent on the spray diameter during the ESD process, and the root-mean-square roughness of the film surface decreased with increasing applied voltage. These findings suggest that the ESD method will be effective for the preparation of fullerene-derivative thin films for the production of organic devices. </p...|$|R
3000|$|The {{microstructure}} and {{the bulk}} {{composition of the}} Co–Ni/MWCNTs nanohybrids (NHs) were examined by STEREOSCAN scanning electron microscope (SEM) working at 20  keV in both Secondary Electron Emission (SE) and Back Scattering (BS) modes. The SEM is equipped with an EDX spectrometer. The surface topography of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs nanohybrid CEs was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements using an ICON AFM Microscope (Bruker) in tapping mode and elaborated using Nanoscope software, and their surface roughness (RMS) derived from the AFM images. The chemical bonding states and work function values (Ф) of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs NHs were investigated using ex situ X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) and Ultra-violet photoelectron (UPS) spectroscopies, respectively. XPS analyses were performed in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions (with a base pressure of 10 − 9  Torr), where a monochromatic Mg–Kα X-ray (Spectra Instruments, hν =  1253.64  eV) was used as excitation source. The C 1  s peak of a pure carbon sample (binding energy position of 284.6  eV) was used as reference material for the calibration of the XPS spectra. After the Shirley background subtraction, the XPS spectra were fitted using CasaXPS software by adopting Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes. UPS measurements were carried out using the He discharge lamp (He I line, hν =  21.2  eV) as the excitation source in normal emission with a resolution of 0.06  eV in the ESCALAB 220 iXL spectrophotometer. A gold reference (having Ф =  5.0  eV) was used to calibrate the Fermi level position, applying a − 3  eV bias to eliminate the intrinsic detector work function barrier. The J–V characteristics of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs based DSSC devices were systemically measured in ambient atmosphere under dark and standard illumination condition (AM 1.5) with an incident light power of 100  mW/cm 2 with an Oriel Sol 3 A solar simulator. The data acquisition was performed using a Keysight B 2901 A source-meter. Two critical parameters of solar cell performances, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) and Fill Factor (FF) were evaluated using the standard equations: PCE = V_oc J_scFF/P_l and FF = V_max J_max/V_oc J_sc, where P [...] l [...] is the power density of the irradiating light, V max and J <b>max</b> are <b>voltage</b> and current density at the maximum power, and V oc and J sc are the open circuit voltage and short circuit current density, respectively.|$|R
30|$|The highest {{output power}} and energy {{conversion}} efficiency were obtained for the DSSC sensitized with acidified ethanolic extract of Bougainvillea spectabilis where {{the efficiency of the}} cell reached 0.175  %. This might be associated with the combination presence of chlorophyll and betalain pigments in the extract to absorb photons—a synergistic effect of two sensitizing pigments. Although there may not be a single pigment that can act as a highly efficient sensitizer, it is possible that a combination of pigments could provide the absorbance necessary to increase the efficiency of a DSSC. In fact, some research has demonstrated a synergistic effect of two sensitizing pigments, meaning the absorption spectra of two pigments combined to increase light absorption and increase the incident photon to current conversion efficiency of the solar cell [25, 26]. Chlorophyll {{plays an important role in}} plant photosynthesis; the DSSCs using chlorophyll derivatives as sensitizers obtained a relatively high conversion efficiency [15, 16]. This is because there are available bonds between the dye and TiO 2 molecules through which electrons can transport from the excited dye molecules to the TiO 2 film [17]. This result indicates that the interaction between the sensitizer and the TiO 2 film is significant in enhancing the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The DSSC output power was calculated as P = J × V using the J–V data. The maximum power (P max) of the DSSCs for each cell is then calculated. The current (I <b>max)</b> and the <b>voltage</b> (V <b>max)</b> corresponding to the maximum power point are then obtained. Generally, the natural dyes employed as sensitizers in solar cell deliver very low efficiencies when compared to synthetic organic and inorganic dyes, due to the absence of specific functional attachment groups and low absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum [27, 28]. The conversion efficiencies of the as prepared DSSCs in this study were better as compared to some DSSC values reported as shown in Table  1. But, the obtained conversion efficiencies were lower than those reported [32] for natural dye based DSSCs may be due to several reasons. Of them one potential reason for the low efficiencies is due to the inconsistency of the TiO 2 film thickness in the layer [29]. The uniformity of the TiO 2 film thickness affects the conversion efficiency of the solar cell. If the film thickness is not uniform, charge recombination can occur and the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC will be reduced. Despite the low efficiencies, the as prepared DSSCs exhibit the applicability of Bougainvillea spectabilis and Euphorbia cotinifolia dyes for photovoltaic energy conversion.|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this master thesis is to {{investigate}} the application of modular multilevel converter (MMC) based grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) conversion systems, and a MATLAB/Simulink model of a PV system composed of two arrays connected to the grid via a five-level MMC is presented to study its operation under steady state and transients. In response to global ever-increasing energy demand, and the pivotal significance of 100 % clean and sustainable energy future to alleviate the adverse impact of fossil fuels and nuclear energy on global warming; tendency towards {{renewable sources of energy}} especially solar photovoltaic systems has incredibly grown in recent years. MMCs, as the PVs inverters and controllers, among their other competitors show superior characteristics and immense potential. The most significant one as the name implies is its modularity that giving rise to fault-tolerant and fail-safe functionality as well as improved waveform quality and reduced harmonic pollution. Besides, MMCs are capable of transformer-less operation; in other words, small passive filters can be the only elements linking these converters to the grid. In this study, a model for MMC-based grid-connected PV applications using MATLAB/Simulink software is developed. First, a piecewise linear model of a solar cell for simulating grid-connected PV systems is utilized to evaluate dynamic and transient response. Then, due to intermittent nature of the solar cells under various irradiances and temperatures, two different maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods are implemented and compared under steady state and transients. The first one is the simple, flexible and robust method of perturb and observe (P&O) where practical techniques for choosing the perturbation frequency and step size based on the selection of the MPPT transient time is introduced. The second strategy is ripple correlation control (RCC) which reduces the steady state error and improves the convergence time. Next, to balance submodule (SM) capacitor voltages and reduce voltage ripples of the MMC, a phase disposition pulse width modulation (PDPWM) technique based on selective virtual loop mapping (SVLM) is simulated that is much faster than the conventional sorting algorithm since it only demands for min and <b>max</b> SM capacitor <b>voltages.</b> Finally, a conventional control method based on modulus optimum technique for tuning of inner current control loop, and symmetrical optimum technique for tuning of outer dc-voltage control loop is presented. Besides, the non-linear method of internal model-based control (IMBC) for controlling the current is presented. In this regard, system dynamic performance under variations imposed by MPPT algorithms is improved, {{and the quality of the}} injected three phase current to the grid is enhanced...|$|R
