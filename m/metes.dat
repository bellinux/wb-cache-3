40|$|Background: Extrathyroidal {{extension}} (ETE) is {{a significant}} prognostic factor in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Minimal extrathyroidal extension (<b>mETE)</b> is characterized by involvement of the sternothyroid muscle or perithyroid soft tissue, and is generally identified by light microscope examination. Patients with <b>mETE,</b> identified pathologically, are automatically upstaged to pT 3. However, the prognostic implications of <b>mETE</b> have {{been a source of}} controversy in the literature. Moreover, there is also controversy surrounding the identification of <b>mETE</b> on pathological specimens. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the level of agreement among expert pathologists in the identification of <b>mETE</b> in PTC cases. Methods: Eleven expert pathologists from the United States, Italy, and Canada were asked to perform a review of 69 scanned slides of representative permanent sections of PTC specimens. Each slide was evaluated for the presence of <b>mETE.</b> The pathologists were also asked to list the criteria they use to identify <b>mETE.</b> Results: The overall strength of agreement for identifying <b>mETE</b> was slight (??=? 0. 14). Inter-pathologist agreement was best for perithyroidal skeletal muscle involvement (??=? 0. 46, moderate agreement) and worst for invasion around thick-walled vascular structures (??=? 0. 02, slight agreement). In addition, there was disagreement over the constellation of histologic features that are diagnostic for <b>mETE,</b> which affected overall agreement for diagnosing <b>mETE.</b> Conclusions: Overall agreement for the identification of <b>mETE</b> is poor. Disagreement is a result of both variation in individual pathologists' interpretations of specimens and disagreement on the histologic criteria for <b>mETE.</b> Thus, the utility of <b>mETE</b> in staging and treatment of PTC is brought into question. The lack of concordance may explain the apparent lack of agreement regarding the prognostic significance of this pathologic feature...|$|R

40|$|We {{isolated}} an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph that {{displays a}} growth phenotype {{similar to that}} of known metF mutants but has elevated levels of 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, the metF gene product. Transduction analysis indicates that the mutant carries normal <b>metE,</b> metH, and metF genes; the phenotype is due to a single mutation, eliminating the possibility that the strain is a <b>metE</b> metH double mutant; and the new mutation is linked to the <b>metE</b> gene by P 1 transduction. Plasmids carrying the Salmonella typhimurium <b>metE</b> gene and flanking regions complement the mutation, even when the plasmid-borne <b>metE</b> gene is inactivated. Enzyme assays show that the mutation results in a dramatic decrease in <b>metE</b> gene expression, a moderate decrease in metH gene expression, and a disruption of the metH-mediated vitamin B 12 repression of the <b>metE</b> and metF genes. Our evidence suggests that the methionine auxotrophy caused by the new mutation is a result of insufficient production of both the vitamin B 12 -independent (<b>metE)</b> and vitamin B 12 -dependent (metH) transmethylase enzymes that are necessary for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine.

40|$|<b>MetE</b> and MetH are two {{distinct}} enzymes that catalyze a similar biochemical reaction {{during the last}} step of methionine biosynthesis, MetH being a cobalamin-dependent enzyme whereas <b>MetE</b> activity is cobalamin-independent. In this work, we show that the last step of methionine synthesis in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is under the transcriptional control of the master pathogenicity regulator HrpG. This control is exerted essentially on <b>metE</b> expression through the intermediate regulator MetR. Expression of <b>metE</b> is strongly and specifically induced {{in the presence of}} plant cells in a hrpG- and metR-dependent manner. <b>metE</b> and metR mutants are not auxotrophic for methionine and not affected for growth inside the plant but produce significantly reduced disease symptoms on tomato whereas disruption of metH has no impact on pathogenicity. The finding that the pathogen preferentially induces <b>metE</b> expression rather than metH in the presence of plant cells is indicative of a probable metabolic adaptation to physiological host conditions since this induction of <b>metE</b> occurs in an environment in which cobalamin, the required co-factor for MetH, is absent. It also shows that <b>MetE</b> and MetH are not functionally redundant and are deployed during specific stages of the bacteria lifecycle, the expression of <b>metE</b> and metH being controlled by multiple and distinct signals...|$|R
