Results show a decreased number of particles emitted (or not change) with an increase in the aromatic concentration in fuel. This is because there is a reduction in the cetane number of the fuel with an increased aromatic content, which effects the combustion process and results in decreased particle formation. However, when ignition improver is used to increase the cetane number, particle emissions remain at a lower level than for normal diesel oil; thereby emphasizing the presence of other factors in the formation of particles...|$|R

40|$|With rising oil prices, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in more accurate measurement during transfers of <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> whether {{for the purposes of}} environmental monitoring or for validating custody transfer. Air entrainment is a common problem in marine fuel transfer (bunkering) operations, which can induce measurement errors in many metering technologies. The latest generation of Coriolis mass flow meters is able to operate in both single- and two-phase (oil-air) flow conditions. Witnessed trials have taken place at the National Engineering Laboratory in the UK using a large (200 mm diameter) Coriolis flowmeter. The accuracies of the mass flow and density measurements were assessed for steady single-phase and two-phase flow on high and low viscosity oils.

40|$|Since 1 st of January 2015 ships {{operating}} in sulphur emission control areas (SECAs) {{have to use}} marine fuels with a fuel sulphur content less than 0. 1 %m/m. This regulation forces the ship owners to make a fuel shift and use low-sulphur marine fuel oils, use alternative fuels or use scrubbers on-board their ships. One {{driving force behind the}} regulation of the fuel sulphur content was to reduce the emissions to air of harmful particles. This thesis focuses on the two first strategies and evaluate how fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics affect the particle emissions. This thesis presents results from particle measurements done in test-bed engine labs and on-board operating ships, with focus on number, mass and sizes of the emitted particles. The on-board measurements considered how a fuel shift from a heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and how use of an alternative fuel, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG) affect the particle emissions. In the test-bed engine measurements the particle emissions from different types of fuels and the effects of fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics, primarily the content of aromatics, were investigated. The results highlight that reduced fuel sulphur contents will not be the only solution for reducing particle emissions, and other fuel characteristics need to be considered. The fuel sulphur content influences the emissions of particles with a diameter of 50 nm or less, whereas other fuel characteristics affect particles in all sizes. An increased content of aromatics did not result in increasing particle emissions, which indicate that the content of aromatics may not play a crucial role with respect to particle emissions from ships. Furthermore, the fuel shift strategy and changing from heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> did not affect the number of particles emitted significantly: similar amounts of number of particles were emitted and there was an increase in the emissions of smaller particles. In contrast, the strategy of using an alternative fuel, here LNG, resulted in significant reductions of the particle emissions. Furthermore, the results also highlight the importance of conducting measurements of number of particles emitted when studying particle emissions from ships and in any future regulation of these emissions...|$|E

The emitted particulate matter (PM) was measured in terms of mass, number, size distribution, volatility, elemental composition, content of organics, black and elemental carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), microstructure and micro-composition, along with the gaseous emissions at different operating conditions. The fuel change reduced emissions of PM mass up to 67 %. The number of particles emitted remained unchanged and were dominated by nanoparticles. Furthermore, the fuel change resulted in an 80 % reduction of SO 2 emissions and decreased emissions of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emissions of both monoaromatic and lighter polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds increased with RMB 30, while the heavy, PM-bound PAH species that belong to the carcinogenic PAH family were reduced. Emissions of BC remained similar between the two fuels. This study indicates that the use of low-sulfur residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> is a way to comply with the new FSC regulation and will reduce the anthropogenic load of SO 2 emissions and secondary PM formed from SO 2, Emissions of primary particles, however, remain unchanged and do not decrease as much as would be expected if distilled fuel was used.

40|$|Emissions of particles, gases, heat, {{and water}} vapor from ships are {{discussed}} {{with respect to}} their potential for changing the microstructure of marine stratiform clouds and producing the phenomenon known as "ship tracks. " Airborne measurements are used to derive emission factors of SO_ 2 and NO from diesel-powered and steam turbine-powered ships, burning low-grade <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (MFO); they were 15 – 89 and 2 – 25 g kg^(- 1) of fuel burned, respectively. By contrast a steam turbine–powered ship burning high-grade navy distillate fuel had an SO_ 2 emission factor of 6 g kg^(- 1). Various types of ships, burning both MFO and navy distillate fuel, emitted from 4 x 10 ^(15) to 2 x 10 ^(16) total particles per kilogram of fuel burned (4 x 10 ^(15) – 1. 5 x 10 ^(16) particles per second). However, diesel-powered ships burning MFO emitted particles with a larger mode radius (0. 03 – 0. 05 µm) and larger maximum sizes than those powered by steam turbines burning navy distillate fuel (mode radius 0. 02 µm). Consequently, if the particles have similar chemical compositions, those emitted by diesel ships burning MFO will serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at lower supersaturations (and will therefore be more likely to produce ship tracks) than the particles emitted by steam turbine ships burning distillate fuel. Since steam turbine–powered ships fueled by MFO emit particles with a mode radius similar to that of diesel-powered ships fueled by MFO, it appears that, for given ambient conditions, the type of fuel burned by a ship {{is more important than the}} type of ship engine in determining whether or not a ship will produce a ship track. However, more measurements are needed to test this hypothesis. The particles emitted from ships appear to be primarily organics, possibly combined with sulfuric acid produced by gas-to-particle conversion of SO_ 2.

The energy required for decomposition of heavy molecules is accounted for.

Net present value (NPV) analysis sets the technical framework for the economic evaluation. The analysis comes to the conclusion that using LNG as fuel for ships offers the potential for significant environmental improvement, regarding both air quality and climate protection, in all sectors subject to the analysis. Economically, LNG as fuel can compete with conventional <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> (MGO), at <b>oil</b> prices around approximately 60 $/bbl. Hence, {{the results of this study}} indicate that from both an environmental- and economic perspective the investment in LNG powered ships is strongly recommendable. The study also presents some potential barriers with regards to commercial viability and technological feasibility that need to be overcome before LNG becomes fully competitive with other fuels...|$|R
30|$|Background Due to high safety {{measures}} in production, {{transport and storage}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> it rarely occurs, that <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> will be released in the environment. One exception of this experience was the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> releases of private <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> tanks during the “century flood” 2002 in Germany. By order of IWO (Institut für wirtschaftliche Oelheizung e.[*]V.), the authors investigated the environmental behaviour of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> after flood incidents.|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel {{produced}} from vegetable oils, animal fats and algae oil is a renewable, environmentally friendly and clean alternative fuel that reduces pollutants and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} in marine applications. This study investigates the influence of biodiesel blend {{on the characteristics of}} residual and distillate <b>marine</b> <b>fuels.</b> Adequate correlation equations are applied to calculate the fuel properties of the blended <b>marine</b> <b>fuels</b> with biodiesel. Residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> RMA has inferior fuel characteristics compared with distillate <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> DMA and biodiesel. The flash point of <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> RMA could be increased by 20 % if blended with 20 vol% biodiesel. The sulfur content of residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> could meet the requirement of the 2008 MARPOL Annex VI Amendment by blending it with 23. 0 vol% biodiesel. In addition, the kinematic viscosity of residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> could be reduced by 12. 9 % and the carbon residue by 23. 6 % if 20 vol% and 25 vol% biodiesel are used, respectively. Residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> blended with 20 vol% biodiesel decreases its lower heating value by 1. 9 %. Moreover, the fuel properties of residual <b>marine</b> <b>fuel</b> are found to improve more significantly with biodiesel blending than those of distillate <b>marine</b> <b>fuel...</b>|$|R
