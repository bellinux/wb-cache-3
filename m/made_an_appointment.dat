5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E
25|$|By now the FBI was {{questioning}} Aafia's former {{professors and}} other associates. In May 2002, the FBI began questioned Siddiqui {{and her husband}} regarding their purchase over the internet of $10,000 worth of night vision equipment, body armour, and military manuals including The Anarchist's Arsenal, Fugitive, Advanced Fugitive, and How to Make C-4. Khan claimed that these were for hunting and camping expeditions. (He later told authorities he purchased them to please Siddiqui.) The couple <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> {{to talk to the}} FBI again in a few weeks but Suddiqui insisted the family leave for Pakistan (according to Khan), and on 26 June 2002, the couple and their children returned to Karachi.|$|E
25|$|Mek'ele {{was founded}} in the 13th century. Mek'ele {{became one of the}} major cities of Enderta {{province}} alongside Entalo starting from the 1870s. Mek'ele's heyday came during the late nineteenth century, after Yohannes IV was crowned as King of Kings of Ethiopia, and chose Mek'ele as the capital of his realm. It was here that his son and heir, Ras Araya Selassie, died of smallpox in June 1888 while assembling an army to support his father. After Yohannes' death at the Battle of Metemma, his successor Emperor Menelik II came to Mek'ele 23 February 1890, where he accepted the submission of the nobles of Tigray—except for Mangesha Yohannes who had <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> to submit 20 days later.|$|E

50|$|It {{was rumored}} that Douglas {{would be given}} <b>a</b> {{political}} <b>appointment</b> in the Truman administration but that the Nixon-Douglas race had <b>made</b> such <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> too controversial for Truman. According to Democratic National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Douglas supporter, Douglas {{could not have been}} appointed dogcatcher.|$|R
25|$|A factor {{from which}} the {{intention}} to evade or delay payment may be inferred is that the debtor <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> to make a payment and then departed without keeping it. In Abell v Strauss, Abel applied to sequestrate the estate of Strauss, a taxi driver, {{on the ground that}} he had committed an act of insolvency in terms of section 8(a), in that he had departed from his dwelling with the intention of evading or delaying the payment of his debts. The court considered that Strauss’s frequent absences from his dwelling might be attributed as much to the demands of his occupation as to an intention to avoid payment. In the court’s view, it could not be inferred that Strauss had committed the act of insolvency alleged.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{was born}} in Alexandria, Virginia, and moved to Florida with his family during his junior high school years. He {{attended}} Tulane University in New Orleans where he studied biology and was a pre-med student. At {{the beginning of his}} senior year, Brown switched his major to acting and directing in the theater. Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, Brown taught in the Brevard County public school system in Florida for three years. In 1972, he applied to the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television as a master's degree candidate. When he was not accepted, Brown drove across the country and <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> with the Dean of the Film School. Upon learning that Brown had driven all that way to see him, the Dean promptly admitted Brown to the program based on his perseverance. Brown became the graduate teaching assistant in the beginning camera class, and counted amongst his students actor and singer Ed Ames.|$|E

50|$|Sclater was {{the founder}} and editor of The Ibis, {{the journal of the}} British Ornithologists' Union. He was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London from 1860 to 1902.

25|$|Despite the variability, all {{but four}} presidents {{have been able}} to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, though his {{successor}} (John Tyler) <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction {{in the size of the}} Court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Somewhat similarly, presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.|$|E
25|$|However, priors were {{sometimes}} themselves in serious trouble. In 1341 the prior Richard le Warde intervened {{in a dispute}} at Tettenhall, where there was conflict over {{the status of the}} College of St Michael as a royal chapel. The dean had <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> in the regular way of Louis de Cherleton as prebendary of Codsall. It wsas then alleged that the Pope, with the support of other ecclesiastical authorities, was contesting the appointment and sought to impose a different candidate through papal provision. Edward III, forbade any further proceedings against Cherleton on 8 March 1341 and again on 10 May. On 10 October Prior Richard and his chaplain Edmund were included in a list of those planning to remove Cherleton in contravention of the king's earlier decrees. The arrest of all of them was ordered. They failed to appear before the King's Bench in Stafford and the Sheriff was ordered to attach the prior and arrest the others to appear in Hilary term of the following year. It seems that again nothing happened and the cases were then postponed again to the Trinity term. This time Roger Northburgh, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield appeared in court as a defendant and the matter was again put off until the Michaelmas term. What became of the cases against the prior and his priest is unknown but the king ultimately got his way.|$|E
500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

The destruction of evidence linked to Tillman's death, including his personal journal, led his mother to speculate that he was murdered.

2500|$|After being {{inspired}} by the film Ordinary People, Chapman returned to Hawaii, telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon.

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I <b>made</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
