5|$|During this season, {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone formed on March 16, {{and the last}} one dissipated on December 12. A total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 25 became tropical storms. 19 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 2 reached super typhoon strength. Two-thirds of the tropical cyclones formed between July and October. Typhoon Pamela was the longest-lived tropical cyclone of the season. Sixteen of the cyclones struck land during their life cycles, with eight <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. Tropical cyclones accounted for 35percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong, their fifth wettest tropical cyclone contribution on record at the time. Nearly half of the deaths during the season were the result of Typhoon Nancy <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Philippines and Vietnam in October.|$|E

5|$|When Gonzalo first formed, various governments {{across the}} eastern Caribbean issued {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches, extending from Guadeloupe {{to the coast}} of Puerto Rico. As the storm was strengthening and <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> region, a hurricane warning was issued for the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Saint Martin. Several major cruise lines altered their itineraries to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, {{which also}} {{triggered}} {{the formation of}} another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Ashina She'er's {{soldiers}} were organized in five columns. The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and struck at Kucha {{from the north}} by <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Dzungarian Basin, which was {{the territory of the}} Chuyue (possibly Chigil) and Chumi, two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state. The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and Chumi before entering the Tarim Basin, upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and tried to find a defensible position in Kucha's eastern territories. Ashina She'er's forces pursued the Karasahr king, took him captive, and then executed him.|$|E
5|$|By June29, a trough, <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) {{from the center}}. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|E

The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Venezuela, Bret first {{affected}} Trinidad and Tobago, causing minor {{flooding and}} power outages. It passed {{just south of}} Cura√ßao, where the storm damaged the coral reef and the roofs of 17homes. The storm later brushed northern Colombia, killing one person there, before hitting Central America. In Nicaragua, Bret killed 31people and left US$3million in damage, with many coastal towns isolated by floods. There was one death in neighboring Costa Rica and seven in Honduras, all due to flooding. In Central America, damage was compounded by Hurricane Gert <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> region in early September.|$|E

5|$|September 28, 2004- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Jeanne, combined with two cold fronts, produce heavy rainfall peaking at 8.01inches (203mm) in Newark. The precipitation leads to rising rivers, including the Red Clay Creek which crests at 13.59feet (4.14m) The rainfall also floods {{roads in the}} northern portion of the state, resulting in trapped vehicles. The {{remnants of}} Jeanne also spawn an F2 tornado in northern New Castle County. The tornado's 5mile (8km) path includes <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> New Castle Airport and several buildings. The tornado damages numerous planes and buildings {{at the airport and}} injures five people. Damage totals to around $1million (2004USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{prolonged}} westward {{track of}} Hurricane Fefa produced swells {{of up to}} 15feet (4.5m) in height. The swells hit eastward facing beaches along the island of Hawaii. The swells washed debris and sea water onto coastal roads near Punaluu Black Sand Beach, resulting in the roads being closed following the storm. Southwestern Maui experienced rough surf, as well. Despite being a weak tropical depression and a tropical wave while <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands, Fefa produced locally strong wind gusts of up to 50mph (80km/h) in the islands of Hawaii and Maui.|$|E
5|$|While the {{hurricane}} was <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Miami to Titusville, later upgrading to a hurricane warning from Miami to Daytona Beach. The agency advised residents to take precautions for {{the hurricane}}, citing {{the potential for}} strong winds and waves. Hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from Punta Rassa to Apalachicola, and after the storm recurved, hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to Jacksonville. Because of well-issued hurricane warnings, residents were prepared for the storm, {{and the number of}} lives lost in the coastal Palm Beach area was only 26.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane {{passed through the}} Bahamas. The eye crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938mbar (27.70inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the Beaufort scale. The hurricane was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes as of 1997.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Florida Straits, the hurricane {{turned to the}} northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) on October6 while <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October8. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1million (1933CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region. The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October9 {{to the south of}} Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|After <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Tongan islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 {{people out of the}} water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E
