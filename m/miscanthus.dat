25|$|For each billion ethanol-equivalent {{gallons of}} fuel {{produced}} and combusted in the US, the combined climate-change and health costs are $469 million for gasoline, $472–952 million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source (natural gas, corn stover, or coal) and technology, but only $123–208 million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock (prairie biomass, <b>Miscanthus,</b> corn stover, or switchgrass).|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{criticism}} about the production of ethanol fuel from food crops. However, second generation biofuels are now being produced from a much broader range of feedstocks including the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial grasses such as switchgrass and <b>Miscanthus</b> giganteus), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Produced responsibly they are sustainable energy sources that need not divert any land from growing food, nor damage the environment.|$|E
25|$|Bio-ethanol {{is usually}} {{obtained}} from the conversion of carbon-based feedstock. Agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis, provided that all minerals required for growth (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) are returned to the land. Ethanol can be produced {{from a variety of}} feedstocks such as sugar cane, bagasse, <b>miscanthus,</b> sugar beet, sorghum, grain, switchgrass, barley, hemp, kenaf, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, sunflower, fruit, molasses, corn, stover, grain, wheat, straw, cotton, other biomass, as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting, whichever has the best well-to-wheel assessment.|$|E
25|$|Cellulosic ethanol {{is a type}} of biofuel {{produced}} from lignocellulose, a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Corn stover, switchgrass, <b>miscanthus</b> and woodchip are some of the more popular non-edible cellulosic materials for ethanol production. Commercial investment in such second-generation biofuels began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is moving forward rapidly. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.|$|E
25|$|Biomass is {{biological}} material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass. As an energy source, biomass {{can either be}} used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel {{can be achieved by}} different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps –, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including <b>miscanthus,</b> switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).|$|E

Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels, through [...] better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources.|$|E
500|$|Typically {{found on}} twigs or buried wood, the fungus {{is known to}} be a {{vigorous}} decomposer of lignin and cellulose in leaf litter. Mycena polygramma is a saprobic fungus, and is one of many fungi that contribute to plant litter decomposition in forest ecosystems through nutrient recycling and humus formation in soil. It is a [...] decomposer of larch litter, and can break down both lignin and carbohydrates, although it has a preference for carbohydrates. In an experiment testing the ability of several litter-decomposing fungi to remove lignin from leaves of the [...] grass <b>Miscanthus</b> sinensis, under pure culture conditions, M.polygramma showed limited ability to cause the mass loss of lignin.|$|E

That winter, he took the surprising step of moving across the river to Fukagawa, {{out of the public eye}} and towards a more reclusive life.

2500|$|Biofuel crops {{grown in}} the UK include oilseed rape (which is also grown for other purposes), short-rotation coppices such as poplar or willow, and <b>miscanthus.</b> [...] Unfortunately {{biofuels}} are quite bulky for their energy yield, which means processing into fuel needs to happen near where the crop is grown; otherwise, {{most or all of}} the benefit of biofuels can be lost in transporting the biofuel to the processing area. [...] Such local processing units are not generally available in the UK, and further expansion of this market will depend on politics and industrial finance.|$|E
