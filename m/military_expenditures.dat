The causality relationship between government <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth has so far received attention from many economists, the dominant ones being Wagner (1890) and Keynes (1936). According to literature, there currently exist four perspectives around the causality relationship <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth. The first perspective by Keynes (1936) suggests that <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> spur economic growth whilst the second perspective by Wagner (1890) mentions that economic growth affects <b>military</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The third perspective says both <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth affects each other whilst the fourth perspective suggests the existence of no causality relationship at all between <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth.

Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve.

5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{articles}} have been written on the determinants of <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> in developing countries, which is important given the negative effect of <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> on economic development. There has been no such study for Zimbabwe. This paper tries to fill this gap, by empirically testing the effects of economic factors, external factors, and geopolitical factors on Zimbabweâ€™s <b>military</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The empirical work is preceded by {{a survey of the}} trends in <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> since 1980. The paper applies a log-linear model specification based on the standard neoclassical theory (Smith, 1989; 1990; 1995) to estimate the determinants of <b>military</b> <b>expenditure.</b> It utilises OLS estimations on co-integrated variables and comes up with long run and short run (ECM) models. The empirical findings suggest that Zimbabwean <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> has been influenced by both external and internal factors. The significant factors include the regional wars, the <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> of neighbouring countries, income, the governmentâ€™s domestic borrowing ability and the trade balance.

This article examines the impact of <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> and income on external debt for a panel of six Middle Eastern countries - Oman, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, Iran, and Jordan - over the period 1988 to 2002. The Middle East represents an interesting study of the effect of <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> on external debt because it {{has one of the highest}} rates of arms imports in the world and it is one of the most indebted regions in the world. The study first establishes whether there is a long-run relationship between <b>military</b> <b>expenditure,</b> income, and external debt in the six countries using a panel unit root and panel cointegration framework and then proceeds to estimate the long-run and short-run effects of <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> and income on external debt. The study finds that external debt is elastic with respect to <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the long run and inelastic with respect to <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the short run. For the panel of six Middle Eastern countries, in the long run a 1 % increase in <b>military</b> <b>expenditure</b> results in between a 1. 1 % and 1. 6 % increase in external debt, while a 1 % increase in income reduces external debt by between 0. 6 % and 0. 8 %, depending on the specific estimator employed.
