[...] She also said that [...] "Romney Marsh is an area where I {{spent a lot of time}} when I was a child. Growing up in a city such as London, it’s so confined sometimes that as a child there is no feeling of a horizon, there’s nothing beyond what you know. So for me I was so lucky to have that experience of spending a lot of time in open spaces such as Romney Marsh that I was able to gain that feeling of beyond.

Gong describes the place {{he grew up in}} his autobiography Obsessed with Excellence: “Even though the house that my family lived is now a part of a city, back then, located near the sea and called hangnam-dong (south of the port), it was where the fishermen gathered and an important area for the fishing industry. Like its name, the neighborhood which was located south of the seaport had many abandoned materials from the time of Japanese occupation of Korea. In his autobiography, Gong describes his father Gong Tae-Jong (born in 1924) and mother Lee Jeong-Soon (born in 1925) as follows: [...] "It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to describe my parents as people who worked their hardest to their utmost capacities. My mother’s hands, from all the work at home and at the fishery, were as rugged as those of manual workers, and it is those hands that first come to my mind when I reminisce about my mother. When I think about my father, diligence, sincerity, and adventurism are the words that first come to my mind while diligence, sacrifice, and devotion are the words that I think of when reminiscing about my mother.

In the morning one must wash the hands plus rinse the mouth. After returning from urinating and defecation, one always cleans the hands. The hat must be on straight; the buttons must be done up. The socks and shoes should all be on snugly. For putting away hats and clothes, use set places. Don't set them down just anywhere, making a sweaty mess. In clothes value cleanliness not fanciness. First follow one's station in life; second suit the family's financial situation. With food and drink do not be picky. Eat just enough, not excessively. While still young, don't drink alcohol; being drunk is a most ugly sight. Walk relaxed and stand straight; bow deep and round, and salute reverently. Don't stand on thresholds; don't lean on one leg.

Enter empty rooms as if someone is there. Do not be too busy, or {{there will be many}} mistakes. Don't fear difficulties; don't look down upon asking questions. Where there is fighting and disturbance, do not ever go near. Evil deviant things, don't ever say. When about to enter through a door, ask who is there. When about to enter a hall, one must call out. When people ask who it is, answer with your name. [...] "Me" [...] and [...] "I" [...] don't make anything clear.|$|E
5000|$|One of Withenoc's first acts at Monmouth was {{to found}} a Benedictine priory in the town. In so doing, he called upon William of Dol - perhaps a {{relative}} - who had been appointed in 1070 as abbot of Saint Florent at Saumur. This was a great abbey {{on the banks of}} the Loire, which was destroyed in the sixteenth century. William sent a prior and monks to inaugurate the new priory at Monmouth, and, in turn, the priory and its endowments were granted to the abbey of Saint Florent. This arrangement continued until the fourteenth century, with the priors of Monmouth coming from Saumur, and part of its revenue, as an alien priory, being sent back to France. [...] The founding charter of the priory has been transliterated as follows:"Wihenoc de Monmouth, to all men, his friends and neighbours, to all the faithful sons of the holy mother church, as well present as future, wishes health. Be it known unto you that I, Wihenoc, being moved by divine impulse, the advice of God, and my soldiers and vassals requiring that from me, for the honour of God, and the holy Virgin at St. Florentius, for the health of my soul, and <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>have</b> built a church in my castle of Monmouth, and have granted it for ever to St. Florentius de Salmure, from whence I have invited monks to inhabit the said church; and that there they may live, regularly serving God, I have granted unto them certain possessions, as well in lands as in churches and tenths, viz. the church of St. Cadoc near my castle, in my manor, where first the aforesaid monks, before the church of Monmouth was finished, some time inhabited: the church of St. Wingatoll; the church of Bockeville, the church of Llangradoc, the church of Welch Bicknor, the church of Eililde Hopa (Long Hope), with the chapel of Hently, the church of Toberton, the church of Stretton, with the chapel of Hasperton, and three carucates of land near the castle of Monmouth, and one carucate in Llancadock, and one carucate in Suentona, and two parts of all the tythes of my manor, as well as in my own possessions, as in the possession of my vassals, and the tenths of all mills, and the tenths of all my taxes.
