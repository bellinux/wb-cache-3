5|$|In the 1940 {{legislative}} session, Johnson successfully lobbied the General Assembly {{to allocate}} <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> teacher retirement system {{that had previously}} been authorized but left unfunded. Despite his fiscally conservative nature, he increased funds to programs to assist the elderly by $1million per year. Other accomplishments of the session included the provision of pensions for justices on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, creation of soil conservation districts in the state, and banning the sale of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> debtor {{for a particular}} purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered <b>money,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> maximum of $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public.

5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E

25|$|Brayne's {{earliest}} financial {{involvement with}} his brother-in-law, James Burbage, was in 1568, when they lent <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> third party. Eight years later, on 13 April 1576, Burbage leased {{part of the}} grounds of the dissolved Holywell Priory in Shoreditch from Giles Allen for the purpose of building a playhouse. To help finance the scheme he took in Brayne as a partner, and it was later claimed that Brayne had supplied most of the £700 spent {{in the construction of the}} Theatre, and had bankrupted himself in so doing. Brayne sold his business and house in Bucklersbury, and by 1577–8 was no longer active as a grocer.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the bank statement presented by the bank to the customer is the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a chequing account as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a liability account is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> customer and places the money into the customer's chequing account, the bank has increased its obligation to pay that money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears in the credit column of a bank statement.|$|E

25|$|In the 1905 provincial elections, Liberals won 16 of 25 {{seats in}} Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan {{government}} bought out Bell Telephone Company in 1909, {{with the government}} owning the long-distance lines and left local service to small companies organized at the municipal level. Premier Thomas Walter Scott preferred government assistance to outright ownership because he thought enterprises worked better if citizens had a stake in running them; he set up the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company in 1911. Despite pressure from farm groups for direct government involvement in the grain handling business, the Scott government opted to loan <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> farmer-owned elevator company. Saskatchewan in 1909 provided bond guarantees to railway companies {{for the construction of}} branch lines, alleviating the concerns of farmers who had trouble getting their wheat to market by wagon.|$|E
