Benefits of assessment that focuses on <b>meeting</b> <b>programme</b> objectives include deeper learning and better student engagement via assessment that is more meaningful and enables connections to be made between individual modules on a degree programme. This study involves a novel, integrated approach to assessment on two marketing-degree modules, where a new product development concept on a marketing-content module is planned, analysed and promoted through a website developed on a quantitative methods and IS module. Results show improvements in student performance (three to four percentage points on related coursework items), student engagement (with increased numbers of students attempting all coursework) and student feedback. Based on this initial success, plans to further integrate the assessment in the following academic year have also been planned...|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Cash transfers are increasingly used in sub-Saharan Africa as a social protection instrument to address poverty and improve the health and well-being of children living in poor resource and high HIV prevalence areas. Small amounts of cash given to poor households on a regular and predictable (often monthly or bi-monthly) basis allow for control, independence and decision making [1, 2]. However, cash transfers, which target some households and not others, can misfire and lead to conflict, jealousy and other unintended consequences. It is against this background that we explore community perceptions of a community-led cash transfer programme in Zimbabwe and discuss the role of community participation in con-tributing to the acceptability of cash transfers, reducing the risk of unintended consequences, and <b>meeting</b> <b>programme</b> objectives. Conditional cash transfers gained popularity in South America where long-standing programmes have demon...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} study in Amsterdam showed that combined family {{support in the}} <b>Meeting</b> Centres Support <b>Programme,</b> in which persons with dementia patients and their carers are both supported by one professional staff, is more effective in influencing behaviour problems and mood of dementia patients living in the community than non-integrated support, such as day care only. A multi-centre implementation study tests if similar effects are achieved in other regions of The Netherlands. METHODS: A pretest-posttest control group design was applied. 112 dementia patients who visited psychogeriatric day care in eight community centres {{across the country and}} in three nursing homes, and their carers participated in the study. The patients in the experimental group (n= 89) received support from the <b>Meeting</b> Centres Support <b>Programme</b> together with their carers, while the control group (n= 23) received day care only. Behaviour problems (aggressive behaviour, inactivity, non-social behaviour) and mood (dissatisfaction, depressive behaviour) were assessed using standardized observation scales. Quality of life was assessed by interviewing the patients. RESULTS: After 7 months the <b>Meeting</b> Centres Support <b>Programme,</b> compared to regular day care, showed a moderately positive effect on the degree of total behaviour problems (effect size= 0. 52), especially on inactivity (effect size= 0. 37) and non-social behaviour (effect size= 0. 60), a large effect on depressive behaviour (effect size= 0. 92) and a moderate effect on self-esteem (effect size= 0. 43). CONCLUSIONS: The <b>Meeting</b> Centres Support <b>Programme</b> proves to be more effective than regular day care in influencing behaviour problems, especially inactivity and non-social behaviour, and depressed mood. Participation in the programme also seems to {{have a positive effect on}} self-esteem, an important aspect of quality of life. These findings surpass the results of the Amsterdam study and confirm the surplus value of the <b>Meeting</b> Centres Support <b>Programme</b> as compared to regular day care for people with mild to severe dementi...|$|R
