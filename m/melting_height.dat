40|$|The {{verification}} of radar retrieval results like hydrometeor type, quantity, and dynamics of clouds {{is an essential}} requirement for assimilating observation data into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. Field campaigns were executed to enrich the observational data base with special aims - for instance the Convection and Orographically Induced Precipitation Study (COPS) in 2007 iin south-west Germany and eastern France had planed to improve the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) in mountainous areas. Therefore {{a huge amount of}} different observation instruments were concentrated in the region around Black Forest, Vogues and Rhine valley especially at socalled supersites. The current study focus on comparison between polarimetric C-band and vertically pointed Ka-band to retrieve profiles of hydrometeor type and quantity. Additional data from radio sounding, rain gauges, and distrometers were used to retrieve temperature profile, rain rate, and raindrop size distribution at ground. The <b>melting</b> <b>height</b> level was used to confirm the spatial data synchronization of different radars. The predominant hydrometeor type were estimated from C-band radar by using polarimetric variables LDR and ZDR. Profiles of reflectivity differences from Ka- and C-band radar were analyzed to give a first guess of mean particle sizes as well as liquid and ice water content taking iinto account attenuation of radar beam. For comparisons additional simulations of radar reflectivity from C- and Ka- band by using T-matrix method were examined by assuming profiles of liquid water and ice particles. In a case study a more complex procedure was used to retrieve profiles of liquid and ice water content from measured raindrop size distribution at ground, vertical Doppler velocity from Ka-band radar and the attenuation corrected reflectivity difference from C- and Ka-band radar. To correct vertical velocity measurements from convective up- or downward motion additional data from an SODAR system were taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{polarimetry}} {{has as its}} object to study the state of polarization of an electromagnetic (e. m.) wave and its changes of state. Radar polarimetry {{is based on the}} concept that the knowledge of the behavior of a wave interacting with a target, allows the radar to use not only the whole power re-radiated by the target, but also information not present in traditional radar. In other words, a wave which travels in free space brings with it a large number of information (amplitude, Doppler frequency, phase, direction), among which the polarization, that is, the trajectory described by the electric field vector. When the wave comes into contact with a target, it is re-radiated and received by the radar with a state of polarization, which may be different from the one used in transmission. In fact, such a change or transformation is related not only to the polarization used in transmission, but also to the geometric and structural characteristics of the object. The main limitation of the radar used in the 70 '- 80 ' was {{due to the fact that}} they transmitted and received with the same polarization. This means that, using a mono-polarized radar, a change of state of polarization, due to the presence of a target, is not disclosed by the radar itself, causing a considerable loss of information. This suggests that full polarimetric survey and subsequent extraction of information are a valuable aid for the detection and classification of the target. Indeed, it is thanks to the growth of the theory of radar polarimetry and the phenomenological theory of the target that the design technology of complex equipment has been able to grow up to the design of fully polarimetric radar that makes use of discriminant of polarization states. The benefits of an e. m. wave polarimetric study are related not only to the detection, classification and recognition of targets, but also to a minimization of the effects of multipath in the radar mapping and tracking in the field of remote sensing and imaging applications. In this thesis we focus mainly on the applications of radar polarimetry in various fields, and showing the feasibility of new methods of feature extraction, namely scattering matrix decomposition method in support of more traditional polarimetric feature extraction for improved classification for various types of target. First part of thesis deals with volumetric target simulation and analysis, namely meteorological targets, both airborne and ground-based, and introduces the concept of Polarimetric Target Decomposition, showing how polarimetry, especially in the case of airborne operations, is able to help to detect and classify possible hazards encountered during the flight, or, in the case of ground-based operation, is able to give a enhanced awareness of the structure of the perturbation with a better understanding of the whole picture. In current avionic systems, for example, is impossible to distinguish the type of precipitation, water, snow, hail. Of course, assumptions can be done, i. e., high reflectivity in a zone where temperature is 15 - 20 degrees below zero is likely to indicate an hailstorm, but we can have no precise information on type of precipitation near and below the <b>melting</b> <b>height</b> (which also depends on season and geographic region). About 70 % of the high-reflectivity echoes that pilots see on their radar are non-hazardous (other than causing a decrease in visibility and making runways wet). To determine whether or not a particular “red” echo is hazardous in terms of turbulence and hail and other dangers, the pilot must first know if the atmosphere in which he is flying is conducive to hail and high turbulence. It is worth noting to recall that heavy rain without turbulence is not an issue for the safety of the flight. But even with atmospheric knowledge, a pilot cannot say whether a particular high-reflectivity area is hazardous. Usually, the pilot evades that area, with an increase of costs, time and polluting emissions due to the detour. In the latter part we describe also the work made in collaboration with TU Delft in the Netherlands using real polarimetric radar data. The second part of the thesis deals with man-made target polarimetric analysis; we analyzed in particular a marine environment, studying a system of detection of ships responsible of illegal discharges in the sea. While first part of the system deals with the analysis of non-polarimetric data, spill and ship detection, the second part is oriented to the feasibility of polarimetric classification of different ships...|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{growth by}} the {{vertical}} Bridgman method {{in which there}} is little or no contact between the wall and the crystal has been termed detached solidification. Detachment has been observed frequently in previous microgravity experiments, and has been reported under some terrestrial conditions as well.

To test this hypothesis, an experimental technique has been developed to measure this pressure difference during the growth of germanium by the vertical Bridgman method. The apparatus allows for both monitoring the pressures and actively controlling them during growth. For a given <b>melt</b> <b>height,</b> there is a maximum pressure difference attainable before gas bubbles up through the melt.

40|$|Successful {{processing}} of homogeneous semiconductor single crystals from their melts depends strongly on precise control of thermal and fluid flow conditions near the solid/liquid interface. In this project, we utilize a novel crystal growth technique called Axial Heat Processing (AHP) {{that uses a}} baffle, positioned inside the melt near the interface, to supply and/or conduct heat axially to the interface. The baffle, {{which may or may}} not have a heater encased in it, can promote more stable and planar growth as well as reduce buoyancy driven convection. The latter is because the baffle reduces the aspect ratio of the melt as it separates the melt into three sections, above the baffle, in the feed gap between the baffle and the crucible wall, and below the baffle between the baffle base and the interface. AHP also enables a close monitoring and/or control of thermal boundaries near the solid/liquid interface during crystal growth by means of thermocouples placed in the baffle. The interface is kept planar when a heating element in the baffle is used.

40|$|The {{capability}} of the fuel to operate at high power without melting is important to Fast Reactors. Reactor design limits normally require {{that there be a}} low probability of fuel melting during steady-state operation, including overpower conditions. This requirement has a direct effect on the steady-state power limit of the fuel pin and hence on the reactor power. The development of computational tools that are able to capture the occurrence of high temperature phenomena and mechanisms is thus an important step in reducing the margin of conservatisms and increasing the reactor efficiency. Among the experiments that were conducted for this purpose, HEDL P- 19 experiment has been selected and simulated using TRANSURANUS code to exploit its capability to capture the inception of MOX fuel melting. The experiment included 8 fresh pins with cladding Outside Diameters (OD) 5. 84 mm, and 8 fresh 6. 35 mm OD pins. It was performed during 1971 to investigate the effect of the initial fuel-to-cladding diametric gap size (from 0. 086 to 0. 25 mm) on the linear heat rate needed to initiate incipient melting at beginning-of-life. All 5. 84 mm OD pins with fuel-to-cladding gaps equal to or less than 0. 14 mm had no fuel melting. The remaining 5. 84 mm OD pins and all the 6. 35 mm OD pins experienced partial fuel melting.

The experimental analysis was performed at NEC Fundamental Research Laboratory in Japan under a joint research project funded by the National Science Foundation. Temperature was measured in a rotating silicon melt using two stationary thermocouples at fixed radii but different angular and vertical positions. The crucible radius was 35 mm and the crystal radius was 17. 5 mm. Crystal and crucible co-rotation rates of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 rpm were studied using a Grashof number between 2. 60 E + 7 and 4. 40 E + 7. The length scale used to define the Grashof number was the <b>melt</b> <b>height.</b> Flow visualization data was also collected. Thermal oscillations were detected at each rotation rate. At 6 and 8 rpm, the flow was non-axisymmetric. Also, at these rates, a two-lobed thermal wave pattern was detected in a horizontal plane, and a tilt of this pattern with height was detected. These results were found to be similar to the behavior of rotating annular duct experiments used to simulate atmospheric motions. At 1 and 4 rpm, the frequency of oscillation was found to be a function of the Grashof number. However, at 6 and 8 rpm, the frequency was nearly independent of the Grashof number. ^ In the numerical analysis, the three-dimensional, unsteady equations of conservation for mass, energy, and momentum were discretized using the finite-element code FI-DAPT TM. A Prandtl number of 0. 0189 and a series of Grashof numbers between 9. 3 E + 4 and 5. 8 E + 6 was used.

Further bubble colliding and bursting produce a three-dimensional polymer Ã¢Â€ÂœmicrofoamÃ¢Â€Â structure with interconnected pores. These results can be of interest for some new applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple method to measure {{viscosity}} of thin polymer melt that is confined between a substrate and a permeable plate using a modified Poiseuille equation. When a patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold {{is placed on}} a styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer film spin-coated onto a substrate and heated above the polymer's glass transition temperature, capillarity forces the polymer melt into the void of the channel. To calculate the viscosity of the confined polymer <b>melt,</b> the <b>height</b> of capillary rise was measured {{as a function of}} time for a number of film thicknesses (220, 350, 540, 1000, and 1300 nm) and at two different temperatures (70 and 100 degrees C). It was found that the viscosity increases with decreasing film thickness at 70 degrees C, whereas it decreases with decreasing film thickness at 100 degrees C. This discrepancy might be related to the confinement-induced solid-like behavior of the polymer melt and wall slip at the polymer/solid interface. Furthermore, the viscosity turned out to be nearly equal to the bulk value for relatively large film thickness (> similar to 500 nm) regardless of the temperature, which corresponds to earlier findingsclose 2...|$|R
40|$|On 23 rd December 2012, a warm frontal {{atmospheric}} system caused significant {{freezing rain}} at the Vienna International Airport. Analyses of Austrian C‑band polarimetric weather radar data reveal cloud microphysical insights {{in the internal}} structure of such systems accompanied by the transition from snow toward ice pellets and subsequent freezing rain and warm rain. Polarimetric radar data are exploited using a recently suggested quasi-vertical profiles (QVP) technique. This method allows to analyze {{the evolution of the}} <b>melting</b> layer <b>height</b> and other important microphysical signatures as well as the following precipitation development with high temporal and vertical resolution. Because the QVP polarimetric radar data are represented in a height vs time format which is fully compatible with the format the data from vertically pointing remote sensors such as cloud radars or wind profilers are displayed, their combined use is very efficient for understanding and monitoring microphysical processes leading to precipitation formation. This is demonstrated by the joint analysis of the polarimetric and profiler data at the Vienna airport. The QVP methodology is particularly effective for monitoring weather in the terminal areas of airports because of its local coverage and high precision as well as its potential for nowcasting. The methodology is very easy to implement and its use along with traditional techniques for weather radar data analysis using PPIs and reconstructed RHIs looks very promising...|$|R

A tender haze hung upon the landscape and subdued it till the scene was as a dream before them. As in a dream the river lay, and dream-like the shipping moved or rested on its deep, broad bosom. Far off stretched the happy fields with their dim white villages; farther still the mellow <b>heights</b> <b>melted</b> into the low hovering heaven. The tinned roofs of the Lower Town twinkled in the morning sun; around them on every hand, on that Monday forenoon when the States were stirring from ocean to ocean in feverish industry, drowsed the gray city within her walls; from the flag-staff of the citadel hung the red banner of Saint George in sleep.|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study: Evaluation of {{copy number}} {{variation}} (CNV) in BRCA 1 / 2 genes, due to large genomic rearrangements (LGRs), is a mandatory analysis in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers families, if no pathogenic variants are found by sequencing. LGRs cannot be detected by conventional methods and several alternative {{methods have been}} developed. Since these approaches are expensive and time consuming, identification of alternative screening methods for LGRs detection is {{needed in order to}} reduce and optimize the diagnostic procedure. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a Competitive PCR-High Resolution Melting Analysis (C-PCR-HRMA) as molecular tool to detect recurrent BRCA 1 LGRs. Material and methods: C-PCR-HRMA was performed on exons 3, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the BRCAI gene; exons 4, 6 and 7 of the ALB gene were used as reference fragments. Results: This study showed that it is possible to identify recurrent BRCA 1 LGRs, by <b>melting</b> peak <b>height</b> ratio between target (BRCA 1) and reference (ALB) fragments. Furthermore, we underline that a peculiar amplicon-melting profile is associated to a specific BRCAI LGR. All C-PCR-HRMA results were confirmed by Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Conclusions: C-PCR-HRMA has proved to be an innovative, efficient and fast method for BRCA 1 LGRs detection. Given the sensitivity, specificity and ease of use, c-PCR-HRMA can be considered an attractive and powerful alternative to other methods for BRCA 1 CNVs screening, improving molecular strategies for BRCA testing in the context of Massive Parallel Sequencing...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} laser {{cladding}} consists of depositing successive layers of molten metallic powder {{to create a}} near-net shape. A high-power laser is used to melt incoming metallic powder, which forms a melt pool on the surface. As the latter moves beneath the laser, this newly created melt pool solidifies. By properly controlling the trajectory of deposition tracks, one can create a diverse range of shapes with varying complexities. However, the process is very sensitive to parameters, requiring constant attention from technicians. This lends itself perfectly to the addition of automatic controllers whereby supervision is minimal. In this thesis, an optical sensor is developed to monitor the process zone. The sensor will output a measurement of the height of solidified clad, which in turn {{can be used by}} a controller to adjust this geometrical feature. The thesis is divided into three main parts, each contributing to the final algorithm. First, in Chapter 3 an analysis is performed on the light irradiating from the interaction zone (or melt pool). It is stated that the dominating source of light is governed by blackbody radiation from this molten metal. This is confirmed by analyzing a series of images captured through a digital camera, where various narrow bandpass filters were utilized to selectively view a portion of the CCD-sensor's spectrum. This investigation also leads to the selection of bandpass filter such that a stable, relatively intense melt pool is captured through the digital camera's CCD-sensor. Second, in Chapter 4 the captured images are taken through a pair of image processing techniques, outputting a series of coordinates representating the melt pool's boundary. The image is first analyzed to calculate an optimal threshold level based on the minimization of fuzzy entropy. With this threshold selected, the grayscale image is converted into black-and-white, where the white pixels represent the melt pool. After this step, the melt pool's boundary is extracted through an 8 -connectivity border tracing algorithm. This technique outputs a series of coordinates (in pixels) as though one were traveling along the melt pool in a clockwise rotation. Last, Chapter 5 analyzes these pixel coordinates to extract the <b>melt</b> pool's <b>height.</b> The coordinates are first transformed into real-world coordinates, by use of a perspective transformation. This transformation essentially yields the melt pool's shadow, as created by a light-source coincident with the camera. As a result, the <b>melt</b> pool's <b>height</b> is estimated based upon a right-angle triangle, where the camera's angle is known, and the projected coordinates represent the shadow length (triangle's base). The result of applying this series of steps to the estimation of clad heights is found at the end of Chapter 5. Results varied dramatically, from 4 % error to 393 %. Although the errors are large at times, they are mainly caused by a bias in the estimate. That is, the dynamics of the true clad formation are very well predicted by the algorithm, however, shifting by a certain amount. This amount varies both with substrate velocity, and the clad's direction of travel, relative to the camera. A partial explanation is given such that the clad's height is offset from the laser center-point, which is a function of both these parameters. However, the specific relationship requires further experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{developed}} algorithms {{have shown}} the potential recovery of rainfall information from spaceborne dual-frequency altimeters. Given the long mission achieved with TOPEX {{and the prospect of}} several other dual-frequency altimeters, we need to validate the altimetrically derived values so as to foster their integration with rain information from different sensors. Comparison with some alternative climatologies shows the bimonthly means for TOPEX to be low. Rather than apply a bulk correction we investigate individual rain events to understand the cause of TOPEX's underestimation. In this paper we compare TOPEX with near-simultaneous ground-based rain radars based at a number of locations, examining both the detection of rain and the quantitative values inferred. The altimeter-only algorithm is found to flag false rain events in very low wind states ( 20 m s- 1), where the empirical dual-frequency relationship is less well defined. In the intermediate range of wind speeds, the TOPEX detections are usually good, with the instrument picking up small-scale variations that cannot be recovered from infrared or passive microwave techniques. The magnitude of TOPEX's rain retrievals can differ by a factor of 2 from the ground-based radar, but this may reflect the uncertainties in the validation data. In general, over these individual point comparisons TOPEX values appear to exceed the “ground truth. ” Taking account of all the factors affecting the comparisons, we conclude that the TOPEX climatology could be improved by, in the first instance, incorporating the radiometric test and employing a better estimate of the <b>melting</b> layer <b>height.</b> Appropriate corrections for nonuniform beam filling and drizzle fraction are harder to define globally...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{is to use the}} {{information}} about distributions of precipitation to determine the four dimensional (i. e., temporal and spatial) patterns of latent heating over the whole tropical region. The Spectral Latent Heating (SLH) algorithm has been developed to estimate latent heating profiles for the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) with a cloud- resolving model (CRM). The method uses CRM- generated heating profile look-up tables for the three rain types; convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level). For convective and shallow stratiform regions, the look-up table refers to the precipitation top height (PTH). For anvil region, on the other hand, the look- up table refers to the precipitation rate at the melting level instead of PTH. For global applications, it is necessary to examine the universality of the look-up table. In this paper, we compare the look-up tables produced from the numerical simulations of cloud ensembles forced with the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Response Experiment (COARE) data and the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) data. There are some notable differences between the TOGA-COARE table and the GATE table, especially for the convective heating. First, there is larger number of deepest convective profiles in the TOGA-COARE table than in the GATE table, mainly due to the differences in SST. Second, shallow convective heating is stronger in the TOGA COARE table than in the GATE table. This might be attributable to the difference in the strength of the low-level inversions. Third, altitudes of convective heating maxima are larger in the TOGA COARE table than in the GATE table. Levels of convective heating maxima are located just below the melting level, because warm-rain processes are prevalent in tropical oceanic convective systems. Differences in levels of convective heating maxima probably reflect differences in <b>melting</b> layer <b>heights.</b> We are now extending our study to simulations of other field experiments (e. g. SCSMEX and ARM) in order to examine the universality of the look-up table. The impact of look-up tables on the retrieved latent heating profiles will also be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Derived from laser cladding, the Direct Laser Metal Deposition (DLMD) {{process is}} based upon a laser beam – powder – melt pool interaction, and enables the {{manufacturing}} of complex 3 D shapes much faster than conventional processes. However, the surface finish remains critical, and DLMD parts usually necessitate post-machining steps. Within this context, {{the focus of our}} work is to improve the understanding of the phenomena responsible for deleterious surface finish by using numerical simulation. Mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations are solved using COMSOL Multiphysics ® in a 2 D transient model including filler material with surface tension and thermocapillary effects at the free surface. The dynamic shape of the molten zone is explicitly described by a moving mesh based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method (ALE). This model is used to analyze the influence of the process parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, and powder feed rate, on the melt pool behavior. The simulations of a single layer and multilayer claddings are presented. The numericalresults are compared with experimental data, in terms of layer <b>height,</b> <b>melt</b> pool length, and depth of penetration, obtained from high speed camera. The experiments are carried out on a widely-used aeronautical alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) using a Nd:YAG laser. The results show that the dilution ratio increases with increasing the laser power and the scanning velocity, or with decreasing the powder feed rate. The final surface finish is then improved...|$|R
