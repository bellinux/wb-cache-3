40|$|The {{advent of}} serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a {{biomarker}} has enabled {{early detection of}} prostate cancer and, hence, improved clinical outcome. However, a low PSA is not a guarantee of disease-free status, and an elevated PSA is frequently associated with a negative biopsy. Therefore, {{our goal is to}} identify molecular markers that can detect prostate cancer with greater specificity in body fluids such as urine or blood. We used the RT-PCR differential display method to first identify <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> differentially expressed in tumor vs. patient-matched nontumor prostate tissue. This analysis led to the identification of 44 <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> that were expressed differentially in some but not all tumor specimens examined. To identify <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> that are differentially expressed in most tumor specimens, we turned to differential display of pooled tissue samples, a technique we name averaged differential expression (ADE). We performed differential display of mRNA from patient-matched nontumor vs. tumor tissue, each pooled from 10 patients with various Gleason scores. Differentially expressed <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> identified by ADE were fewer in number, but were expressed in a greater percentage of tumors (> 75 %) than those identified by differential display of mRNA from individual patient samples. Differential expression of these <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> was also detected by RT-PCR in mRNA isolated from urine and blood samples of prostate cancer patients. Our findings demonstrate the principle that specific cDNA probes of frequently differentially expressed <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> identified by ADE can be used for the detection of prostate cancer in urine and blood samples...|$|R
40|$|Populations of {{alveolar}} macrophages {{recovered from}} the lower respiratory tract secrete fibronectin, a multi-functional glycoprotein capable of influencing cell migration, attachment, differentiation, and proliferation. Using in situ hybridization of 35 S-labeled antisense and sense RNA fibronectin probes, the present study demonstrates that most, but not all, normal alveolar macrophages contain fibronectin <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts,</b> and that among those macrophages expressing this gene, the relative amount of fibronectin <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> varies from cell to cell. Interestingly, while 66 +/- 3 % of normal alveolar macrophages contain fibronectin <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts,</b> this is increased to 82 +/- 2 % (P less than 0. 01) of alveolar macrophages {{recovered from the}} lungs of individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with exaggerated amounts of fibronectin in the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, of the macrophages expressing the fibronectin gene, those from IPF patients contain more fibronectin <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> than those from normals. Consistent with this observation, evaluation of tissue samples from IPF patients demonstrated that of all cells present, alveolar macrophages showed the greatest numbers of fibronectin <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> per cell. These observations demonstrate {{that there can be}} marked cell-to-cell variation in the expression of the gene for a macrophage product such as fibronectin, suggesting that there are processes that modulate similar cells in the same anatomic compartment to vary their expression of the same gene...|$|R

25|$|The initial {{pool for}} in vitro {{evolution}} {{can be derived}} from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an in vitro selection experiment, which is sometimes also called in vitro reselection. The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through in vitro evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcript</b> of bovine serum albumin was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through deep sequencing analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.|$|E

In 1991, during {{the investigation of the}} expression of early-response genes in fibroblasts transformed with Rous sarcoma virus, a novel <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcript</b> that was similar, but not identical, to the seminal COX enzyme was identified. It was suggested that an isoenzyme of COX had been discovered. Another group discovered a novel cDNA species encoding a protein with similar structure to COX-1 while studying phorbol-ester-induced genes in Swiss 3T3 cells. The same laboratory showed that this gene truly expressed a novel COX enzyme. The two enzymes were renamed COX-1, referring to the original enzyme and COX-2.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally DNA microarrays use {{complementary}} DNA or oligonucleotide probes {{to analyze}} messenger RNA (mRNA) from genes of interest. Extracted total RNA {{serves as a}} template for complementary DNA (cDNA) that is tagged with fluorescent probes before being allowed to hybridize to the microarray for visualization. For proteases, specific probes for protease genes and their inhibitors {{have been developed to}} view expression patterns on the <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcript</b> level. The two platforms currently available for this purpose come from corporate and academic sources. Affymetrix’s Hu/Mu ProtIn Microarray uses 516 and 456 probe sets to evaluate human and murine proteases, inhibitors, and interactors respectively. CLIP-CHIP™, developed by the Overall Lab, is a complete protease and inhibitor DNA microarray for all 1561 human and murine proteases, non-proteolytic homologues, and their inhibitors. Both of these tools allow comparison of expression patterns between normal and diseased samples and tissues. Unfortunately, as transcript levels often fail to reflect protein expression levels, gene microarrays are limited in representing protein in samples. In addition, proteases recruited from remote sources like nearby tissues are ignored by these DNA based arrays, reiterating the need for protein based methods to confirm the presence and activity of functional enzymes when transcriptome analysis is performed.|$|E

Alternative splicing of <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> leads to further diversity of mRNAs and protein isoforms. Here, {{we describe the}} regulation of BDNF <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> in an in vitro model of eyeblink classical conditioning and a unique transcript that forms a functionally distinct truncated BDNF protein isoform. Nine different <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> from the BDNF gene of the pond turtle Trachemys scripta elegans (tBDNF) are selectively regulated during classical conditioning: exon I <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> show no change, exon II transcripts are downregulated, while exon III transcripts are upregulated. One unique transcript that codes from exon II, tBDNF 2 a, contains a 40 base pair deletion in the protein coding exon that generates a truncated tBDNF protein.

The copy number of scygonadin <b>mRNA</b> <b>transcripts</b> in the ejaculatory duct of males was greatly higher than those in other tissues, in particular, was over 60, 000 fold that in the hemocytes of females. Using immunohistochemistry, the Scy protein was found at higher levels in male tissues than in female ones, particularly in the reproductive duct of males. It was also interesting to note that Scy gene expression was not significantly induced with lipopolysaccharide challenge. However, it was highly expressed in the ejaculatory duct and the seminal vesicle of pre-copulatory males and in the spermathecae of post-copulatory females under mating conditions. The results suggested that Scy, as {{an important}} antimicrobial component, probably performed more functions in males, and was likely to be involved in a function associated with crab fertilization and reproduction in both males and females during mating.
