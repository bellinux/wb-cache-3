5000|$|Although {{development}} {{had started}} much earlier - the Force 7 coupé {{was announced in}} 1974 but eventually only 10 pre-production coupés survived. By {{the time of the}} factory closure in 1974, one Force 7 was already in England for secret testing, Leyland Australia kept one example and finally donated that coupé to an Australian museum with some other components of the P76 production line and the remaining eight coupés were offered for sale to private buyers in an auction after the factory had closed. The handbooks had even been printed and were offered for <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sale</b> by the auctioneers. There was to have been a base six-cylinder Force 7, a more powerful Force 7V with the V8 unit, and a range-topping Tour de Force. All the surviving cars are the [...] "mid" [...] range Force 7V. It was unusual in that it had full seating for five adults and a large rear hatchback, {{the first of its kind}} produced in Australia. It shared few body panels with the sedan.|$|E

5000|$|Natural {{products}} and <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> were {{the pillars of}} the cosmetics company he founded in 1959. His aim was to democratize the access to beauty products.

Yves Rocher retired from the company in 1992, passing control to his son Didier, but returned to the helm after Didier's death in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Some {{years after}} buying the Martinier-Collin company, Mimard and Blachon {{settled on the}} site in the Cours Fauriel, built by the {{architect}} Lamaizière. The list of their innovations is important: they created a large factory, a centre of technical innovation, a novel system of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> (printing of the Manufrance catalogue reached a million copies), a print centre (Le Chasseur français magazine) and made renowned rifles (Robust, Ideal, Simplex, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The 18th century {{entrepreneur}} Josiah Wedgwood pioneered many of {{the marketing}} strategies used today, including the satisfaction-or-money-back guarantee on {{the entire range of}} his pottery products. He took advantage of his guarantee offer to send his products to rich clientele across Europe unsolicited. The money-back guarantee was also a major tool of early U.S. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> pioneers in the United States such as Richard Sears and Powel Crosley Jr. to win the confidence of consumers.|$|R
40|$|The {{federal income}} tax {{does not apply to}} profits {{generated}} by pure <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> originating from outside the United States, and state and local consumption taxes are effectively inapplicable to pure <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> originating from outside the taxing jurisdiction. These conclusions seem fully applicable to federal taxation of income from sales that are initially solicited through Internet advertising and then transacted over the Internet between a customer in the United States and an out-of-country seller 2 ̆ 7 s out-of-country website. Similar conclusions are also, arguably, applicable in the case of state and local consumption taxes. Extension of the <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> tax exemption to Internet sales has been a cause of concern among taxing officials. Clearly, there are some very large commercial fields that are susceptible to being removed from the taxing jurisdiction of state and federal authorities through the utilization of electronic commerce. If this happens, all levels of government will suffer a significant revenue loss without a proportionate decline in the demand for government services. Solving this problem by government borrowing or by taxing non-electronic commerce more heavily is unattractive. The preferred solution is to find ways to keep Internet commerce in the state consumption tax and {{federal income tax}} bases, and to bring <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> commerce into both tax bases at the same time. The challenges of doing that, however, are truly daunting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{charitable}} organizations, catalogue <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> firms {{offer an}} opportunity to expand both database and revenue. But an offer must be made very carefully since motivation for a donation (altruistic) seems incompatible {{with that of a}} purchase (economic). This research is designed to study the impact of sending a catalogue offer to actual donors on their subsequent donation behavior. An experimental study with a French charitable institution shows that while <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> do indeed erode traditional public canvassing campaigns, this erosion nonetheless remains limited. It also reveals that traditional donors seem to be reluctant to use this commercial approach...|$|R
50|$|In 1906 Spiegel's <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> {{were near}} $1 million. To handle the {{overwhelming}} {{success of the}} <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> operation, a new company — Spiegel, May, Stern, and Company — was formed, allowing the Spiegel House Furnishings Company to devote its limited resources to conventional retailing, rather than assume the debts associated with building up the <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> segment. Arthur was named President of the new company. In 1909 Spiegel introduced the teddy bear to the American consumer, {{for the first time}} nationwide, by offering it in its <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> catalog. The Ideal Toy Company partnered with Spiegel to launch this successful toy venture, and Spiegel continues to give its staff teddy bears to mark the company anniversary every year.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations, the Gun Control Act of 1968 was enacted.

The Act also prohibited sale of firearms to felons, those under indictment, fugitives, illegal aliens, drug users, those dishonorably discharged from the military, and those in mental institutions. The law also restricted importation of so-called Saturday night specials and other types of guns, and limited the sale of automatic weapons and semi-automatic weapon conversion kits.|$|R

A minor recession in 1921–22 caused {{a large number of}} customers to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their typewriters. The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|R

Irish philately was his speciality; the first specialised stamp catalogue, Stamps of Ireland debuted in 1964 and in 1967 he held his first specialised Irish stamp auction, which took place on 10 February in Dublin. When the Handbook of Irish Philately was published in 1968, Feldman presented a copy to the President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera.|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} mass {{production}} methods enabled folding knives with multiple components {{to be produced}} in large numbers at lower cost. By 1890, U.S. knife sales of all types were on the increase, buoyed by catalog <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> as well as mass marketing campaigns utilizing advertisements in periodicals and newspapers. In consequence, knife manufacturers began marketing new and much more affordable automatic knives to the general public. In Europe {{as well as the}} United States, automatic knife sales were never more than a fraction of sales generated by conventional folding knives, yet the type enjoyed consistent if modest sales from year to year.|$|R

The Senate Judiciary Committee similarly brought the bill to a temporary halt, but as in the House, it was passed on reconsideration.

5000|$|Elving {{was also}} noted for his <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> of radios {{modified}} to receive subcarrier signals emanating from FM radio stations. These little-known signals, which require special receiving equipment to hear, often consist of background music for retail establishments, newsfeeds, and reading {{services for the}} blind. Elving advocated these services as superior to newer technology such as HD Radio. In March 1989, Monitoring Times published an article by Elving entitled [...] "SCA: FM Radio's Alter-Ego - The Radio the FCC Doesn't Want You to Own." [...] In 1997 Elving was quoted in a New York Times article discussing Radio Data System (RDS) signals, which ride on FM subcarriers and were thought for a time to be the future of radio.|$|R

Doyle released the EP independently from his website, mailing each CD out by hand. An underground US following developed quickly, and respected zines such as Absolute Punk [...] "a stellar debut, 8/10" [...] and Sound The Sirens [...] "a therapeutic must-have" [...] gave high ratings. Using only MySpace and physical CD <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>sales</b> (no touring, no digital sales, no radio) Doyle slowly but surely sold {{out of the first}} run of the EP, with help from a remnant of Dum Dums fans and a growing contingent newly discovered fans from the US.|$|R
