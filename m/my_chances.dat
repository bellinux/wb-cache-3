5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil <b>my</b> <b>chances</b> on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
2500|$|Chambers {{dreamed of}} having a career in {{mainstream}} films and believed her celebrity as the star of Behind the Green Door and the Ivory Snow girl would be a stepping stone to other endeavors. [...] "The paradox was that, {{as a result of}} Green Door, Hollywood blackballed me," [...] she said later. [...] " [...] became a very high-grossing film...But, to a lot of people, it was still a dirty movie; for me to do anything else, as an actress, was totally out of the question.
