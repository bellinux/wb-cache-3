25|$|Jääkarhu {{was also}} the most {{powerful}} steam-powered icebreaker ever commissioned in Finland. Her three triple-expansion steam engines, two with a <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of 2,500 ihp driving four-bladed nickel steel propellers weighing about 11 tons each in the stern at 120 rpm, and one turning a third propeller {{of the same size}} in the bow at 130 rpm with a <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of 2,600 ihp. However, for short periods of time during icebreaking operations, the combined output of the engines could reach 9,200 ihp. Unlike the previous coal-burning icebreakers, Jääkarhu had eight oil-fired boilers with mechanical ventilation that consumed 2.5 to 4.5 tons of fuel oil per hour. Although she was the most expensive to operate, and for that reason she was always the last one to enter service and first one to sail back to her summer moorings, her endurance and range were considerably better than those of the older icebreakers since she could hold nearly 1,000 tons of fuel and required refueling only two or three times during normal winters.|$|E
25|$|Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg have a {{diesel-electric}} powertrain {{with two}} six-cylinder Wärtsilä 6L26 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines, {{each with a}} <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of , driving van Kaick DGS generators rated 2,250 kVA at 690 V. According to the power plant principle, the main generators in the forward engine room provide electrical power for all shipboard consumers, including propulsion. For emergency and harbour use the ships also have Valmet 612 diesel engines, rated at , coupled to 163 kVA alternators. The vessels are propelled by two ABB Azipod VI1100A electric azimuth thrusters rated at 1,620kW each. Arcticaborg and her sister ship {{were among the first}} icebreakers fitted with Azipod units that allow the ships to operate astern in heavy ice conditions with excellent maneuverability. In addition the ships have one 150kW bow thruster for harbour operations.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most modern}} bulk carriers, Valemax vessels are {{powered by a}} single {{two-stroke}} low-speed crosshead diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. The ships built by DSME and STX in South Korea are powered by 7-cylinder MAN B 7S80ME-C8 and 7S80ME-C engines, respectively, and the ships built by RSHI and Bohai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry have Wärtsilä 7RT-flex82T and 7RT-flex84T engines, respectively. Both MAN and Wärtsilä engines will have a <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of around [...] when turning the [...] propeller at 76–78 rpm, giving the ships a service speed of around [...] while burning almost 100 tons of heavy fuel oil per day. However, due to the large size of the vessels the emissions per cargo ton-mile are very low and thus the Valemax vessels are in fact among the most efficient long-distance dry bulk carriers in service — Vale has reported a 35% drop in emissions per ton of cargo carried in comparison to older ships. In the second series, the main engine has been changed to more efficient MAN B 7G80ME-C9 engine producing about [...] at 72 rpm.|$|E

40|$|The lithium-SO 2 cell shows good {{performance}} {{over a wide}} range of temperatures and a good shelf life. In addi-tion, it has the highest power density of all commercially available cells (1). For example, a C-size cell is capable of continuously delivering 1. 5 A at room temperature (2). However, because of hazard limitations, its recommended <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rate</b> is only 0. 36 A (2). Recently, both the safety and rate capability of the Li-SO 2 system were improved (3 - 5), and the recommended <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rate</b> was doubled. All of this was accom-plished by, among other things, the use of balanced Li-to-SO 2 ratio and greater electrode area. The main hazard factors in high rate lithium cells are the deposition of very reactive high surface area lithium during reversal and charging abuses (6 - 8) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of electrically assisted bicycles {{gives rise to}} the need of the evaluation of the performance and efficiency of the electric drive that supply it. In this paper, is presented a test bench for the estimation of the electric drive output torque under several speed and load conditions. Moreover, the test bench detects the electrical and mechanical parameters that allow to evaluate the electrical drive efficiencies. The test bench has been designed in agreement with the Directive 2002 / 24 /EC of the European Parliament since it detects the <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>rated</b> power (that must be lower than 0. 25 kW) and evaluates if the output is progressively reduced and finally cut off as the vehicle reaches a speed of 25 km/h, or sooner, if the cyclist stops pedaling. The test bench has been conceived also with the aim of releasing type-approval certification. With the test bench, an electric rickshaw prototype available in the University of Palermo SDES Laboratory has been tested. Test results are here presented and discussed. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
