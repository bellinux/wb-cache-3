5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} <b>Miller</b> <b>indices</b> (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three <b>Miller</b> <b>indices</b> (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the <b>Miller</b> <b>indices</b> which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E

40|$|The {{current work}} {{is aimed at}} {{analyzing}} the effects of crystallographic texture, both macro and micro-texture, on whisker growth. The macro-texture of the Sn coatings deposited on brass substrate was systematically studied by varying the process parameters used for electro-deposition. The combination of process parameters, such as deposition temperature and current density, and the resulting macro-texture most prone to whisker growth were identified by monitoring the whisker growth in Sn coatings. The electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) technique was then used to identify the grains where whiskers actually grow. Both macro-and micro-texture of Sn coatings revealed that coatings with pre-dominant low <b>Miller</b> <b>index</b> grain orientations, such as (100), were highly susceptible for whisker growth. Whisker propensity decreased as the texture transitioned from low to high <b>Miller</b> <b>index</b> grain orientation. The micro-texture mapping of the Sn coatings using EBSD technique confirmed that whisker grows from low <b>Miller</b> <b>index</b> grains with (100) or near (100) orientations, surrounded by grains of similar orientation followed by grains with high index plane grains, such as (211), (210) or (321).
