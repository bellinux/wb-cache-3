We tested the validity of a new assessment tool, the Multicultural Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ), using an undergraduate sample (N � 164), and examined the relation of multicultural experience to moral judgment, closedmindedness, growth, and fixed <b>mindsets.</b> We expected that greater multicultural experience would be related to lower levels of closed-mindedness and higher levels of moral judgment and growth <b>mindsets.</b> Higher MEQ scores were correlated with decreased closed-mindedness and higher moral judgment scores. In regression analyses, controlling for age and sex, higher MEQ scores positively predicted participant scores on postconventional moral judgment and growth <b>mindsets,</b> but negatively predicted use of less developed moral judgment and fixed <b>mindsets.</b> Overall, these results support the validity of the MEQ and suggest that multicultural experiences are positively linked to measures of moral judgment and growth <b>mindsets...</b>|$|R

Despite an expanding body of research, the existence of differences in the <b>mindsets</b> associated with commitment profiles has only ever been inferred. Two mixed method studies investigated the proposition that commitment profiles generate qualitative different <b>mindsets</b> which impact employees’ behaviour.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an interpretive mixed-methods {{approach}} research {{conducted in the}} Australian services sector. Deriving from two different yet related literatures on aesthetics and spirituality, this thesis focuses on the examination of ethical <b>mindsets.</b> Data was collected through an online survey of 223 respondents and focus groups interviews with 20 participants. Analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data suggests the presence of aesthetic spirituality and religious spirituality, along with optimism, harmony and balance, contentment, personal truth, making a difference, and interconnectedness as ethical <b>mindsets</b> components. Although this research does not support universal conclusions, the relationship between ethics, spirituality, and aesthetics identified in the Australian services sector might be replicated elsewhere. In the field of business ethics, this thesis comes in response to diverse calls by several scholars from different disciplines such as Lane & Klenke (2004) Ashar and Lane-Maher (2004), and Ghoshal (2005) amongst others. More recently with the market meltdown and its global ramifications, there has emerged an increasing chorus of calls for a re-examination of ethics guiding individuals. These individuals, continue to struggle with emerging issues such as: uncertainty, risk, ambiguity and suffering and, in severe cases, these individuals might feel alienated in this society as argued by Arisian (1993). Such developments in this post-ideological period and post-modern society seem to threaten {{the very fabric of}} the society, by allowing individuals to stand alone, and to introduce change to or even reject the values that have hitherto defined the character of Western society. This trend, if left unchecked, might lead to grievous consequences for the society as a whole. With special attention to Weick’s (1999) recommendation to abandon the heavy tool of paradigms and monologues; this study intends to examine the <b>mindsets</b> of individuals. It is argued that research in ethics, and specifically business ethics, is gaining momentum. This interest is coupled with an interest in spirituality, especially with the increasing number of conferences and articles that discuss this and related concepts. Practitioners, academics, heads of state, and heads of international organizations have increased calls to examine the ethics in an attempt to find solutions to the transgressions, which have led to the crisis that has befallen global markets. Therefore, the urgent need to go beyond the traditional theories and models in relation to business ethics has been recognised in this thesis. It became apparent, through the extensive literature review, that there is an area {{that has yet to be}} explored in the field of management. This area is ethical <b>mindsets,</b> to ascertain whether aesthetics and spirituality are components of ethical <b>mindsets,</b> and whether these two components are inter-related. This thesis examines the under-researched, under-theorized area of ethical <b>mindsets,</b> with the aim of investigating the existence of ethical <b>mindsets</b> in the Australian services sector. The research draws mainly on two separate but allied business ethics literatures relating to spirituality and aesthetics, two issues that were probed using the theoretical lens of <b>mindsets.</b> In order to achieve the aims and objectives of this thesis, an interpretive mixed-methods approach was considered the most appropriate. This thesis contributes to the contemporary debate on business ethics, moving behind the progressively more modernized investigative languages that prevail and beyond the traditional. This thesis goes past and well beyond the obvious, in an attempt to close the gap identified in the literature of management research. This gap is perceived as being the lack of practical evidence supporting the examination of concepts such as spirituality, aesthetics, ethics and ethical <b>mindsets</b> combined in an Australian business context. Spirituality draws attention to individuals’ conscientiousness in inventing ethical workplaces, whilst aesthetics focuses the conversation and discernment on ethical behaviour in business. <b>Mindsets</b> provide a key perspective that combines spirituality and aesthetics into a single analytical framework. With the lack of appropriate tool to measure the three concepts combined, and through a rigorous process of a three-stage pilot study, a new tool was designed to achieve this thesis aims. The aims are (1) assess the existence and dimensions of ethical <b>mindsets</b> of individuals working in the Australian services sector, (2) explore the components of ethical <b>mindsets,</b> and examine the relationship, between ethical <b>mindsets,</b> spirituality and aesthetics, and (3) contribute to the wider debate on ethical issues, specifically with regards to ethical <b>mindsets,</b> spirituality and aesthetics. In order to achieve these aims and objectives, research questions examined are: (1) Do ethical <b>mindsets</b> exist in the Australian services sector? If so, what is the nature or dimensionalities of ethical <b>mindsets</b> in the Australian Services Sector?, (2) To what extent are spirituality and aesthetics key components of ethical <b>mindsets?</b> Moreover, how do spirituality and aesthetics affect ethical <b>mindsets?,</b> and, (3) How are spirituality and aesthetics related to each other within ethical mindsets?Based on the evaluation of empirical and theoretical studies to date, this thesis provides answers to the research questions in relation to ethical <b>mindsets,</b> with a special interest in aesthetics and spirituality and their influence on individuals’ ethical <b>mindsets.</b> The empirical evidence presented in this thesis assesses and acknowledges the existence of ethical <b>mindsets</b> in the Australian services sector. The findings from the online survey, which were further explored and triangulated by the data gathered through focus groups interviews, provide an exploration and identification of eight major components of these <b>mindsets</b> (i. e. aesthetic spirituality, religious spirituality, optimism, harmony and balance, personal truth, contentment, making a difference and interconnectedness). These eight components recording high alphas, those range between 0. 931 and 0. 720, with their thirty-four dimensions recording high factor loading (high of 0. 913 and low of 0. 445). The discussions throughout this thesis document highlight the strength of the relationship between ethical <b>mindsets,</b> spirituality and aesthetics, allowing the contribution to the wider debate on ethical issues, specifically regarding ethical <b>mindsets,</b> spirituality and aesthetics. The statistical power of the intervening variables might be limited by the sample size of 223 respondents; however, an analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data has revealed both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors pertain to individuals (e. g., age, gender, motivations, beliefs, values etc) and extrinsic factors pertain to the broader environment (e. g., organizational culture, organizational leadership, national culture, social norms etc). Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (i. e. agency vs. structure) were identified as possibly having an influence on individuals’ ethical <b>mindsets.</b> In addition, a by-product of this thesis is the suggested newly developed research tool that can be used for the examination of ethical <b>mindsets.</b> The findings of this thesis of the eight ethical <b>mindsets</b> components, and the suggested survey tool, the methodology employed, has their theoretical, practical and methodological implications on business ethics research that are of importance to both academics and practitioners. These findings are likely to assist individuals, and in turn businesses in Australia, to tackle the deterioration of ethics in business-related matters, and most importantly, the researcher’s belief that the findings and the outcome of this thesis have opened a completely new field of research developing a path for future research in this area...|$|R
