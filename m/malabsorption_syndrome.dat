40|$|The {{carotenoids}} lutein and zeaxanthin {{are believed}} to protect the human macula by absorbing blue light and quenching free radicals. Intestinal <b>malabsorption</b> <b>syndromes</b> such as celiac and Crohn’s disease are known to cause deficiencies of lipid-soluble nutrients. We hypothesized that subjects with nutrient <b>malabsorption</b> <b>syndromes</b> will demonstrate lower carotenoid levels in the macula and blood, and that these lower levels may correlate with early-onset maculopathy. Resonance Raman spectrographic (RRS) measurements of macular carotenoid levels were collected from subjects with and without a history of <b>malabsorption</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Carotenoids were extracted from serum and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Subjects with malabsorption (n[*]=[*] 22) had 37 % lower levels of macular carotenoids on average versus controls (n[*]=[*] 25, P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

Increased CVP can be caused by pericarditis or right-sided heart failure. Inflammatory bowel disease can also lead to inflammation of the lymphatics and lymphangiectasia through migration of inflammatory cells through the lymphatics.|$|E

5000|$|Phlorizin is a nonselective {{inhibitor}} {{with poor}} oral bioavailability {{so it is}} unsuitable as a drug for treatment of diabetes, therefore phlorizin derivative was synthesised and called T-1095. T-1095 is a methyl carbonate prodrug that is absorbed into the circulation when given orally and is rapidly converted to the active metabolite, T-1095A, in the liver. By inhibiting SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, urinary glucose excretion increased in diabetic animals. T-1095 did not proceed in clinical development, probably because of the inhibition of SGLT-1 [...] but non-selective SGLT inhibitors may also block glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1). About 90% of filtered glucose is reabsorbed through SGLT-2 so research has focused specifically on SGLT-2. Inhibition of SGLT-1 may also lead to the genetic disease called Glucose Galactose <b>Malabsorption</b> <b>syndrome,</b> characterized by a severe diarrhea.|$|E
5000|$|... α Heavy chain disease (also termed immunoproliferative small {{intestinal}} {{disease or}} IPSID, Mediterranean lymphoma, and Seligmann disease) afflicts primarily individuals of Mediterranean, North African, and Middle Eastern descent of lower economic status. Many cases are {{centered in the}} Middle East and associated with relatively unsanitary living conditions. The disease usually appears between the ages 10 and 30 {{and in some cases}} may be an aberrant immune response to a parasite or other microorganism. The disease commonly effects the gastrointestinal tract leading to signs and symptoms of a <b>malabsorption</b> <b>syndrome</b> or, far less commonly, the respiratory tract with signs and symptoms of respiratory dysfunction. Involved tissues usually include mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and evidence a histology of lymphoplasmacytoid infiltrates accompanied by large numbers of plasma cells and small lymphocytes. The plasma cells therein express the monoclonal α chain and therefore are clonal in nature and the sole or contributing producer of the α chain myeloma protein. Some 57% to 66% of patients present with disseminated lymphoma, 17% to 36% of patients present with a localized lymphoma, and 9% to 17% of patients lack any evidence of a lymphoplasmacytic neoplasm. A majority of the latter patients have an autoimmune disease or a chronic infection which may be responsible for, or contribute to, production of the α heavy chain. Studies indicated that a sub-set particularly of the digestive form of heavy chain disease is caused by infection. This is based on findings that the majority of α heavy chain disease patients are in the lower economic class living under unsanitary conditions, that gastrointestinal bacterial and parasitic infections have been documented in many of these patients, and that long-term (>6 months) appropriately selected antibiotic therapy has improved the condition in 33% to 71% of patients who are at an early stage of the disease and documented to be infected. However, these patients frequently relapse. Patients resistant to antibiotic trials have been treated with multiple drug chemotherapy to obtain complete remission rates of 64% and an overall 5 year survival of 67%.|$|E

40|$|I HAVE BEEN {{interested}} in the <b>malabsorption</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{for a long time}} and one of the fascinations of a continued interest over the years is to watch the emphasis change as new knowledge is added and old problems are solved. When I reviewed the subject in 1960 the classical idea that all the signs and symptoms of the <b>malabsorption</b> <b>syndromes</b> were due to failure of absorption of essential substances still held the field, but even then this was difficult to sustain. It was held, for example, that the dermatitis, glossitis and cheilosis that occurred in some patients, were due to faulty absorption of B vitamins and yet it was known that with one or two notable exceptions the absorptive capacity of the small intestine for the water soluble vitamins was enormous, and that even in the presence of gross steatorrhoea enough could be absorbed to satisfy the body's needs. Gradually, we have had to come to realise that malabsorption is only one facet of the problem, even if it is the easiest to recognise. In the presence of gross disorganisation of the small intestine not only are substances poorly absorbed but the normal losses by secretion and exudation int...|$|R

40|$|Background: The avian reoviruses {{have emerged}} to induce various manifestations in chickens.
