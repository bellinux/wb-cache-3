50|$|The DFL did {{not hold}} an {{endorsing}} convention that was originally scheduled for September 19.

50|$|The Big Sioux River {{rises in}} Roberts County, South Dakota {{on a low}} plateau known as the Coteau des Prairies and flows {{generally}} southwardly through Grant, Codington, Hamlin, Brookings, <b>Moody,</b> and Minnehaha <b>counties,</b> past the communities of Watertown, Castlewood, Bruce, Flandreau, Egan, Trent, Dell Rapids, and Baltic to Sioux Falls, where it passes over a waterfall in Falls Park, which gives that city its name. Downstream of Sioux Falls and the community of Brandon, the Big Sioux is used to define the boundary between South Dakota and Iowa, flowing along the eastern borders of Lincoln and Union counties in South Dakota, and the western borders of Lyon, Sioux and Plymouth counties in Iowa, past the communities of Canton, Fairview, Hudson, Hawarden, North Sioux City, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota and Beloit, Hawarden and Akron in Iowa.

5000|$|In {{reaction}} to the second straight year of double digit property tax increases, Kaplowitz stated that {{as head of the}} budget committee [...] "the spending hike reflected increases in state mandates such as higher Medicaid and pension fund costs. To cover other potential expenses, county lawmakers created an $11.8 million contingency fund. The fund could help pay for bus service should Albany fall to come through with extra aid, as well as help ball out the cash-strapped Westchester Medical Center and fund future raises for unionized employees." [...] By setting money aside, lawmakers hoped to reassure credit agencies after <b>Moody's</b> placed the <b>county's</b> tripe-A bond rating on 90-day ‘watch fist’ review, citing the county's liability for part of the medical center's debt. Kaplowitz said county officials enacted the second double-digit property tax hike of 14.8 percent in 2003 because the package of sales tax increases negotiated with state lawmakers would generate $50 million this year, leaving Westchester with a $22 million gap to fill, reflecting the contingency fund and a $10 million write-down of money owed to Westchester by the medical center for which the county will not be repaid. Kaplowitz stated that [...] "Companies have bad years, and governments unfortunately have bad years. Hopeful, this is the end to two bad years in a row".|$|R
