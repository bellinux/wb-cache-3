The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, {{as well as on}} firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as <b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>MAC)</b> addresses.

50|$|RPR {{works on}} a concept of dual counter {{rotating}} rings called ringlets. These ringlets are set up by creating RPR stations at nodes where traffic is supposed to drop, per flow (a flow is the ingress and egress of data traffic). RPR uses <b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> protocol (<b>MAC)</b> messages to direct the traffic, which can use either ringlet of the ring. The nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms, avoiding congestion and failed spans. The avoidance of failed spans is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as steering and wrapping. Under steering, if a node or span is broken, all nodes are notified of a topology change and they reroute their traffic. In wrapping, the traffic is looped back at the last node prior to the break and routed to the destination station.|$|R

40|$|Clock {{synchronization}} in {{a wireless}} sensor network (WSN) is quite essential as it provides a consistent and a coherent time frame for all the nodes across the network. Typically, clock synchronization is achieved by message passing using a contention-based scheme for <b>media</b> <b>access,</b> like {{carrier sense multiple access}} (CSMA). The nodes try to synchronize with each other, by sending synchronization request messages. If many nodes try to send messages simultaneously, contention-based schemes cannot efficiently avoid collisions. In such a situation, there are chances of collisions, and hence, message losses, which, in turn, affects the convergence of the synchronization algorithms. However, the number of collisions can be reduced with a frame based approach like time division multiple access (TDMA) for message passing. In this paper, we propose a design to utilize TDMA-based <b>media</b> <b>access</b> and <b>control</b> (<b>MAC)</b> protocol for the performance improvement of clock synchronization protocols. The basic idea is to use TDMA-based transmissions when the degree of synchronization improves among the sensor nodes during the execution of the clock synchronization algorithm. The design significantly reduces the collisions among the synchronization protocol messages. We have simulated the proposed protocol in Castalia network simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol significantly reduces the time required for synchronization and also improves the accuracy of the synchronization algorithm...|$|R
