50|$|Poaching {{itself is}} part of a family of <b>moist-heat</b> cooking methods but {{separates}} itself in that it is primarily for delicate foods such as eggs. Simmering generally uses a higher temperature for cooking, and because it surrounds the food in water that maintains a more or less constant temperature, simmering cooks food very evenly. Boiling uses the absolute highest temperature for water and is least likely to be used in cooking delicate foods.|$|E
50|$|Generally game {{is cooked}} {{in the same}} ways as farmed meat. Because some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a common mishap which can be avoided if {{properly}} prepared. It is sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or <b>moist-heat</b> methods {{to make it more}} tender, since some game tends to be tougher than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating as in the dish Hasenpfeffer, cooking in a game pie or as a stew such as Burgoo.|$|E
40|$|I {{have studied}} the {{characteristics}} of toxic compounds from the sterilized medical devices or dental material, which migrated into patient’s body fluid and evaluated if the migrated amount is risky or not. I have studied several sorts of toxic compounds. They are 4, 4 ’-methylenedianiline (MDA), bisphenol A, phthalate esters, methylmethacrylate (MMA), N,N’-dimethyl p-toluidine (DMPT), benzoly peroxide (BPO), 4, 4 ’-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4 -hydroxy 4 ’-chloro diphenyl sulfone and so on. Mostly they are from medical devices and dental materials. Sorts of sterilization are gamma-ray irradiation, <b>moist-heating,</b> ethylene oxide (EOG) exposure. Detection of MDA and bisphenol A was by electro chemical detector (ECD) at 900 mV. BY applying 900 mV, MDA change to diimino compound and bisphenol A changes to keto compound.

50|$|Roasting can {{be applied}} {{to a wide variety of}} meat. In general, it works best for cooking whole chickens, turkey, and leaner cuts of lamb, pork, and beef. The aim is to {{highlight}} the flavor of the meat itself rather than a sauce or stew, as it is done in braising or other <b>moist-heat</b> methods. Many roasts are tied with string prior to roasting, often using the reef knot or the packer's knot. Tying holds them together during roasting, keeping any stuffing inside, and keeps the roast in a round profile, which promotes even cooking.|$|E
5000|$|Poaching {{is a type}} of <b>moist-heat</b> cooking {{technique}} that involves cooking by submerging food in a liquid, such as water, milk, stock or wine. Poaching is differentiated from the other [...] "moist heat" [...] cooking methods, such as simmering and boiling, in that it uses a relatively low temperature (about 160 - 180 F). [...] This temperature range makes it particularly suitable for delicate food, such as eggs, poultry, fish and fruit, which might easily fall apart or dry out using other cooking methods. Poaching is often considered as a healthy method of cooking because it does not use fat to cook or flavor the food.|$|E
50|$|Micro-wave {{and other}} {{irradiation}} sterilization {{has been used}} to sterilize bio-hazard material in large quantities, but all such approaches suffer from major drawbacks as compared to converters. Irradiation plants are large installations that are expensive to build and maintain, and must necessarily be hub locations {{as part of a larger}} supply chain. There is also a health risk and a danger of exposure to radioactive material in installations that use energy sources for generation of gamma rays and other types of radiation. In general, Micro-wave and Irradiation technology was used to treat hazardous pathogenic waste before the widespread adoption of <b>moist-heat</b> sterilization that both autoclaves and converters use. These solutions have been economically forced out of the mainstream use because of their high complexity and operational costs.|$|E
5000|$|A round steak is a beef steak {{from the}} [...] "round", the rear {{leg of the}} cow. The round is divided into cuts {{including}} the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, {{with or without the}} [...] "round" [...] bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow <b>moist-heat</b> methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of autoclaves {{was a big}} step {{in the direction of}} widespread treatment of refuse, and so many functional forms of autoclaves are currently in operation at landfills and treatment centers around the world. Some common features of autoclaves that differentiate them from competing technologies are as follows. Autoclaves employ the <b>moist-heat</b> method to sterilize and deactivate refuse in a large pressure vessel where saturated steam is injected. The end product is completely sanitized and even previously bio-hazardous waste can be discarded in a normal municipal landfill. Autoclaves employ the same method of sterilization as converters, but do so using larger and more complex equipment that also has higher safety and energy consumption requirements. In a majority of cases, autoclaves are hub-and-spoke operations requiring regional treatment centers and a supply chain.|$|E
50|$|Different {{cultures}} and language {{tend to have}} their own unique ways of cooking and each of them has different terminologies which often come from historical necessities. Traditional cooking methods in Malay cuisine are quite similar to life in Malay villages, slow and laidback as most authentic Malay delicacies cooked on low heat for a long time as compared to Chinese food. There are numerous methods of cooking terminologies that are used in Malay cooking that consist of dry and moist methods. Tumis (use a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow pan over relatively high heat), salai (smoked or grilled food on the fire such as dried fish and the ingredients are usually cut into pieces or thinly sliced to facilitate fast cooking), sangai (method of cooking whereby food mainly dries spices are frying without oil), layur (warm over low heat to dry) are examples of terminologies for dry-heat cooking methods. On the other hand, <b>moist-heat</b> cooking method includes terms such as tanak (cooking in a pot especially rice), jerang (boiling or simmering normally used of liquids), celur (blanching or dipping something such as vegetable into the hot water) and reneh (simmering or boiling food).|$|E

Rounds from twenty yield grade 2 and twenty yield grade 3 carcasses were dissected into cutability components of fat, lean, bone, and connective tissue. Subcutaneous fat, M. gluteobiceps, ishiatic head of M. gluteobiceps, and M. semitendinosus differed (P< 0. 05) between yield grades for percentage of initial round weights. M. rectus femoris, M. vastus lateralis, M. semimembranosus, M. adductor, M. gluteobiceps, ishiatic head of M. gluteobiceps, and M. semitendinosus were assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups: control, mechanical blade-tenderization, 2 % injection of the enzyme bromelain, or 10 % injection of salt/phosphate solution. Steaks (2. 54 cm) from each muscle were cooked by dry-heat and <b>moist-heat</b> methods. Warner-Bratzler shear force values differed (P< 0. 05) for M. rectus femoris and M. semimembranosus across treatment groups for both dry-heat and <b>moist-heat</b> cookery methods. These muscles also improved tenderness ranking among individual muscles for both cookery methods. M. semitendinosus displayed significantly lower shear values of <b>moist-heat</b> steaks compared to dry-heat for control and bromelain steaks. Percent moisture for phosphate treated steaks was significantly higher than all other treatments. Purge loss of individual muscles, number of steaks cut per muscle, steak yield, cook loss for both methods, and percent fat displayed no significant differences across treatment groups. These findings suggest individual muscles from the round can improve in tenderness through injection-type strategies.

40|$|In a {{study to}} detoxify Jatropha curcas seed four {{potential}} detoxification methods were tested for their effectiveness. The first method entailed oil expulsion from unshelled Jatropha curcas seed using a Sunhdra industrial oil expeller. The second method involved laboratory-based petroleum-ether solvent extraction of shelled and minced kernels. Thirdly, shelled kernels were subjected to industrial detoxification that involved double solvent extraction with the hexane-ethanol system accompanied by <b>moist-heat</b> treatment at 90 °C for 30 min. The fourth method was {{an extension of the}} third whereby the meal generated was wet extruded (126 °C, 2 atmospheres, 10 min contact time) followed by re-extraction with hexane and moist heat treatment (121 °C for 30 min). The detoxification methods had significant (P< 0. 0001) effect on both the anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) and the proximate composition of the meals. Oil expulsion left the phorbol esters (PEs) of the unshelled seed at 0. 70 mg g 1, laboratory petroleum-ether extraction reduced the PEs content by 67. 69 % from 6. 5 mg g 1 in the raw shelled kernels to 2. 10 mg g 1, double solvent extraction followed by <b>moist-heat</b> treatment reduced PEs by 70. 77 % to 1. 90 mg g 1. Double solvent extraction accompanied with wet extrusion, re-extraction with hexane and <b>moist-heat</b> treatment reduced PEs content to 0. 80 mg g 1, an 87. 69 % decrease. All the methods except laboratory petroleum-ether solvent extraction managed to completely inactivate trypsin inhibitors in the meals. Total phenolics (TPs) content was lowest (P< 0. 0001) in the oil-expulsion produced meal (8. 50 g Kg 1) while the laboratory petroleum-ether produced meal contained 64. 57 g Kg 1 TPs. Oil-expulsion and double solvent extraction accompanied with wet extrusion, re-extraction and <b>moist-heat</b> treatment completely inactivated lectins in the meals. The high chemical nutrient potential of Jatropha curcas seed (crude protein, calcium and phosphorus) is only realised with shelling and extraction of most of the oil. None of the tried methods managed to completely detoxify the Jatropha curcas seed.

40|$|Sorghum-based diets {{have been}} {{associated}} with inconsistent, and even sub-optimal, growth performance of broiler chickens. Sorghum is unique in that it contains kafirin, phytate and may contain condensed tannin; these factors can negatively influence the nutritive properties of sorghum. Both phytate and tannin have the capacity to complex proteins in the gut and depress protein digestibility and intestinal uptakes of dietary and endogenous amino acids (AA). A substantial proportion of sorghum protein is composed of kafirin, which is relatively poorly digested and contains a paucity of lysine (lys). Therefore, as kafirin proportions of sorghum protein increase, digestibility of AA and lys concentrations decline. Because of variable AA concentrations in sorghum protein, the accuracy with which intended dietary levels of AA are met in formulating sorghum-based diets may not be precise. Kafirin is also associated with harder grain textures and higher starch gelatinisation temperatures and the digestibility of starch in sorghum is generally inferior to other grains. The particle size and method of grinding sorghum influences broiler performance but the optimal particle size appears to be dependent on grain texture. Sorghum is vulnerable to 2 ̆ 7 <b>moist-heat</b> 2 ̆ 7 because it induces disulphide cross-linkages in β- and γ-kafirin located in the periphery of protein bodies that represents a barrier to the more digestible, centrally located α-kafirin component. Starch granules are intimately associated with protein bodies and the protein matrix in sorghum endosperm and starch digestibility is also compromised by the formation of disulphide cross-linkages, which impede starch gelatinisation and enzymic degradation. This raises the possibility that steam-pelleting sorghum-based diets at high temperatures may constitute sufficient 2 ̆ 7 <b>moist-heat</b> 2 ̆ 7 to compromise nutrient utilisation. The identification of the most appropriate processing methods of sorghum-based diets should prove advantageous and inclusion of exogenous proteases with the capacity to degrade kafirin may hold promise. In low-tannin, phytase-supplemented, sorghum-based diets the more important causes of inconsistent broiler performance may be the kafirin content, variable concentrations and digestibilities of AA and grain texture coupled with inappropriate processing methods...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-eight {{types of}} lysozyme-sensitive spores among seven Bacillus species {{representative}} of thermophiles, mesophiles, and psychrophiles were obtained spanning a 3, 000 -fold range in <b>moist-heat</b> resistance. The resistance within species was altered by demineralization {{of the native}} spores to protonated spores and remineralization of the protonated spores to calcified spores and by thermal adaptation at maximum, optimum, and minimum sporulation temperatures. Protoplast wet densities, and thereby protoplast water contents, were obtained by buoyant density sedimentation in Nycodenz gradients (Nyegaard and Co., Oslo, Norway). Increases in mineralization and thermal adaptation caused reductions in protoplast water content between limits of ca. 57 and 28 % (wet weight basis), and thereby correlated with increases in sporal heat resistance. Above and below these limits, however, increases in mineralization and thermal adaptation correlated with increases in sporal resistance independently of unchanged protoplast water contents. All three factors evidently contributed to and were necessary for heat resistance of the spores, but dehydration predominated...|$|E
40|$|Foodservice {{managers}} {{strive to}} control {{factors that affect}} yield, serving cost, and palatability of beef. Beef roasts are traditionally roasted at temperatures from 325 °F to 350 °F for both home and institutional use.

The issue of cooking loss led Winston Industries to develop the CVap Cook and Hold Vapor Oven (Winston Industries, Louisville, KY). CVap technology controls evaporation by creating a moist environment, which creates an opposing vapor pressure that minimizes moisture loss and should improve cooking yields. The objectives of our research were to compare the effects of <b>moist-heat</b> cookery in a CVap oven and dry-heat cookery in a Blodgett forced-air convection oven on cooked yield, cooked color, tenderness, and sensory attributes of beef roasts differing in connective tissue content cooked to different endpoint temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Five {{types of}} dormant Bacillus spores, between and within species, were {{selected}} representing a 600 -fold range in <b>moist-heat</b> resistance determined as a D 100 value.

The ratio between the volume occupied by the protoplast (the structures bounded by the inner pericytoplasm membrane) and the volume occupied by the sporoplast (the structures bounded by the outer pericortex membrane) was calculated from measurements made on electron micrographs of medially thin-sectioned spores. Among the various spore types, an exponential increase in the heat resistance correlated directly with the wet density and inversely with the water content and with the protoplast/sporoplast volume ratio.

40|$|Populations of Bacillus subtilis spores {{in which}} 90 to 99. 9 % of the spores {{had been killed}} by moist heat gave only two {{fractions}} on equilibrium density gradient centrifugation: a fraction comprised of less dense spores that had lost their dipicolinic acid (DPA), undergone significant protein denaturation, and were all dead and a fraction with the same higher density as that of unheated spores. The latter fraction from heat-killed spore populations retained all of its DPA, but > 98 % of the spores could be dead. The dead spores that retained DPA germinated relatively normally with nutrient and nonnutrient germinants, but the outgrowth of these germinated spores was significantly compromised, perhaps because they had suffered damage to some proteins such that metabolic activity during outgrowth was greatly decreased. These results indicate that DPA release takes place well after spore killing by moist heat and that DPA release during <b>moist-heat</b> treatment is an all-ornothing phenomenon; these findings also suggest that damage to one or more key spore proteins causes spore killing by moist heat.

Caesin (CAS), Boiled T. conophorum (BTC) and Roasted T. conophorum (RTC) were fed these three (3) groups of rats respectively. All chemicals and statistical analysis were based on modern techniques. In vivo bioassay revealed that growth food and nitrogen intakes and Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) were higher in rats fed the RTC diet than in rats fed the BTC diet. However, rats fed the BTC diet gained more weight than those fed the RTC diet.

40|$|Photometric {{immersion}} refractometry {{was used}} to determine the average apparent refractive index (n) of five types of dormant Bacillus spores representing a 600 -fold range in <b>moist-heat</b> resistance determined as a D 100 value. The n of a spore type increased as the molecular size of various immersion solutes decreased. For comparison of the spore types, the n of the entire spore and of the isolated integument was determined by use of bovine serum albumin, which is excluded from permeating into them. The n of the sporoplast (the structures bounded by the outer pericortex membrane) was determined by use of glucose, which was shown to permeate into the spore only as deeply as the pericortex membrane. Among the various spore types, an exponential increase in the heat resistance correlated with the n of the entire spore and of the sporoplast, but not of the isolated perisporoplast integument. Correlation of the n with the solids content of the entire spore provided a method of experimentally obtaining the refractive index increment (dn/dc), which was constant for the various spore types and enables the calculation of solids and water content from an n. Altogether, the results showed that the total water content is distributed unequally within the dormant spore, with less water in the sporoplast than in the perisporoplast integument, and that the sporoplast becomes more refractile and therefore more dehydrated as the heat resistance becomes greater among the various spore types...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to review studies that {{evaluated}} the effects of cooking techniques on carotenoids and anthocyanins in vegetables and to release a meta-analysis of the findings. A literature search was conducted to identify studies that evaluated the effects of cooking techniques on the levels of carotenoids and anthocyanins in vegetables. the database search found 404 results, and an additional 18 articles from 1992 to 2013 were selected that met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis with a random effect model was conducted using the weighted response ratios (R*) calculated for each experiment. Significant reductions of carotenoid levels after microwaving (R* = 0. 79) and frying (R* = 0. 59) and an increase after stewing (R. * = 1. 33) were reported; for anthocyanins, reduction was observed after <b>moist-heat</b> techniques such as pressure boiling (R* = 0. 11) and pressure steaming (R* = 0. 01), and steaming tended to reduce their concentration (R* = 034; p = 0. 054). Increases of anthocyanin levels were observed in dry-heat cooking techniques such as microwaving (R* = 3. 51) and baking (R* = 2. 95). Cooking techniques influence the levels of natural pigments in vegetables, and depending on the technique, their levels may increase or decrease. Carotenoids were most degraded in frying and most increased during the stewing technique, while anthocyanins were most degraded in pressure steaming and most increased in the microwaving technique.

Drying process can be performed under the sun or in an air circulated oven with temperature not higher than 60 °C. Phenolic content of crude drugs on the other hand is the lowest if it is dried at 60 °C. Drying at 40 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C produce crude drug with higher phenolic content compared to those dried at 60 °C.

40|$|Grain sorghum is an underutilized crop {{despite many}} {{advantages}} to its cultivation. A drought-tolerant plant with many pest-resistant cultivars, its applications {{are limited by}} problems with nutrient availability, particularly protein digestibility. Digestibility of grain sorghum protein is reduced by antinutritional compounds in the grain like tannins and phytates, and by <b>moist-heat</b> cooking. Some of these concerns can be mitigated by how the grain is processed. Fermentation is one processing method that can improve digestibility. Fermentation can also concentrate protein in a substrate. In this experiment, grain sorghum was subjected to different treatments and used as a substrate for yeast fermentation. Two species of yeast were tested; common baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and an amylolytic strain (Lipomyces kononenkoae). Effects of pasteurization or sterilization of the substrate, nitrogen supplementation, amyloglucosidase addition, and co-culture with an amylolytic lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus amylovorous were examined. After 48 hours of incubation, baker’s yeast samples treated with enzyme increased in crude protein, from 9 % in unfermented grain to approximately 27 % after treatment. Nitrogen supplementation accelerates protein enrichment and is a significant factor at 24 hours of fermentation. Pepsin digestibility of fermented samples was improved compared to thermally processed controls. Phytates increased in concentrated high-protein samples, but the ratio of phytate to protein was reduced by both yeasts. Both types of yeast increased pepsin digestibility of sorghum protein compared to thermally processed control samples. L. kononenkoae reduced phytates in the substrate, but did not enrich protein content. The lactic co-culture had no significant effect on measured responses, but decreased incidence of spoilage and contamination of the fermentation samples. A fermentation with baker’s yeast can concentrate sorghum protein in a substrate if the grain starch is hydrolyzed first, and can increase digestibility as well...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{literature on}} the dyeing of textiles, {{there is a lack}} of research about dyeing and colouring Japanese mending papers for paper conservation purposes. In this study, a range of scientific techniques have been applied to improve understanding of the physical, chemical and biological properties of Japanese mending papers after treatment with various dyes and pigments. A variety of toning materials including plant dyes, watercolours, acrylic paints, inks, pastels, gouaches, and colour pencils are commonly used by conservators for paper toning purposes. Plant dyes are often used in artisanal practices including painting, handicrafts, textiles and paper dyeing; however, the chemistry of such colourants and their interaction with Japanese mending papers used in paper conservation has not been studied. The basic premise of this study is that a conservation treatment should not contribute to the physical, chemical or biological degradation of mending papers used for paper conservation purposes and should, ideally, prevent such degradation. In this study, two Japanese tissue papers (Yukyu-shi and Sekishu Mare) were treated with selected plant dyes, watercolours and acrylic paints. Paper specimens were subject to both <b>moist-heat</b> artificial ageing and accelerated photoageing and colour changes were measured using spectrophotometry and microfading tests (MFTs). Physical experiments (folding endurance, tear resistance) and chemical tests (pH) were used to investigate the paper degradation mechanisms to achieve a better understanding of how paper deteriorates as a result of artificial ageing. The results show that, in general, the papers treated with plant dyes are more acidic than those treated with watercolours and acrylic paints. Almost all of the plant dyes tested in this work showed some degree of fading as measured by spectrophotometry, compared to untreated controls and those samples treated with watercolours and acrylic paints. By contrast, synthetic artists’ pigments were relatively stable to colour change. Acrylic paints and watercolours are the most widespread colourants used by paper conservators and their continued use over plant dyes is justified by this study. While their use is undergoing a revival and they are seen to have heritage value as a traditional product, plant dyes may not be suitable for colour-matching the retouched parts of ancient books and documents because of their propensity for colour change over time. Dyed papers also displayed less folding and tear resistance after ageing and there was a difference in these properties between Yukyu-shi and Sekishu papers. The untreated Sekishu papers and the Sekishu papers treated with watercolours and acrylic paints exhibited greater tear resistance than the Yukyu-shi papers. The Sekishu and Yukyu-shi papers in untreated form and when treated with acrylic paints, as well as the Yukyu-shi papers treated with plant dyes, demonstrate effective folding endurance after ageing. A further aim of this thesis was to quantify the growth of Aspegillus niger and Penicillium rubrum fungal species on Japanese tissue papers with the aid of real time polymerase chain reactions (PCR). This technique amplifies deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the target species which is a proxy for species abundance. Universal PCR primers amplified DNA from both A. niger and P. rubrum and these species were found to grow preferentially on Yukyu-shi paper, regardless of the treatment. Sekishu papers treated with most plant dyes and chemical colourants were more resistant to fungal growth than similarly treated Yukyu-shi papers. In summary, this study suggests that for the best long term preservation outcomes for paper materials in archives, libraries, galleries and museums, acrylic artist paints generally perform better in conservation terms than plant dyes and watercolours. This must be balanced against the fact that traditional paper conservation practices may have particular cultural values in some circumstances. Important new insights and opportunities to improve conservation outcomes, and safeguard unique cultural heritage, can be based on the innovative use of an array of scientific techniques that question established cannons...|$|E
