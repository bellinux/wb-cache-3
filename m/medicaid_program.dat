Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>program,</b> MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families to hire more case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E

The state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> were surveyed by mail for this research in mid 1987 to determine if the states covered AZT (Retrovir), if limits apply to this coverage, if the states have or are developing AIDS-related policies, and if hospice care is a benefit. Forty-four states cover AZT (two additional states cover AZT only during inpatient hospital care), with most <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> placing some limit on coverage or reimbursement. Most states do not have special Medicaid coverage for AIDS care nor are they developing proposals or policies for this care.

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for state university faculty to participate as part-time consultants in the administration of state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs.</b> However, rarely do state universities participate institutionally as public agencies in the administration of state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> since the propriety, value and parameters of these engagements are usually not recognized. Even in states where they flourish, collaborations between state universities and state Medicaid agencies are not well understood and suggest to some people an unlikely confluence of two worlds. The missions of state universities and state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> differ, their institutional cultures differ, and their protocols differ. In all states, state universities are considered apart from other state agencies, sometimes to the point of not being thought of as state agencies at all. Yet, the appropriateness and benefits of state universities engaging in Medicaid administration have been well established by state universities and the state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> that have worked together. In light of the challenges facing state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> and what state universities can do for these programs, state universities contributing to Medicaid administration should be more recognized and more common. Explanation and examples follow. Rounding out this discussion will be depictions of collaborations in three states: Maryland, Massachusetts and Ohio. Maryland’s initiative spotlights analytic, program development and program evaluation services; Massachusetts’ features clinical expertise; and, Ohio’s dwells on workforce development. In all three states, the state university partner does far more for Medicaid than is covered here, but these examples suggest the breadth of what state universities can do...|$|R

25|$|Medicaid is {{a program}} that is not solely funded at the federal level. States provide {{up to half of}} the funding for the <b>Medicaid</b> <b>program.</b> In some states, {{counties}} also contribute funds. Unlike the Medicare program, Medicaid is a means-tested, needs-based social welfare or social protection program rather than a social insurance program. Eligibility is determined largely by income. The main criterion for Medicaid eligibility is limited income and financial resources, a criterion which plays no role in determining Medicare coverage. Medicaid covers a wider range of health care services than Medicare.|$|E

40|$|State <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} {{important role in the}} U.

The size and complexity of these programs will only increase with the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Yet, many state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> lack the resources and breadth of expertise to maximize the value of their programs not only for their beneficiaries but also for all those served by the health care system. Universities, especially those with medical schools and other health science programs, can serve as valuable partners in helping state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>programs</b> achieve higher levels of performance, including designing and implementing new approaches for monitoring the effectiveness and outcomes of health services and developing and sharing knowledge about program outcomes. In turn, universities can expand their role in public policy decision making while taking advantage of opportunities for additional research, training, and funding.

25|$|Several {{factors are}} {{associated}} with states' decisions to accept or reject Medicaid expansion {{in accordance with the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Partisan composition of state governments is the most significant factor, with states led primarily by Democrats tending to expand Medicaid and states led primarily by Republicans tending to reject expansion. Other important factors include the generosity of the <b>Medicaid</b> <b>program</b> in a given state prior to 2010, spending on elections by health care providers, and the attitudes people in a given state tend to have about the role of government and the perceived beneficiaries of expansion.|$|E
25|$|According to CMS, the <b>Medicaid</b> <b>program</b> {{provided}} {{health care}} services to more than 46.0 million people in 2001.

From 2000 to 2012, the proportion of hospital stays for children paid by Medicaid increased by 33 percent, and the proportion paid by private insurance decreased by 21 percent. Some 43 million Americans were enrolled in 2004 (19.7 million of them children) at a total cost of $295 billion. In 2008, Medicaid provided health coverage and services to approximately 49 million low-income children, pregnant women, elderly people, and disabled people.

25|$|Medicaid {{is a joint}} {{federal and}} state program that helps with medical costs for about 74 million people (as of 2017) with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers {{benefits}} not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to low-income and disabled people. It is a means-tested program that is jointly funded {{by the state and}} federal governments and managed by the states, with each state currently having broad leeway to determine who is eligible for its implementation of the program. States are not required to participate in the program, although all have since 1982. Medicaid recipients must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and may include low-income adults, their children, and people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid.
