5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the <b>military</b> <b>component</b> of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the <b>military</b> <b>component</b> of the Manhattan Project) {{surveyed}} {{sites around}} Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer {{feared that the}} high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{response}} to the SDI during the period March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of {{their view of the}} program both as a threat and as an opportunity to weaken NATO. SDI was likely seen not only {{as a threat to the}} physical security of the Soviet Union, but also as part of an effort by the United States to seize the strategic initiative in arms controls by neutralizing the <b>military</b> <b>component</b> of Soviet strategy. The Kremlin, however, masked their real concerns, advocating that space-based missile defenses would make nuclear war inevitable.|$|E

25|$|A Polish {{resistance}} movement began organizing {{soon after the}} invasions in 1939. Its largest <b>military</b> <b>component</b> {{was a part of}} the Polish Underground State network of organizations and activities and became known as the Home Army. The whole clandestine structure was formally directed by the Polish government-in-exile through its delegation resident in Poland. There were also peasant, right wing, leftist and Jewish partisan organizations. Among the anti-German uprisings waged were the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw Uprising.

Five days later, the Council adopted Resolution 1704 creating the new United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Australia was allowed to retain command over the joint military task force, although the UN Secretary-General and Security Council will revisit this question by 25 October.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, in {{response}} to the large increase in domestic cocaine production activities and the deterioration of security conditions, the Colombian and US governments announced Plan Colombia, a joint anti-drug strategy. The main aims of the Plan were a 50% reduction in the production and trafficking of illegal drugs within six years and an improvement of security conditions in Colombia. US funding for the <b>military</b> <b>component</b> of Plan Colombia was on average US$540 million per year between 2000 and 2008, while the Colombian government invested approximately US$812 million per year. Following the September 11 attacks, Plan Colombia resources began to be used for anti-guerrilla operations.

25|$|During the Second Empire, {{foreign and}} {{mercenary}} soldiers {{became an important}} part of the Bulgarian army and its tactics. Since the very beginning of the rebellion of Asen and Peter, the light and mobile Cuman cavalry was effectively used against the Byzantines and later the Crusaders. For instance, fourteen thousand of them were used by Kaloyan in the battle of Adrianople. The Cumans were the empire's most effective <b>military</b> <b>component.</b> The Cuman leaders entered the ranks of Bulgarian nobility, and some of them received high military or administrative posts in the state. During the 14th century the Bulgarian army increasingly relied on foreign mercenaries, which included Western knights, Mongols, Ossetians or came from vassal Wallachia. Both Michael III Shishman and Ivan Alexander had a 3,000-strong Mongol cavalry detachment in their armies. In the 1350s, Emperor Ivan Alexander even hired Ottoman bands, as did the Byzantine Emperor. Russians were also hired as mercenaries.|$|E

It was initially envisioned that the <b>military</b> <b>component</b> of UNTAG would only provide communications and logistic support to the election. In September the role was broadened to include hundreds of electoral monitors, and in October (after detailed planning and reconnaissance of all polling stations) the Australian contingent deployed a ready-reaction force. At the same time the 15th Field Troop (under Lieutenant Brent Maddock) was deployed, making the first entry into a live minefield by Australian troops since the Vietnam War.|$|E

The position of marshal (literally [...] "horse servant") was a high one in court circles and the king's marshal (such as the Earl Marshal in England) was also responsible for managing many military matters. [...] Also present within the great households was the constable (or [...] "count of the stable"), who was responsible for protection and the maintenance of order within the household and commanding the <b>military</b> <b>component</b> and, with marshals, might organise hastiludes and other chivalrous events.
