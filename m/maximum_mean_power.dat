The finite element method (FEM) is used to model the piezolaminated unimorph cantilever structure. The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and linear piezoelectric theory are implemented in finite element simulations. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimization approach is carried out to optimize the structural parameters of mechanical energy-based energy harvester for maximum power density and power output. The numerical simulation demonstrates {{the performance}} of lead-free piezoelectric materials in unimorph cantilever-based energy harvester.

30|$|For these {{experiments}} a Nd:YAG-Laser was used.

Because {{of the use}} of pulsed laser radiation with pulse duration of 70  ns, the thermal input is localized directly at the surface. The focusing of the short laser pulses to a footprint of approximately 200  µm in diameter results in very high energy densities, so that the magnesium surface is melted or sublimated within a few microseconds. At the same time, an explosively expanding plasma is generated, which needs the major part of the thermal energy provided by the individual laser pulses. Therefore, only very little heat is transferred into the bulk material [5]. Thus changes in microstructure can be avoided and makes it also possible to process very thin magnesium-substrates and pretreat them for adhesive bonding.|$|R

Well-trained female cyclists (n = 32; mean +/- SD; 24. 3 +/- 4. 1 y; VO 2 peak 57. 1 +/- 4. 9 ml/kg/min) completed two trials (randomized cross-over design) in which they consumed a meal (2 g/kg carbohydrate and 54 kJ/kg) 2 hr before a 90 -min cycle session (80 min at 60 % maximal aerobic power followed by a 10 -min time trial; TT). The dairy meal contained 3 servings of dairy foods providing similar to 1350 mg calcium. Gut comfort and palatability were measured using questionnaires. Performance was measured as <b>maximum</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> during the TT (MMP 10 (min)).

However, the traditional determination of the specific workload at which power production is maximized (i. e., optimum power load) is time-consuming and requires one-repetition maximum tests. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether elite athletes from different sports would produce <b>maximum</b> <b>mean</b> propulsive <b>power</b> values at a narrow range of mean propulsive velocities, resulting in similar jump heights. One hundred and nine elite athletes from several individual/team sport disciplines underwent repetitions at maximal velocity with progressive loads, starting at 40 % of their body mass with increments of 10 % to determine the individual optimum power zone.

Twenty-two male rugby sevens players from the Brazilian National Olympic Team (Rio- 2016) performed vertical jumping tests (squat and countermovement jumps [SJ and CMJ]), JS and HS exercises, COD speed test and sprinting velocity in 40 m, in this order. Based on the results of the MPP in the JS and HS exercises the participants were divided, using the median split, into four groups as follows: higher JS, lower JS, higher HS, and lower HS. Between-group differences in the functional tasks were detected via magnitude-based inferences. The athletes with higher MPP in the JS were capable of jumping higher and sprinting faster (including the COD speed test) than their weaker counterparts. This pattern was not observed in the HS exercise. To conclude, JS was shown to be more connected to sprinting, COD speed and jumping abilities than HS in elite rugby sevens players and should be preferred for assessing and possibly training elite athletes needing to improve speed-power related abilities...|$|R

40|$|While in the past, lasers {{were widely}} used in cutting and welding operations, {{in the recent years}} they have been applied to other {{machining}} like marking, scribing, selective ablations and engraving on metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials. It was possible thanks to the introduction of laser sources characterised by short and ultrashort pulses with pulse duration variable from nanosecond to femtosecond. The main advantages of these lasers are non-contact working, high repeatability, high scanning speed, worked area comparable to the laser spot, high flexibility and high automation. However, using these lasers, the material removal rates are very low if compared to mechanical processes. For these reasons they are suitable for machining metallic materials and heat sensible non metallic materials. Wood engraving and marking by laser resembles face milling to some extent, with beam 'tool' diameter smaller than that of mechanical cutters by more than two orders of magnitude. However, since the surface layers lying below those that are burnt away will remain on the object being processed, care should be exercised to avoid their damage, i. e. overheating, discoloration etc [...] This places a limitation on the temperature field and heating time that are associated with the laser power and beam characteristics, thereby bounding material removal rate and confining the process to shallow and more or less uniform removal depths with low-power lasers. In this light, {{it is no coincidence that}} laser engraving technology is quite widespread in the handicraft industry to mark and engrave wooden decorative items. Moreover, it is important to choose optimised process parameters like wavelength, spot diameter, pulse repetition frequency, scanning speed and beam power according to the material absorption and the required surface quality. Aim of the present research was to study the features and the performance given by a 5 W Q-switched diode pumped Nd:YAG laser at the II harmonic generated wavelength of 532 nm, in the marking and engraving of different wood. This laser was characterised by pulse duration of about 150 ns, pulse repetition frequency up to 50 kHz, a <b>maximum</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> of 5 W and a beam focus diameter of about 80 μm.

The effectiveness of the laser and the quality of the grooves were evaluated by means of an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope while the groove geometries and the surface morphology was estimated by a roughness measuring instrument. Experimental results showed that the laser can be used to machine wood obtaining decorative drawing and three-dimensional engraved geometries lacking in burn...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In sport, the {{distribution}} of work over a defined exercise period {{has been defined as}} a “pacing strategy. ” Both teleoanticipation and feedback mechanisms have been suggested to influence pacing (Abbiss and Laursen, 2008). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of a 3 -wk training camp on the pacing of cyclists that improved overall cycling time trial performance (i. e. responders) in order to gain insight into the role teleoanticipation and feedback mechanisms may play in pacing. Methods Male competitive cyclists (n= 13; 19. 9 ± 1. 3 y, 71. 8 ± 5. 7 kg, maximal aerobic power; 370 ± 36 W) completed structured training for 5 wks. Cyclists trained for 2 - 8 hours daily and the program included cycle ergometer sessions 3 d. wk- 1. Each week participants performed a 10 min cycling Time Trial (TT; Wattbike) at the end an interval session. Power was recorded at 1 Hz and <b>maximum</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (MMP 10 min) was calculated. Responders were defined as cyclists that improved MMP 10 min 5 - 15 % from baseline with baseline tests within 5 %. The Typical Error (TE) was used to estimate reliability. A priori planned contrasts (paired t-tests) were used to compare MMP 10 min performance and pacing during baseline and best performances. Pacing was quantified by dividing the 10 min time trial into 4, 150 s segments. Results The TE for MMP 10 min was 1. 4 %. The best MMP 10 min produced in the camp was 8. 4 ± 2. 9 % (mean± 90 % CI) greater than baseline (362 ± 41 W vs 334 ± 37 W). The perception of effort and post TT heart rate were similar for baseline and best TT performances (~ 98 %max and ~ 180 - 185 bpm). On average, {{the distribution}} of work for each 150 s of the TT 10 min at baseline and best performance was similar (25 %, 25 %, 24 %, 26 %). Following training, the increase in power for each of the four segments (150 s) of the TT was 7 ± 3 %; 7 ± 2 %; 9 ± 2 % and 12 ± 3 %. Discussion Cyclists selected for this analysis produced a large and consistent increase in MMP 10 min (~ 8 %) during a 3 wk training study. The pacing during baseline testing and best 10 min TT were similar. The dramatic increase in cycling power (~ 7 %) during the first 150 s of the 10 min TT, following training supports the concept of teleoanticipation as feedback mechanisms are less likely to be involved. The improvement in power during the final 150 s (~ 12 %) with similar peak heart rates and perception of effort, indicates that peripheral feed-back mechanisms may be involved in training improvements. Our data support the concept that both feed forward and feedback mech-anisms contribute to training induced improvements in time trial performance.

40|$|Purpose: Cold water {{immersion}} (CWI) {{may be beneficial}} for acute recovery from exercise, but it may impair long-term performance by attenuating the stimuli responsible for adaptation to training. We compared effects of CWI and passive rest on cycling performance during a simulated cycling grand tour. Methods: Thirty-four male endurance-trained competitive cyclists were randomized to CWI for four times per week for 15 min at 15 °C or control (passive recovery) groups for 7 d of baseline training, 21 d of intensified training, and an 11 -d taper. Criteria for completion of training and testing were satisfied by 10 cyclists in the CWI group (maximal aerobic power, 5. 13 ± 0. 21 W•kg- 1; mean ± SD) and 11 {{in the control group}} (5. 01 ± 0. 41 W•kg- 1). Each week, cyclists completed a high-intensity interval cycling test and two 4 -min bouts separated by 30 min. CWI was performed four times per week for 15 min at 15 °C. Results: Between baseline and taper, cyclists in the CWI group had an unclear change in overall 4 -min power relative to control (2. 7 % ± 5. 7 %), although <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> in the second effort relative to the first was likely higher for the CWI group relative to control (3. 0 % ± 3. 8 %).

A 9 km resolution, 1, 150 km by 1, 750 km, wind resource map at 120 m elevation above ground level (agl) is produced based on the NCEP reanalysis database for the three year period of 2009 - 2011. The onshore wind resource map is validated by comparing the modeling results to observed wind data at 100 m agl from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) of Thailand, and at 120 m agl from the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT). The Mean Square Error (MSE) is computed and is use as the main criterion to evaluate the simulation results.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for endurance cycle races, cyclists {{carry out a}} large volume of training to attain the necessary fitness to perform. These loads must be managed wisely to be optimally prepared for race day. In the early 1970 s Banister and colleagues introduced empirical models that describe the relationship between training load and performance ability. Banister suggested that Performance = Fitness – Fatigue and proceeded to introduce mathematical sophistication to this underlying premise by incorporating decay constants for both fitness and fatigue. Banister suggested that training load rapidly influenced fatigue but only slowly influenced fitness. However, with recovery fitness was well maintained while fatigue quickly dissipated. More recently, commercially available software packages have {{made it easier for}} coaches and cyclists to engage in these concepts. The TrainingPeaksTM software incorporates a performance manager, which is based on an impulse-response model for managing the training loads of cyclists based on data recorded by on board cycle ergometers called power meters. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how well the performance manager model predicts the performance ability of competitive cyclists in road time trials, individual road races and multi-day events. Nationally and Internationally competitive cyclists (20 M, 5 F) submitted power meter files for a six- to eight-month period. Measures of fitness, fatigue and freshness were derived in the performance manager from the day before each competition. <b>Maximum</b> <b>mean</b> <b>powers</b> (MMPs) for 5 -s, 60 -s, 5 -min and 20 -min durations were recorded from each race. Mixed modelling was used to estimate the linear relationship between changes in fitness, fatigue and freshness, and changes in the MMPs during competition. Expressed as coefficients of variation (CV), within-cyclist variation in MMP from competition to competition ranged from 15 % (5 -s MMP) to 4. 1 % (20 -min MMP). These CVs were too large for the MMPs to track the usual changes in performance that cyclists would show between competitions. When the bottom half of each cyclist's MMPs were discarded, only 5 - and 20 -min MMPs in time trials had CVs that could track reasonable changes in performance (~ 2. 5 %). However, the mixed models showed effects of fitness, fatigue and freshness on MMPs that were either unclear or too weak to be useful. This study casts doubt on the use of fitness, fatigue and freshness measures to assess training load and the use of MMPs to assess performance in road cycling. Different models of measuring training loads should be investigated. Contextual information about each competition ride might reduce the error in MMPs by allowing filtering or adjusting for poor performances, but other measures of performance from competitions may be needed to determine whether fitness, fatigue and freshness are worth monitoring...|$|R

Powered by a 511 -kV voltage signal for a duration of 45 ns, the design under consideration operates with an injected electron beam of mean voltage and mean current of around 508 kV and 19 kA, respectively. Full-wave 3 -D modeling is performed using well-tested electromagnetic particle-in-cell codes such as Computer Simulation Technology Particle Studio and Magic. Simple rules for designing and installing the reflectors are given. The number of reflectors required to maximize the efficiency is discussed.

40|$|Repeated sprint ability {{has been}} widely studied by researchers, however, {{analysis}} {{of the relationship between}} most kinetic variables and the effect of fatigue is still an ongoing process. To search for the best biomechanical parameter to evaluate repeated sprint ability, several kinetic variables were measured in a tethered field running test and compared regarding their sensitivity to fatigue and correlation with time trials in a free running condition. Nine male sprint runners (best average times: 100 m = 10. 45 +/- 0. 07 s; 200 m = 21. 36 +/- 0. 17 s; 400 m = 47. 35 +/- 1. 09 s) completed two test sessions on a synthetic track. Each session consisted of six 35 m sprints interspersed by 10 s rest under tethered field running or free running conditions. Force, power, work, an impulse and a rate of force development were all directly measured using the sensors of a new tethered running apparatus, and a one-way ANOVA with Scheffe post-hoc test used to verify differences between sprints (p < 0. 05). Pearson product-moment correlation measured the relationship between mechanical variables and free running performance. A total impulse, the rate of force development and maximum force did not show significant differences for most sprints. These three variables presented low to moderate correlations with free running performance (r between 0. 01 and - 0. 35). <b>Maximum</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> presented the strongest correlations with free running performance (r = - 0. 71 and - 0. 76, respectively; p < 0. 001), followed by mean force (r = - 0. 61; p < 0. 001) and total work (r = - 0. 50; p < 0. 001).

Analysis of the wind speed and hence power distribution over the wet and dry seasons shows that in the wet season, August is the windiest month for Douala and Limbe while September is the windiest month for Kribi while in the dry season, March is the windiest month for Douala and Limbe while February is the windiest month for Kribi. In terms of <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> density, most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy, Kribi shows to be the best site for the {{installation of a}} wind farm. Generally, the wind speeds at all three locations seem quite low, average wind speeds of all the three studied locations fall below 4. 0 m/s which is far below the cut-in wind speed of many modern wind turbines. However we recommend the use of low cut-in speed wind turbines like the Savonius for stand alone low energy need...|$|R

The monthly <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> density varies between 43.15 W/m 2 in November and 153.16 W/m 2 in March. Therefore, based on PNL wind power {{classification}} scheme [23], the monthly <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> density mostly falls into class 1 (PD[*]≤[*] 100) except in January, February, April and July, when it falls into class 2 (100 [*]<[*]PD[*]≤[*] 150), and in March, when it falls into class 3 (150 [*]<[*]PD[*]≤[*] 200). However, the annual <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> density for this site is 96.98 W/m 2 (class 1). For Owerri (Table 3), the minimum and maximum values of the monthly {{mean wind speed}}s are 2.72 and 3.70 m/s, respectively, while the annual mean wind speed for this site is 3.36 m/s. The monthly <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> density varies between 11.66 W/m 2 in November and 31.02 W/m 2 in January.

A first-order method is used to calculate the <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> spectrum of the device in waves of dissimilar spectra. JONSWAP spectra with different peak enhancement parameters are used to show the effect of energy concentration within the wave spectrum on the device <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> spectrum. A comparison of the optimum <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> output of a PAWEC in an irregular wave climate with that in an energy-equivalent regular wave climate is made to show the influence of the combination of wave spectrum and power output characteristics on the former.
