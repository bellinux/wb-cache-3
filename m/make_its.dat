5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might <b>make</b> <b>its</b> swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E

5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually able to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> {{way up the}} western passage on 9 August, enduring fire from batteries {{on both sides of}} the river for more than two hours. Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an article}} in the New Rochelle Pioneer the film was {{produced}} in New Rochelle and according to a news release the film was shot in the mountains during real blizzard weather. Bowers believes this film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release. The winter of 1909 through 1910 contained two notable snow events that might have possibly been used in the production. A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would <b>make</b> <b>its</b> way through New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 inches of snow. Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the press, was recorded in early February.|$|E

5|$|After Lavasani's {{body had}} been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, {{contacted}} the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, {{and the prime minister}} agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel and engine tests, but before the N–20 could <b>make</b> <b>its</b> maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although {{the wings of the}} P-16 were later used {{in the development of the}} successful Learjet.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{originally}} considered reviving CBS's long-lost {{quiz show}} The $64,000 Question {{for a new}} era, with a new home on ABC. However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire was about to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> debut, he got {{his friends and family}} members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members, each containing a copy of Millionaires first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping <b>make</b> <b>its</b> visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
