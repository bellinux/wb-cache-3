5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, {{although}} the concept originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992). Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima, and Takashi Iizuka. Naka began the project with the <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character. The team conducted research on dreaming and REM sleep, and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. An analogue controller, known as the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and was included with some retail copies sold.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The <b>main</b> <b>idea,</b> in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

5|$|Gaga {{performed}} {{songs from}} her third studio album Artpop (2013) at ArtRave, a two-day event hosted by her {{to promote the}} album. In 2014, she headlined her first residency show, with seven shows at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York. Later that year, she began the , whose <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> was to create an immersive rave. The tour received a positive response from reviewers, but some criticized it for being disjointed. After the release of her collaborative album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek (2014), the duo embarked on their Cheek to Cheek Tour, which began in December 2014 and concluded in August 2015. The tour was critically acclaimed, and topped Vulture's list of 10 best concerts of 2015. In 2015, she received her third Billboard Music Award for Top Touring Artist nomination; she was also nominated in 2011 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> of the {{algorithm}} {{is to find}} pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and {{the algorithm}} chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> {{behind this}} method is that the results are {{computed}} based on repeated random sampling and statistical analysis. The Monte Carlo simulation is in fact random experimentations, in the case that, {{the results of these}} experiments are not well known.|$|E
25|$|Coding theory {{started as}} a part of design theory with early {{combinatorial}} constructions of error-correcting codes.

25|$|This {{does not}} mean that if {{mathematics}} is separate from material concerns, it is useless; or that algebra, which is more abstract, is more useless.

25|$|We can {{compute the}} MD DCT-IV using the regular row-column method {{or we can}} use the {{polynomial}} transform method for the fast and efficient computation.

MD DCT-IV also has several applications in various fields.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a stiff {{equation}} is a differential equation for which certain numerical methods for solving the equation are numerically unstable, unless the step size {{is taken to}} be extremely small. It has proven difficult to formulate a precise definition of stiffness, but the <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> is that the equation includes some terms {{that can lead to}} rapid variation in the solution.|$|E

25|$|The modern TSSI {{approach}} has been criticized by other Marxist and neo-Ricardian scholars including Gerard Duménil, Duncan K. Foley, Michel Husson, David Laibman, Dominique Lévy, Simon Mohun, Gary Mongiovi, Ernesto Screpanti, Ajit Sinha, and Roberto Veneziani. The <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> of these critics is, that if equilibrium is let go of, then capitalism is an unpredictable chaos, and no coherent theory of prices or profits is possible anymore.|$|E

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> {{of racial}} antisemitism, as {{presented}} by racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, {{is that the}} Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to the European nations. The emphasis was on the non-European origin {{and culture of the}} Jews, meaning they were beyond redemption even if they converted to Christianity. This modern antisemitism emphasized hatred of the Jews as a race and not only the Jewish religion.|$|E

25|$|Lie sphere {{geometry}} is a geometrical {{theory of}} planar or spatial geometry {{in which the}} fundamental concept is the circle or sphere.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether elaborative interrogation {{would be an}} effective learning strategy with lengthy expository text. One hundred undergraduates (65 females and 35 males) comprised the study’s 5 groups: a) naturalistic elaborative interrogation, b) self-study, c) repetition, d) elaborative interrogation with pre-underlined main ideas; and, e) elaborative interrogation with pre-underlined <b>main</b> <b>ideas</b> plus structured ‘why’ questions. The expectation was that elaborative interrogation {{would prove to be}} a potent learning strategy relative to lower-order strategies (e. g., repetition); and that, when using expository text, students may require some supports to maximize the strategy’s gains. All students read an eight page passage on childhood education from a university textbook, studied <b>main</b> <b>ideas</b> (pre-identified or not), and completed a free recall and multiple choice task As was expected, Bonferroni t’s (Q 3 ̆c. 05) revealed that elaborative interrogation exceeded repetition’s performance on the total free recall score; and, the naturalistic group had fewer correct multiple choice responses for <b>main</b> <b>ideas,</b> and wrote down fewer <b>main</b> <b>ideas</b> on the free recall measure than the other two elaborative interrogation groups. However, the self-study group engaged mainly in lower-order strategies and was not outperformed by the naturalistic elaborative interrogation group.
