These {{announced}} that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E

5|$|Freelancer {{features}} a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128players to play {{together in a}} game. Multiplayer games are hosted on game servers; personal computers that meet the requirements for the game {{can act as a}} server. Gameplay is similar to the single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can resume their game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because it was something she had not done before. Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list.

The list ranking is <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E

They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} the Air Force was reduced from 290to 190fixed-wing aircraft and had five of its twelve bases closed. In 2002, the Armée XXI reforms continued {{the pattern of}} reduction, with bases at Mollis, Turtmann, and Interlaken closed, jets relocated out of Dübendorf (later planned for closing), and the helicopter base at Alpnach placed on the closure list. These closures left Payerne, Sion, and Meiringen as the only combat bases, Emmen as the main helicopter base, and Locarno as a training base. Buochs was <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> war-time reactivation, and the theoretical plan for using highways near Payerne, Sion, and Lodrino as emergency runways was retained, although no pilots have been trained in their use since the mid-1980s.|$|E

As a palette-swapped character, he was physically {{identical to the}} Mortal Kombat games' other male ninjas, save for his red coloring. For Mortal Kombat: Deception, which marked Ermac's return to the series as a playable character after an eight-year absence, {{he was given a}} distinct redesign by Steve Beran, the series' lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that his objective of remaking old characters was to greatly differentiate them from their previous incarnations. His Deception design was <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> the 2011 reboot game, but with an increased black palette.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the MBTA {{announced}} that the contamination had been fully removed, and revealed plans to place solar panels in the west part of 5-Yard. The panels would be installed and <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> at least 20 years by an outside contractor. Bidding began in May 2012, with the stipulation that the solar array would be operational {{by the spring of}} 2013. The contract was chosen in September 2012, with a revised completion date of October 2013. In July 2013, MassDOT (the MBTA's parent agency) {{announced that}} construction would not begin until at least 2014 due to a state solar program reaching capacity earlier than expected. , the installation was to occur in June 2015.|$|E

5|$|Most {{official}} {{records show}} Davies's birth date as November 1886, {{but he is}} widely {{thought to have been}} born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal adviser, and vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm advocate of the Soviet Union, a position he <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway {{opened in}} late 1853, {{and the effects}} on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite {{petitions}} from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> drain purposes only. Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until {{the early years of}} the 20th century. There is still a public right of navigation as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another {{restructuring of the}} major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, {{and again in the}} abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were <b>maintained</b> <b>for</b> scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E

The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over.
