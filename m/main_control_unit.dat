With multiple power outlets in almost every room in every house, the power line is the most pervasive network and the largest infrastructure available.

This paper presents a method to develop a home automation system using the AC (alternating current) power line to establish a network between <b>main</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>unit</b> and client units with a proprietary designed power line communication (PLC) protocol. The designed protocol has features such as multinode simplex communication, flood transmission and even parity error detection.

50|$|In {{computer}} engineering, {{an execution}} unit (also called a functional unit) {{is a part}} of the central processing unit (CPU) that performs the operations and calculations as instructed by the computer program.

50|$|A {{group of}} devices are {{connected}} via Bluetooth technology {{in an ad}} hoc fashion. A piconet starts with two connected devices, and may grow to eight connected devices. Bluetooth communication always designates one of the Bluetooth devices as a <b>main</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>unit</b> or master unit. Other devices that follow the master unit are slave units. This allows the Bluetooth system to be non-contention based (no collisions). This means that after a Bluetooth device {{has been added to}} the piconet, each device is assigned a specific time period to transmit and they do not collide or overlap with other units operating within the same piconet.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with various {{supplies}} and loads in an autonomous microgrid, a system of sensors {{and a control unit}} was developed. The goals of this system are to cope efficiently {{in the event of an}} energy supply shortage, and to prevent such events as much as possible. To achieve these goals, the aim was to manage energy in the system as efficiently as possible. The system consists of a collection of sensor nodes, a control unit and an analysis unit. The sensor nodes monitor power flow and collect data from the outlets. The <b>main</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> manages the power flow and prevents shortages, and relays information between the nodes and the data analysis unit. The data analysis unit uses historical data collected from the nodes to make predictions on supply and demand and to make scheduling decisions. This thesis is concerned with the <b>main</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and the nodes. Theory about power management, node monitoring and communication is discussed, followed by the implementation of the MCU and the nodes.

50|$|The <b>main</b> {{operator}} <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> {{of these}} plans, appeared {{similar to a}} 232 plus Bellset 26 combo but was now a Tele 248 plus Bellset 39a (early versions) or 44 (later). These bellsets had a recess, in the front, dominated by a horizontal, quadrant mounted, 4 position slider, flanked by either 1 or 2 press buttons, for buzzing the extension(s). These Bellsets 39a and 44 were bellsets in name only, as they contained no bell. What they did contain was a maze of spring contact sets, mainly activated by a cam at the pivot of the slide switch. The system required a separate, remote mounted bellset, for incoming signalling. The main unit could make and answer exchange calls, talk to and transfer calls to the extension(s). The extensions could call and {{talk to each other}} and the main unit, but could only make external calls if a request to the operator, for the exchange line, was honoured.When this system was eventually revisited and brought up to date, with the 700 series Plans 105 and 107, the equivalent <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> was dubbed 'The Planset'.|$|R

50|$|The {{flight crew}} {{consisted}} of Captain Manjit Singh Sohanpal and co-pilot Arvind Singh Bagga. A criminal case, filed against them {{based on the}} statement of a surviving passenger, was later withdrawn. Both Captain Sohanpal and co-pilot Bagga died in the accident.Investigators later conducted an observation with its Rudder Power <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (PCU). The <b>Main</b> Power <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (MPCU) of the rudder has been a subject of intense debate and discussions and has undergone mandatory modifications {{as a result of}} some previous accident investigations. The PCU has responsible for several high-profile crashes, such as United Airlines Flight 585, USAir Flight 427, and Eastwind Airlines Flight 517. Flight 7412 nose-dived before the crash, as well as two previous crashes, Flight 585 and Flight 427. The rudder locked up in a particular direction, and reversal of rudder to that of the commanded position (anomalous rudder movements such as un-commanded movements). These have been attributed to the secondary slide jamming with the primary slide due to contamination or adverse buildup of tolerances during manufacture. However, investigators later dismissed it and ruled out the failure of the PCU as the cause, and concluded that it was serviceable and was in good condition.|$|R
