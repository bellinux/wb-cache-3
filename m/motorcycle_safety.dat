25|$|Team Oregon <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> Program, {{known as}} Team Oregon, is an American, Oregon-based <b>motorcycle</b> <b>safety</b> {{partnership}} between the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Oregon State University. Headed by Steve Garets, it is funded by ODOT through motorcycle endorsement (license) fees and student tuition. Team Oregon's training materials {{have been used in}} other states, including Idaho and Illinois, and it is the only official <b>motorcycle</b> <b>safety</b> program in Oregon. The program began in 1984.|$|E
25|$|<b>Motorcycle</b> <b>safety</b> {{education}} is offered throughout the United States by organisations ranging from state agencies to non-profit organisations to corporations. Most states use the courses {{designed by the}} <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> Foundation (MSF), while Oregon and Idaho developed their own. All of the training programs include a Basic Rider Course, an Intermediate Rider Course and an Advanced Rider Course.|$|E
25|$|Team Oregon was nationally {{recognized}} through the <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> Foundation (MSF) and {{sponsored by the}} Oregon Traffic Safety Commission. In December 2006, Team Oregon and Oregon State University were sued by the <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> Foundation for copyright infringement in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. MSF alleged Team Oregon used their materials {{to develop their own}} program. Team Oregon and MSF settled the lawsuit out of court in December 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Because Queensland driver {{licences}} were {{susceptible to}} fraud the department initiated a smartcard project in 2003. The project {{has suffered from}} long delays and cost overruns. The Here For Life campaign was launched in 2009 and has been credited as being a great success in <b>motorcycle</b> rider <b>safety.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since Oregon {{implemented}} the Team Oregon <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> Program, motorcycle fatalities {{have been reduced}} by 50%. However, motorcycle fatality rates are rising in both Oregon and nationally. Team Oregon's position, {{as well as that}} of the Oregon Department of Transportation's Traffic Safety Division, is that rider judgment and skill are critical in avoiding motorcycle accidents and fatalities. Approximately 70% of Oregon's riders receive training through Team Oregon.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, the Think Bike {{campaign}} {{is dedicated to}} increasing both <b>motorcycle</b> <b>safety</b> and the awareness of motorcycles on the country's roads. The campaign, while strongest in the Gauteng province, has representation in Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal and the Free State. It has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects such as the annual Motorcycle Toy Run.|$|E

50|$|Various {{types of}} airbags were tested on {{motorcycles}} by the UK Transport Research Laboratory in the mid-1970s. In 2006 Honda introduced the first production <b>motorcycle</b> airbag <b>safety</b> system on its Gold Wing motorcycle. Honda claims that sensors {{in the front}} forks can detect a severe frontal collision and decide when to deploy the airbag, absorbing some of the forward energy of the rider and reducing the velocity at which the rider may be thrown from the motorcycle.|$|R
25|$|Even {{more so than}} on a bicycle, {{deliberately}} countersteering {{is essential}} for safe motorcycle riding, {{and as a result}} {{is a part of the}} safe riding courses run by the <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> Foundation and the Canada Safety Council. Deliberately countersteering a motorcycle is a much more efficient way to steer than to just lean. At higher speeds the self-balancing property of the bike gets stronger, and more force must be applied to the handlebars.|$|E
25|$|It is {{used for}} <b>motorcycle</b> <b>safety</b> clothing, {{especially}} in the areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows. In fencing it {{is used in the}} protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. It is increasingly being used in the peto, the padded covering which protects the picadors' horses in the bullring. Speedskaters also frequently wear an under-layer of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates {{in the event of a}} fall or collision.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{motorcycle}} rider {{training is}} compulsory in Quebec and Manitoba only, but all provinces and territories have graduated licence programs which place restrictions on new drivers {{until they have}} gained experience. Eligibility for a full motorcycle licence or endorsement for completing a <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Safety</b> course varies by province. The Canada Safety Council, a non-profit safety organisation, offers the Gearing Up program across Canada and is endorsed by the Motorcycle and Moped Industry Council. Training course graduates may qualify for reduced insurance premiums.|$|E
50|$|The Billy Mitchell Bridge, which {{transporters}} used {{to access}} the circuit, became a source of controversy for many years at Road America with both cars and <b>motorcycles</b> for <b>safety</b> reasons. After Memo Gidley's serious crash at the 2001 CART race at the circuit, and complaints by motorcycle racers, officials began formulating a plan to fix the problem. In the winter of 2006, the bridge was demolished, adding runoff at Turn 13 while adding a new tunnel and eliminating the point of impact where Titus was badly injured.|$|R

5000|$|Roads are {{primarily}} designed for their main users, cars, and are seldom engineered with <b>motorcycle</b> specific <b>safety</b> in focus. The choice of roadside barriers and guardrails to prevent vehicles from crossing over a median or running {{off the road}} {{have proved to be}} dangerous for motorcyclists, as they are designed to dissipate braking energy for much heavier and structurally tougher cars and trucks. Moreover, they are designed to be impacted on the sliding rail and not at their support poles, which act as swords to unprotected road users.|$|R
2500|$|The United Kingdom {{has several}} organisations {{dedicated}} to improving <b>motorcycle</b> <b>safety</b> by providing advanced rider training {{beyond what is}} necessary to pass the basic motorcycle licence test.

40|$|Bikers {{are often}} {{involved}} in accidents like other road users. Many are injured and killed {{each year and}} their proportion of all traffic injuries has increased, mainly due to the doubling {{of the number of}} motorcycles in use in the last decade. The overall aim {{of this study is to}} increase the awareness of other road users of motorcyclists’ visibility and their attitudes to road safety and road safety measures, especially during night riding. There were three proactive measurements conducted to compare and enhance the visibility of the motorcyclist during night riding. The three measurements used were application of the reflective sticker on the sides of the motorcycle; a new design of using LED lights on <b>motorcycles</b> <b>safety</b> vest and Circuit modification on signal lamps, where the signal stays on both sides during the riding while the blinkers are still affective when needed. The data collection was by doing field testing on the three proactive measures and questionnaires were distributed to collect surveys among road users, especially small motorcycles and car users. The result shows that by doing some modifications on the safety apparel and on the motorcycle itself will improved motorcyclist’s safety during night riding. The findings also found out that the modification done will enhance and increase the visibility of the small motorcycle riders during night riding. Thus, the research is expected can reduce accident among small motorcycle riders...|$|R

50|$|The Losail {{race track}} in Qatar {{represents}} the debut race of each MotoGP season. In 2008, the track held {{the first night}} event in MotoGP history. The 2008 night event, aside from drawing boosted viewing, was initiated {{with the intent of}} increasing equipment performance: the day-time heat in Qatar has been hazardous to the conditions of tires and expensive, customized parts on the multimillion-dollar <b>motorcycles.</b> Rider <b>safety</b> notwithstanding, the extreme heat could be a critical variable contributing to defeat. Qatar's Grand Prix is the only event in the entire MotoGP calendar to be held at night.|$|R
