5|$|As {{with other}} {{swallows}}, both <b>martins</b> feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.

5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky crag martin overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale crag martin, but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} known whether the two closely related <b>martins</b> could hybridise, which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species. Dusky crag <b>martins</b> from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that between individual <b>martins</b> of the nominate subspecies.|$|E

5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the <b>martins</b> (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag <b>Martins</b> Ptyonoprogne, and Saw-wings Psalidoprocne.

5|$|Mascarene <b>martins</b> will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. <b>Martins</b> on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown.

A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E

5|$|The Delichon <b>martins</b> were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the Asian house martin. The typical nest is a grass or feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top, but many Asian house <b>martins</b> leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA {{analysis}} showed that an enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera, including the Delichon house <b>martins,</b> a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag <b>martins</b> resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the research showed that if Delichon, Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo, Ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, and is {{sometimes}} included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag <b>martins</b> resemble those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow. However, a DNA analysis showed that if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag <b>martins,</b> it should include all the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the Delichon house <b>martins</b> are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off. The pale crag martin's nearest relatives are {{the other members of the}} genus, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia, the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa, and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris.|$|E

5|$|The house <b>martins</b> nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings, {{constructing}} feather- or grass-lined mud nests. The typical clutch is two {{or three}} white eggs; both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. These <b>martins</b> are aerial hunters of small insects such as flies and aphids. Despite their flying skills the Delichon <b>martins</b> are sometimes caught by fast-flying birds of prey. They may carry fleas or internal parasites. None of the species are considered threatened, although widespread reductions in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe. This decline is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} <b>martins</b> are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house <b>martins.</b>|$|E
5|$|These drab <b>martins</b> {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand <b>martins</b> of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia <b>martins.</b> Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E
