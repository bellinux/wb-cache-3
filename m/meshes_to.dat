Coarser particles are separated in the sieve analysis portion, and the finer particles are analyzed with a hydrometer. The distinction between coarse and fine particles is usually made at 75 μm. The sieve analysis shakes the sample through progressively smaller <b>meshes</b> <b>to</b> determine its gradation. The hydrometer analysis uses the rate of sedimentation to determine particle gradation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system also}} models the {{phases of the}} moon. The moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which <b>meshes</b> <b>to</b> the sun pointer at B0 (the {{connection}} between B0 {{and the rest of}} B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean sun pointer or a hypothetical true sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the moon, but is also geared to the sun— the effect is to perform a differential gear operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the sun and moon pointers. [...] The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.|$|E

60|$|Seeing that Ethelberta {{had been}} working at that art as a profession, it can hardly {{be said that the}} {{question}} was conceived with tact, though it was put with grace. Lord Mountclere evidently thought it objectionable, for he looked unhappy. To only one person in the brilliant room did the request appear as a timely accident, and that was to Ethelberta herself. Her honesty was always making war upon her manoeuvres, and shattering their delicate <b>meshes,</b> <b>to</b> her great inconvenience and delay. Thus there arose those devious impulses and tangential flights which spoil the works of every would-be schemer who instead of being wholly machine is half heart. One of these now was to show herself as she really was, not only to Lord Mountclere, but to his friends assembled, whom, in her ignorance, she respected more than they deserved, and so get rid of that self-reproach which had by this time reached a morbid pitch, through her over-sensitiveness to a situation in which a large majority of women and men would have seen no falseness.|$|E

5000|$|As of OpenGL 4.0 and Direct3D 11, a new shader class {{called a}} {{tessellation}} shader has been added. It adds two new shader stages {{to the traditional}} model: tessellation control shaders (also known as hull shaders) and tessellation evaluation shaders (also known as Domain Shaders), which together allow for simpler <b>meshes</b> <b>to</b> be subdivided into finer meshes at run-time according to a mathematical function. The function {{can be related to}} a variety of variables, most notably the distance from the viewing camera to allow active level-of-detail scaling. This allows objects close to the camera to have fine detail, while further away ones can have more coarse meshes, yet seem comparable in quality. It also can drastically reduce mesh bandwidth by allowing <b>meshes</b> <b>to</b> be refined once inside the shader units instead of downsampling very complex ones from memory. Some algorithms can upsample any arbitrary mesh, while others allow for [...] "hinting" [...] in <b>meshes</b> <b>to</b> dictate the most characteristic vertices and edges.|$|E
