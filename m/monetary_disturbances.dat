40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{historical}} record to isolate episodes in which there were large <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances</b> not caused by output fluctuations. It then tests whether these monetary changes have important real effects. The {{central part of the}} paper is a study of postwar U. S. monetary history. We identify six episodes in which the Federal Reserve in effect decided to attempt to create a recession to reduce inflation. We find that a shift to anti-inflationary policy led, on average, to a rise in the unemployment rate of two percentage points, and that this effect is highly statistically significant and robust to a variety of changes in specification. We reach three other major conclusions. First, the real effects of these <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances</b> are highly persistent. Second, the six shocks that we identify account for a considerable fraction of postwar economic fluctuations. And third, evidence from the interwar era also suggests that <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances</b> have large real effects. ...|$|E

The model implies the testable hypothesis that aggregate output and employment are uncorrelated with the contemporaneous measure of money growth implied by {{the difference between the}} currently available estimates of current and past money shocks. Rejection of this hypothesis provides strong evidence again at the equilibriums approach to modeling the relation between <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances</b> and macro-economic fluctuations. ...|$|E

The results indicate that under such a dual foreign exchange system, the stability of a foreign exchange system requires a sufficient level of official reserves that can accommodate adverse terms of trade and <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbance</b> shocks.

40|$|The <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{theory of}} the Depression, {{explained}} by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) asserts that the Depression was so deep and long because the Federal Reserve pursued a tight monetary policy.

It is probable that {{the decline in the}} money supply caused the credit market problems, but {{this may not be the}} main or the only avenue through which the money supply affected output.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} a {{money and}} credit market into a static approximation of the baseline New Keynesian model {{based on a}} money-and-credit-in-the-utility approach, in which real balances and borrowing contribute to the household's utility. In this framework, the central bank has no direct control over the interest rate on bonds. Instead, the central bank's instrument variables are the monetary base and the refinancing rate, i. e. {{the rate at which}} the central bank provides loans to the banking sector. Our approach gives rise to a credit channel, in which current and expected future interest rates on the bond and loan market directly affect current goods demand. The credit channel amplifies the output effects of isolated <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Taking changes in private (inflation and interest rate) expectations into account, we find that - contrarily to Bernanke and Blinder (1988) - the credit channel may also dampen the output effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances...</b>|$|E

In the model estimated simultaneously, the nominal exchange rate is allowed to diverge from Purchasing Power Parity in the short run, the monetary approach to exchange rate determination and the quantity theory of money {{are assumed to be}} valid in the long run, the dynamic adjustment of prices and the exchange rate to <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances</b> is made explicit, and currency substitution between domestic and foreign currency is introduced explicitly. The problem of the autocorrelation of the residuals of the money demand function found in previous studies is resolved, the fit of inflation and exchange rate changes is very satisfactory, and the speed of adjustment of the exchange rate to <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbances</b> is found to be much higher than for prices.

40|$|Using {{a partial}} {{equilibrium}} framework, Mankiw and Reis [2002] {{show that a}} sticky information model can generate a lagged and gradual inflation response after a monetary policy shock, whereas a sticky price model cannot. Our paper demonstrates that that finding is sensitive to their model’s parameterization. To determine a plausible parameterization, we specify a general equilibrium model with sticky information. In that model, we find that inflation peaks only one period after a <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbance.</b> A sensitivity analysis of our results reveals that the inflation peak is delayed by including real rigidities when the monetary policy instrument is money growth, whereas inflation peaks immediately when the policy instrument is the nominal interest rate.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} exchange-rate policy into a {{model of}} exchange- rate behavior, and examines the data econometrically to infer hypotheses about policy behavior in the 1970 s. The model shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then a movement along a "saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium. Here the role of "news" in moving the exchange rate is clear. The model is {{used to analyze the}} options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in the exchange rate following a real or <b>monetary</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The distinction is made between monetary policy and sterilized intervention, and a regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable is also studied. Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) for each of four countries [...] the U. S., the U. K., Germany, and Japan [...] are estimated, and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy in the U. S. {{and to a lesser extent}} Japan, drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U. K. reacts. It appears that U. S. monetary policy is essentially determined by domestic considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a consequence. In Japan, interest rates are varied in response to movement in the current-account and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange rate are partially neutralized by sterilized intervention. Germany and the U. K. react to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates, and sterilized intervention. ...|$|R
