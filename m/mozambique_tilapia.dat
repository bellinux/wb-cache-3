The fish {{population}} in the perennial reservoirs contain mostly exotic food fish <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia.</b> The stone sucker and Esomus thermoicos are endemic among other species. The blackspot barb, olive barb, orange chromide and common spiny loach are the common fish species.|$|E
25|$|Gobies usually live in male-female pairs that {{construct}} and share burrows, similar {{to many other}} fish such as <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia.</b> The burrows are used for shelters and spawning places. Gobies use their mouths to dig into the sea bottom, removing dead coral-fragments, rubble, and benthic algae {{in order to build}} their burrows. Gobies maintain their burrows by fanning away sand inside the burrows. Furthermore, gobies use coral rubble to block burrow entrance. A single goby carry as many as nine pieces of coral rubble per minute. Gobies also build a 6–13cm high mound over the entrance of their spawning burrow. The mound lets the water flow fast over the mound. The water flow created by the mound helps to provide oxygen to the eggs. While burrow building is a cooperative behavior done by both sexes, males usually put more effort in burrow maintenance than females. Females feed more instead, because the reproductive success is optimal when females put more energy in preparing for the reproduction. Interestingly, after spawning eggs, the roles of male and female changes. Females primarily maintain the burrow, and males mainly care for the eggs by fanning them, thereby providing oxygen. When females leave the burrow, however, the mounds lose their heights. The males then give up on the eggs and eat them, preparing for future mating opportunities. Goby burrows vary in size {{depending on the size of}} the goby species.|$|E
2500|$|The Orange River has a {{relative}} paucity of species diversity. A 2011 survey of 13,762 fish found only 16 [...] {{species of fish}} present. Three of these, the [...] common carp, the <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> and the western mosquitofish are non-indigenous. Another exotic species, rainbow trout, {{is found in the}} river headwaters in Lesotho.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias,</b> {{like all}} species {{belonging}} to the Oreochromis genus and species like Astatotilapia burtoni, are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning that spawn is incubated {{and raised in the}} mouth of the mother. Parental care is therefore almost exclusive to the female. Males do contribute by providing nests for the spawn before incubation, but the energy costs associated with nest production is low relative to mouthbrooding. Compared to non-mouthbrooders, it is not energetically feasible to both mouthbrood and grow a new clutch of eggs. Thus, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias</b> arrest oocyte growth during mouthbrooding to conserve energy. [...] Even with oocyte arrest, females that mouthbrood take significant costs in body weight, energy, and low fitness. Hence, parental-offspring conflict is visible through the costs and benefits to the parents and the young. A mother caring for her offspring carries the cost of reducing her own individual fitness. Unlike most fish, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias</b> exhibit an extended maternal care period believed to allow social bonds to be formed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias</b> often {{travel in}} groups where a strict {{dominance}} hierarchy is maintained. Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production. [...] In {{terms of social}} structure, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias</b> engage in a system known as lek-breeding, where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them. Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates. During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water. [...] This aggregation forms {{the basis of the}} lek through which the females preferentially choose their mates. Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance. [...] In experiments with captive tilapias, evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions. Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males. However, contrary to popular belief, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias</b> display more agonistic interactions towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank. One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly. In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight. Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate tilapias both for an easy fight and to keep their rank.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, urinary pheromones {{also play}} a part in male - male {{interaction}} for <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias.</b> Studies have shown that male aggression is highly correlated with increased urination. Symmetrical aggression between males resulted in an increase in the release of urination frequency. Dominant males both store and release more potent urine during agonistic interactions. Thus, both the initial stage of lek formation and the maintenance of social hierarchy may highly depend on the males’ varying urinary output.|$|R

50|$|For {{the past}} century, river runoff and {{evaporation}} have greatly increased the salinity concentration within the Salton Sea. Presently, the introduced <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis mossambicus) {{and only a}} handful of other fish species are capable of tolerating the Salton Sea’s exceptionally high concentrations of salinity. Although the <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> is most commonly an invasive species throughout much of the southwestern United States, in the Salton Sea, this tilapia has become a critical part of local ecology.|$|E
50|$|Urine in <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias,</b> {{like many}} {{freshwater}} fish species, {{acts as a}} vector for communication amongst individuals. Hormones and pheromones released with urine by the fish often affect the behavior and physiology of the opposite sex. Dominant males signal females {{through the use of}} a urinary odorant. Further studies have suggested that females respond to the ratio of chemicals within the urine, as opposed to the odor itself. Nevertheless, females are known to be able to distinguish between hierarchical rank and dominant vs. subordinate males through chemicals in urine.|$|R
50|$|Male <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapias</b> {{synchronize}} breeding {{behavior in}} terms of courtship activity and territoriality {{in order to take}} advantage of female spawning synchrony. One of the costs associated with this synchronization is the increase in competition among males, which are already high on the dominance hierarchy. As a result, different mating tactics have evolved in these species. Males may mimic females and sneak reproduction attempts when the dominant male is occupied. Likewise, another strategy for males is to exist as a floater, travelling between territories in an attempt to find a mate. Nevertheless, it is the dominant males who have the greatest reproductive advantage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} comprehensive dis-tributional data, {{from over}} 1300 sites, on introduced freshwater fishes in Western Australia. Currently, there are 10 species of introduced freshwater fish {{established in the}} inland waters of Western Australia. Most of the introduced fishes found here are those that have formed feral populations elsewhere in the world, and include members of the Salmonidae, i. e., rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta); Cyprinidae, i. e., goldfish (Carassius auratus) and carp (Cyprinus carpio); Poeciliidae, i. e., mosquitofish (Gambusia hol-brooki), one-spot livebearer (Phalloceros caudi-maculatus), guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii); Percidae, i. e., redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis), and Cichlidae, i. e., <b>Mozambique</b> mouthbrooder or <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis mossambicus). More recently, the eastern Austral-ian silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) (Terapontidae), which was introduced for aquaculture, has been cap-tured in the Swan River near Perth. It is not known whether this population is self-maintaining. The majority of introduced species are confined to the south-west, although four and one species have been recorded from the Pilbara and Kimberley, respec-tively. Some species are extremely common and widespread, e. g., G. holbrooki and P. fluviatilis, whereas others are far more restricted and may be confined to between one and three catchments, e. g., C. carpio, P. caudimaculatus, P. reticulata, X. hellerii, O. mossambicus, and B. bidyanus. The im-pact of these introduced fishes on native species varies, but ranges from predation, e. g., O. mykiss, S. trutta, G. holbrooki, and P. fluviatilis, to aggressive-ness, e. g., G. holbrooki, X. hellerii, and O. mossam-bicus, and competition for food and habitat...|$|R
50|$|<b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> are omnivorous. They can consume {{detrital}} material, diatoms, invertebrates, small fry {{and vegetation}} ranging from macroalgae to rooted plants. This broad diet helps the species thrive in diverse locations.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with most}} species of tilapia, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> {{have a high}} {{potential}} for hybridization. They are often crossbred with other tilapia species in aquaculture because purebred <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> grow slowly and have a body shape poorly suited to cutting large fillets. Also, hybrids between certain parent combinations (such as between Mozambique and Wami tilapia) result in offspring that are all or predominantly male. Male tilapia are preferred in aquaculture as they grow faster and have a more uniform adult size than females. The [...] "Florida Red" [...] tilapia is a popular commercial hybrid of Mozambique and blue tilapia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> are hardy {{individuals}} {{that are easy}} to raise and harvest, making them a good aquacultural species. They have a mild, white flesh that is appealing to consumers. This species constitutes about 4% of the total tilapia aquaculture production worldwide, but is more commonly hybridized with other tilapia species. Tilapia are very susceptible to diseases such as whirling disease and ich. <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> are resistant to wide varieties of water quality issues and pollution levels. Because of these abilities they have been used as bioassay organisms to generate metal toxicity data for risk assessments of local freshwater species in South Africa rivers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis mossambicus) is a tilapiine cichlid fish {{native to}} {{southern}} Africa. It {{is a popular}} fish for aquaculture. Dull colored, the <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> often lives up to a decade in its native habitats. Due to human introductions, it is now found in many tropical and subtropical habitats around the globe, where it can become an invasive species because of its robust nature. These same features make it a good species for aquaculture because it readily adapts to new situations. It is known as black tilapia in Colombia and as blue kurper in South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> is an {{invasive}} species {{in many parts}} of the world, having escaped from aquaculture or been deliberately introduced to control mosquitoes. [...] It has been nominated by the Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) as one of the 100 worst {{invasive species}} in the world. [...] It can harm native fish populations through competition for food and nesting space, as well as by directly consuming small fish. [...] In Hawaii, striped mullet Mugil cephalus are threatened because of the introduction of this species. <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> may also be responsible for the decline of the desert pupfish, Cyprinodon macularius, in California's Salton Sea.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{fish in the}} lakes, but the Paniai gudgeon (Oxyeleotris wisselensis) is {{endemic to}} the lake system. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> (O. mossambicus) are non-natives that have been {{introduced}} by humans.|$|E
50|$|Threats {{faced by}} the species include habitat loss as water is drained for irrigation, as well as {{predation}} by the introduced black bass and competition from native and invasive species such as the Banded tilapia, <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia,</b> and common carp.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{growing in}} the lake {{includes}} hydrilla (Hydrilla spp) and the filamentous alga (Clodophora spp). The lake is also rich in fish that includes dalág (Ophicephalus striatus), <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis mossambicus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), goby (Glossogobius giurus) and catfish (Clarias spp).|$|E
50|$|It is {{a remarkably}} robust and fecund fish, readily {{adapting}} to available food sources and breeding under suboptimal conditions.

50|$|In captivity, Wami tilapia {{have been}} hybridised with the <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis mossambicus).

50|$|Fresh water {{fisheries}} can {{be found}} in inland regions or in areas with large rivers or lakes. Fresh water fishes are popular in Sundanese cuisine of West Java, caught or raised in Lake Toba in Batak lands of North Sumatra, or taken from large rivers in Malay lands of Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra, or large rivers in Kalimantan. Popular fresh water fish among others; carp, gourami, catfish, pangasius, snakehead, trichogaster, climbing gourami, Nile tilapia, and <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lake {{contains}} various fish, {{including the}} eel Anguilla marmorata which migrates between {{the lake and}} the sea, and 11 fish species that are endemic to the lake, notably buntingi ricefish (Adrianichthys, Oryzias nebulosus, O. nigrimas and O. orthognathus), gobies (Mugilogobius amadi and M. sarasinorum), and the halfbeak Nomorhamphus celebensis. These endemics are all highly threatened; in some cases possibly already extinct. One {{of the reasons for}} the drastic decline of the native fish are introduced, non-native species, particularly <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> and common carp.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{considered}} Endangered by the IUCN {{as it has}} declined much in recent decades. The main threat is the introduced smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), which has killed off the stocks of {{the fish in the}} Berg River watershed by eating juveniles. In Brandvlei Dam, where the barb's population is most healthy, the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) is spreading; its impact will need to be assessed. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and <b>Mozambique</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis mossambicus), introduced for aquaculture, are competing with the Cape whitefish for food. Water pollution is also a problem.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} and recipes of ikan goreng, {{differ from the}} recipes of marinate spices, bumbu toppings, dipping sauces or sambals, to the species of fishes being fried. Almost all kind of fish and seafood can be made into ikan goreng, the most popular are freshwater gourami, bilis (mystacoleucus), patin (pangasius), nila (nile tilapia), mujair (<b>mozambique</b> <b>tilapia)</b> and ikan mas (carp). Seafood fried fishes are bandeng (milkfish), tongkol or cakalang (skipjack tuna), tuna, bawal (pomfret), tenggiri (wahoo), kuwe (trevally), baronang (rabbitfish), kerapu (garoupa), kakap merah (red snapper), teri (anchovy), todak (swordfish), hiu or cucut (shark) and pari (stingray).|$|E
5000|$|Sleep {{could also}} become absent during {{selective}} {{parts of a}} fish's life. Species that are normally quiescent at night become active day and night during the spawning season.
