40|$|Background : Tropical and {{subtropical}} Africa {{is predicted}} to experience a rise in temperature.  The effects of rising temperatures on temperate grasslands have been studied using open-top chambers (OTCs) but reports for tropical/subtropical grasslands are scarce. This study used OTCs to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on a threatened subtropical grassland type, namely KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS). Objectives : To assess the effects of OTCs on selected abiotic parameters and plant productivity within KZNSS. Methods : Five OTC and control plots were randomly distributed at the same altitude within a patch of KZNSS. Air and soil temperature, relative humidity (RH), soil moisture content and light intensity were monitored in all plots in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Biomass production and plant density were measured in each season, for each life form (graminoid, forb and shrub), separately and combined. Results : The OTCs resulted in a rise in average, maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>day</b> and night, air and soil temperatures. This increase, the degree of which differed across seasons, was accompanied by a decline in RH and soil moisture content. Elevated temperatures led to a significant increase in combined, graminoid and shrub above-ground productivity (AGP) and a decrease in forb density, but in certain seasons only. Below-ground biomass production was unaffected by elevated temperatures. Conclusions : OTCs can simulate realistic increases of air temperature in subtropical grasslands.  Graminoids and shrubs appear to benefit from elevated temperatures whilst forbs decrease in abundance, possibly through competition and/or direct physiological effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} wild or captive-bred mammals within their {{historical}} ranges typically aims to reestablish populations {{in areas where}} they have become extinct or extirpated, to reinforce natural populations, or to resolve human-wildlife conflicts. Such programs, which also typically in parallel help foster {{the protection of the}} release site, concern a wide range of endangered mammalian species, including our closest living relatives: chimpanzees. In June 2008, the Chimpanzee Conservation Center (CCC), which is located in the High Niger National Park (HNNP) in Guinea, released a group of 12 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) comprised of 6 females and 6 males (8 - 20 yr old). The selected release site lies 32 km from the sanctuary in the Mafou, a core area of HNNP where wild chimpanzees are also known to occur. The purpose of this release was therefore to reinforce the natural chimpanzee population within the Mafou core area and to promote the protection of the HNNP. Nearly 2 yr postrelease, 9 chimpanzees still remain free-living. Two thirds of the release chimpanzees were equipped with VHF-GPS store-on-board tracking collars. We used data from retrieved collars to explore the release chimpanzees' habitat use, individual day range, and core area use (50 % and 80 %) {{during the first year of}} the release. Males traveled significantly further than females. Although <b>minimum</b> <b>day</b> range did not differ between the sexes or vary seasonally, some release males were active for longer during the day than the females. Males also ranged over larger areas and used a wider network of core areas than the females. Habitat use was similar to that recorded in wild chimpanzees in the HNNP. As of September 2010, 2 males and 3 females form a group at the release site. Two of these females gave birth to healthy offspring respectively 16 and 20 mo postrelease. Another female successfully immigrated into a wild chimpanzee community. We suggest that the success of this chimpanzee release can be attributed to the CCC's lengthy rehabilitation process and the savanna-mosaic habitat of the HNNP. This release demonstrates that under special socioecological circumstances, the release of wild-born adult chimpanzees of both sexes is a viable strategy, which can also function as an effective conservation tool...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves 146 - 150. x, 150 l illus., maps, tablesThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to construct and analyze the patterns and trends of water demand in the service areas of the Honolulu Board of Water Supply, and to identify factors affecting water demand with the intent of deriving useful policy implications as well as improving on urban water demand research. To accomplish the objectives, a thorough review of the literature was conducted and some suggestions for methodological improvement were developed. Classical univariate time series analysis, data disaggregation methods, and trend analysis were used to construct the patterns and trends of water consumption. Significant variables, which affect increasing per capita water consumption, were identified through a logical sequence of data processing and reasoning. The results were confirmed by the methods of sample survey and regression analyses. Most of the data used in this study were compiled from water consumption records obtained from the Board of Water Supply. During the period of 1960 - 1971, the average daily per capita water consumption increased by about 27 percent from 139 gallons to 177 gallons. When per capita consumption was estimated by nine service areas per capita consumption figures depicted not only a wide dispersion in absolute value but also revealed different rates of growth. The seasonal patterns of water consumption were examined on a monthly basis. There is a steadily widening seasonal fluctuation in water use over time with summer consumption increasing faster than that for winter use. The trend of sprinkling demand was estimated from maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>day</b> water consumption trend equations. There is a difference in per capita consumption between single and multiple family dwellings, which is attributable mainly to outdoor sprinkling by households occupying single family dwellings. The water consumption level in established residential areas has remained essentially constant over time. The overall increase in per capita consumption results from water use for other than indoor domestic purposes. Water consumption has been expanding most noticeably where there is significant construction activity. Per capita water consumption data were fitted by linear regression to value of construction completed and annual changes in rainfall. The equation explained 96 percent of the total variation of per capita consumption and the two independent variables were statistically significant. There is no evidence that residential water users have been responsive to price changes in the past. Large industrial water users appear to respond to price increase but commercial users do not. Existence of price responsiveness in industrial demand seems to have a close relationship with alternative water supply sources and nonexistence of price responsiveness in commercial demand may be associated with an incidence structure of water bill payments, which also has an important meaning in measuring the price elasticity of residential demand. The demand approach for projection of water use is advocated by most urban water studies. Major implications {{of this study are}} that (1) the requirement approach is still a practical means of forecasting future water need, (2) there are serious institutional limitations in the use of price as a means to promote conservation but peak load pricing may be an effective way of reducing the inequitable distribution of water supply costs, and (3) the complex economic forces that have been operating through the existing institutional framework call for some form of unified management of groundwater resource for the purpose of conservation...|$|E
