40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping</b> {{effect on the}} system performance, especially in a non-uniform traffic environment. In [1], Pattavina discussed the implementation issues of output <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping</b> in a switching system, studied the throughput improvement by computer simulations, and also calculated the bounds of packet loss rate. Also, the maximum throughput analysis with output <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping</b> was recently presented in [3] under uniform traffic conditions. We here provide the exact analysis of throughput, delay and loss, based on the technique developed in [4]. Especially, {{we are able to}} evaluate the system performance in a nonuniform traffic environment where a much more significant improvement by <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping</b> is observed. This is because the local congestions caused by individual heavily loaded output links can now be removed upon output <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping.</b> We further propose a new concept of input <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping</b> by letting each demultiplexer have the ability to skip those input links when their buffer is full. Hence, the incoming packet will be blocked if and only if when the buffers of all input links within the same <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> are full. In contrast, by purely time-division demultiplexing, the packet is blocked when the buffer of presently held input link is full. Considering the high non-uniformity of input link traffic intensities, such an input <b>trunk</b> <b>grouping</b> will remove any possible local congestions of individual input links within each <b>trunk</b> <b>group.</b> The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the system maximum throughput performance with different trunk groupings in both uniform and non-uniform traffic environments. In section 3, we evaluate the average input buffer size and packet loss rate with finite buffer size. The paper is then concluded in s [...] ...|$|R

Methods 54 cases {{were divided into two}} groups randomly:the pulmonary vein trunk-ligation <b>group</b> (<b>trunk</b> <b>group,</b> 27 cases) and the pulmonary vein branch-ligation group (branch group, 27 cases). The blood concentrations of hydrocortisone (HC), blood glucose (BG) and cardial troponin-I (cTnI) were determined at different time point. The surgical data, the quantum of pain and ECG also recorded. Results ① There were no significance difference of the operation time, blood loss during operation and drainage volume in first day after operation between two groups. ② There're no differences of the quantum of pain between two groups. ③ The HC of the two groups' ascend obviously on the end of operation and descend during postoperative. ④ The BG of the two groups' rise on the 1 st day obviously, maintain high level on the 2 nd day, descend on the 3 rd day but still higher than that of preoperation. ⑤ The BG and HC show a direct positive correlation postoperative. ⑥ The cTnIs of the <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> ascend immediatelyafter operation, but there's no statistically significance between two groups. ⑦ The arrhythmia incidence is higher in the <b>trunk</b> <b>group,</b> but the arrhythmia incidences classified by the date after operation of the two groups' show no distinction.

50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex trunk circuit, {{outgoing}} trunks are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle <b>trunks</b> in that <b>group.</b> The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of the grade of service given to the subscribers in a telephone exchange. The analytical models used are (a) the probability linear graph for lost calls and (b) the traffic flow graph for delayed calls. Both of these models are expressed in terms of the congestion functions of the sub-units of the switching system in the exchange. When these models are used, the engineering procedure of determining the quantity of equipment for the switching system in the exchange to satisfy the objective grade of service is simple. The switching system in the exchange may be divided into three major sub-units: the <b>trunk</b> <b>groups,</b> the switching network, and the common control. The congestion functions for these sub-units are discussed. The structure and the mode of operation for these sub-units are usually very complex, so that the congestion functions for these units can only be approximated. Thus, the overall grade of service estimated this way is only an approximation. Finally, the procedure of estimating the overall grade of service of an exchange is demonstrated by considering a simple hypothetical telephone switching system. The main contributions in this thesis are: (1) The traffic flow graph: This graph is used as the model for estimating the grade of service for delayed calls in an exchange. It can also be used for approximating the waiting time distribution for a given waiting system. (2) The equivalent trunk technique: This technique is shown to be reasonably accurate and simple for use in computing the <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> congestion distribution when the <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> is arranged in grading. (3) A method of approximating network blocking probability: This method can be used to approximate the blocking probability of any complex switching network. It is simple and inexpensive and produces reasonably accurate results. (4) Single linking stage network loaded with multitype of traffic: When some types of traffic require the service of more than one link at a time, the network for these types of traffic is blocked even if there are some idle links in the network. Extremely poor approximation will result if the usual assumption of independent busy links is used for calculating the blocking probability. In this thesis, such a network is analysed and a better approximation for computing the blocking probability is given. (5) General case approach for determining waiting time distribution for a single server delay system: Such a single server delay system is analysed. This aids one {{to the understanding of the}} congestion processes producing delays...|$|R

50|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in the implementation of}} digital signal processing allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.|$|R
