5|$|Alpine {{skiing is}} an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} nordic skiing, {{but the first}} alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held for both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{expanding}} {{population of}} Scandinavia {{led to a}} shortage of available resources and arable land there {{and led to a}} period of Viking expansion, the Norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion. Shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries, the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain. Modern Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal genetic ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> equal measure.|$|E

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% of <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number of <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E

5|$|Golf {{has been}} {{prominent}} in England; {{due in part}} to its cultural and geographical ties to Scotland, the home of Golf. There are both professional tours for <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> <b>in</b> two main tours: the PGA and the European Tour. England has produced grand slam winners: Cyril Walker, Tony Jacklin, Nick Faldo, and Justin Rose in the men's and Laura Davies, Alison Nicholas, and Karen Stupples in the women's. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, played both in England and Scotland. The biennial golf competition, the Ryder Cup, is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder who sponsored the event and donated the trophy. Nick Faldo is the most successful Ryder Cup player ever, having won the most points (25) of any player on either the European or US teams.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{sponsors}} 31 varsity {{sports and}} {{has one of}} the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs. MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, NCAA's Division I Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC) for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Mary Brewster Hazelton (November 23, 1868– September 13, 1953) was an American {{portrait}} painter. She {{attended the}} School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, {{where she was}} later an instructor. Among her other achievements, Hazelton {{was the first woman}} to win an award open to both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the United States when she won the Hallgarten Prize from the National Academy of Design in 1896. Her portrait paintings are in the collections of the Massachusetts State House, Harvard University, Peabody Essex Museum, and Wellesley Historical Society. The professional organizations that Hazelton was affiliated with included the Wellesley Society of Artists, of which she was a founding member, and The Guild of Boston Artists, of which she was a charter member. She lived her adult life with her sisters in the Hazelton family home in Wellesley, Massachusetts.|$|E

They eventually develop a romantic relationship despite being aware of the social boundaries between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Afghan society. War comes to Afghanistan, and Kabul is bombarded by rocket attacks. Tariq's family decides to leave the city, and the emotional farewell between Laila and Tariq culminates with them making love. Laila's family also decides to leave Kabul, but as they are packing a rocket destroys the house, killing her parents and severely injuring Laila. Laila is subsequently taken in by Rasheed and Mariam.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> {{the nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> equal measure.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity in Australia has increased during the past 30 years, {{little is known about}} the dietary and behavioural antecedents of body mass index (BMI). We examined changes in mean BMI, diet, and other lifestyle behaviours between 1976 and 2005 and described the cross-sectional associations between these factors and BMI. A series of biennial biomedical surveys by Sydney Adventist Hospital from 1976 to 2005 allowed examination of BMI trends, while the selection of three surveys enabled detailed examination of likely dietary and lifestyle associations. Subjects included in this study were: 384 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 338 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1976; 160 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 146 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1978; 166 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 141 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1980; 164 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 142 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1982; 177 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 13 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1984; 239 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 227 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1986; 210 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 225 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1988; 165 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 148 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1990; 138 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 167 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 1992 <b>and</b> 270 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 62 <b>women</b> <b>in</b> 2005. Height <b>and</b> weight were measured by hospital staff. Mean BMI increased in the early 1990 s. Salt, coffee, cola, alcohol and meat consumption, dieting to lose weight and eating between meals were positively associated with BMI while physical activity, food variety, large breakfasts and consumption of spreads were negatively associated. Food consumption and daily activities have important associations with BMI, though their specific associations differ by sex. “Affluent” lifestyle patterns appear to contribute to higher BMI, while a more “prudent” lifestyle seems to protect from such increases...|$|R
5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense}} of subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|Between September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was {{seconded}} to the Foreign Service.

He then {{served as}} Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy See.

In 2006, the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, which is conferred on Roman Catholic <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labours, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in their communities and country.|$|E
5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, as <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E
