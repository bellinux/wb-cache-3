40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, the thermal mass flow meters {{have been widely}} used in several {{industries}} such as the petroleum refining industry, waste water processing and steeling making industry. I will call it “TMF” {{in the rest of the}} article. The TMF’ low-flow sensitivity and fast response have made them the first choice for many critical gas flow application. However, there are still some inadequacies in the TMF. Such as interruption among the wires, high cost of the installation and influenced by temperature. Some of the problem comes from its way of the connection [...] - four-wire connection. Two-wire connection can resolve some of these problems. In this thesis, the author presents a new type of two-wire installation and use of TMF which can be realized low production cost. The author found a new measurement method, which is detecting the functional relationship between working current of a traditional TMF and the flow.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{automated}} {{measurement of the}} hysteresis of the temperature-compensated inductance-to-frequency converter with a single quartz crystal is proposed. The new idea behind this method is a converter with two programmable analog switches enabling the automated <b>measurement</b> of the <b>converter</b> hysteresis, {{as well as the}} temperature compensation of the quartz crystal and any other circuit element. Also used is the programmable timing control device that allows the selection of different oscillating frequencies. In the proposed programmable method two different inductances connected in series to the quartz crystal are switched in a short time sequence, compensating the crystal’s natural temperature characteristics (in the temperature range between 0 and 50 °C). The procedure allows for the <b>measurement</b> of the <b>converter</b> hysteresis at various values of capacitance connected in parallel with the quartz crystal for the converter sensitivity setting at selected inductance. It, furthermore, enables the measurement of hysteresis at various values of inductance at selected parallel capacitance (sensitivity) connected to the quartz crystal. The article shows that the proposed hysteresis <b>measurement</b> of the <b>converter,</b> which converts the inductance in the range between 95 and 100 μH to a frequency in the range between 1 and 200 kHz, has only 7 × 10 − 13 frequency instability (during the temperature change between 0 and 50 °C) with a maximum 1 × 10 − 11 hysteresis frequency difference...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Rapid and {{accurate}} detection of pathogens using conductometric biosensors requires potentiostats that can measure small variations in conductance. In this paper, we present an architecture {{and implementation of}} a multichannel potentiostat array based on a novel semi-synchronous sigma–delta (61) analog-to-digital conversion algorithm. The algorithm combines continuous time 61 with time-encoding machines, and enables measurement of currents down to femtoampere range.

Measured results demonstrate that the prototype can achieve 10 bits of resolution, with a sensitivity down to 50 -fA current. The power consumption of the potentiostat has been measured to be 11 W per channel for a sampling rate of 250 kHz.
