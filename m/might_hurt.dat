5|$|Ten years later, J. D. Redding and {{his teenage}} {{daughter}} Tory rent the O'Grady farmhouse for the summer. Contract workers Nathan Murphy, his 12-year-old brother Alex, and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re-paint the farmhouse. While {{looking around the}} basement, Ozzie hears the leprechaun's cry for help and mistakes him for a little child. He brushes the old four-leaf clover off the crate, freeing the leprechaun. After failing to convince the others that he met a leprechaun, Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it, believing he will find a pot of gold at the end. Alex accompanies him for fear Ozzie <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> himself. A bag of one hundred gold pieces magically appears before Ozzie. After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a piece, they stash it in an old well and plot to keep it for themselves, hoping to fix Ozzie's brain.|$|E

25|$|For the 1968 presidential election, LeMay {{originally}} supported former Republican Vice President Richard Nixon; {{he turned}} down two requests by former Alabama Governor George Wallace to join his newly formed American Independent Party, that year, {{on the grounds that}} a third-party candidacy <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> Nixon's chances at the polls. (By coincidence, Wallace had served as a sergeant in a unit commanded by LeMay during World War II).|$|E
25|$|What {{he did not}} {{describe}} in the book {{was that he had}} offered, if released, to take no more part in the campaign, nor give any information which <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> the Boer cause. Just to hedge his bets, he also attempted to get himself re-classified as a military prisoner, as he had heard of a possible exchange of military prisoners. The Boers regarded him as a significant prisoner, because of his initiative in attempting to get the train moving and allowing the engine to escape, because of his reputation as a war correspondent, and because he was a minor member of the aristocracy whose father {{had been a member of}} the British government. Nonetheless, it transpired that the authorities were seriously considering the possibility of accepting his offer to withdraw from the war, which later gave rise to accusations he had broken his agreement when he resumed reporting after his escape.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} party around 3 a.m., {{allegedly}} with bruises and blood stained clothes, Jackie called her three best friends, [...] "Andy", [...] "Randall" [...] and [...] "Cindy", for support. In Rolling Stones version, Jackie's friends discouraged her {{from going to}} the hospital to protect her reputation and because Andy and Randall planned to rush fraternities and worried their association with Jackie <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> their chances if she reported it. Erdely wrote that Randall was no longer friends with Jackie and, [...] "citing his loyalty to his own frat, declined to be interviewed".|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Muhammad {{has long}} been {{featured}} {{as one of the}} many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy. When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, [...] "We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> us. Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't hurt us, but we won't rip on [...] because they <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> us.'" [...] The Muhammad subplot in [...] "200", like the [...] "Cartoon Wars" [...] episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo. [...] "200" [...] also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children. The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored.|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{had a good}} opening week, and {{tickets were}} {{reportedly}} selling for many times the original cost at some locations. Total gross collections were an Indian record of [...] ( [...] nett) for its opening week. Krrish became the second-highest-grossing film of 2006, earning over [...] 690million nett in India alone, and was classified as a [...] "Blockbuster" [...] by Box Office India. It also grossed $4,320,000 in the overseas market, where it was declared a [...] "hit".

500|$|Ice later {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing. Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> his reputation. Rather than being dissuaded, their fear encouraged Robinson who agreed to work with Ice. In an interview, Robinson stated [...] "It's the most punk-rock thing you could do." [...] Despite not being happy with his old image, Winkle stated that {{he never had a}} problem with his older music. Ice decided against changing his stage name to something else, as he felt no need to run from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the latter}} part of Speer's imprisonment, Wolters was a {{faithful}} correspondent, writing lengthy letters to Speer at least once a month, attempting to tell Speer everything that might interest him but nothing that <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> him. [...] When Speer invented the concept of his [...] "world wide walk", imagining his daily exercise around the prison yard to be segments in a long walk from Europe through Asia to North America, Wolters supplied Speer with details of what he would [...] "see". [...] Speer later stated, [...] "In a manner of speaking, Rudi Wolters accompanied me on these walks." [...] As midnight struck and October 1, 1966 began, Speer was released from Spandau Prison. [...] His last use of the clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to Wolters, in which Speer jokingly asked Wolters to pick him up thirty-fivekilometres south of Guadalajara, Mexico, which he had [...] "reached" [...] after walking 31,936kilometres.|$|E
500|$|In June 2007, {{after two}} weeks of protests, some DePaul {{students}} staged a sit-in and hunger strike in support of both professors denied tenure. [...] The Illinois Conference of the American Association of University Professors also {{sent a letter to the}} university's president stating: [...] "It is entirely illegitimate for a university to deny tenure to a professor out of fear that his published research ... <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> a college's reputation" [...] and that the association has [...] "explicitly rejected collegiality as an appropriate criterion for evaluating faculty members". In a 2014 interview, professor Matthew Abraham, author of Out of Bounds: Academic Freedom and the Question of Palestine, described the Finkelstein tenure case as [...] "one of the most significant academic freedom cases in the last fifty years", claiming the case demonstrated [...] "the substantial pressure outside parties can place on a mid-tier religious institution when the perspectives advanced by a controversial scholar threaten dominant interests".|$|E

500|$|At 10 Downing Street {{in early}} September 1964, impasse {{developed}} between Douglas-Home and Smith over {{the best way}} to measure black public opinion in Southern Rhodesia. A key plank of Britain's Southern Rhodesia policy was that the terms for independence had to be [...] "acceptable {{to the people of the}} country as a whole"—agreeing to this, Smith suggested that white and urban black opinion could be gauged through a general referendum of registered voters, and that rural black views could be obtained at a national indaba (tribal conference) of chiefs and headmen. Douglas-Home told Smith that although this proposal satisfied him personally, he could not accept it as he did not believe the Commonwealth, the United Nations or the Labour Party would also do so. He stressed that such a move towards accommodation with Smith <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> the Conservatives' chances in the British general election the next month, and suggested that it might be in Smith's best interests to wait until after the election to continue negotiations. Smith accepted this argument. Douglas-Home assured Smith that a Conservative government would settle with him and grant independence within a year.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, {{there were}} plans to {{demolish}} the monument, although little written evidence is available to historians and research is largely based on oral testimony. On September 29, 1949 (although according to oral testimony, the issue was first raised as early as October 1944) the Council of People's Commissars of the Latvian SSR proposed {{the restoration of the}} statue of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great. [...] While they did not expressly call for the demolition of the Freedom Monument, the only way to restore the statue to its original position would have been to tear down the monument. The result of the debate is unrecorded, but since the monument still stands the proposition was presumably rejected. The Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina (1889–1953; designer of the monumental sculpture Worker and Kolkhoz Woman) is sometimes credited with the rescue of the monument, although there is no written evidence to support the fact. According to her son, she took part in a meeting where the fate of the monument was discussed, at which her opinion, as reported by her son, was that the monument was of very high artistic value and that its demolition <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> the most sacred feelings of the Latvian people.|$|E
500|$|Urobuchi {{attributed}} {{his past}} experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and Yōsuke Kuroda {{as a major}} influence in his writing for Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and has referred {{to both of them}} as his mentors. To set the initial pacing of the series, Urobuchi used a technique he credited as originally from Kuroda. The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context, the second episode would then define the particular rules governing the story's setting, and the third episode would be responsible for divulging the revelation in the plot so as to hook the viewer. The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involved the death of Mami, a main character figure. This decision was controversial, and Urobuchi recalled production staff members continually approaching him and asking him to reconsider due to their own fondness for the character. However, he refused and the plot remained unchanged during production. Nevertheless, Urobuchi realized that this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> the overall series' success with some audiences, commenting: [...] "I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing, like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Lisa visits Smithers, {{owner of}} the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection, and asks for help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974. Lisa bikes to Lovell's house and plays one of the doll's phrases over the intercom. The gate {{immediately}} opens. Lisa and Lovell decide {{to create a new}} talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy have a meeting in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, as kids, and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them that it is just the same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was able to get through to at least one little girl.|$|E
500|$|Growing up {{a fan of}} Disney films, Murphy {{had never}} wanted to play a princess, preferring {{characters}} who were adventurous and [...] "drove the action" [...] instead. In the actress' opinion, villains {{continue to be the}} most dynamic characters in Disney films. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney villain as a [...] "juicy" [...] experience, Murphy explained that this is because these characters are [...] "not bound by ethics or moral codes or concern for what someone thinks or how it <b>might</b> <b>hurt</b> someone else", providing actors with more freedom. Upon her first session, Murphy appreciated the directors for exposing her to early concepts and ideas about Gothel. However, Murphy was not provided with a complete script because [...] "They’re very protective about that." [...] Murphy was directed to lower the pitch of her voice in favor of demonstrating a rather [...] "flat" [...] sound. Although Murphy did not base her own performance on any one individual in particular, she admitted to Babble that she was somewhat inspired by Betty Lou Gerson's performance as Cruella de Vil in Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Comparing voice acting to Broadway, Murphy commented that, in animation, [...] "You’re recording and you’re discovering it and giving the performance all at the same time. It’s not like you have three weeks rehearsal." [...] Additionally, Murphy never worked with co-star Mandy Moore, voice of Rapunzel; instead, Murphy revealed that scenes with Gothel and Rapunzel were actually recorded opposite one of the directors impersonating Moore, who also explained to Murphy that Gothel's design will continue to evolve as the character begins to adapt the actress' mannerisms. Howard enthused that Murphy [...] "nailed" [...] Gothel, admitting to ultimately using 90% of the actress' original material and takes because [...] "The character just came right to life when she came in." ...|$|E
