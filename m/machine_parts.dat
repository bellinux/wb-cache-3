5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces.

Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E

25|$|Many sculptors seek {{new ways}} and {{materials}} to make art. One of Pablo Picasso's most famous sculptures included bicycle parts. Alexander Calder and other modernists made spectacular use of painted steel. Since the 1960s, acrylics and other plastics {{have been used}} as well. Andy Goldsworthy makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as ice sculpture, sand sculpture, and gas sculpture, is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used stained glass, tools, <b>machine</b> <b>parts,</b> hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use found objects, and Chinese scholar's rocks have been appreciated for many centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the soft core, while <b>machine</b> <b>parts</b> like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E

25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling <b>machine</b> <b>parts,</b> moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.|$|E
25|$|The Sino-Albanian split left Albania with {{no foreign}} benefactor. Albania ignored calls by the United States and the Soviet Union to {{normalize}} relations. Instead, Albania expanded diplomatic ties with Western Europe and the developing nations and began stressing {{the principle of}} self-reliance as the keystone of the country's strategy for economic development. Albania, however, didn't have many resources of its own, and Hoxha's cautious opening toward the outside world wasn't enough to bolster the economy, which stirred up nascent movements for change inside Albania. Without Chinese or Soviet aid, the country began to experience widespread shortages in everything from <b>machine</b> <b>parts</b> to wheat and animal feed. Infrastructure and living standards began to collapse. According to the World bank, Albania netted around US$750 in gross national product per capita {{throughout much of the}} 1980s. As Hoxha's health slipped, muted calls arose for the relaxation of party controls and greater openness. In response, Hoxha launched a fresh series of purges that removed the defense minister and many top military officials. A year later, Hoxha purged ministers responsible for the economy and replaced them with younger people.|$|E
