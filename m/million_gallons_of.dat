5|$|Harveys Creek and its {{tributary}} Pikes Creek {{are used}} by the Pennsylvania American Water Company Ceasetown as a water supply for part or all of 15 municipalities and communities, including Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, Shickshinny, and others. As of 2002, the creeks supply 67,500 people with water. Pennsylvania American Water Company Ceasetown is permitted to take 16 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water per day from them.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water {{when it is not}} raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 4.03 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water per day are {{withdrawn}} from Toby Creek and its tributaries. 3.38 million gallons per day (84 percent) are removed by registered water suppliers and 0.51 million gallons per day (13 percent) are removed for {{commercial and industrial}} purposes. 0.10 million gallons per day (2 percent) are removed for mineral purposes and 0.04 million gallons per day (1 percent) are removed for residential purposes. A reservoir known as the Huntsville Reservoir {{is located in the}} watershed of Toby Creek. It has a capacity of approximately 1.915 billion gallons.|$|E

5|$|Exxon Valdez {{departed}} {{the port}} of Valdez, Alaska at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|E
5|$|He left Third Mate Gregory Cousins {{in charge}} of the {{navigation}} bridge and Able Seaman Robert Kagan at the helm with instructions from the third mate to return to the southbound traffic lane in the TSS at a prearranged point. Exxon Valdez failed to return to the shipping lanes and struck Bligh Reef at around 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989. The accident resulted in the discharge of around 11 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> oil, 20% of the cargo, into Prince William Sound.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of wetland {{complexes}} in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook. These include Bear Swamp (which is at the stream's headwaters), Simerson Marsh, and Little Virginia. The first of these is a Pocono wetland bog. Lakes in the watershed include Lake Scranton, the District Number Fifty-Nine Reservoir, the Williams Bridge Reservoir, and Hazard Pond. Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply, with the former providing 22 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water per day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides {{a substantial portion of the}} water supply of the Lackawanna Valley. Downstream of Lake Scranton, the watershed contains a lake used by the Montage Mountain Ski Resort for snowmaking.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{production}} at the plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Bird, {{the eldest}} son of Premier Vere Bird, first entered {{politics}} in 1981 when he served as an unelected security official during the general election. In the following election in 1984, Bird and his brother Lester were both elected to the House of Representatives after the Antigua Labour Party, led by their father, took 16 of the 17 House seats. Bird himself was victorious over George Walter, leader of the Progressive Labour Movement and former Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, gaining 912 votes to Walter's 358. Upon election, with his father as Prime Minister, {{he was given the}} Ministry of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As Minister he visited Dominica {{at the head of a}} four-person delegation that was dispatched to reach a deal on selling Antigua and Barbuda, a country lacking natural supplies, water. This business was concluded on 16 July 1984, when it was announced that Dominica would sell Antigua and Barbuda 2 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water every 10 days, at a cost of around 3 US dollars per thousand gallons.|$|E

5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to private development, several joint-development affordable housing projects {{have recently been}} constructed along the Metrorail line {{with the intent of}} increasing ridership through transit-oriented development. These projects include Santa Clara apartments, Brownsville Transit Village, and The Beacon, which is located near Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station in Downtown Miami. The headquarters of Miami-Dade Transit, also located next to Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station, is known as the Overtown Transit Village. Brownsville Transit Village, opening in March 2012, was visited by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lisa P. Jackson, on January 5, 2012 to tour the 490-unit development, which will save an estimated five <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water and $50,000 annually in utility bills due to environmentally sustainable plumbing fixtures. Nonetheless, by 2016, Brownsville and Santa Clara were still the lowest ridership stations, the only ones to regularly post ridership numbers below 1,000 daily. In general, stations to the north of Civic Center see much lower ridership, on average one-third of stations from Civic Center south. They are mostly in industrial areas with low population density and little development, as well as stagnant or declining populations, such as Gladeview and Brownsville. Additionally, stations to the north of Earlington Heights are only served by one line, giving them much longer headways.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E

5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
