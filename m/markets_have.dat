5|$|Lexus sales {{operations}} vary {{in structure}} by region. In many markets, {{such as the}} U.S., the dealership network is a distinct organization from corporate headquarters, with separately owned and operated Lexus showrooms. By contrast, in Japan all 143 dealerships {{in the country are}} owned and operated by Lexus. Several <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> a designated, third party regional distributor; for example, in the United Arab Emirates, sales operations are managed by Al-Futtaim Motors LLC, and in Costa Rica, Lexus vehicles are sold via regional distributor Purdy Motors S.A. Other officially sanctioned regional distributors have sold Lexus models prior to the launch of, or in absence of, a dedicated dealership network.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{the evolution}} of the longevity risk transfer market with the development of the Catastrophe Bond Market, more formally known as the Insurance Linked Securities (ILS) Market. The ILS market is small; the longevity market is potentially enormous. The ILS <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been around for some 15 years; the Longevity market less than 5 years. The ILS <b>market</b> <b>has</b> had a heterogeneous approach to loss measures; the longevity <b>market</b> <b>has</b> striven for homogeneity. The ILS <b>market</b> <b>has</b> used security, i. e. bond, structures; the longevity market uses derivative, i. e. swap, structures. Nearly all ILS transactions cover “event” risk; nearly all longevity structures are “aggregate”.
