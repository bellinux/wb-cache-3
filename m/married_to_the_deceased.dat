This {{marriage}} took place {{nearly two months}} after João Maria Ferreira do Amaral was killed. She did this to legitimize their son Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral and their daughter Joana Teresa de Albuquerque, Maria Helena de Albuquerque, 1st Baroness of Oliveira Lima (Funchal, São Pedro, 1817 - Lisbon, 6 June 1909).

50|$|The scene cuts {{back to the}} past, where Lu Dieyu {{was shown}} to be {{pregnant}} with Huo Lianqi's child {{on the night of}} their consummation. Despite being <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> second son of the family, the family thought that it is strange that she is pregnant as the physician deduced that the child was supposedly conceived on the night of marriage. The eldest son, Huo Lianxiu (also Francis) however, allowed for her to kept her child. Lu Dieyu was then moved to the basement of the mansion to await her pregnancy. Lu Dieyu was seen to be continuously writing letters back-and-forth to Huo Lianqi, even after her daughter was born, she continued writing and receiving letters from Huo Lianqi but he was not seen to have returned to the mansion, writing in one of his letters that he's studying abroad and will return once he's graduated.|$|E

50|$|While Babur lay at Kunduz an embassy {{arrived from}} Shah Ismail {{bringing}} the Emperor's sister Khanzada Begum with rich presents and tenders of amity. Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister, {{who had been}} imprisoned by and forced <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> <b>the</b> recently <b>deceased</b> Muhammad Shaybani. Ismail also provided Babur with a large wealth of luxury goods and military assistance, for which Babur reciprocated by adopting the dress and outward customs of the Persians. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail I would form a partnership {{in an attempt to}} take over parts of Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) in Central Asia.|$|R
25|$|Babur and the {{remaining}} Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership {{in an attempt to}} take over parts of Central Asia. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted <b>the</b> Safavids <b>to</b> act as a suzerain over him and his followers. Thus, in 1513, after leaving his brother Nasir Mirza to rule Kabul, he managed to take Samarkand for the third time; he also took Bokhara but lost both again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Uzbeks. Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister Khānzāda, who had been imprisoned by and forced <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> <b>the</b> recently <b>deceased</b> Shaybani. Babur returned to Kabul after three years in 1514. The following 11 years of his rule mainly involved dealing with relatively insignificant rebellions from Afghan tribes, his nobles and relatives, in addition to conducting raids across the eastern mountains. Babur began to modernise and train his army despite it being, for him, relatively peaceful times.|$|R
40|$|The case of Fidel Ochoa Urquijo (deceased), Rosa Elda Velasquez (alleged widow) et al. v. Reidhead Enterprises and State Compensation Fund, {{decided by}} the Industrial Commission of Arizona in 1981, {{considers}} whether a woman, recognized as a surviving concubine under {{the laws of the}} Republic of Mexico, is entitled to widow 2 ̆ 7 s benefits under the Workmen 2 ̆ 7 s Compensation Act of the State of Arizona (the Arizona Act) upon the death of her Mexican national 2 ̆ 2 husband, 2 ̆ 2 when that death arose out of {{and in the course of}} his legal employment with an Arizona employer. Under Mexican law, a surviving concubine of an existing concubinage is entitled to receive the same survival benefits as a woman legally <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> at the, time of death. Based solely upon the wording of the birth certificates of the deceased 2 ̆ 7 s two children (born of different mothers) which described the eldest as 2 ̆ 2 legitimate 2 ̆ 2 and the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s child as 2 ̆ 2 natural 2 ̆ 2, the administrative law judge ruled that the deceased was presumed to be married to the mother of the eldest child and found no documentary proof of the dissolution of this marriage. Since by Mexican law a state of concubinacy cannot arise if there is a prior existing marriage, the judge ruled that there was no subsequent, valid concubinage between the claimant and the deceased in the Republic of Mexico; the claimant was, therefore, entitled to no benefits. The judge considered two further arguments in the case. First, he concluded that a Mexican concubine could not be equated with a 2 ̆ 2 widow, spouse or wife 2 ̆ 2 of a deceased employee under the Arizona Act, even though a common-law marriage, valid in the jurisdiction where consummated, is recognized as valid in Arizona for the purposes of the Arizona Act. Secondly, it was determined that a valid concubinage offends the public policy of the State of Arizona, primarily because it lacks the stability of both a ceremonial marriage and a recognized common-law marriage since, under Mexican law, a concubinage is terminable at the will of either of the parties. Because this case was not appealed beyond the level of the administrative law judge, these issues are both unresolved and unreported in the State of Arizona...|$|E
40|$|Muslim {{marriages are}} not {{recognised}} in South African civil law, {{as they are}} potentially polygamous. In the recent Western Cape High Court decision of Faro v Bingham the position of Muslim spouses in Islamic marriages and the consequences thereof again came to the fore. The non-recognition of Muslim marriages has resulted in hardships for Muslim spouses in areas of marriage, devolvement of marriage by divorce or death, maintenance rights and inheritance law. In comparing the South African law with Muslim personal law there {{are found to be}} fundamental differences between the two systems with regard to the rights granted to civil law spouses in marriage and divorce. Muslim spouses are often the innocent victims of the social and psychological effects of polygamy. While a secular court grants a civil divorce the Islamic law of divorce is practically administered by Islamic organisations such as the Muslim Judicial Council. The draft Muslim Marriages Bill (2010) was published for commentary in January 2011. The Bill constitutes an attempt to reconcile the classical Islamic law with the constitutional values. Since its publication nothing has been done to speed up the process, due to constitutional and religious turmoil between women's rights activists and traditionalists. While it is uncertain if, and when, the bill will be accepted, the judiciary (secular courts) has increasingly recognised some of the legal consequences of Muslim marriages on a case-by-case basis. However, the Muslim marriage has not been formally accepted by the courts as a valid union in terms of the Marriage Act 25 of 1961. In the Faro case an action was brought against the executrix of the deceased's estate by the surviving spouse to enable her to inherit intestate from the deceased and to claim maintenance from the deceased's estate. The pertinent question was whether she was still <b>married</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> or if he had divorced her through presenting the talaq. The court was asked, inter alia, to regard marriages solemnised according to tenets of Islamic law to be valid marriages in terms of the Marriages Act. The position and role of the Muslim Judicial Council and the Master were questioned when dealing with factual disputes. The court granted her relief on her status as a widow, but postponed certain prayers giving the legislator another opportunity to promulgate legislation regarding Muslim marriages. The court set a deadline to the legislator to urgently report back on the enactment of the draft Muslim Marriages Bill. [URL]...|$|E
5000|$|An Odia Hindu wedding, or bahaghara (ଓଡ଼ିଆ ବାହାଘର), is {{a wedding}} {{ceremony}} performed by Odia Hindu {{people in the}} Indian state of Odisha. There are subtle differences in the rites observed by different castes. In the Odia marriage rituals mother of the bridegroom does not {{take part in the}} ceremony. The Utkala Brahmins have their weddings only in the daytime, preferably mid day or mornings, while the other caste weddings are done during the evening or night. There is the custom of sending betel nuts to family friends for inviting them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marriage. The first invitation is sent to Jagannath as a respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lord. Marriages in Odisha are mostly fixed and arranged by the parents. Marriages for serving or capturing is not common. In the Odia community widow remarriage is allowed in some lower caste, in this case the younger brother is allowed <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> brother's wife. [...] The marriage happens in three major rituals, Nirbandha (fixing the marriage), Bahaghara (wedding) and Chauthi/Chaturthi (consummation). A marriage is not considered complete or valid until consummation. These rituals are performed either at the Duara (bride's house) or Tola kanias house. (Bridegroom's residence).|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the expulsion in 1492, the Sephardic expellees in the Ottoman Empire developed a unique interpretation of levirate marriage (yibbum), a commandment obligating the brother {{of a man who has}} died without an heir <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> widow. Heavily influenced by Iberian kabbala, the emerging Ottoman Sephardic yibbum discourse emphasized the extreme importance of reproduction and evinced an egalitarian social imagination. How can we explain the unique qualities of the expellees' yibbum discourse? In the past, scholars explained the emergence and nature of postexilic kabbalistic discourses by arguing that the expulsion was a traumatic catastrophe that led <b>the</b> desperate expellees <b>to</b> develop messianic theology. Others argued that the increased mobility of the expellees brought together previously isolated kabbalists in new intellectual communities that produced novel religious discourses. I suggest we shed additional light on the yibbum discourse, in particular, and the relationship between the expulsion and <b>the</b> turn <b>to</b> kabbala, in general, by approaching the expellees not merely as traumatized or passive recipients of the kabbalists' cultural production, but instead as agents shaping a communal and spiritual identity to suit their new social context. Deprived of established social structures and institutions, the impoverished expellees developed kabbalistic discourses that directly addressed their social predicament. These discourses displayed an egalitarian sense of communal identity and emphasized the extreme importance of the expellees' few assets, their offspring. In this context, <b>the</b> turn <b>to</b> kabbala after 1492 was not an attempt <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> harsh realities of the expulsion or a top-down dissemination of elite theology, but rather a communal effort <b>to</b> directly address <b>the</b> diasporic reali...|$|R
40|$|Despite an {{historical}} tendency among psychologists to pathologize continuing attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased,</b> scholars of grief {{have come to}} appreciate that maintaining a connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> can be a healthy part of bereavement.
