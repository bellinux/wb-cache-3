25|$|After Yellow Tavern, Sheridan led {{his troops}} southward towards Richmond on May 11, {{carefully}} feeling {{his way through}} the abandoned outer defensive works.

25|$|Although {{his army}} was {{supposed}} to join that of Washington's in Pennsylvania, Lee set a very slow pace.

The next morning, a British patrol of two dozen mounted soldiers found Lee writing letters in his dressing gown, and captured him.

25|$|On July 27, 2016, {{a federal}} judge ruled that Hinckley {{would be allowed to}} be {{released}} from St. Elizabeth's on August 5, as he was no longer considered a threat to himself or others.

He will live with his 90-year-old mother and be restricted to a 50-mile zone around her home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and will live full-time at his mother's home. As part of his release, he is excluded from speaking to the press, has to work three days a week, can drive no more than 30 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mother's home or 50 miles if attended, and must see a psychiatrist twice a month.|$|E
25|$|On May 11, 1864, Sheridan and his Union cavalry force, on {{the second}} day of a daring raid against Richmond, {{defeated}} Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at the Battle of Yellow Tavern, mortally wounding the storied Confederate cavalier. Sheridan led his troops southward towards Richmond, carefully feeling his way through the abandoned outer defensive works. As darkness fell, a severe thunderstorm drenched the column, but Sheridan kept up his movement down the Brook Pike, not realizing that he was boxing himself into a potential trap. Confederates had left torpedoes (land mines) in the roadmany exploded during the passage, killing several horses but not delaying the column further. As dawn broke and the storm subsided, Sheridan found himself only two and half <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> objective. However, to his dismay, the intermediate defenses in his front swarmed with enemy troops. His left flank was against the swollen Chickahominy, and Confederate cavalry threatened his rear, hoping to capture the Union force.|$|E
25|$|For the 1829 {{campaign}} on the Danube, Tsar Nicholas dismissed the ailing Wittgenstein and handed the Russian command to his more aggressive compatriot, Count von Diebitsch, who succeeded in capturing Silistra and then surprised the Ottomans with a high-speed drive for the Ottoman capital Constantinople (Istanbul), bypassing Shumla and routing an Ottoman army sent to intercept him. In September 1829, with the Russian army camped just 40 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> palace, the Sultan was forced to capitulate. By the Treaty of Adrianople, he conceded {{a long list of}} Russian demands, one of which was acceptance of Greek autonomy as defined in the Treaty of London. However, Tsar Nicholas and his ministers were careful to refrain from the more extreme demands advocated by Russian nationalists, such as a Russian military occupation of the Straits or annexation of the Romanian principalities, that would risk war with Great Britain and Austria. As a consequence, London and Vienna were relieved that the outcome was not worse and reluctantly acquiesced in Russia's strategic gains.|$|E
50|$|While {{in prison}} for the murder of his mother, Daniel Thomas Tavares Junior sent a {{threatening}} letter to one of the prison staff indirectly claiming responsibility for the Highway Killings.

25|$|In November 1978, {{the body}} of truck driver J.T. McGarry, who had been shot {{multiple}} times, was found over 25 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> Ventura County home. Michael Hanline was suspected of having murdered him, {{with the help of}} an accomplice, because he and McGarry had both been involved with the same woman. Largely on this woman's testimony, Hanline was sentenced to life without parole in 1980. Soon after the CIP was established in 1999, the organization received correspondence from Hanline claiming his innocence. The CIP spent years investigating this case. They eventually discovered that a since-deceased attorney named Bruce Robertson had attempted to implicate Hanline in order to direct suspicion away from his own clients, and had intimidated potential witnesses. A witness had even placed Robertson at McGarry's home on the night of his murder. In addition, DNA testing pointed to Hanline's innocence, and it was established that the woman who testified against him had been on drugs, both on the night of the murder and at the time of her testimony. On November 24, 2014, Hanline was released from Ventura County Court a free man, and in April of the following year, a judge dismissed all charges against him, as the district attorney had decided not to retry the case. Having served 36 years behind bars, Hanline was the longest-incarcerated person whose conviction was reversed in the history of the State of California.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the conflict, Kenyatta was {{becoming}} restless and frustrated by the distance between him and Kenya. To Edna, he stated that he felt [...] "like a general separated by 5000 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> troops". While in Sussex, he wrote an essay for the United Society for Christian Literature, My People of Kikuyu and the Life of Chief Wangombe, in which he called for his tribe's political independence. He also began—although never finished—a novel partly based on his life experiences. He continued to give lectures around the country, including to groups of East African soldiers stationed in Britain.|$|E

The B-17 crash landed in the sea. Two of the crew were killed, but the rest made it to shore, and thence to Del Monte Field. Only one B-17, piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease, reached Del Monte, and this B-17 was in poor condition, with no brakes and a faulty supercharger. Sharp ordered it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease made the return trip, carrying sixteen passengers.|$|E
