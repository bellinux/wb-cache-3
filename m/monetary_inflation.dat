25|$|A {{negative}} balance of payments, growing public debt incurred by the Vietnam War and Great Society programs, and <b>monetary</b> <b>inflation</b> by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued. The drain on US gold reserves culminated with the London Gold Pool collapse in March 1968. By 1970, the U.S. had seen its gold coverage deteriorate from 55% to 22%.

At the same time, the Bank of India was permitted to treat those credits as assets against which it could print currency up to {{two and a half times}} more than the total debt incurred. India's money printing presses then began running overtime, printing the currency that paid for all these massive defence expenditures. The tremendous rise in nominal money supply spurred <b>monetary</b> <b>inflation,</b> reaching its peak in 1944â€“45. The accompanying rise in incomes and purchasing power fell disproportionately into the hands of industries in Calcutta (in particular, munitions industries).|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} per capita income growth {{at the end of}} the 18th century may appear as a counterargument against the modernity of the Dutch economy. However, at closer {{inspection}} this was actually a modern process of restructuring in the face of adverse circumstances, as may be seen in current modern economies, like the United States and European countries, that also undergo major structural upheavals. The 18th-century deindustrialization was in large part a consequence of a too-high real wage level, combined with protectionist policies of foreign governments, closing access to major markets. The agricultural depression was a general European phenomenon. The crisis in foreign trade was answered, and partly parried, with commercial innovations. The financial and fiscal crisis that proved the Republic's undoing was altogether modern in nature (unlike the comparable crises that regularly brought the Spanish Crown to its knees), but simply happened before the modern means of dealing with it (expansion of the tax base and/or <b>monetary</b> <b>inflation)</b> were at hand.|$|E

Thus Paul argues that government, via a central bank (the Federal Reserve), is the primary cause of economic recessions and depressions.

40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} (IT) is {{a relatively}} new monetary policy framework for low-income countries (LICs). The limited number of LICs with an IT framework and the short time that has elapsed since the adoption of this framework explains why there are no previous empirical studies on the performance of IT in LICs. This paper has made a first attempt at filling this gap. It finds that inflation targeting appears to be associated with lower inflation and inflation volatility. At the same time, there is no robust evidence of an adverse impact on output. This may explain the appeal of IT for many LICs, where building credibility of monetary policy is difficult and minimizing output costs of reducing inflation is imperative for social and political reasons.

40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} (IT) {{serves as}} monetary policy framework in several advanced economies, {{where it has}} enhanced policy transparency and accountability. The paper considers its wider applicability to developing countries. The prerequisites for a successful IT framework are identified as an ability to carry out an independent monetary policy (free of fiscal dominance or commitment to another nominal anchor, like the exchange rate) and a quantitative framework linking policy instruments to inflation. These prerequisites are largely absent among developing countries, though several of them could with some further institutional changes and an overriding commitment to low inflation make use of an IT framework. <b>Inflation</b> targeting;Developing countries;inflation, <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>inflation</b> target, central bank, rate of <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> base, price stability, monetary authorities, monetary policy framework, independent <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>inflation</b> tax, <b>monetary</b> regime, <b>inflation</b> performance, inflation rate, inflation tax rate, real interest rates, inflation targeting framework, high inflation, low <b>inflation,</b> <b>inflation</b> forecasts, <b>monetary</b> stability, monetary fund, monetary economics, monetary regimes, nominal variables, <b>inflation</b> objective, <b>monetary</b> aggregate, foreign currency, aggregate demand, inflationary pressures, price level, real interest rate, reserve requirements, monetary policy instruments, annual inflation, inflation process, rates of inflation, costs of <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> reform, monetary balances, money market, monetary policy regimes, monetary financing, monetary policies, money demand, high rates of inflation, terms of trade, money supply, monetary transmission mechanism, monetary standards, monetary policy frameworks, monetary instruments, monetary policy rules, monetary policy objectives, monetary transmission, reduction of <b>inflation,</b> domestic <b>monetary</b> policy, control of inflation, effects of <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> expansion, forecasting <b>inflation,</b> discount rate, real variables, <b>inflation</b> stabilization, <b>monetary</b> targeting, low rate of inflation, lower inflation, quasi money, inflation dynamics, moderate inflation, independent central bank, nominal interest rate, monetary aggregates, <b>monetary</b> objectives, <b>inflation</b> targeting regime, <b>monetary</b> theory, reduction in inflation, real rates, expansionary <b>monetary</b> policy, extreme <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> union, low levels of <b>inflation,</b> average <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> economists, high reserve requirements, <b>monetary</b> control, <b>inflation</b> crises, <b>monetary</b> policy reaction functions, demand for money, macroeconomic performance, measure of <b>inflation,</b> <b>inflation</b> rates, <b>monetary</b> program, real money, retail price index, <b>monetary</b> stance, high <b>inflation</b> episodes, money growth...|$|R
40|$|This paper classifies {{countries}} that define their monetary policy framework by an inflation target into full-fledged inflation targeters, eclectic inflation targeters and inflation targeting lite regimes. This classification {{is based on}} indicators of the clarity and credibility of the commitment to the inflation target. The three regimes {{can be viewed as}} corresponding to different welfare maximizing combinations of policy objectives, each conditional on a country''s "endowed" level of credibility. The credibility of the regimes is related empirically to structural differences. Policy implications are drawn, especially for emerging market countries aiming at full-fledged inflation targeting. <b>Inflation</b> targeting;Price stabilization;inflation, <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>inflation</b> target, central bank, price stability, financial stability, percent inflation, low inflation, inflation objective, <b>inflation</b> targeting regime, <b>monetary</b> regime, monetary aggregate, monetary fund, monetary policy framework, <b>monetary</b> framework, <b>inflation</b> rate, foreign exchange, open market operations, monetary economics, real interest rates, <b>monetary</b> objective, annual <b>inflation,</b> actual <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> target, monetary policy objectives, monetary program, money demand, independent monetary policy, inflation-targeting, increase in <b>inflation,</b> <b>inflation</b> performance, <b>monetary</b> policy frameworks, monetary policy implementation, money growth, annual inflation rate, national bank, open market operation, rates of inflation, inflationary expectations, rate of <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> instruments, <b>monetary</b> regimes, average <b>inflation,</b> effects of <b>inflation,</b> transitional <b>monetary</b> regime, <b>inflation</b> targeting framework, <b>monetary</b> policy regimes, lower <b>inflation,</b> variable <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> aggregate target, monetary targeting, monetary policies, actual rate of <b>inflation,</b> <b>monetary</b> aggregates, monetary stability, macroeconomic stability, monetary frameworks...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, much {{work has been}} geared toward solving the problem of time {{inconsistency}} in monetary policy and analyzing the coordination problem between fiscal and monetary policy. This paper provides {{a review of the}} theoretical background to these theories, while also focusing on their inherent problems. It concludes that while the literature makes a strong case for central bank independence, more work should be done in the area of determining the desirable degree of independence with a view to the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy.
