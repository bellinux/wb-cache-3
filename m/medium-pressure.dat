25|$|Lamps {{are either}} amalgam or <b>medium-pressure</b> lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high {{efficiencies}} (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1 W/cm power density (power {{per unit of}} arc length). Amalgam UV lamps are a higher-power version of low-pressure lamps. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly {{lower than that of}} traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2–3 W/cm. <b>Medium-pressure</b> UV lamps have a broad and pronounced peak-line spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30 W/cm³ or greater.|$|E
25|$|The UV lamps {{for water}} {{treatment}} consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254nm, or <b>medium-pressure</b> UV lamps that produce a polychromatic output from 200nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; {{it is either}} housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the <b>medium-pressure</b> chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure—by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under full system pressure and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the <b>medium-pressure</b> stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|E

The two ships had different fuel stores; Bismarck was designed to carry 3,200tons of fuel oil, but could store up to 6,400tons of fuel in a normal configuration; with extra fuel bunkers, the fuel carried could be increased up to 7,400tons. Tirpitz was designed to carry 3,000tons of fuel, and with additional bunkers, was able to store up to 7,780tons.

500|$|The Mogador-class ships {{retained}} the unit arrangement of their propulsion spaces used in earlier contre-torpilleurs. They used a new high-pressure Indret boiler rated at [...] While this gave more power for its weight and size, {{it proved to}} be fragile and difficult to maintain. Each set of Rateau-Bretagne geared turbines was rated at [...] and consisted of four main turbines, a high-pressure, a <b>medium-pressure</b> and two low-pressure with a reversing turbine in each of the main low-pressure turbine cases. There were also two small cruise turbines operating in parallel in each engine room. At low speeds, steam was directed to the cruise turbines, but at higher speeds it was diverted to the high-pressure turbine. At [...] the cruise turbines were decoupled entirely using a Vulcan clutch. This didn't work properly and several ship's captains recommended that the cruise turbines be deleted from future classes entirely. Each of the two shafts was driven by single reduction gearing. The port shaft was driven by the rear engine room and was significantly shorter than the starboard shaft which was driven by the forward engine room. This caused a significant disparity between the turning circle, depending on which direction the ship was turning.|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{arrangement}} on {{a compound}} engine {{is that the}} steam is first expanded {{in one or two}} high-pressure (HP) cylinder(s), then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts into a larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinder, (or two, - or more), thus extending the cycle. Thus the cylinders can be said to work in [...] "series" [...] as opposed to the normal arrangement of a simple-expansion locomotive where they work in [...] "parallel", the steam being expanded just once in any one cylinder. In order to balance piston thrusts of a compound, the HP:LP cylinder volume ratio has to be carefully determined, usually by increasing the LP cylinder diameter and/or by lengthening the stroke. [...] In non-condensing engines, the HP:LP volume ratio is usually 1:2¼. [...] On geared locomotives, cylinder volumes can be kept more or less identical by increasing LP piston speed. [...] Strictly speaking compound only stands for double-expansion, but the term is loosely applied to any multiple-expansion engine. The instances where railway locomotives have employed triple-expansion with steam going from high-pressure (HP) cylinder, to <b>medium-pressure</b> (MP) cylinder and finally to a low-pressure (LP) one are rare, but triple-expansion engines were very common in steamships in the late 19th/early 20th centuries.|$|E

50|$|The Arc has two sections: the Internal and External Zones. The Internal Zone, {{which is}} located on the inner side of the arc, {{adjacent}} to the Alboran Sea, mostly consists of high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic rocks. The External Zone, located on the outer side of the arc, is mostly made of sediments deposited on the passive margins of Africa and Iberia. These rocks became highly deformed during the westward emplacement of the hinterland of the subduction system, with some units in the External Rif having undergone <b>medium-pressure,</b> low-temperature metamorphism during the Oligocene. Flysch units from the Cretaceous to Early Miocene are located between the External and Internal Zones. These were folded and thrusted during the westward migration of the Internal Zones and can be interpreted as the palaeo-accretionary wedge of the subduction system that was active during the Lower and Middle Miocene.|$|E
50|$|The {{engines of}} the F103 series were a {{development}} of Daimler-Benz {{for a military}} project that never came into being. They were dubbed the Mitteldruckmotor (<b>medium-pressure</b> engines) because of their unusually high BMEP (mean effective pressure, as calculated from brake torque) values, {{which led to a}} good thermodynamic efficiency. The engines had spiral-formed intake channels that gave the fuel-air mixture a good swirl. The engine had Heron-type combustion chambers with broad squish bands, further enhancing the mixture swirl and aiding good combustion. These features made it possible to use very high compression ratios for the time. The initial engine version had a CR of 11.2 to 1 for 98 RON fuel and even the engines intended for 92 RON fuel had a CR of 9 to 1, which was a very unusually high value for the time.|$|E
