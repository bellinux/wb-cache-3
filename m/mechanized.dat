The 1st <b>Mechanized</b> Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a {{blocking}} force west of Khafji while the 5th <b>Mechanized</b> Division took the town. The 1st <b>Mechanized</b> and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th <b>Mechanized</b> Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mechanized</b> {{divisions}} {{were organized}} along the Soviet model with three <b>mechanized</b> infantry regiments, one tank regiment, {{and a full}} complement of 12,000 infantry soldiers, while the armored divisions were composed of 3 tank and one <b>mechanized</b> infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. The air defense regiments consisted of two anti-aircraft artillery battalions and one surface-to-air missile (SAM) battalion, each composed of several batteries. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of <b>mechanized</b> and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one multiple rocket launcher battalion, and one surface-to-surface missile battalion.|$|E

A {{study was conducted to}} identify the lowest cost between manual and <b>mechanize</b> technique in harvesting process. This research used questionnaire to set primary data and data from an estate in Sabah were collected as secondary data. In analyse data, method used were enterprise budget and partial budget. From the findings, it show that <b>mechanize</b> technique need lower cost of operation compared to manual technique by reduction of 16. 34 % per hectare. There was 25 % of reduction in labour energy and by using <b>mechanize</b> technique the productivity also increase. Reduction of total cost happen after changing in using from manual to <b>mechanize</b> technique. Manual technique estimated profit was lower than <b>mechanize</b> technique. Plantation can gain extra RM 1, 459. 81 per hectare of net income in promoting <b>mechanize</b> technique in harvesting Fresh Fruit Bunch. The study also show the cost-effectiveness of <b>mechanize</b> was higher than manual technique.

Between 14 and 17 March, the <b>Mechanized</b> Cavalry Regiment, transferred from the Albanian front, was gradually incorporated into the division: its Light Company formed the 19th Reconnaissance Group; its 1st Combat Company, with the 1st and 4th MG troops and the 1st and 4th Mortar Troops, formed the 191st <b>Mechanized</b> Regiment; its 2nd Combat Company, with the 2nd MG troop and the 2nd Mortar Troop, formed the 192nd <b>Mechanized</b> Regiment; and its 3rd Combat Company, with the 3rd MG troop and the 3rd Mortar Troop, formed the 193rd <b>Mechanized</b> Regiment.

In addition, the Pripyat Marshes and the Carpathian Mountains posed a serious challenge to the army group's northern and southern sections respectively. On 22 June, only the northern section of Army Group South attacked, but the terrain impeded their assault, giving the Soviet defenders ample time to react. The German 1st Panzer Group and 6th Army attacked and broke through the Soviet 5th Army. Starting {{on the night of}} 23 June, the Soviet 22nd and 15th <b>Mechanized</b> Corps attacked the flanks of the 1st Panzer Group from north and south respectively. Although intended to be concerted, Soviet tank units were sent in piecemeal due to poor coordination. The 22nd <b>Mechanized</b> Corp ran into the 1st Panzer Army's III Motorized Corps and was decimated, and its commander killed. The 1st Panzer Group bypassed much of the 15th <b>Mechanized</b> Corps, which engaged the German 6th Army's 297th Infantry Division, where it was defeated by antitank fire and Luftwaffe attacks. On 26 June, the Soviets launched another counterattack on the 1st Panzer Group from north and south simultaneously with the 9th, 19th and 8th <b>Mechanized</b> Corps, which altogether fielded 1649 tanks, and supported by the remnants of the 15th <b>Mechanized</b> Corps.
