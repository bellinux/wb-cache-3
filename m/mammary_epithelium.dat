40|$|Mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) has {{developed}} a strategy of exploitation of the immune response. It infects dendritic cells and B cells and requires this infection to establish an efficient chronic infection. This allows transmission of infection to the mammary gland, production in milk and infection {{of the next generation}} via lactation. The elaborate strategy developed by MMTV utilizes several key elements of the normal immune response. Starting with the infection and activation of dendritic cells and B cells leading to the expression of a viral superantigen followed by professional superantigen-mediated priming of naive polyclonal T cells by dendritic cells and induction of superantigen-mediated T cell B cell collaboration results in long-lasting germinal center formation and production of long-lived B cells that can later carry the virus to the <b>mammary</b> gland <b>epithelium.</b> Later in life it can induce transformation of <b>mammary</b> gland <b>epithelium</b> by integrating close to proto-oncogenes leading to their overexpression.

Normal human breast tissue, breast cancer cell lines, and 162 tumor samples of patients with primary unilateral invasive breast cancer were analyzed for ABCA 3 and ABCA 1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays.

In multivariate analysis, diminished ABCA 3 expression proved to be a significant, independent and adverse risk factor for tumor recurrence. ABCA 1 expression was associated with positive lymph nodes, but not significantly associated with tumor recurrence or breast cancer-specific survival.

Both groups were found to be homogeneous relative to age, menarche, body mass index, previous gestation, parity, breastfeeding, number of fibroadenomas, family history of breast cancer and tabagism. Median tumour size was 2. 0 cm and no relationship between proliferative activity and nodule diameter was observed. No typical pattern was observed in the expression of Ki- 67 in distinct nodules of the same patient. Average values for expression of Ki- 67 (per 1000 epithelial cells) in follicular and luteal phases were 27. 88 and 37. 88, respectively (P = 0. 116).

50|$|Functions of MTA3 are {{believed}} to be differentially regulated in the context of cancer-types. For example, MTA3 expression is downregulated in breast cancer and endometrioid adenocarcinomas. MTA3 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and human placenta and chorionic carcinoma cells. In breast cancer, loss of MTA3 promotes EMT and invasiveness of breast cancer cells via upregulating Snail, which in turn represses E-cadherin adhesion molecule. In the <b>mammary</b> <b>epithelium</b> and breast cancer cells, MTA3 is an estrogen regulated gene and part of a larger regulatory network involving MTA1 and MTAs, all modifiers of hormone response, and participate in the processes involved in growth and differentiation. Accordingly, the MTA3-NuRD complex regulates the expression of Wnt4 in mammary epithelial cells and mice, and controls Wnt4-dependent ductal morphogenesis.|$|E
50|$|There are two known isoforms of SIM2 which play {{different}} roles in various tissues. The isoform SIM2 Short (SIM2s) {{has been shown}} to be specifically expressed in mammary gland tissue. SIM2s is a splice variant which lacks exon 11 of SIM2. It has been researched that SIM2s acts in mammary gland development and has tumor suppressive characteristics specifically in breast cancer. In a mouse specimen, when SIM2s was not expressed in mammary epithelial cells there were development defects leading to cancer-like characteristics in the cells. The defects were increased cell proliferation, cellular invasion of local stroma, loss of cellular polarity, and loss of E-cadherin cellular adhesion molecules. These observations suggest that SIM2s is essential for proper mammary gland development. Experiments reintroducing SIM2s in human breast cancer cells allowed for the tumor suppressive characteristics to be observed. Comparing normal human breast cells to human breast cancer cells with immunohistochemical staining showed that SIM2s was expressed more in the normal than the cancerous. Reintroducing SIM2s expression in breast cancer cells showed a decrease in growth, proliferation, and invasiveness. SIM2s represses the actions of the matrix metalloprotease-3 gene (MMP3) which include cell migration, cancer progression, and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT). SIM2s also represses the SLUG transcription factor which in turn suppresses EMT. EMT suppression allows for E-cadherin to remain and for the cell to not undergo pathological EMT associated with tumor formation. These actions show the tumor suppressive effects of SIM2s in <b>mammary</b> <b>epithelium.</b>|$|E

Here we explore how these genes act together in mammary gland initiation. We compared expression of Tbx 3, the gene associated with the human condition ulnar–mammary syndrome, expression of the gene encoding the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase Pyst 1 /MKP 3, which is an early response to FGFR 1 signalling (as judged by sensitivity to the SU 5402 inhibitor), and expression of Lef 1, encoding a transcription factor mediating Wnt signalling and the earliest gene so far known to be expressed in mammary gland development. We found that Tbx 3 is expressed earlier than Lef 1 and that Pyst 1 is also expressed early but only transiently. Patterns of expression of Tbx 3, Pyst 1 and Lef 1 in different glands suggest that the order of mammary gland initiation is 3, 4, 1, 2 and 5. Consistent with expression of Pyst 1 in the mammary gland, we detected expression of Fgfr 1 b, Fgf 8 and Fgf 9 in both surface ectoderm and <b>mammary</b> bud <b>epithelium,</b> and Fgf 4 and Fgf 17 in <b>mammary</b> bud <b>epithelium.</b> Beads soaked in FGF- 8 applied to the flank of mouse embryos, at a stage just prior to mammary bud initiation, induce expression of Pyst 1 and Lef 1 and maintain Tbx 3 expression in flank tissue surrounding the bead.

40|$|To {{develop an}} {{inducible}} and progressive model of mammary gland tumorigenesis, transgenic mice were generated with a mouse mammary tumor virus–long terminal repeat–driven, conditional, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) –independent FGF receptor (FGFR) 1 (iFGFR 1) {{that can be}} induced to dimerize with the drug AP 20187. Treatment of transgenic mice with AP 20187 resulted in iFGFR 1 tyrosine phosphorylation, increased proliferation, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, and lateral budding. Lateral buds appeared as early as 3 d after AP 20187 treatment and initially consisted of bilayered epithelial cells and displayed apical and basolateral polarity appeared after 13 d of AP 20187 treatment. Invasive lesions characterized by multicell-layered lateral buds, decreased myoepithelium, increased vascular branching, and loss of cell polarity were observed after 2 – 4 wk of treatment. These data indicate that acute iFGFR 1 signaling results in increased lateral budding of the <b>mammary</b> ductal <b>epithelium,</b> and that sustained activation induces alveolar hyperplasia and invasive lesions...|$|R
