50|$|R. nutkana hosts gall-making wasps of {{the family}} Cynipidae, genus Diplolepis, in the insect class Hymenoptera. Two species are D. polita, which makes bristly round red or green galls on leaves, and D. rosae, the <b>mossy</b> <b>rose</b> <b>gall,</b> which makes large, mossy, feathery, greenish or {{yellowish}} growths on stems.|$|R
50|$|The <b>galls</b> of the <b>rose</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> (Diplolepis rosae) {{are also}} {{distinctive}} and {{are known as}} bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of dog roses and have a length of up to 5 cm with red, long-haired outgrowths. Inside the galls are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focussed on description of biology of <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> from the genus Diplolepis spp. (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) in the palearctic region {{with the emphasis}} on some interesting phenomenons in their life cycle. These <b>wasps</b> induce <b>galls</b> obligatory on <b>roses</b> (Rosa spp.) and are widely distributed in the holarctic region. Many authors focussed on research of parasitoids, which use wasps larvae as food source. It was also recognized that inquilines lost their ability to induce own galls. However, their development is still dependent on galls tissues, because they feed on cells within <b>galls.</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> reproduce mostly without any mating. Female lay unfertilized eggs and males are very rare. Recently, development of modern techniques enable authors to study infection by bacteria of the genus Wolbachia and its role in the wasps parthenogenetic development. It is also apparent difference between the levels of our knowledge about individual species in this bachelor thesis. We have relative rich knowledges about European <b>rose</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasps,</b> on the other hand biology of some Asian species is still very poor...|$|R
40|$|According to the Host-tracking Hypothesis, {{species of}} higher trophic levels with a close {{relationship}} to their hosts, such as parasites or parasitoids, are expected to show spatio-temporal phylogeographic patterns {{similar to those of}} their host. Alternatively, with ecological sorting, a subset of the local species pools might shift to a related host species, thereby disengaging common phylogeographic patterns. Here, we compare the phylogeographic structures of the cynipid <b>rose</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> Diplolepis rosae across Europe and of two of its most common parasitoids, the wasps Orthopelma mediator and Glyphomerus stigma, by analysing the sequences of two gene fragments (COI and ITS 2). The phylogeographic structures of the three species associated with roses were incongruent. D. rosae had the lowest genetic diversity with one major clade, O. mediator showed the classical phylogeographic structure for Europe with one eastern and one western clade, and G. stigma had the highest diversity but no geographical structuring. This discordance of geographical patterns may be explained by 1) the dispersal propensity of adult parasitoids or 2) the parasitoids having the ability to switch to another host, while the primary host becomes rare or is even not available. Furthermore there was no indication that phylogenetic patterns were affected by Wolbachia infections. Our results document that communities of closely interacting species {{may be the result of}} idiosyncratic biogeographic histories...|$|R

40|$|Cynipid <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> have {{fascinating}} biology {{that has}} piqued {{the interest of}} naturalists throughout history. They induce morphologically complex, sometimes spectacular, gall structures on plants in which the larval stages develop. <b>Gall</b> <b>wasps</b> have therefore evolved an intimate association with their hosts - both metabolically, {{and in terms of}} their population histories. <b>Gall</b> <b>wasps</b> must both interact physiologically with their hosts to induce galls, and track their host plants through space and time. My thesis centres on two uses of genomic data in understanding the biology of the oak apple <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> Biorhiza pallida. I provide a comprehensive investigation into patterns of oak and <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> gene expression associated with gall induction, and a population genomic reconstruction of the population history of this species across the Western Palaearctic. While advances in sequencing technology and reduced costs have made these aims possible, analysis of the massive resulting datasets generated creates new challenges. Firstly, in reconstructing the population history of B. pallida, I describe the use of shotgun sequencing and an informatic pipeline to generate alignments of several thousand loci for three B. pallida individuals sampled from putative glacial refugia across the Western Palaearctic in Iberia, the Balkans and Iran. This dataset was analysed using a new maximum likelihood method capable of estimating population splitting and admixture among refugia across very large numbers of loci. The results showed an ancient divide between Iberia and the other two refugia, followed by very recent admixture between easternmost and westernmost regions. This suggests that <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> have migrated westwards along the North African coast as well as through mainland Europe. Second, I compare the gene expression profiles of <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> and oak tissues sampled from each of three stages of gall development, leading to new insights into potential mechanisms of gall wasp-oak interaction. A highly expressed <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> protein was identified that is hypothesised to stimulate somatic embryogenesis-like development of the gall through interaction with oak tissue glycoproteins. Highly expressed oak genes include those coding for nodulin-like proteins similar to those involved in legume nodule formation. Finally, analysis of the <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> genome has revealed potential, but as yet unconfirmed, horizontal gene transfer events into <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> genomes. Genes discovered in three <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> genomes and expressed in three transcriptomes encode plant cell wall degrading enzymes. They are not of hymenopteran origin, and are most homologous to genes of plant pathogenic bacteria. These genes could be involved in several aspects of <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> biology, including feeding and developmental manipulation of host plant tissue...|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing {{and spatial}} {{analysis}} represent useful tools for modeling species’ dispersal, characterizing {{the spread of}} invasions and the invasability of a region, and thus allowing more accurate predictions for developing mitigation strategies. American chestnut, Castanea dentata, was historically a dominant forest species in North America, but occurs only sporadically today after its functional elimination by an exotic fungal pathogen in the early 1900 ’s. In recent decades Castanea resources have increased due to restoration efforts, commercial chestnut plantations, and horticultural uses. This resurgence is threatened by an additional exotic species, the globally invasive Asian chestnut <b>gall</b> <b>wasp,</b> Dryocosmus kuriphilus.
