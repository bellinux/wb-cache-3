It's rather that the entire idea is based on dubious assumptions. A different assumption is introduced, namely that effectiveness can only be obtained by parties having iterative conversations over time, and that communication is meant more to provoke right action than to transmit understanding. Based on examples of this assumption in practice, suggestions for software development are sketched. Biographical sketch Brian Marick was a programmer, tester, and line manager for ten years, then a pure testing consultant for ten more. Since 2001, he's been heavily involved in the Agile methods. He {{was one of the}} authors of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and is past chair of the board of the Agile Alliance nonprofit. At this point, it's probably fairer to call him an Agile consultant and advocate than a testing consultant, though his Agile work is heavily informed by the lessons of testing. His testing work can be found at , and his agile work at and . Many of his writings <b>make</b> it <b>into</b> the <b>pages</b> of Better Software Magazine, of which he is a technical editor. 1 Because of poor time management on my part, this is not the final version of this paper.
