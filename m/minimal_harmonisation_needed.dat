Rather, what can be witnessed is the prevalence of national policy goals through the discretionary implementation of the common rules at the expense of the simpler approach of <b>minimal</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> To support this argument, the author looks at the process of policy coordination in three major areas of the EU: Single Market, Economic and Monetary Union and Social Policies...|$|R

40|$|The paper makes {{a quality}} {{assessment}} of the available national indicators on collectively agreed wages available in ten European countries including Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK. It assesses the available indicators in a comparative way by using the six dimensions of statistical output quality, developed within the European statistical system by Eurostat: relevance, coherence, clarity, accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility. Most of the national data are either developed by the official national statistical agencies or by the Ministries of Labour. There are significant differences but sometimes also interesting similarities in the statistical definition of collectively agreed wages, the methods of calculation and coverage of the data. However, {{there is a certain}} dominance in the use of index-based indices, comparable with the methodological approach of a consumer price index, which could create a starting base for European harmonisation. In order to get more comparable data the paper suggests and develops a step by step approach starting with more systematic exchange and coordination of national data providers, followed by a <b>minimal</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of certain data items towards the creation of an official European database on collectively agreed wages based on a harmonised data source (e. g. provided among others by collecting pay scale information of workers through the Structure of Earnings survey). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{research}} is increasingly becoming data-intensive; sensitive data are being re-used, linked and analysed on an unprecedented scale. The current EU {{data protection law}} reform {{has led to an}} intense debate about its potential effect on this processing of data in medical research. To contribute to this evolving debate, this paper reviews how the dominant 'consent or anonymise approach' is challenged in a data-intensive medical research context, and discusses possible ways forwards within the EU legal framework on data protection. A large part of the debate in literature focuses on the acceptability of adapting consent or anonymisation mechanisms to overcome the challenges within these approaches. We however believe that the search for ways forward within the consent or anonymise paradigm will become increasingly difficult. Therefore, we underline the necessity of an appropriate research exemption from consent for the use of sensitive personal data in medical research to take account of all legitimate interests. The appropriate conditions of such a research exemption are however subject to debate, and we expect that there will be <b>minimal</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of these conditions in the forthcoming EU Data Protection Regulation. Further deliberation is required to determine when a shift away from consent as a legal basis is necessary and proportional in a data-intensive medical research context, and what safeguards should be put in place when such a research exemption from consent is provided.

40|$|EU {{enlargement}} {{rests on}} the proven success of European unification. European monetary integration {{and the introduction of}} euro are probably the best examples of integration. The EU financial sector has been going through a large restructuring program in the last decades. There was a continuous wave of deregulation since the late 1980 s, when the Single Market programme with <b>minimal</b> <b>harmonisation</b> and home country control was implemented in successive periods for banking, insurance and the securities markets. The accession of new members poses huge challenges on the European Union and the countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC). Similarities in economic histories and experiences, as well as comparable methods applied to build the market economies, led to creation of analogous structures and institutions in the CEEC. This was also true {{for the development of the}} financial sector. The paper will then investigate the most important characteristics of the financial architecture and will analyse the impact of closer integration of financial sectors in CEEC and EU countries. It will briefly review the developments which have taken place in the financial sector of both groups of countries to provide the background for the later analysis of the expected effects of integration in both old and new member states.

These characteristics are mainly ruled by the principle of “landing like an aircraft at an airport” (XCOR, 2015) (DreamChaser, 2015) (Spaceliner, 2015). This directly generates the need to be taken in a system wide information management (SWIM) consideration because of the fact, that all the future air traffic participants are requested to act as SWIM communicating sub-systems by the future Single European Sky Air Traffic Manamement Research (SESAR) SWIM "Intranet for ATM" concept.

Water governance is defined here as a process in which law has a transformational role by allowing policy goals to become tangible and enforceable rights and obligations. Against this conceptual background global water governance appears to be still fragmented and incoherent. More coordination efforts and further <b>harmonisation</b> is <b>needed,</b> but more importantly global institutions are required to allow international law to operate effectively. It is within this context that the UNCSD can be seen as an international agenda setting process and three key water related topics appear to be on such agenda: water and sanitation; water and ecosystem services and water and climate change.

40|$|Unidroit has {{recently}} launched an intergovernmental process intended {{to set an}} international non-binding standard for close-out netting legislation. This paper, first, provides insights into {{the question of why}} <b>harmonisation</b> is <b>needed.</b> The colossal exposures inherent in the derivatives, securities lending, repo, forex and similar markets are generally covered by close-out netting provisions, which are contained in the relevant master agreements. Close-out netting reduces mutual exposure by about 80 – 90 %. The ‘net’ exposure is taken as a basis for the calculation of collateral and underlying capital, thus being vital for market participants' risk management, as well as for prudential supervision. Even though most developed markets have adopted netting-friendly legislation, the international nature of the modern financial market complicates enforceability of close-out netting in cross-jurisdictional situations, in particular in insolvency scenarios. Further, the Article explains the current difficulties in transposing the concept of close-out netting across jurisdictional borders and advocates a functional approach alongside the five criteria (immediate discharge of obligations? obligations due? obligations of the same kind?).

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the report of the GTZ expert group an {{overview}} on the basics of integration and tax harmonisation within a common market is given. Chapter II. concentrates on the problems of national and international tax law regarding double taxation before the harmonisation process within the EU is described in detail. This process is not a best practice example but at least the experiences made in the course of the last five decades are interesting enough and might contribute important information for regions, which more or less recently have started a similar endeavour. The <b>harmonisation</b> <b>needs</b> are discussed for value added taxation (VAT), excise taxation, and income taxation. The problems of tax administrations, procedures laws, taxpayers' rights and obligations as well as tax compliance are also taken into consideration. The second part of the study reviews the national tax systems within the EAC member countries. Before the single taxes are described in more detail, the macroeconomic situation is illuminated by some basic figures and the current stand of the inner-community integration analysed. Then the single tax bases and tax rates are confronted to shed some light on the necessities for the development of a common market within the near future. Again the value added tax laws, excise taxes and income taxes are discussed in detail, while regarding the latter the focus is on company taxation. For a better systematic analysis the national tax laws are confronted within an overview. The chapter is closed with a summary of the tax rates applied and a rough estimation of the tax burdens within the Partner States. The third part of this report contains the policy recommendations of the expert group following the same structures as the chapters before and presenting the results for the VAT, the excises and the corporate income tax (CIT). Additionally the requirements for tax procedures and administration as well as problems of transparency and information exchange are discussed in detail before the strategic recommendations are derived in close relation to the experiences made within the EU harmonisation process. The recommendations are based on the following normative arguments: (1) Tax harmonisation is a basic requirement for economic integration. (2) Equality of taxation is an imperative of tax justice and demands the avoidance of double taxation as well as the combat of tax evasion and corruption. (3) The avoidance of harmful tax competition between the Partner States. (4) The strengthening of taxpayers' rights in tax procedures. Hence, all kinds of income, goods and services should be taxed once and only once...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Using a questionnaire, the EC 4 (European Communities Confederation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) has {{collated}} {{an inventory}} of the accreditation procedures for medical laboratories in the EU. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Accreditation of medical laboratories in {{the countries of the}} EU is mostly carried out in cooperation with national accreditation bodies. These national accreditation bodies work together in a regional cooperation, the European Cooperation for Accreditation (EA). Professionals are trained to become assessors and play a prominent role in the accreditation process. The extent of the training is diverse, but assessors are kept informed and up-to-date by annual meetings. The frequency of assessments and surveillance visits differs from country to country and ranges from 1 to 4 years. More <b>harmonisation</b> is <b>needed</b> in this respect, based on a frequency that can be pragmatically handled by laboratory professionals. In the majority of EA bodies, accreditation is carried out on a test-by-test basis. Many professionals would prefer accreditation of the entire service provided within the actual field of testing (i. e., haematology, immunology, etc.), with accreditation granted if the majority of tests offered within a service field fulfil the requirements of the ISO 15189 standard.

The EURRECA (EURopean micronutrient RECommendations Aligned, [URL] Network of Excellence is developing generic tools for systematically establishing and updating micronutrient reference values or recommendations. Different types of instruments (including best practice guidelines, interlinked web pages, online databases and decision trees) have been identified. The first set of instruments is for training purposes and includes mainly interactive digital learning materials. The second set of instruments comprises collection and interlinkage of diverse information sources that have widely varying contents and purposes. In general, these sources are collections of existing information. The purpose of the majority of these information sources is to provide guidance on best practice for use in a wider scientific community or for users and stakeholders of reference values. The third set of instruments includes decision trees and frameworks. The purpose of these tools is to guide non-scientists in decision making based on scientific evidence. This platform of instruments will, in particular in Central and Eastern European countries, contribute to future capacity-building development in nutrition. The use of these tools by the scientific community, the European Food Safety Authority, bodies responsible for setting national nutrient requirements and others should ultimately help to align nutrient-based recommendations across Europe.

Central statistical analyses on major cardiovascular risk factors were conducted with careful consideration of methodological issues, including differences in study designs, data assessment tools, and analytic techniques used.  MAIN RESULTS—Because of the detected variability among methods used, direct comparisons of risk factor distributions and prevalences between studies were problematic. None the less, comparisons of within population contrasts by sex, age group, and other health determinants were considered to be meaningful and apt, as illustrated here for obesity. Results were targeted and disseminated to both the general public and public health professionals and framed {{in the context of a}} European information campaign.  CONCLUSIONS—International and national comparisons between existing locally run studies are feasible and useful, but <b>harmonisation</b> methods <b>need</b> improvement.

Also the design practices of timber floors with respect to vibrational serviceability criteria, including those for fundamental frequency, unit point load deflection and unit impulse velocity, in up to thirteen European countries have been gathered and their differences been further assessed by analysing flooring systems constructed with three types of joists, i. e. solid timber joists, engineered I-joists and metal web joists. The unit point load deflection criterion is the most crucial one for structural design of timber floors with various types of joists and usually dominates the whole design. Finland tends to be the strictest, followed by Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Norway, while Denmark, the UK and Ireland are the most generous.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between innovation policies and locational competitiveness {{has emerged as}} an important area {{in the analysis of}} economic development, reflecting both the centralisation and decentralisation of globalising economic activities. The underlying spatial and institutional components are subject to a pattern of cumulative causation in which strategic interventions of policy actors exercise a decisive role in shaping competitive advantages, while promoting interactions with local and foreign partners both from the private and public sectors. The Singaporean development experience illustrates these strategic interdependencies of innovation policies and locational competitiveness.

40|$|Abstract Background Data {{requirements}} by governments, {{donors and}} the international community to measure health and development achievements have increased in the last decade. Datasets produced in surveys conducted in several countries and years are often combined to analyse time trends and geographical patterns of demographic and health related indicators. However, since not all datasets have the same structure, variables definitions and codes, they have to be harmonised prior to submitting them to the statistical analyses. Manually searching, renaming and recoding variables are extremely tedious and prone to errors tasks, overall when the number of datasets and variables are large. This article presents an automated approach to harmonise variables names across several datasets, which optimises the search of variables, minimises manual inputs and reduces the risk of error. Results Three consecutive algorithms are applied iteratively to search for each variable of interest for the analyses in all datasets. The first search (A) captures particular cases that could not be solved in an automated way in the search iterations; the second search (B) is run if search A produced no hits and identifies variables the labels of which contain certain key terms defined by the user. If this search produces no hits, a third one (C) is run to retrieve variables which have been identified in other surveys, as an illustration. For each variable of interest, the outputs of these engines can be (O 1) a single best matching variable is found, (O 2) more than one matching variable is found or (O 3) not matching variables are found. Output O 2 is solved by user judgement. Examples using four variables are presented showing that the searches have a 100 % sensitivity and specificity after a second iteration. Conclusion Efficient and tested automated algorithms should be used to support the <b>harmonisation</b> process <b>needed</b> to analyse multiple datasets. This is especially relevant when the numbers of datasets or variables to be included are large. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Paediatric {{clinical}} trials are often conducted as multinational trials. Informed consent or assent {{is part of}} the ethics committee approval for {{clinical trials}}. The consent requirements vary between countries due to national laws and regulations, which are not harmonised in Europe. These discrepancies can present challenges for paediatric clinical trials. The aim {{of this study was to}} assemble these consent and assent requirements across the European Economic Area. The collated national requirements have not been publicly available before, despite a real need for this data. METHODS: National consent and assent requirements for paediatric clinical trials were analysed and collated for 25 European Union Member States and 2 European Free Trade Association countries until the end of 2014. The data were retrieved from existing databases and through communication with the competent authorities and selected ethics committees. Results from a literature search for international or national guidelines, declarations and conventions and academic societies' publications served as comparison material. RESULTS: Consent and assent requirements are heterogeneous across these countries. We compiled our findings in 'The Informed Consent and Assent Tool Kit', a table including 27 national consent and assent requirements listed by individual country. CONCLUSIONS: Wide variation in paediatric consents and assents presents challenges for multinational paediatric trials in Europe. The toolkit is available for all those involved in paediatric clinical trials and ethics committees, providing a new platform for proactive feedback on informed consent requirements, and may finally lead to a <b>needed</b> <b>harmonisation</b> process, including uniform standards accepted across Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} reimbursement {{decisions of}} new medicines in European countries {{are based on}} multiple criteria, such as the relative effectiveness, value for money, costs, social and ethical considerations. The relative effectiveness {{is the extent to}} which an intervention does more good than harm compared to already available treatment(s). Although reimbursement criteria differ per country, the relative effectiveness is very relevant in many European countries. For this reason, multiple countries simultaneously write their own relative effectiveness assessment (REA) report of the same medicine. There are potential quality and efficiency gains for European countries to collaborate in the production of these REAs. Since more harmonisation is a prerequisite for collaboration, we have studied the possibilities for harmonising REAs in Europe. There is general willingness to cooperate in the development and standardisation of methods for REAs in Europe and it is expected to lead to an increase of quality and expertise throughout Europe. But, the willingness to produce and use joint REAs is not yet shared by all countries, and increases with potential efficiency gains. The potential efficiency gains are highest for smaller/middle-sized European countries and also European countries with less developed HTA systems. We found that important methodological aspects for REAs are approached in a similar way in many European jurisdictions. Nonetheless, there are also differences that should be considered when jointly producing REAs (hereafter referred as joint REAs). In order to cover the needs of multiple jurisdictions joint REAs should be comprehensive in terms of relevant comparators, endpoints, studies included and the uncertainty of the evidence. If there is a lot of variation in treatment patterns between countries or if multiple comparators are available indirect comparisons are likely to play a relevant role in joint REAs, as it is highly unlikely that direct evidence is available for all comparisons. Although available pilot joint REAs seem to cover the needs of multiple jurisdictions from a methodological point of view, the actual use is still limited. Other factors seem to play a relevant role such as timing of the joint REA and not optimal alignment with national procedures. More emphasis needs to be put on these issues in order to realise national use of the reports. Harmonisation of REAs in Europe is feasible, but the production and use of joint REAs follows rather an evolutionary path instead of disruptive introduction. It is driven by jurisdictions that have the highest efficiency gains. Further alignment of methods and procedures is required to enhance <b>harmonisation.</b> The <b>need</b> for alignment of evidence requirements before and after market approval goes beyond national efficiencies and requires a multi-stakeholder debate between regulatory agencies, HTA agencies, and pharmaceutical companies. A common understanding and common policies of evidence requirement for a new medicine will improve the drug development and thus help patients in need for effective, safe and affordable treatments...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation in Environmental Physics to be {{publicly}} examined in Häggsalen (Ångström Laboratory), Uppsala University, on Friday, November 8, 2002 at 10 : 00 am for {{the degree of}} doctor of philosophy in Physics. The examination will be conducted in English. Gamma spectrometry {{is one of the}} tools commonly used for the measurement of various environmental radionuclides. Simultaneous determination of the absolute activity of gamma emitting radiotracers {{in a wide range of}} environmental matrices and fractions necessitates proper and accurate evaluation of the sample-to-detector efficiency. Several radiotracers require, in addition, the use of sub-routines for self-absorption corrections. Gamma spectrometry is an important and elegant tool for assessing environmental changes. Optimisation of ultra low-level gamma spectrometry for reliable assessment of such changes requires <b>harmonisation</b> of laboratory <b>needs</b> with sampling and site conditions. Different aspects of the calculation of sample-to-detector efficiencies using empirical and Monte Carlo approaches are discussed here, including the uncertainties related to the simulation of the performance of different HPGe detectors and the effects of the incomplete collection of charges in Ge-crystals. Various simulation codes for the computation of peak efficiencies in planar and well Ge-detectors have been developed from scratch. The results of the simulations have been tested against experimental data and compared to other simulation results obtained with the Monte Carlo N-Particle code (MCNP). The construction of calibration sources with improved absorption and collimation characteristics have been, also, described in this work. These sources have been especially designed for the efficiency calibration of Ge-detectors at energies below 100 keV. Flexible, fully tested and prototype approaches for the evaluation of self-absorption corrections, based on Monte Carlo simulations, are described. Special consideration is given to the problems related to the sample's variability in size, density and composition. Several examples of the absolute and simultaneous determination of environmental multitracers which benefited from self-absorption corrections and the optimised efficiency calibration algorithms are, also, presented and discussed. These examples include, among other things, a comprehensive analysis of the gamma spectrometry of 234 Th in a wide range of matrices and the speciation of several radionuclides in sediments from a hard-water lake...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{competence}} is achieved through University education. University {{is the place}} where the root of knowledge in a field of study is fabricated. It is also the forum where research and professional queries begin. As such, the curriculum is not only for the forming of knowledge but also for the forming of attitudes, academic and professional approaches. The impact of a departmental curriculum is far greater than the mere transfer of knowledge. Syllabus or courses of studies are one-dimensional document that embody the subjects and contents outline with broad time allocation. Curriculum is three-dimensional, and takes into account the needs of the society, students, professions and the instructional methodology (Karisiddappa and Sangam, 1994). The objective is to describe the course content or what is being studied. It is a blueprint that provides fundamental guidelines for a department on: what is study; why; when; where and how it is to be studied; who should study and how the courses of studies are to be evaluated and trainees’ assessed (Ocholla, 2000). The use of ICT has transformed a modern library into an electronic library providing access to information from local and remote databases through Internet and/or Intranet, CD Networks, e-books, e-journals, computerized in-house library operations such as acquisition, classification, cataloguing, circulation serial control, bar-coding, etc. The concepts such as ‘Library without walls 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Virtual Library 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Electronic Library 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Digital Library 2 ̆ 7 have already come to light. New technologies have heralded not only new ways of handling information but also introduced new formats. Information started detaching itself from just the print format. Diverseness in format has created an independence of thought in approaching it. These changes transfigured the library education and obligated the professionals to prepare themselves for the coming era. How do these changes affect education for library and information science? If professional values are changing minimally, professional parameters slowly and information technology rapidly, it follows that education of information professionals has to reflect minimal change, moderate change and total change – all at once! (Gorman, 1999). Educating information professionals for the future can be determined by examining what skills will be required by library information professionals to enable them to adapt new and changing demands in society (Wagner, 2000). There is a need to educate and train students to the best contemporary standards in terms of curricular aims and contents, teaching methodologies, assessment practices and quality control. Modularisations of the studies and their <b>harmonisation</b> with actual <b>needs</b> of the running library and information centres are required. A standard formal library education should have devoted faculty members, well-resourced department, and scientifically liable curriculum indicating clear relationship between theory and practice, an enthusiastic and hard-working student body, management of training units. There should also be suitable classrooms, practical room, computer laboratories and computer and/or electronic equipment, suitable organizational placing, effective communication among all, and an emphasis on continuing education as community service. The University of Dhaka has played a key role for the development and provision of library education in Bangladesh. As professional, the future is never far from our thoughts, but the changes and challenges of the new millennium give a special reason to re-examine where we are coming from and where should be heading.
