40|$|Abstract — The {{previous}} work {{is carried out}} on sliding window approach for <b>fragment</b> <b>mining</b> rules which results in large & complex processing the data. In this paper we present an idea to find out association within inter-transaction with different windowing approach. These approaches first minimizes the huge input dataset using tumbling window approach and then apply <b>fragment</b> <b>mining</b> to generate rules among different transactions with window length. This experimental work find out effect of different windowing approaches and select the best windowing method which will best suited for processing huge amount of data with minimum complexity. We conclude that this approach is promising one and will be suitable for predictions and useful in stock trading platforms for proper investment in Indian Stock market depend on finance sector.

40|$|Two {{representative}} soil {{models are}} compared and contrasted within two transient nonlinear dynamics computational analyses. The first soil model {{is representative of}} a discrete-particle group of models, while {{the other is a}} typical continuum-type consolidated-soil model. The two computational analyses involved: (a) the case of a soil slug impacting a rigid flat surface and (b) the case of detonation of a mine shallow buried in soil and the interaction of the resulting gaseous detonation products, <b>mine</b> <b>fragments,</b> and soil ejecta with a plate-like deformable steel target. The results obtained show that the use of the computationally more expensive particle mechanics-based soil models is fully justified only in the case of loose (low-density) soil. In addition, the magnitude of the particle-to-particle coefficient of restitution has been found to have a second-order effect on the extent of momentum transferred from the moving soil to the target and that it may be substantially different from its effective counterpart for the entire loose-soil agglomerate...|$|R

The first alluviel 'rush' began in the 1850s, while the more concerted effort to extract gold from Cape Terawhiti followed in the 1880s. The latter of which failed to provide an economic return. Problems arose when miners encountered the fragmented geological landforms that make up much of the Wellington region. While payable quartz veins, containing gold, would be located, these seams come to an abrupt end, making <b>mining</b> a <b>fragmented,</b> and expensive exercise. This eventually caused the demise of gold mining on Cape Terawhiti.The company to expend the most {{amount of time and}} money into the Terawhiti goldfield was the Albion Gold Mining Company.
