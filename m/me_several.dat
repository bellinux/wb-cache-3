25|$|Also in February 2006, {{the band}} {{went back into}} the studio to finish up the {{recordings}} they started the previous fall. Initially unsure of how to release so many songs, the band announced in May 2006 that they would release a one-disc album in early September entitled Barenaked Ladies Are <b>Me.</b> <b>Several</b> alternate versions are available, including downloadable versions and a USB flash drive version. The B.L.A.M. tour in support of the album, and its follow-up Barenaked Ladies Are Men (both of which hail from the same sessions), ran in Fall 2006 for the U.S., February 2007 for Canada, and later in 2007 for the UK. That same year, the band wrote and recorded the theme song for the television series The Big Bang Theory.|$|E
500|$|Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy {{was cast}} {{to give a}} {{sympathetic}} quality, so Olbricht {{would not be the}} [...] "fall guy". Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as divided between complaining about Hitler's regime and actually doing something about it. The actor described his portrayal, [...] "One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It's so associated with evil that it took <b>me</b> <b>several</b> days to get used to being in costume." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{present at}} the session was David Crosby of the Byrds. He {{recalled}} his reaction to hearing the completed song: [...] "man, I was a dish-rag. I was floored. It took <b>me</b> <b>several</b> minutes {{to be able to}} talk after that." [...] Due to the multiple takes required to perfect the orchestral cacophony and the final chord, the total time spent recording [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] was 34hours. In contrast, the Beatles' debut album, Please Please Me, had been recorded in its entirety in only 10hours, 45minutes.|$|E

500|$|Tessa {{occasionally}} meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In [...] "", {{she immediately}} dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that [...] "...sparks fly {{between the two}} women". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take <b>me</b> <b>several</b> lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, but I never thought I would meet one of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>several</b> 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did {{it in order to}} hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick, {{in regards}} of Debra Messing's character, said: [...] "Grace doesn't fall {{into any of}} those {{categories}} that have stereotyped Jewish women. She's strong, she's pretty and she's a proud Jewish woman." [...] Mutchnick revealed that Nicollette Sheridan was originally brought in to read the part of Grace, but even though she did a [...] "great job", her performance was [...] "too desperate". Mutchnick and Kohan decided to cast Messing in the role instead, {{who at the time}} was starring in ABC's drama Prey. After her first meeting with them, Messing was not convinced she wanted the role. Messing revealed that Mutchnick and Kohan showed up at her home with a bottle of vodka; [...] "They poured <b>me</b> <b>several</b> shots, we spoke for several hours and they pitched me the show. I'm a lightweight. I didn't need much to be a little giddy. By the end of the evening, they said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Let's talk tomorrow.'" [...] They called her the next day to inform her that they [...] "loved her" [...] and asked [...] "if she'd made up her mind". Messing still did not make her mind up. However, the following day, she called Mutchnick and Kohan and accepted the role. In discussion of the character, Messing said: [...] "I have a lot more confidence and I'm much more relaxed. I feel comfortable that Grace will be a character I'll enjoy doing for a long time." [...] She later, however, admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace. Messing was the last actor to be cast.|$|E

2500|$|Old Mr. Rootes told <b>me</b> <b>several</b> the like. As, an apparitor at Blakeley, when old Mr. Paget was there, came {{in among}} the communicants and took all their names, and bragged that he would present them all at the visitation. The next Lord's day he {{resolved}} to go to Bolton to entrap Mr. Gosnall and his communicants in like manner. On the Sabbath morning when he was getting up, something, as he thought, gave him a dust on the neck; he fell immediately sick, and died within two hours. Some godly men came in when he was dead, as neighbours, and providentially saw the paper and burned it and so the mischief by him was prevented.|$|E
2500|$|While most of Sevier County {{supported}} the Union during the U.S. Civil War (96% {{of the county}} voted against secession in 1861), the Brabsons {{supported the}} Confederacy. [...] Benjamin Brabson's son, William, enlisted in the Confederate army, and in 1863 was captured by the Union Army while fighting near Muscle Shoals. [...] Toward {{the end of the}} war, as Union forces re-gained control of East Tennessee, vengeful Sevier Countians began harassing and threatening the Brabsons. [...] Most of the family's livestock were stolen, the plantation houses were looted, and family members were forced to flee. [...] In an October 1865 letter, Benjamin Brabson's wife, Elizabeth (18211894), wrote, [...] "they rocked my house so, burned my carriage, and fired my outbuildings, they also shot at <b>me</b> <b>several</b> times." [...] Thomas Brabson and his wife moved to Knoxville, where there had been more sympathy for the Confederacy. [...] Benjamin Brabson moved to Winchester, Tennessee, writing in 1865 that his future looked [...] "dark." [...] He died a few months later, and, according to his wishes, was buried in Winchester rather than the family cemetery in Boyds Creek.|$|E
2500|$|David Cantwell {{recalled}} in 2013, [...] "His approach to singing, {{he told me}} once, was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He {{was a kind of}} singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real." [...] In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, [...] "Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish". [...] In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, [...] "Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it." [...] In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, [...] "His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: [...] one of the greatest instruments ever made." [...] Emmylou Harris wrote, [...] "...when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always," [...] a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole <b>Me,</b> <b>several</b> country music stars offer similar thoughts. Johnny Cash: [...] "When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'"; [...] Randy Travis: [...] "It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that"; Tom T. Hall: [...] "It was always Jones who got the message across just right"; and Roy Acuff: [...] "I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones". [...] In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, [...] "All I did was change the instrumentation around him. [...] I don't think he's changed at all." ...|$|E
