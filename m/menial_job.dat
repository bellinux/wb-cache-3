500|$|Peter Dunne {{was born}} on July 10, 1867, in Chicago, the son of Irish immigrants; he added the first name [...] "Finley", his mother's maiden name, in his early twenties. A {{precocious}} boy, he did well in elementary school but finished last in his high school class of 50, possibly because {{of the death of}} his mother, and was sent to work at about age 17 in 1884. [...] Dunne got a <b>menial</b> <b>job</b> on the Chicago Tribune, where superiors soon noticed his street smarts, and made him police reporter. Over the next few years, Dunne worked for several Chicago papers, gaining in salary and responsibility, and by 1888 at age 21 was city editor and a political writer for the Chicago Times.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Stanton {{conceived}} WALL-E {{during a}} lunch with fellow writers John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft in 1994. Toy Story was near completion and the writers brainstormed ideas {{for their next}} projects—A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., and Finding Nemo—at this lunch. Stanton asked, [...] "What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot {{to turn off the}} last robot?" [...] Having struggled for many years with making the characters in Toy Story appealing, Stanton found his simple Robinson Crusoe-esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet strong. Stanton made WALL-E a waste collector as the idea was instantly understandable, and because it was a low-status <b>menial</b> <b>job</b> that made him sympathetic. Stanton also liked the imagery of stacked cubes of garbage. He did not find the idea dark because having a planet covered in garbage was for him a childish imagining of disaster.|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Gordon, 32 [...] years old, {{suffers from}} {{phenylketonuria}} {{and has an}} IQ of 68. He holds a <b>menial</b> <b>job</b> at a bakery which his uncle had secured for him so that Charlie {{would not have to}} be sent to a state institution.

Two researchers at Beekman, Dr. Nemur and Dr. Strauss, are looking for a human test subject on whom to try a new surgical technique intended to increase intelligence. They had already performed the surgery on a mouse named Algernon, dramatically improving his mental performance. Based on Alice's recommendation and his motivation to improve, Charlie is chosen over smarter pupils to undergo the procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Tony Hale as Gary Walsh: Selina's {{personal}} aide and body man. A long-term associate and confidant of Selina, Gary {{is portrayed as}} incredibly loyal and devoted. Despite his <b>menial</b> <b>job,</b> Gary is actually a graduate of Cornell University, having majored in hotel management. In {{the fourth and fifth}} seasons, Gary is portrayed as having issues adapting to Selina's presidency, since he can no longer be as close to her as previously, due to lack of security clearance. When Selina fails to win reelection, he remains on as her {{personal aide}}. Hale describes Gary's loyalty to Selina stemming from the idea that the character [...] "is {{one of those guys who}} never really had an identity. He attached himself to people to find who he was." [...] Hale received two Primetime Emmy Awards for his performance on the series, with three further nominations.|$|E

Lois is disliked by both Hal's wealthy family and her own parents. She has a younger sister named Susan, who blames Lois for stealing Hal from her. Neighbors despise Lois and her boys and celebrate the weekends when they're gone. In the series finale, she discovered that she and Hal are expecting a 6th child.|$|E
2500|$|One unanticipated {{consequence}} {{of the rise of}} Pullman cars in the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries was their effect on civil rights and African-American culture. Each Pullman car was staffed by a uniformed porter. The majority of Pullman Porters were African Americans. While still a <b>menial</b> <b>job</b> in many respects, Pullman offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, in addition to a chance for travel, and it was a well regarded job in the African-American community of the time. The pullman attendants, regardless of their true name, were traditionally referred to as [...] "George" [...] by the travelers, the name of the company's founder, George Pullman. The Pullman company was the largest employer of African Americans in the United States. Subsequently, railway porters fought for political recognition and were eventually unionized. Their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, became an important source of strength for the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement in the early 20th century, notably under the leadership of A. Philip Randolph. Because they moved about the country, Pullman porters also became an important means of communication for news and cultural information of all kinds. The African-American newspaper, the Chicago Defender, gained a national circulation in this way. Porters also used to re-sell phonograph records bought in the great metropolitan centres, greatly adding to the distribution of jazz and blues and the popularity of the artists.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 86 - 91). This research {{considers the}} reasons for the position of African migrants with a tertiary education in <b>menial</b> <b>jobs</b> in Cape Town. Until recently, mainstream migration literature on South Africa has tended to universalise xenophobia and to treat migrants as innocent people for their situation. To what extent does xenophobia explain the position of skilled migrants in menial work in Cape Town bearing in mind that i) South Africa suffers a shortage of skills needed to spur economic growth and development, ii) xenophilia (love and support for foreigners) {{is part and parcel of}} the interactions between South Africans and foreigners? Using an in-depth, qualitative, face-to-face interview schedule instrument and a convenience sampling method to select twelve skilled migrants from five African countries, this research provides a 'thick' and comprehensive understanding of {{the reasons for}} the position of African skilled migrants in <b>menial</b> <b>jobs</b> in Cape Town. It establishes a system of antecedent and immediate reasons which explain this position. The antecedent reasons are deprivation in home countries, reliance on superficial information and/or emotions to find out about opportunities in South Africa, the imperative of survival, reliance on limited social capital to find jobs, limited English skills, low entry requirements characterising <b>menial</b> <b>jobs,</b> and the fact that the migrants saw <b>menial</b> <b>jobs</b> as a temporary measure and exploited this facet of such jobs. Immediate reasons consist of limited knowledge of Xhosa and Afrikaans languages, xenophobia, racism, and the temporary nature of asylum seeker permit identity document. This research challenges the sketchy finding of earlier studies which has implicitly suggested that xenophobia is omnipresent in South Africa. It throws doubt into the extent to which the Government and businesses are informed about and willing to tackle the skills shortage in this country. It shows that the value of education is not forgone even though highly educated migrants do <b>menial</b> <b>jobs.</b> Such migrants are likely to and do secure professional jobs in the long-term...|$|R
