5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. <b>Moulds</b> can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity <b>moulds,</b> each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. <b>Moulds</b> are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium <b>moulds</b> are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium <b>moulds</b> are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium <b>moulds</b> are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel <b>moulds</b> are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{multiple}} cavity tooling will mould {{a series}} of different parts in the same tool. Some toolmakers call these <b>moulds</b> family <b>moulds</b> as all the parts are related. Some examples include plastic model kits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moulds</b> {{are built}} through two main methods: {{standard}} machining and EDM. Standard machining, in its conventional form, {{has historically been}} the method of building injection <b>moulds.</b> With technological developments, CNC machining became the predominant means of making more complex <b>moulds</b> with more accurate mould details {{in less time than}} traditional methods.|$|E
5000|$|For many <b>moulding</b> methods, it is {{convenient}} {{to refer to}} one <b>mould</b> piece as a [...] "lower" [...] <b>mould</b> and another <b>mould</b> piece as an [...] "upper" [...] <b>mould.</b> Lower and upper refer to the different faces of the <b>moulded</b> panel, not the <b>mould's</b> configuration in space. In this convention, {{there is always a}} lower <b>mould,</b> and sometimes an upper <b>mould.</b> Part construction begins by applying materials to the lower <b>mould.</b> Lower <b>mould</b> and upper <b>mould</b> are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing uses a different nomenclature.|$|R
5|$|To {{allow for}} {{removal of the}} <b>moulded</b> part from the <b>mould,</b> the <b>mould</b> {{features}} must not overhang {{one another in the}} direction that the <b>mould</b> opens, unless parts of the <b>mould</b> are designed to move from between such overhangs when the <b>mould</b> opens (using components called Lifters).|$|R
50|$|Steel, wood, GRP, {{and other}} {{materials}} are used as <b>mould</b> materials for prototyping purposes. The <b>mould</b> can be a male or female <b>mould.</b> To make shower bathtubs, a male <b>mould</b> is used. In the boating industry, a single-sided female <b>mould</b> made from FRP (fibre-reinforced plastic) is used to make yacht hulls. The outer shell of the <b>mould</b> is stiffened by a wood frame. The <b>mould</b> is made by taking the reversal of a male pattern. Several different hull sizes can be made using the same <b>mould.</b> The length of the <b>mould</b> is shortened or lengthened using inserts and <b>mould</b> secondaries such as windows, air vents, and propeller shaft tunnels.|$|R
5|$|Since <b>moulds</b> {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical <b>moulds</b> are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel <b>moulds</b> cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel <b>moulds</b> are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel <b>moulds</b> are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium <b>moulds</b> can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The <b>moulds</b> can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s {{samples of}} extremophile molds {{were taken from}} Mir. Ninety species of {{micro-organisms}} were found in 1990, {{four years after the}} station's launch. By the time of its decommission in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, the problems with contamination get worse. <b>Moulds</b> that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The <b>moulds</b> in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment. The <b>moulds</b> also caused bad smell, which was often cited as visitors' strongest impressions.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers go {{to great}} lengths to protect custom <b>moulds</b> due to their high average costs. The perfect {{temperature}} and humidity level is maintained to ensure the longest possible lifespan for each custom mould. Custom <b>moulds,</b> such as those used for rubber injection moulding, are stored in temperature and humidity controlled environments to prevent warping.|$|E

5|$|Penicillium <b>moulds</b> cause {{soft rot}} such as of apples, while Aspergillus <b>moulds</b> create patches {{on the surface}} of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol. Scientific {{understanding}} of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as Louis Pasteur's 1879 Studies on Fermentation, which investigated the spoilage of beer.|$|E

5|$|Further details, such as {{undercuts}} or any feature causing additional tooling, {{will increase}} the mould cost. Surface finish of the core and cavity of <b>moulds</b> will further influence the cost.|$|E
5|$|A <b>mould</b> {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the <b>moulded</b> part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the <b>mould</b> when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or <b>mould</b> gates, are located below the parting line or <b>mould</b> surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} <b>mould</b> on the parting line. The <b>moulded</b> part is cut (by the <b>mould)</b> from the runner system on ejection from the <b>mould.</b> Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the <b>mould</b> (usually the ejector half), which push the finished <b>moulded</b> product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the <b>mould.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Moulding</b> is {{a process}} in which by pouring a molten metal into a <b>mould</b> cavity which is created by keeping the {{required}} shape of pattern on the molding sand and allowing the molten metal to solidify by cooling slowly. But in this process we can able to get only one shape of casting, it means shape of the final casting is limited. If we want more number of same design but not identical parts then it is not possible from a single <b>mould,</b> this drawback can be overcome by family <b>moulding.</b> This paper tells how can be able to get more number of same design but not identical parts. In another words we can say that two different parts can be produced from a single <b>mould.</b> This <b>mould</b> is called family <b>mould.</b> Family <b>mould</b> design consists of a complete <b>mould</b> with a few or many different cavity inserts that runs as a multiple part.
