40|$|European forests have a {{prominent}} role in the global carbon cycle and an increase in carbon storage has been consistently reported during the 20 th century. Any further increase in forest carbon storage, however, could be hampered by increases in aridity and extreme climatic events. Here we use forest inventory data to identify the relative importance of stand structure (stand basal area and mean d. b. h.), mean climate (water availability) and recent climate change (temperature and precipitation anomalies) on forest basal area change during the late 20 th century in three major European biomes. Using linear mixed-effects models we observed that stand structure, mean climate and recent climatic change strongly interact to modulate basal area change. Although we observed a net increment in stand basal area during the late 20 th century, we found the highest basal area increments in forests with <b>medium</b> <b>stand</b> basal areas and small to medium sized trees. Stand basal area increases correlated positively with water availability, and were enhanced in warmer areas. Recent climatic warming caused an increase in stand basal area, but this increase was offset by water availability. Based on recent trends in basal area change we conclude that the potential rate of aboveground carbon accumulation in European forests strongly depends on both stand structure and concomitant climate warming, adding weight to suggestions that European carbon stocks may saturate in the near future...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Umfakarin natural forest reserve, South Kordofan, Sudan. The main objective was to investigate the possibility of managing Acacia seyal Del. variety seyal for the production of gum talha. Three stand densities (strata), namely dense, medium, and slight, were distinguished {{based on the number of}} trees per hectare. During the sampling phase, the study adopted the method of identifying the competitors (neighboring trees) from the subject one (trees selected for gum production experiments). From the three stand densities, a total of 482 subject trees, covering variable diameter ranges (d= 9 - 11. 5, 13. 5 - 16, 18 - 20. 5 and above 21 cm) were selected, based on the diameter at 0. 25 m height (d 0. 25). In each stratum, competitor trees were identified within a radius equal to the height of subject tree multiplied by a factor (1. 25). The diameter at breast height, height to crown base, height, crown radii, and tree coordinates were measured for each of the subject trees and its competitors. Subject trees were exposed to tapping on first of October, the fifteenth of October, and the first of November, using local tools (Sonki and Makmak). Additionally, untapped trees were used as controlling-variables. The initial gum collection was completed fifteen days after the tapping, while the subsequent (7 - 9 pickings) were done at an interval of fifteen days. Six stand height functions were tested and the results illustrated that the Michailow stand height function was suitable for predicting the height of Acacia seyal in Umfakarin natural forest. The predictive ability of this height function ranged from 19. 3 % to 24 %. The volume function used in this study was able to predict the volume of standing trees with more than 92 percent accuracy. Competition among trees of Acacia seyal was assessed in terms of competition indices. Eight competition indices were quantified using the CroCom program. The relationship between these indices and tree dimensions (diameter at breast height, height and crown diameter) was tested using logarithmic models. Among these indices, the Hegyi_ 2 index is considered a suitable index to be applied for estimating the degree of competition in natural stands of A. seyal of dense stratum when using diameter at breast height as a predictor. About 70 % of the total variability is explained by this logarithmic model. Gum yielded by each subject tree per season was obtained by summing up the gum samples collected from all pickings. Gum production per unit area was also determined. Regression tree, general linear model (GLM) and logistic regression techniques were used for analyzing the obtained data. The results of the study indicated that the gum yield is independent of stand density. Tapping has influence on gum yield. Trees tapped by sonki on the first of October at <b>medium</b> <b>stand</b> density have the highest gum with an average value of about 56 g/tree/season. Significant difference (p = 0. 021) was detected between two groups of dates; the first of October and first of November in <b>medium</b> <b>stand</b> density. The results also revealed that the most important variable influencing gum production was found to be diameter at breast height with 23. 95 cm threshold. Between 41 - 53 percent of subject trees produce gum less than 50 g/season. The results indicated that A. seyal species produces a very low quantity of gum talha (3. 6 - 4. 8 kg/ha) and for economic reasons, its tapping is not recommended. The findings of the regression analysis revealed to a model which could be used to estimate the yield of gum talha from A. seyal natural stands in the Umfakarin forest, South Kordofan, Sudan. Conducting experiments on the production of gum talha in permanent plot trials in different climatic regions of the Sudan is highly recommended...|$|E

40|$|With the {{tremendous}} growth that the Internet has been exhibiting {{during the last}} few years all around the world, marketers have started to use this new medium as a means to reach target audiences and as a tool to broadcast advertisements and communicate messages to consumers. As a result, a new type of advertising was born : "Internet advertising". Despite the fact that Internet advertising provides numerous benefits to the public and possesses several distinctive properties and advantages over the other forms of advertising, it was interesting to find out whether the consumers themselves, specifically whether the consumers living in Lebanon, had positive or negative attitudes toward this new type of advertising. More precisely, it was interesting to answer questions such as : Do consumers in Lebanon like Internet advertising? Do they attend to it? Do they have confidence in it? What is their reaction to it? How do they perceive the Internet advertising medium and where does this <b>medium</b> <b>stand</b> in their opinion as compared to the traditional advertising media tools? This research project is an attempt to find answers to all of the above questions. Indeed, the main objective sought through out this project is to examine and measure the attitudes and responses of the consumers in Lebanon toward Internet advertising. Several phases had to be completed throughout this project in order to achieve this objective. As a matter of fact, a theoretical part providing information about the Internet, Internet advertising, the Internet as compared to other advertising media tools and the Internet market in Lebanon was first executed. After that, the research questions that we wanted to answer thanks to this study that we intended to test through this research were formulated. Next, a questionnaire was developed and a survey was conducted according to the judgmental sampling technique on 255 students who were of course Internet users and who were pursuing university at four different universities.

40|$|Land {{clearance}} and conversion {{have resulted}} in habitat loss and anthropogenic fragmentation (including reduction of stand size and increased isolation), which {{are some of the}} greatest threats to plant populations today. It is of immense importance that we uncover the mechanisms behind these threats (i. e. impact on pollen and seed vectors and ecological consequences of this, leading to higher levels of inbreeding and reduced production and quality of fruits), because ignoring them would expose many anthropogenically disturbed plant populations to the risk of extinction. I investigated the impacts of stand size on temperate anthropogenically fragmented populations of the mangrove Avicennia marina in three Sydney and Minnamurra estuaries on the coast of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, near the southern limits of mangroves, where mangrove populations have suffered from anthropogenic fragmentation, dividing them into stands of varying size, from large stands of 10000 trees or more down to single isolated trees. My study investigated the impacts of stand size (in the present study comparisons were done between large stands of 1500 - 10000 trees, <b>medium</b> <b>stands</b> of 300 - 500 frees and small stands of up to ca. 100 trees) on pollination biology, mating systems and reproductive output. It also combined highly replicated surveys of pollinator activity and diversity and reproductive success, experimental tests of pollinator activity and the use of neutral DNA markers to estimate the effects of stand size on genetic diversity and mating systems. Today it is thought that a range of generalized pollinators pollinate mangroves. To test this hypothesis in temperate populations of A. marina flower visiting insects were captured during multiple surveys of flower visitation and it was investigated which species touched the stigma during foraging and which species carried pollen on body parts touching the stigma. Species that did were tested for pollen removal and deposition to establish their identity as pollinators...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{effectiveness}} of sapwood basal area as an estimator of individual tree basal area growth was tested on several young, even-aged Douglas-fir stands, stocked at varying densities. For all densities, ranging from partially open-grown to very overstocked stands, {{the null hypothesis}} {{that there was no}} association between sapwood basal area and one year basal area increment was rejected at the. 05 leve 1 of significance. The degree of association varied significantly between densities, but conclusions concerning how the {{effectiveness of}} sapwood basal area changes with increasing density were not possible, because of the variation in sample tree uniformity with respect to size among the densities. Comparisons were made between sapwood basal area and basal area with respect to their effectiveness in estimating basal area growth. With the exception of the light to <b>medium</b> density <b>stands,</b> sapwood basal area and basal area were equally effective estimators. For the light to <b>medium</b> density <b>stands</b> basal area was a significantly better estimator. Several explanations for the superiority of basal area were postulated, the most reasonable explanation being that the increment core estimates were inaccurate and more poorly correlated with actual sapwood basal area than were the basal area estimates due to the variability in the distribution of the sapwood on trees in partially open-grown positions. Because of the strong relationship between sapwood basal area and tree leaf area, sapwood basal area was used as a proxy variable to test for changes in leaf area or growth efficiency. Leaf area efficiency was defined as the basal area growth per unit of leaf area. The relationship between leaf area efficiency and stand density was found to be strongly linear with average efficiency decreasing significantly with increasing stand density. Lastly, a range of optimum leaf area stocking levels, as estimated through sapwood basal area measurements, with regards to maximizing wood production were examined...|$|R
40|$|Sarah Kember's contribution, {{which is}} part theory, part {{practice}} (the practice of fiction), seeks to offer an understanding of photography and photographs beyond that provided by the humanities (and by humanist discourse of both the art‐historical and the “visual cultural” kind). In the first part (“The Virtual Life of Photography”) she turns to Bergson to reinterpret Barthes's ontological enquiry in Cameras Lucida, and {{to the study of}} new media and science and technology studies (STS) to theorise photography's contemporary condition. Kember places photography firmly within its (new) media ecology: an ecology in which no <b>medium</b> <b>stands</b> alone, hard‐walled and untouched by others; this is an ecology in which convergence has taken place, not only between media, but also between technology, information, and the biological sciences, a condition within which photography is now entangled. Yet, she argues, {{we do not know what}} photography is (although she suggests how we might get closer to knowing) not only because of the limits of the theories seen as legitimate to address the question but also, following Bergson, because of a dominance of intellect and an atrophy of intuition as a method of enquiry. This, she suggests, is a situation that disables our ability to grasp an ontology of “becoming”, the very kind to which she sees photography belonging. In the second part (“Of Murder and Metamorphosis”) Kember proceeds to explore the kind of account that her analysis of photography's ontology and condition might generate. She considers a fictional report of (as she presents it) an invisible event – a photograph of a man being struck by lightening. In a mode that is itself a hybrid of academic research and fiction, Kember reflects upon how such an event might be understood when media studies, physics, biology, mythology, and medicine, as well as an address to photography as culture, are used to investigate processes that are always both natural and cultural, social and technological, material and metaphorical...|$|R

L is the velocity gradient tensor of the fluid velocity u. Such a generalized relation can be used for both low and high flow rates. Also developed in the present work is a linear theory to simplify the works of determining effects of G and M. It is found that nublap cannot depend on fluid velocity u itself. L affects nublap only through its symmetric part (velocity strain tensor D). The symmetry and positive-definiteness of H, the inverse of permeability tensor, follow logically from the three fundamental principles. Eigenvectors of H are the same as those of D with corresponding eigenvalues related to those of D through a quadratic relation. Six scalars formed by v and D (rather than the Reynolds number) are found to be scalars characterizing convective inertia effects. The incompressibility is found to be responsible for the vanishing of the first correction term to the classical Darcy's law as the Reynolds number tends to zero. The vanishing of D forms the applicability condition of classical Darcy's law. This requires u to be vanished, uniform, or in rigid body rotation. | Good {{separation of}} microscale with macroscale leads {{to the existence of}} a macroscale description of flows through porous media.

L is the velocity gradient tensor of the fluid velocity u. Such a generalized relation can be used for both low and high flow rates. Also developed in the present work is a linear theory to simplify the works of determining effects of G and M. It is found that ▽p cannot depend on fluid velocity u itself. L affects ▽p only through its symmetric part (velocity strain tensor D). The symmetry and positive-definiteness of H, the inverse of permeability tensor, follow logically from the three fundamental principles. Eigenvectors of H are the same as those of D with corresponding eigenvalues related to those of D through a quadratic relation. Six scalars formed by v and D (rather than the Reynolds number) are found to be scalars characterizing convective inertia effects. The incompressibility is found to be responsible for the vanishing of the first correction term to the classical Darcy's law as the Reynolds number tends to zero. The vanishing of D forms the applicability condition of classical Darcy's law. This requires u to be vanished, uniform, or in rigid body rotation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of agriculture {{to the national}} economy and economic stability of Serbia is great {{considering the fact that}} it makes a substantial part of the Gross domestic product. At the same time, the abundance of natural resources in Serbia, favorable geographic and climatic conditions and skilled labor force are resources which can make the local agriculture more competitive in the global market. The sector of small and <b>medium</b> enterprises (SMEs) <b>stands</b> out as an important factor in the economic growth and development of the countries in transition. Due to its numerous advantages over the large enterprises, such enterprises can accelerate the process of transition, increase the investment rate and reduce unemployment rate which is usually very high in the developing countries. Economic development of our country is based to a certain extent {{on the development of the}} SME sector which has a particularly important role in the agribusiness sector. This paper aims to provide an analysis of the SME sector in Serbia with the special focus on the agro-food system and its characteristics in the agriculture and food industry. Strengthening this sector will mean better business conditions in the Serbian economy, and the measures taken within economic and agricultural policies should be aimed at fostering innovation and competitiveness of small and medium enterprises...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunitySnowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), their famous 10 -year population cycle, and close association with Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) have been well-studied in boreal Canada for decades. Snowshoe hare range, however, extends south into the Sierra Nevada, Southern Rockies, upper Lake States, and Appalachian Mountains. Ecology of snowshoe hares in these more southerly regions is not as well understood, though hare research in the U. S. Rocky Mountains has accelerated over the past decade. Through this recent work, biologists have identified stands of young, densely-stocked conifers and those of mature, uneven-aged conifers as primary hare habitat in the region. Both stand types are characterized by dense understory vegetation that provides both browse and protection from elements and predators. From 1999 to 2006, Canada lynx were reintroduced into Colorado {{in an effort to}} restore a viable population to the southern portion of their former range. Snow tracking of released individuals and their progeny indicated that the majority of lynx winter diet in Colorado was comprised of snowshoe hares. Thus, long-term success of the lynx reintroduction effort hinges, at least partly, on maintaining adequate and widespread populations of snowshoe hares in the state. To improve our understanding of snowshoe hare ecology in the southern portion of their range, and enhance the ability of agency personnel to manage subalpine landscapes for snowshoe hares and lynx in Colorado, I conducted an observational study to evaluate purported primary hare habitat in the state. Specifically, I estimated snowshoe hare density, survival, recruitment, and movement indices in mature, uneven-aged spruce/fir (Picea engelmannii/Abies lasiocarpa) and 2 classes of young, even-aged lodgepole pine: 1) "small" lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, which were clear cut 20 - 25 years prior to this study and had regenerated into densely stocked stands with trees 2. 54 - 12. 69 cm in diameter, and 2) "medium" lodgepole pine stands (tree diameter = 12. 70 - 22. 85 cm) which were clear cut 40 - 60 years prior to this study and pre-commercially thinned ~ 20 years prior. I used a combination of mark-recapture and radio telemetry to estimate parameters. I sampled during both summer and winter to cover the range of annual variation in parameters. Animal density {{is one of the most}} common and fundamental parameters in wildlife ecology and was the first metric I used to evaluate the stand types. However, density can be difficult to estimate from mark-recapture data because animals move on and off of a trapping grid during a sampling session (i. e., lack of geographic closure). In Chapter 1, I developed a density estimator that uses ancillary radio telemetry locations, in addition to mark-recapture information, to account for lack of geographic closure resulting in relatively unbiased estimates of density. I derived the variance for this estimator, showed how individual covariates can be used to improve its performance, and provided an example using a subset of my snowshoe hare data. In Chapter 2, I completed a series of simulations to test the performance of this "telemetry" estimator over a range of sampling parameters (i. e., capture probabilities, sampling occasions, densities, and home range configurations) likely to be encountered in the field. I also compared the percent relative bias of the telemetry estimator to two other commonly used, contemporary estimators: spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR), and mean maximum distance moved (MMDM). The telemetry estimator performed best over most combinations of sampling parameters tested, but was inferior to SECR at low capture probabilities. The telemetry estimator was unaffected by home range configuration, whereas performance of SECR and MMDM was dependent on home range shape. Density is an important metric of habitat quality, but it can be misleading as some habitats with high animal density may function as population sinks. A complete assessment of habitat quality requires estimation of habitat-specific demographic rates in addition to density. In Chapter 3, I used the telemetry estimator to estimate snowshoe hare densities in each stand type during summer and winter, 2006 - 2009. I then combined mark-recapture and telemetry data to estimate survival via the Barker robust design model as implemented in Program MARK. Finally, I used age- and habitat-specific density and survival estimates to estimate recruitment in each stand type. During summer, hare densities were highest in small lodgepole (0. 20 ± 0. 01 (SE) to 0. 66 ± 0. 07 hares/ha), lowest in medium lodgepole pine (0. 01 ± 0. 04 to 0. 03 ± 0. 03 hares/ha), and intermediate in spruce/fir (0. 01 ± 0. 002 to 0. 26 ± 0. 08 hares/ha). During winter, densities became more similar among the 3 stand types. Annual survival was highest in spruce/fir (0. 14 ± 0. 05 (SE) to 0. 20 ± 0. 07) and similar among the 2 lodgepole stands types (0. 10 ± 0. 03 to 0. 16 ± 0. 06). Across stands, summer-winter survival was nearly twice as high as winter-summer survival. Recruitment of juvenile hares occurred during all 3 summers in small lodgepole stands, 2 of 3 summers in spruce/fir stands, and in only 1 of 3 summers in <b>medium</b> lodgepole. <b>Stand</b> attributes indicative of dense cover were positively correlated with density estimates and explain relatively more process variance in hare densities than other attributes. These same attributes were not positively correlated with hare survival. In addition to density and demography, movement is an informative aspect of animal ecology. Timing, extent, and frequency of movements can reflect predation pressure, food scarcity/abundance, availability of mates, or seasonal changes in any of these parameters. In Chapter 4, I used telemetry data to assess movement patterns of snowshoe hares at 2 scales (within-season, between-season) in all 3 stand types. Within-season movements of hares were larger during winter than during summer and tended to be larger in small lodgepole stands. Within-season movements of males tended to be larger than females during summer, possibly as a means of maximizing mating opportunities. Movements were similar between the sexes during winter. Hares in both small and <b>medium</b> lodgepole <b>stands</b> tended to make larger movements between seasons than hares in spruce/fir stands, possibly reflecting the variable value of these stands as mediated by snow depth. In summary, snowshoe hare density, survival, and recruitment were relatively low in thinned, <b>medium</b> lodgepole <b>stands</b> compared to spruce/fir or small lodgepole. Thus, while hares occur in these stands, they do not appear to be capable of supporting self-sustaining hare populations, and this stand type is probably less important than mature spruce/fir and small lodgepole stand types. Management for snowshoe hares (and lynx) in central Colorado should focus on maintaining the latter. Given the more persistent nature of spruce/fir compared to small lodgepole, and the fact that such stands cover considerably more area, mature spruce/fir may be the most valuable stand type for snowshoe hares in the state...|$|R

COSmIC <b>stands</b> for Cosmic Simulation Chamber, a laboratory chamber where interstellar and planetary analogs are generated, processed and analyzed. It is composed of a pulsed discharge nozzle (PDN) expansion that generates a free jet supersonic expansion in a plasma cavity coupled to two ultrahigh-sensitivity, complementary in situ diagnostics: a cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) system for photonic detection and a Reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ReTOF-MS) for mass detection. This setup allows the study of molecules, ions and solids under the low temperature and high vacuum conditions that are required to simulate some interstellar, circumstellar and planetary physical environments providing new fundamental insights on the molecular level into the processes that are critical to the chemistry in the ISM, circumstellar and planet forming regions, and on icy objects in the Solar System. Recent laboratory results that were obtained using COSmIC will be discussed, in particular the progress that have been achieved in monitoring in the laboratory the formation of solid particles from their gas-phase molecular precursors in environments as varied as circumstellar outflow and planetary atmospheres...|$|R

In many cases, machines of high investment are used in wood harvesting without adequate operation planning; consequently, the cost per hour of these machines, which is high, could be reduced. Using technological resources such as the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) integrated with the Global Positioning System (GPS), which are the basis of precision harvesting. In this research, a technological tool capable of calculating and optimizing the average skidding distance of the forwarder was developed. It was used in stands of different sizes and formats through mathematical techniques and available functionalities in the Geographic Information System GRASS. The developed tool, called optimized model, divides the stand in small parts in relation to shorter skidding distances. The main variable considered was the alignment of plantation. The model was tested in eucalypt stands located in the State of São Paulo. Sixteen stands were randomly selected: eight with a rectangular polygon form, and eight with irregular polygon form. The main variables were collected in these stands. Results showed that the optimized model developed, is efficient and flexible. It was possible to divide the stands in small parts resulting in smaller skidding <b>medium</b> distances. The <b>stands</b> with irregular form had shorter skidding medium distances than the rectangular stands...|$|R

To achieve {{the objective of the}} study, thirty (30) SMEs in Victoria Falls were selected. An openended questionnaire was distributed to each owner or Manager of the SMEs selected for the study and the data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings reveals that SMEs do not maintain proper accounts as a result they cannot be able to identify, assess their business performance effectively. More so, about 70 % of respondents indicated that did not have adequate funding, while 23 % had post secondary qualifications and in all cases segregation of duties was minimal and the decision making was left to the owners of businesses. Compared to corporatcs where directors are accountable to shareholders, aiming at improving shareholder wealth, with SMEâ€™s there is no such accountability. The study recommend among others that SMEs should try to maintain proper books of accounts so {{that they will be able}} to plan, identify, assess and manage performance effectively and efficiently, in addition SMEs owners as a matter of necessity should undertake to attain entrepreneurial skills or alternatively engage personnel with the requisite skills. Proprietors should also endeavor to improve on the management style of businesses in as much they are owned by them, the businesses need to survive and grow to have a competitive edge against other businesses that are competing for the same market. In as much as the government seeks to raise its revenue collections in taxes, the study recommends that the government reduces such taxes as they are beyond the reach of small enterprises who end up adopting unethical means to evade such taxes. Also the research recommends that that the indigenisation program is made transparent and known to all while funds should be availed to the up and coming organizations at minimal interest rates and minimum requirements. With a change in the proprietors view of businesses and the government intervening by reducing taxes and providing funds, small to <b>medium</b> organizations <b>stand</b> to grow considerably...|$|R
30|$|Natural pioneer and {{introduced}} plantation/invader species {{can become a}} partner in forest rehabilitation towards recovery of biodiversity and productivity. The natural succession process with the invasive alien plants as the pioneer nurse stand {{can be used to}} reduce costs. The aliens provide a rapid ground cover, which prevents erosion, adds litter to a degraded site which would help to restore nutrient cycling and increase the moisture content of the growing <b>medium.</b> The nurse <b>stand</b> provides shade and reduces strong wind to facilitate the establishment of shade-tolerant natural forest species and thereby recover the biodiversity as in any native pioneer stand. The results from the various rehabilitation actions according to this particular manipulative approach have shown that a pioneer or planted or naturalized nurse stand can be converted to natural forest, cost-effectively, if it is not in the normal fire zone. The manipulative ‘interference’ through selective thinning facilitates and speeds up the development towards a natural forest community. A practice of repeated clearing of invader plants, for example in the riparian zone, can be turned into a system of regrowing forest with highly reduced maintenance costs. The removed stems could be used for laths, poles, firewood, timber, depending on the development stage of the nurse stand. Medicinal plant crops and other forest species could be harvested from such stands (Geldenhuys & Delvaux 2007). The practice therefore provides options for small business development parallel to the rehabilitation process. This new approach requires a different mind-set providing a variety of benefits to the owner of the land, as well as adjacent communities in many areas.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the competitive ability with weeds of the short-strawed Gaines variety wheat and taller growing varieties under different fertility levels at three experimental locations. The experiments were designed so that the effects of variety, nitrogen fertilization, and weed competition could be evaluated. The interactions between these factors were also studied. Ryegrass (Loolium app.) and downy brome (Bromus tectorum) were the two weed species studied. Under high winter rainfall and ryegrass competition yields of wheat were seriously impaired in both the short and tall growing wheat varieties tested. As rates of nitrogen increased yields of wheat did not increase where a <b>medium</b> or heavy <b>stand</b> of ryegrass was present. Yield of wheat was reduced under high nitrogen and high ryegrass competition. A response to 60 pounds of nitrogen per acre was noted where no ryegrass competition was present. One hundred twenty pounds of nitrogen did not increase yields appreciably, especially in the Gaines variety. In the two remaining experiments, response to nitrogen fertilization was not as prominent due to lack of moisture throughout the growing season. However, downy brome competition decreased yields at one location under all three fertility levels. At the other location a poor stand of downy brome and arid conditions accounted for the lack of competitive effects. No differences were noted in competing abilities of the tall vs. the short growing varieties. In general it was concluded that in order to get maximum response from nitrogen fertilization in wheat, weeds would have to be controlled...|$|R
40|$|Collisionless shocks form {{ahead of}} coronal mass ejections (CMEs) when the CME speed exceeds the Alfven {{speed of the}} ambient plasma in the corona and interplanetary <b>medium.</b> The shock <b>stands</b> at a {{distance}} from the CME flux rope that depends on the shock Mach number, the geometry of the driver, and the adiabatic index. While the shock ahead of the CME has been observed {{for a long time in}} the in situ data, it has been identified recently near the Sun in the coronagraphic and EUV images. Unlike in situ observations, the imaging observations are two dimensional, so one can better discern the CME-shock relationship near the Sun. Gopalswamy and Yashiro demonstrated that the coronal magnetic field can be derived from the shock standoff distance measured in coronagraphic images. The method involves measuring the standoff distance, the radius of curvature of the flux rope, and assuming the value of the adiabatic index and deriving the Alfvenic Mach number. The next step is to derive the Alfvenic Mach number from the measured shock speed and an estimate of the local solar wind speed. The final step involves deriving the magnetic field from the Alfven speed by measuring the local plasma density either from coronagraphic (polarized brightness) images or from the band-splitting of type II radio bursts. In this paper, we derive the combined magnetic field profile from near the Sun to the edge of the LASCO field of view (1. 5 to 30 solar radii) and compare it with the current model profiles...|$|R
