5000|$|... “Robert <b>Mangold’s</b> paintings,” wrote Michael Kimmelman in the New York Times in 1997, “are more {{complicated}} to describe than they seem, which is partly what’s good about them: {{the way they}} invite intense scrutiny, which, {{in the nature of}} good art, is its own reward.” His works are comprised often of simple elements which are put together through complex means. <b>Mangold's</b> work challenges the typical connotations of what a painting is or could be, and his works often appear as objects rather than images. Elements refer often to architectural elements or have the feeling of an architect's hands. He almost always works in extensive series, often carried through both paintings and works on paper.|$|R
