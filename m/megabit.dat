5|$|Mother 2 was {{designed}} to fit within an eight <b>megabit</b> limit, but was expanded in size and scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 <b>megabit</b> cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994. With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches. Itoi told Weekly Famitsu that Shigeru Miyamoto liked the game {{and that it was}} the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. Mother 2 would release in North America about a year later.|$|E
5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it {{was not included in the}} game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 <b>megabit</b> cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 <b>megabit</b> battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E

As {{two of the}} three frequencies provide about eight <b>megabits</b> per video channel and the other is only about six <b>megabits</b> per video channel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} specification for ROM size {{is up to}} 330 <b>megabits,</b> {{hence the}} system displaying [...] "MAX 330 MEGA PRO-GEAR SPEC" [...] upon startup. While no technical advances were required to achieve it, some games over 100 <b>megabits,</b> such as Top Hunter, followed this screen by displaying an animation proclaiming [...] "THE 100MEGA SHOCK!". The original ROM size specification was later enhanced on cartridges with bank switching memory technology, increasing the maximum cartridge size to around 716 <b>megabits.</b> These new cartridges also cause the system to display [...] "GIGA POWER PRO-GEAR SPEC" [...] upon startup or during attract mode, indicating this enhancement.|$|R
25|$|The Auckland Chamber of Commerce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} if Telecom did not {{invest in a}} next-generation high-speed network, comparable with that of other Western nations, they would fund a private fibre-optic based service in the 100 <b>megabit</b> speed range. The proposed coverage {{of this would be}} within 200m of a path running south from Auckland CBD (situated to allow as many businesses as possible to connect). Any company or private individual within this range would be offered a connection.|$|E
25|$|The {{average length}} of time that posts are {{able to stay in}} the group before being deleted is {{commonly}} called the retention time. Generally the larger Usenet servers have enough capacity to archive several years of binary content even when flooded with new data at the maximum daily speed available. A good binaries service provider must not only accommodate users of fast connections (3 <b>megabit)</b> but also users of slow connections (256 kilobit or less) who need more time to download content {{over a period of several}} days or weeks.|$|E
500|$|According to its specifications, the Links' Wi-Fi {{will cover}} a radius of 150 feet (46 m) [...] to 400 feet (120 m).

The fast speeds make LinkNYC only gigabit-speed {{internet}} service provider in North America. LinkNYC's routers have neither a bandwidth cap nor a time limit for usage, meaning that users can use LinkNYC Wi-Fi {{for as long as they}} need to. The free phone calls are also available for unlimited use. The network is only intended for use in public spaces, though this may be subject to change in the future. In the future, the LinkNYC network could also be used to [...] "connect lighting systems, smart meters, traffic networks, connected cameras and other IoT systems," [...] as well as for utility monitoring and for 5G installations.|$|E

500|$|The EarthBound fan {{community}} anticipated a sequel, and a North American {{release of}} Mother 3 was announced as EarthBound 64. [...] Nintendo displayed a playable {{version of the}} game at their 1999 Space World trade show, where IGN described the development's progress as [...] "very far along" [...] and half complete. In April 2000, IGN estimated the game's development as [...] "safe {{to assume that the}} game is nearing its final stages of completion". The game struggled to find a firm release date, and was expected to release in Japan before a North American version would be considered. At the time, the 64DD was only released in Japan. Nintendo chose not to show the game at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo, though IGN expected to see a finished version of the game at Nintendo's 2000 Space World. After a period of silence, Nintendo announced that the game would be a 256 <b>megabit</b> cartridge for the Nintendo 64 (similar to [...] ) instead of a 64DD game. Mother producer Satoru Iwata cancelled the game altogether prior to the 2000 Space World, and Itoi announced the cancellation in late August 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Award-winning {{composer}} Jeremy Soule {{was signed}} to compose the game's score. [...] "It {{will be a}} Star Wars score, but {{it will all be}} original, and probably the things that will remain will be the Force themes and things like that," [...] Gallo said. Soule was unable to write a full orchestral score for Knights of the Old Republic due to technical limitations: [...] "At the time we only had an 8 <b>megabit</b> per second MIDI system. That was state of the art... I had to fool people into thinking they were hearing a full orchestra. I’d write woodwinds and drums, or woodwinds, horns and drums, or strings and drums and brass. I couldn’t run the whole orchestra at once, it was impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC). This is {{data channel}} which uses an {{additional}} wavelength usually outside the EDFA amplification band (at 1,510nm, 1,620nm, 1,310nm or another proprietary wavelength). The OSC carries {{information about the}} multi-wavelength optical signal as well as remote conditions at the optical terminal or EDFA site. It is also normally used for remote software upgrades and user (i.e., network operator) Network Management information. It is the multi-wavelength analogue to SONET's DCC (or supervisory channel). ITU standards suggest that the OSC should utilize an OC-3 signal structure, though some vendors have opted to use 100 <b>megabit</b> Ethernet or another signal format. [...] Unlike the 1550nm multi-wavelength signal containing client data, the OSC is always terminated at intermediate amplifier sites, where it receives local information before re-transmission.|$|E

5000|$|During the 16-bit {{game console}} era, the <b>megabit</b> was a {{commonly}} used {{measure of the}} size (computer data storage capacity) of game cartridges. This size represented one mebibit (Mibit). The vast majority of SNES and Mega Drive (Genesis) games were produced on 8 <b>megabit</b> cartridges, although other sizes such as 4, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48 <b>megabit</b> cartridges appeared.

50|$|Assuming equal {{operating}} parameters to an 802.11g network achieving 54 <b>megabits</b> per second (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna), an 802.11n network can achieve 72 <b>megabits</b> per second (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna and 400 ns guard interval); 802.11n's speed may {{go up to}} 150 <b>megabits</b> per second if there aren't other Bluetooth, microwave or Wi-Fi emissions in the neighborhood by using two 20 MHz channels in 40 MHz mode. If more antennas are used, then 802.11n can go up to 288 <b>megabits</b> per second in 20 MHz mode with four antennas, or 600 <b>megabits</b> per second in 40 MHz mode with four antennas and 400 ns guard interval. Because the 2.4 GHz band is seriously congested in most urban areas, 802.11n networks usually have more success in increasing data rate by utilizing more antennas in 20 MHz mode rather than by operating in the 40 MHz mode, as the 40 MHz mode requires a relatively free radio spectrum which is only available in rural areas away from cities. Thus, network engineers installing an 802.11n network should strive to select routers and wireless clients with the most antennas possible (one, two, three or four as specified by the 802.11n standard) {{and try to make}} sure that the network's bandwidth will be satisfactory even on the 20 MHz mode.|$|R

50|$|Enhanced Small Disk Interface (ESDI) was {{an attempt}} to {{minimize}} controller design time by supporting multiple data rates with a standard data encoding scheme; this was usually negotiated automatically by the disk drive and controller; most of the time, however, 15 or 20 <b>megabit</b> ESDI disk drives were not downward compatible (i.e. a 15 or 20 <b>megabit</b> disk drive would not run on a 10 <b>megabit</b> controller). ESDI disk drives typically also had jumpers to set the number of sectors per track and (in some cases) sector size.|$|E
50|$|The <b>megabit</b> {{is widely}} used when {{referring}} to data transfer rates of computer networks or telecommunications systems. Network transfer rates and download speeds often use the <b>megabit</b> as the amount transferred per time unit, e.g., a 100 Mbit/s (<b>megabit</b> per second) Fast-Ethernet connection, or a 10 Mbit/s Internet access service, whereas the sizes of data units (files) transferred over these networks are often measured in megabytes. To achieve a transfer rate of one megabyte per second one needs a network connection with a transfer rate of eight megabits per second.|$|E
