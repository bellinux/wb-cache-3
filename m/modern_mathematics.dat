25|$|The Euler {{characteristic}} {{was originally}} defined for polyhedra {{and used to}} prove various theorems about them, including the classification of the Platonic solids. Leonhard Euler, for whom the concept is named, was responsible {{for much of this}} early work. In <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics,</b> the Euler characteristic arises from homology and, more abstractly, homological algebra.|$|E
25|$|Functors {{were first}} {{considered}} in algebraic topology, where algebraic objects (like the fundamental group) are associated to topological spaces, and algebraic homomorphisms are associated to continuous maps. Nowadays, functors are used throughout <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics</b> to relate various categories. Thus, functors are generally applicable in areas within mathematics that category theory {{can make an}} abstraction of.|$|E
25|$|Although Euclidean {{spaces are}} no longer {{considered}} to be the only possible setting for a geometry, they act as prototypes for other geometric objects. Ideas and terminology from Euclidean geometry (both traditional and analytic) are pervasive in <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics,</b> where other geometric objects share many similarities with Euclidean spaces, share part of their structure, or embed Euclidean spaces.|$|E

25|$|The Bohr–Sommerfeld {{quantization}} conditions lead {{to questions}} in <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b> Consistent semiclassical quantization condition requires {{a certain type}} of structure on the phase space, which places topological limitations on the types of symplectic manifolds which can be quantized. In particular, the symplectic form should be the curvature form of a connection of a Hermitian line bundle, which is called a prequantization.|$|E
25|$|In <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics,</b> {{given the}} {{multitude}} of geometries, {{the concept of a}} line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.|$|E
25|$|This {{book has}} become a {{standard}} textbook in many countries, and is often cited as a reference in research articles. The book was published in 1990 by Academic Press. Its aim is to give an introduction {{to one of the}} most dynamic areas of <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b> It is directed at first and second year graduate students intending to specialise in research in operator algebras and at interested researchers from other areas, especially quantum physicists.|$|E

25|$|A line in Plutarch's Table Talk {{states that}} Hipparchus counted 103049 {{compound}} propositions {{that can be}} formed from ten simple propositions. 103049 is the tenth Schröder–Hipparchus number, which counts the number of ways of adding one or more pairs of parentheses around consecutive subsequences {{of two or more}} items in any sequence of ten symbols. This has led to speculation that Hipparchus knew about enumerative combinatorics, a field of mathematics that developed independently in <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the theory}} of linear systems is the basis and a {{fundamental}} part of linear algebra, a subject which is used {{in most parts of}} <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b> Computational algorithms for finding the solutions {{are an important part of}} numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model or computer simulation of a relatively complex system.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} {{occupies a}} central place in <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics</b> and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. Initially {{a study of}} systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, and it becomes even more {{important to understand the}} intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.|$|E

25|$|Complex {{social network}} {{analysis}} is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional {{social network analysis}}, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics</b> (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis {{are coming out of}} the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} of set theory {{was such that}} debate on the paradoxes {{did not lead to}} its abandonment. The work of Zermelo in 1908 and Abraham Fraenkel in 1922 resulted in the set of axioms ZFC, which became the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory. The work of analysts such as Henri Lebesgue demonstrated the great mathematical utility of set theory, which has since become woven into the fabric of <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b> Set theory is commonly used as a foundational system, although in some areas category theory is thought to be a preferred foundation.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, {{it became}} the {{standard}} to build mathematical theories on axiomatic set theory. The creation of axiomatically founded generalized theories, such as the general topology, served among other things to single out the common structural core for various specific cases or regions and then set up an abstract theory, which contained all these parts as special cases. This brought a great success {{in the form of}} simplification and harmonization and ultimately brought on economy of thought with itself. Hausdorff himself highlighted this aspect in the Principles. The topological chapter the basic concepts are methodologically a pioneering effort, and they showed the way for the development of <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{first case}} in which {{seemingly}} unrelated mathematical questions were studied {{with the help of}} permutations occurred around 1770, when Joseph Louis Lagrange, in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the roots of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of Évariste Galois, in Galois theory, which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics</b> there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.|$|E
25|$|By {{its great}} generality, {{abstract}} algebra {{can often be}} applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, {{and can be used}} to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics.</b> Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.|$|E
25|$|In modern terms, {{the problem}} is an inverse problem, an attempt to deduce the {{parameters}} of a mathematical model from observed data. Though {{the problem is}} a simple one for <b>modern</b> <b>mathematics</b> after the advent of electronic computers, at the time it involved much laborious hand calculation. Adams began by assuming a nominal position for the hypothesised body, using the empirical Bode's law. He then calculated the path of Uranus using the assumed position of the perturbing body and calculated the difference between his calculated path and the observations, in modern terms the residuals. He then adjusted the characteristics of the perturbing body in a way suggested by the residuals and repeated the process, a process similar to regression analysis.|$|E
