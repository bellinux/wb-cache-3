A 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology, including color, meristic variation, spine, dermal denticles (tooth-like scales) and teeth of different populations. Two distinct species emerged: the smaller M. alfredi found in the Indo-Pacific and tropical east Atlantic, and the larger M. birostris found throughout tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. The former is more coastal while the latter is more ocean-going and migratory. A 2010 study on mantas around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between M. birostris and M. alfredi.|$|E

With reference to examples from Northem Sotho and Zulu, this article demonstrates that zero <b>morphs</b> and empty <b>morphs,</b> as realizations of morphemes, fail to comply {{in one way or}} another with the above-mentioned characteristics posited for morphemes.

40|$|Performing the {{biomimetic}} <b>morphing</b> method on a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) wing is {{very challenging}} tasks {{due to the}} MAV wing size limitation, limited energy budgets, complicated <b>morphing</b> mechanism and complex aeroelastic interactions. These issues had restricted the application of <b>morphing</b> wing on MAV wing platform. As a result, the impact of twist <b>morphing</b> on MAV wing aerodynamics and structural performances was not fully understood. Thus, this thesis presents the investigation of wing structural, aerodynamics performance and flow structure formations on a basic twist <b>morphing</b> MAV wing named as Twist <b>Morphing</b> wing. A series of <b>morphing</b> force intensity was imposed on Twist <b>Morphing</b> wing design to elucidate the impact of twist <b>morphing</b> mobility. Fully coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulation is the main methodology used in this works. The wing structural and airflow field problems over Twist <b>Morphing</b> wing were solved based on a three-dimensional (3 D) linear quasi-static structural coupled with steady state, incompressible Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes - Shear Stress Turbulence (RANS-SST) flow. The validation on aerodynamic performances showed good correlation between the FSI and wind tunnel test results. The wing structural results showed that Twist <b>Morphing</b> wings had produced high geometric twist magnitude (e), which in turn, induced higher lift coefficient (Cʟ) and drag coefficient (Cᴅ) performances on the wing. The flow structure investigations revealed that this benevolent and malevolent aerodynamics attitude contributed by low-pressure intensity and strong tip vortex (TV) strength induced on Twist <b>Morphing</b> wing. These phenomenon had turned out greater in Twist <b>Morphing</b> wing with higher <b>morphing</b> force (5 N and 3 N) configurations. However, Twist <b>Morphing</b> wing had also exhibited poor maximum aerodynamic efficiency (Cʟ/Cᴅ max) performances. The massive drag coefficient distribution had overwhelmed the successive increase in lift coefficient generation, which consequently plunged the maximum aerodynamic efficiency distribution magnitude on Twist <b>Morphing</b> wings...|$|R
5|$|As {{the number}} of known {{specimens}} increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered {{what appeared to be}} two distinct body types, or morphs, similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' <b>morph</b> while the other was termed ''. Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex, with the 'robust' <b>morph</b> usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the 'robust' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also ostensibly to allow eggs to pass out of the reproductive tract, as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>morph</b> {{accounts}} for 50% {{of the adult}} males, and they make {{the same number of}} attempts to court females, but using a different courting display.

He then loads the semen into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two weapons {{new to the}} Metroid series: the tri-splitting Spazer Laser Beam, and the Plasma Beam, which {{passes through}} enemies when shot. Samus can only equip one beam at a time; however, she can switch between them by returning to where they are first found. Metroid II features the Space Jump, a new suit enhancement that allows Samus to jump infinitely and access otherwise unreachable areas. The game also sees the return of Samus' <b>Morph</b> Ball, a mode in which she curls up into a ball to travel through small tunnels. In addition, the game {{is the first in}} the series to feature the Spider Ball and Spring Ball. The Spider Ball allows Samus to climb most walls or ceilings, giving her freedom to explore both the surfaces and ceilings of caverns, and the Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while curled up into a ball in the <b>Morph</b> Ball form.|$|E
40|$|Student participant-witnesses {{produced}} 4 composites of unfamiliar {{faces with}} a system that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve appearance of artificial faces. <b>Morphs</b> of 4 composites produced by different witnesses (between-witness <b>morphs)</b> were judged better likenesses (Experiment 1) and were more frequently named (Experiment 2) by participants who {{were familiar with the}} target actors than were <b>morphs</b> of 4 composites produced by a single witness (within-witness <b>morphs).</b> Within-witness <b>morphs</b> were judged better likenesses and more frequently named than the best or the first-produced individual composites. The same results for likeness judgments were observed after possible artifacts in the comparison of between- and within-witness <b>morphs</b> were eliminated (Experiment 3). Experiment 4 showed that both internal and external features were better represented in <b>morphs</b> than in the original composites, although the representation of internal features improved more. The results suggest that <b>morphing</b> improves the representation of faces by reducing random error. Between-witness <b>morphs</b> yield more benefit than within-witness <b>morphs</b> by reducing consistent but idiosyncratic errors of individual witnesses. The experiments provide the first demonstration of an advantage for within-witness <b>morphs</b> produced using a single system. Experiment 2 provides the first demonstration of a reliable advantage for between-witness <b>morphs</b> in the most forensically relevant task: naming a composite of a familiar person produced by a witness who was unfamiliar with the target. <b>Morphing</b> would enhance the recognition of facial composites of criminals. Within-witness <b>morphing</b> provides a methodology for use in crimes in which the victim is the only witness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) ...|$|R

Using an idea of intersection of two polygons (called core) the problem of <b>morphing</b> polygons is decomposed to several sub-problems of <b>morphing</b> polylines. We describe a solution of <b>morphing</b> problem for the case when the core consists of one polygon.

5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal scales of the forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three main colour morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with black and white, giving the impression of vertical black and white bars on the lips. The second colour <b>morph,</b> from the west African savanna, is banded black and yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, the lips, chin and throat are yellow. The third colour <b>morph,</b> from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily speckled with brown or black, and specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails.

40|$|<b>Morphing</b> {{aircraft}} offer superior properties {{as compared}} to non-morphing aircraft. They can achieve this by adapting their shape depending on the requirements of various conflicting flight conditions. These shape changes are often associated with large deformations and strains, and hence dedicated <b>morphing</b> concepts are developed {{to carry out the}} required changes in shape. Such intricate mechanisms are often heavy, which reduces, or even completely cancels, the performance increase of the <b>morphing</b> aircraft. Part of this weight penalty is determined by the required actuators and associated batteries, which are mainly driven by the required actuation force and energy. Two underexposed influences on the actuation force and energy are the flight condition at which <b>morphing</b> should take place and the order of the <b>morphing</b> manoeuvres, also called <b>morphing</b> scheduling. This paper aims at highlighting the importance of both influences by using a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with different <b>morphing</b> mechanisms as an example. The results in this paper are generated using a <b>morphing</b> aircraft analysis and design code that was developed at the Delft University of Technology. The importance of the flight condition and a proper <b>morphing</b> schedule is demonstrated by investigating the required actuation forces for various flight conditions and <b>morphing</b> sequences. More importantly, the results show that there is not necessarily one optimal flight condition or <b>morphing</b> schedule and a tradeoff needs to be made.
