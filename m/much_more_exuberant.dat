5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E

Odhuvars, Sthanikars or Kattalaiyars offer short musical programmes in the temples by singing the devotional Thevaram songs. In sharp contrast with the restrained and intellectual nature of Carnatic music, Tamil folk music tends to be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>exuberant.</b> Popular forms of Tamil folk music include the , a form of music performed with a bow, the urumee mellam or Naiyandi mellam which incorporates the use of the urumee and the , ballads that convey folklore and folk history.|$|E
50|$|Henri Le Fauconnier {{had already}} in 1912 {{become a member}} of the Amsterdam Moderne Kunstkring (Modern Art Circle), {{together}} with Fernand Léger and Piet Mondriaan. A few years after the formation of the Bergense School in Groningen another School was formed in 1917-1918, called De Ploeg. Jan Wiegers was its central figure. De Ploeg also worked in an expressionist style, but its use of colour was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>exuberant.</b> The group was notably influenced by the German Expressionism of Ernst Kirchner and its social outlook was influenced by the upcoming socialism.|$|E

50|$|The Chilean Coastal Range (Cordillera de la Costa) is a {{mountain}} range {{that runs from}} north to south along the Pacific coast of South America parallel to the Andean Mountains, extending from Morro de Arica in the north to Taitao Peninsula, where it ends at the Chile Triple Junction, in the south. The range has a strong influence on the climate of Chile since it produces a rain shadow to the east. Because of this the vegetation growing on the seaward slopes is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> than in the interior. Compared to the coastal lowlands and the Intermediate Depression it is sparsely populated with land use varying from protected areas to grazing and silviculture. The range is present in all Chilean regions except for Coquimbo Region and Magallanes Region.|$|E

40|$|Dendrite {{size and}} {{morphology}} are key determinants of the functional properties of neurons and neural circuits. Here {{we show that}} CD 40, {{a member of the}} TNF receptor superfamily, is a major regulator of dendrite growth and elaboration in the developing brain. The dendrites of hippocampal excitatory neurons were markedly stunted in Cd 40 -/- mice, whereas those of striatal inhibitory neurons were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>exuberant.</b> These striking and opposite phenotypic changes were also observed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from Cd 40 -/- mice and were rescued by soluble CD 40. The changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from Cd 40 -/- mice were mimicked in neurons of Cd 40 +/+ mice by treatment with soluble CD 40 L and were dependent on PKC-β and PKC-γ, respectively. These results suggest that CD 40 -activated CD 40 L reverse signalling has striking and opposite effects on the growth and elaboration of dendrites among major classes of brain neurons by PKC-dependent mechanisms...|$|E

50|$|The Sydney Town Hall, {{started in}} 1868, is a {{comparable}} mixture {{and its main}} elevation is broadly similar.

50|$|Eccentric {{dance is}} {{a style of}} dance {{performance}} in which the moves are unconventional and individualistic. It developed as a genre in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries {{as a result of}} the influence of African and exotic dancers on the traditional styles of clog and tap dancing. Instead of holding the body stiff and straight in the style of a jig, acrobatics such as flips and contortions were used in a <b>more</b> <b>exuberant,</b> expressive and idiosyncratic way.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Salizzo {{launched}} SportsCafe {{through new}} production company Leftfield, with initial sponsorship from the TAB. This {{role was to}} define his career, and the shows success translated into fame and recognition for Salizzo. His role on the show as both producer and presenter often involved bringing into line the other, <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> hosts, as well as behind-the-scenes work. At its peak, production of the show led to Salizzo part-owning a restaurant and bar complex on Aucklands Princes Wharf named Leftfield.|$|R
5000|$|Textural {{contrasts}} abound. The [...] "Credo", {{typically the}} longest section of any mass setting, uses 40 voices in many places, but intersperses many passages for smaller units. Sections {{of the mass}} which normally have a fuller, <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> musical setting, such as the [...] "Et Resurrexit" [...] (and He was resurrected) have all 40 voices, while those which more sedate or sorrowful, for example the [...] "Crucifixus", have the smallest groupings (in this case, only eight voices of one choir sing).|$|R
50|$|Ayres' {{early works}} are {{typically}} made with thin vinyl paint {{in a limited}} number of colours arranged in relatively simple forms, but later works in oil paint are <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> and very colourful, with a thick impasto being used. The titles of her paintings, such as Anthony and Cleopatra (1982) and A Midsummer Night (1990), are usually given after the painting is completed and do not directly describe the content of the painting, but rather are intended to resonate with the general mood of the work.|$|R
50|$|Richard Hildreth (1807-1865), a Yankee {{scholar and}} {{political}} writer, wrote a thorough highly precise {{history of the}} nation down to 1820. His six-volume History of the United States (1849-52) was dry and heavily factual—he rarely {{made a mistake in}} terms of names, dates, events and speeches. His Federalist views and dry style lost market share to George Bancroft's <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> and democratic tomes. Hildreth explicitly favored the Federalist Party and denigrated the Jeffersonians. He was an active political commentator and leading anti-slavery intellectual, so President Lincoln gave him a choice diplomatic assignment in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|After 1630 van Delen’s style became <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> and palace exteriors {{became his}} {{favourite}} subject. Van Delen’s palette also became lighter and brighter. [...] The fullness of the Antwerp Baroque style had by then taken a firm {{grasp of the}} artist. His palette also became brighter and lighter. The buildings he depicted became dominated by pink, white and black marble and were from then on decorated with an excess of sculpture. Around 1640 van Delen produced his most ambitious works, which were more sober in colour. Thereafter his output rapidly declined.|$|R

5000|$|Abhang or abhanga (अभंग) {{is a form}} of devotional poetry sung {{in praise}} of the Hindu god Vitthala, also known as Vithoba. The word [...] "abhang" [...] comes from a for [...] "non-" [...] and bhang for [...] "ending" [...] or [...] "interrupting", in other words, a flawless, {{continuous}} process, in this case referring to a poem. [...] By contrast, the devotional songs known as Bhajans focus on the inward journey. Abhangs are <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> expressions of the communitarian experience. Abhanga is considered a form of the ovi. Abhangs are sung during pilgrimage to the temples of Pandharpur, by the devotees.|$|R
25|$|A {{different}} and <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> Baroque style with some Rococo touches, more {{reminiscent of the}} style in Central Europe, developed {{in the northern part}} of Portugal. The Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni designed the church and the spectacular granite tower of São Pedro dos Clérigos in Porto. One of his successors was the painter and architect José de Figueiredo Seixas, who had been one of his disciples. The sanctuary Bom Jesus do Monte near Braga, built by the architect Carlos Luis Ferreira Amarante is a notable example of a pilgrimage site with a monumental, cascading Baroque stairway that climbs 116 metres. This last example already shows the shift in style to Neo-classicism.|$|R
50|$|The hôtel particulier {{was built}} by the architect, Auguste Brion (1861-1940), for himself in 1904. Brion, the scion {{of a family of}} artists {{directly}} related to the legendary Friederike Brion, was a prolific architect who built four other houses in the same street between 1903 and 1905. The hôtel is executed in a <b>more</b> <b>exuberant</b> style than most of Brion's other realizations. For the structure, the architect used timber framing and walls of reinforced concrete the surface of which he then covered with stonemasonry. Between 1926 and 1972, the Hôtel Brion was used as an actual hotel, called Hôtel Marguerite. It is again in private hands since 1980.|$|R
