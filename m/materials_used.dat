The study was educational Research and Development (R & D). The procedure of the study was conducting the needs analysis, writing the course grid, developing the first draft of the supplementary writing <b>materials</b> <b>using</b> task based language teaching, trying out and evaluating the first draft of the supplementary writing <b>materials</b> <b>using</b> task based language teaching by the expert, revising the first draft of the supplementary writing <b>materials</b> <b>using</b> task based language teaching, writing the final draft of supplementary writing <b>materials</b> <b>using</b> task based language teaching. The data from the interview was analyzed qualitatively and the data from the questionnaires were analyzed quantitatively through the descriptive statistics. The result of the needs analysis showed that the students needed interesting additional writing materials. The product of this supplementary writing materials is entitled as Supplementary Writing <b>Materials</b> <b>using</b> Task Based Language Teaching which is accompanied with study guide book. The supplementary English writing materials’ book consists of three units. Each unit has 15 tasks and it consists of three stages. Those three stages are pre task activity, task cycle and language focus. The result of the expert judgement is 2. 33 and the result of the student’s try out is 2. 34. As a result, the supplementary English writing <b>materials</b> <b>using</b> task based language teaching have been appropriate with the tenth grade senior high school students’ needs...|$|R

5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main <b>materials</b> <b>used</b> in the construction of the settlements.|$|E

The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting.

5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and <b>materials</b> <b>used</b> by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E

5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} 23,000 tyres per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of <b>materials</b> <b>used</b> to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips of rubber tread. Shortages of rubber tread can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|E
