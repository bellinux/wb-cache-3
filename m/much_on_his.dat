McLain was a three-time All-Star and won the Cy Young Award twice in his career.

500|$|Poe had a keen {{interest}} in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing" [...] in Graham's Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] incorporating ciphers as {{an essential part of the}} story. Poe's success with cryptography relied not so <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1970s, {{the chief}} {{academic}} publications on Cantor were two short monographs by Schönflies (1927) – largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler – and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at {{second and third}} hand; neither had <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> personal life. The gap was largely filled by Eric Temple Bell's Men of Mathematics (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as [...] "perhaps the most widely read modern book {{on the history of}} mathematics"; and as [...] "one of the worst". Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as Oedipal, Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics, and fills the picture with stereotypes. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell – including one that labels Cantor's father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents. A critique of Bell's book is contained in Joseph Dauben's biography. Writes Dauben: ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was known}} for his high leg kick, the menacing glare through his cap pulled down almost to his eyes, and his {{deceptive}} changeup. When Hoffman first came into the league, he could throw up to 95mph. He would also throw a slider and only an occasional changeup. His original changeup was a conventional circle changeup taught to him by Cincinnati scout Larry Barton. Hoffman learned a different changeup, which he throws with a palmball grip, from teammate Donnie Elliott in 1994. [...] He began using the new changeup in 1995 when his fastball had dropped to 88–90mph after his offseason injury on the beach. [...] With the decrease in velocity, Hoffman knew he could not rely as <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> fastball. [...] He played through 1995 and had surgery the following offseason for a torn rotator cuff. When he returned the following year, Hoffman's fastball was at 87–88mph, but he had more experience with his new changeup. [...] His fastball reached back as high as 91mph in 1998, but by sometime after 2000 it dropped down to 83–88mph. His repertoire by then included primarily of his changeup, a four-seam fastball, a slower cut fastball that moves in towards a left-handed batter, and the occasional slider and a curveball.|$|E
500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Marty Racine of the Houston Chronicle said that [...] "I Don't Wanna Know" [...] and [...] "Take Me Home" [...] {{were the only}} songs to [...] "rise above the crowd", and that Collins focused too <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> singing and less on his drumming, [...] "which can be captivating". Racine also added that the album makes the listener feel a little [...] "cold", but admired that the singer was [...] "playing the game as well as anyone". Writing an article in defence of Collins in 2010, Gary Mills of The Quietus described the album as [...] "determined dross" [...] which Collins did not deserve to have his career judged by. In 2013, music critic Tom Service of The Guardian was similarly scathing, saying the album had not {{stood the test of}} time and was [...] "unlistenable to today", singling out [...] "Sussudio" [...] for particular criticism, arguing: [...] "the production, the drum machine, the inane sincerity of the lyrics; there's no colder or more superficial sound in popular music, precisely because it takes itself so seriously." [...] He also compared it unfavourably with the enduring appeal of Collins's 1980s contemporaries such as the Human League and—in particular—the Pet Shop Boys, saying the latter were [...] "geniuses by comparison".|$|E
500|$|On July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a {{trade that}} brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the {{beginning}} of the 1968–69 NBA season. To get the center, the Lakers traded West's backcourt partner Archie Clark, starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia. Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark, and especially after losing Goodrich in the expansion draft to the Phoenix Suns. He only had diminutive, defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West. While West himself got on well with the new recruit, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff. Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain [...] "The Load", and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as [...] "the dumbest and worst coach ever". There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened. West was clearly disturbed by locker room tension; used to playing in teams with good chemistry, his quality of play became erratic, and he posted a career-low 25.9points. However, he made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team.|$|E

The {{lack of a}} second guard next to West (and thus, the lack of speed and quickness) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft, he said: [...] "Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [...] size...but if I don't play him, we look {{like a bunch of}} trucks." [...] In addition, Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower, which made him difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West, he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor; regarding Baylor, he later explained: [...] "We were good friends, but... black culture... you never let the other guy one-up you." [...] The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff: pejoratively calling the new recruit [...] "The Load", he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as [...] "the dumbest and worst coach ever".

500|$|Percy {{has been}} {{variously}} {{described as a}} belligerent and eccentric man, with [...] "surges of wild energy subsiding into sloth".

[...] According to both men, Percy's conversion to Catholicism was a calming influence, but biographer Mark Nicholls, who calls Percy [...] "a pugnacious character", says that this was only true to a point. [...] His excesses did not prevent him from joining Northumberland during his command in the Low Countries, held from 1600–1601, {{for which he was}} rewarded with £200. [...] The earl also appointed Percy his receiver of rents in Cumberland and Northumberland, in 1603. [...] Henry Percy was considered a supporter of the Catholic cause, and on several occasions before 1603, suspecting that Queen Elizabeth I did not have long to live, he entrusted Thomas with the delivery of secret correspondence to and from her probable successor, King James VI of Scotland. [...] Northumberland's uncle had been executed for his involvement in the Rising of the North, a plot to replace Elizabeth with James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. [...] He planned to make up for his family's disgrace by building a strong relationship with James, but also wished to counter the influence of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, whose father (it was rumoured) James believed had been responsible for Mary's death.|$|E
