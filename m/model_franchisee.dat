A <b>model</b> of <b>franchisee</b> buying behaviour is developed, depicting the sequence of events which occur in the purchase and operation of a franchised small business. The relationships in the model are tested with data obtained from nine restaurant franchise companies and 127 of their franchised owner-managers. The objectives of the study were to identify the characteristics of franchisors and franchisees which contribute to franchisee satisfaction with purchasing and operating a franchised outlet, and the consequences of this level of satisfaction so that its importance to the relationship can be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and analyse the {{regulatory}} issues emerging from the newly launched programme of rural electricity access in India. We focus on two broad areas, namely regulatory issues related to the organisation/structuring of the activities and issues related to subsidy and tariffs. The paper looks into the alternative organisational arrangements being used by the programme and identifies problem areas through a responsibility mapping. The tariff principle being followed by the programme is then analysed considering the alternative organisational forms and issues related to such pricing policies are identified. Possible alternative pricing options are then suggested. The paper finds that while the <b>franchisee</b> <b>model</b> is an innovative idea, it raises issues that the regulators should be concerned with. The programme has so far relied on the simplest <b>franchisee</b> <b>model</b> because of its ease of implementation but a transition to more complex alternatives would require careful considerations.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{an empirical}} study which tested a <b>model</b> of <b>franchisee</b> buying behavior. The model depicts {{the sequence of}} events which occur in the purchase and operation of a franchised small business, proposing that franchisee satisfaction is dependent on various inputs by both franchisors and franchisees which influence either the pre-purchase expectations of franchisees or the post-purchase performance of franchised outlets. The relationships in the model are expressed with three hypotheses, which were tested with data obtained from nine restaurant franchise companies and 127 of their franchisee owner-managers. The study findings demonstrate that while franchising does offer many of the benefits of independent small business ownership while reducing some of the problems, there are very real differences between satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory franchise systems, at least from the perspective of franchisees...|$|R

40|$|Most conceptual, {{exploratory}} and explanatory {{investigations into}} the motivations to enter franchising arrangements have taken only the situation of a traditional single unit owner-operator into account. Presumably, franchisees are attracted to these contractual vertical marketing networks as they {{become part of a}} larger, established system with a proven brand and consumer following, while retaining some independence and receiving financial support, and initial and ongoing operational assistance. However, multiple unit franchisees may differ from their single unit counterparts in terms of their experience, philosophical orientations and expectancies. Therefore, a single theoretical <b>model</b> of <b>franchisee</b> motivations that postulates symmetry of motives would be unrealistic and untenable. Instead this research aims to build theory through the presentation of a set of propositions that explains multiple unit franchising as a function of an individual's need for empowerment, anticipation of future scale economies, available financial liquidity, entrepreneurial orientation and desire to minimise future intra-system conflict. Overall, the qualitative findings clarified and confirmed the validity of the general propositions in preparation for future empirical testing.

40|$|Investigating an {{important}} overlooked phase of interorganizational relationship evolution, {{which is currently}} hypothesized to progress through five stages of awareness, exploration, expansion, commitment, and dissolution, this dissertation proposes {{that in the long}} road between commitment and dissolution, the quintessential interfirm relationship is likely to be characterized by aprolonged period of relationship alienation, which then becomes the immediate precursor to the dissolution stage. The dissertation utilizes social learning theory, behavior constraint theory, and alienation theory to explain apathetic behaviors of franchisees. The principal proposition is that certain characteristics of the franchise system’s operating environment inadvertently condition franchisee estrangement and failure, and the maladaptive behaviors persist even after environmental changes make success possible again. The dissertation proposes and empirically tests a conceptual <b>model</b> of <b>franchisee</b> alienation. Data from dyadic franchisee-franchisor relationships (N= 185) across a wide variety of industries were obtained through a survey of franchisee organizations that were members of the Franchise Council of Australia (FCA). The results render support to the central hypothesis that franchisee alienation occurs {{as a result of the}} franchisee organization disconnecting its own actions from the outcomes of its interactions with the franchisor. Franchisee alienation is shown as a phenomenon that is extremely toxic for the franchise system as a whole, as the alienated franchisee is likely to engage in opportunistic behaviors, exhibits reduced productivity, and is inclined to litigate against the franchisor and to dissolve its relationship with the franchisor. On the basis of the findings, the dissertation offers a prescription in terms of the different strategies that can be used by the franchisor to prevent and combat franchisee alienation...|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} {{of this research}} is: Who should undertake promotional and brand-image advertising if the franchisor and franchisees act so as to maximize their respective profits? To address this question, we study a two-stage advertising game between a franchisor and two adjacent franchisees. In {{the first stage of}} the game, the franchisor chooses between three advertising models - centralizing or delegating the two types of advertising to the franchisees or delegating only promotional advertising. In the second stage, given the franchisor's choice of an advertising <b>model,</b> the two <b>franchisees</b> {{decide whether or not to}} cooperate. Our main findings are that (1) the franchisees should cooperate if the franchisor delegates either both brand-image and promotional advertising or promotional advertising, although cooperation between franchisees does not necessary improve the franchisor's profits. (2) The choice of an advertising arrangement critically depends on the margins as well as the costs of performing both promotional and brand-image advertising. We also discuss the conditions under which the three advertising models should be implemented. Game theory Marketing Franchising Cooperative advertising Horizontal cooperation...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the model of freedom {{franchising}} and to its comparison with the classic franchising model. The aim of the article is to systemize and enrich the knowledge in the sphere of the franchising model evolution. The author’s task was to identify the key features of the freedom franchising model, to compare the freedom franchising with classic franchising and to formulate the conditions under which the freedom franchising model can be developed. To achieve this the analysis, synthesis, comparison and longitude methods were used. Classic franchising model includes the transfer of both visible (design, brand style) and invisible to the customers (business processes, know-how) elements from the franchisor to the franchisee. Such a business model enables the franchise to preserve the high quality of products and services and to grow the net at high rate. The drawback of the classic model is the complexity of bringing up innovations by the franchisee – new ideas are strictly chosen by the franchisor and then implemented within the network only after the successful experience in control points of contact. Nevertheless, there is the franchising business <b>model</b> in which <b>franchisees</b> can experiment with front-of-house (visible) elements of the system (such as point’s of contact design) on the one hand, and on the other – in which new ideas and initiatives from the franchisee are welcomed by the franchisor. The model is called “freedom franchising”. It is {{important to point out that}} key system elements are standardized in both models as standardized production processes help preserve high quality within the franchising net. Freedom franchising model is not applicable in the spheres where full business standardization is needed as well as in the business that is focusing on fast growth. But it helps franchisees to implement new ideas within the whole network. The article would be of interest to franchisors for creating franchise programs as freedom franchising model helps combine the regulations of the franchising model with franchisees’ initiatives...|$|R
