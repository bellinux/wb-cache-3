The reserve system was to keep the oil under government jurisdiction rather than subject to private claims. Management of these reserves was the subject of multi-dimensional arguments—beginning with a turf battle between the Secretary of the Navy and the Interior Dept. The strategic reserves issue was also a debate topic between conservationists and the petroleum industry, {{as well as those who}} favored public ownership versus private control.

Sound risk <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> should involve the estimation of the moments and distribution of cash flows associated with sold policies. To estimate the moments or the distribution of future cash flows, one must model stochastic decrements and stochastic discount rates explicitly.

The interest rate levels or historical interest rate movements may affect future cash flows of sold policies through lapses, policy loans, or participating features embedded in the insurance contract.

The objectives of this report are to describe principles by which large multi-area power systems are controlled and to anticipate how the introduction of large amounts of wind power production might require control protocols to be changed. The operation of a power system is described in terms of primary and secondary control actions. Primary control is fast, autonomous, and provides the first-line corrective action in disturbances; secondary control takes place on a follow-up time scale and manages the deployment of resources to ensure reliable and economic operation. This report anticipates that the present fundamental primary and secondary control protocols will be satisfactory as wind power provides an increasing fraction of the total production, provided that appropriate attention is paid to the timing of primary control response, to short term wind forecasting, and to <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> for control action...|$|E

40|$|To reduce global {{biodiversity}} loss, {{there is}} an urgent need to determine the most efficient allocation of conservation resources. Recently, {{there has been a}} growing trend for many governments to supplement public ownership and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> with incentive programs for conservation on private land. At the same time, policies to promote conservation on private land are rarely evaluated in terms of their ecological consequences. This raises important questions, such as the extent to which private land conservation can improve conservation outcomes, and how it should be mixed with more traditional public land conservation. We address these questions, using a general framework for modelling environmental policies and a case study examining the conservation of endangered native grasslands to the west of Melbourne, Australia. Specifically, we examine three policies that involve: (i) spending all resources on creating public conservation areas; (ii) spending all resources on an ongoing incentive program where private landholders are paid to manage vegetation on their property with 5 -year contracts; and (iii) splitting resources between these two approaches. The performance of each strategy is quantified with a vegetation condition change model that predicts future changes in grassland quality. Of the policies tested, no one policy was always best and policy performance depended on the objectives of those enacting the policy. This work demonstrates a general method for evaluating environmental policies and highlights the utility of a model which combines ecological and socioeconomic processes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} ongoing {{activities}} in IEA ENARD’s Annex IV “Transmission Systems”. The Annex was formally {{adopted by the}} ENARD Executive Committee in September 2008, with the aim to establish a long term vision for developments in transmission systems beyond 2020. On this background {{the objective is to}} address the main barriers towards the necessary development of transmission systems and to identify the most promising solutions related to the various operational, planning, technological, and market aspects, including the need for development and application of new methods and tools. Finally the Annex is expected to address the specific R&D activities needed {{as a result of the}} vision. There is a need for new solutions to deal with variable and less controllable generation and to cope with the distance between generation and the main load centres. The solutions rely on development of transmission capacity and storage, taking advantage of further technological developments such as VSC-HVDC. In order to enable necessary investments it is equally important to establish a suitable regulatory framework and market design, allowing close coordination among the involved entities and reducing the investment risk. Further, more refined methodologies and tools need to be adopted to identify the best options for grid expansion. The future development will require significant changes in the way power systems are operated and controlled. A main barrier is the uncertainty related to <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> and balancing control, ranging from secondary control in the minute range to tertiary control and intra-day markets. A key message is that there is a need for a better understanding of the various challenges related to balancing the increasing variability in power generation and load demand on this time scale. New tools and analysis techniques must be developed to properly address these issues. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Winter energy {{management}} in small passerines living year-round in boreal or alpine areas presumably results in strong selective pressure since {{they need to}} find food, {{at a time when}} natural resources diminish and become less available, and energy requirements increase dramatically. In this thesis {{energy management}} during the non-breeding season was studied in three species of tits (Parus spp.), from three different populations: Coll de Pal (Spanish Pyrenees), Lund (Southern Sweden) and Oulu (Northern Finland). Energy management strategies vary significantly between species and among populations and individuals of the same species. Such differences may depend on several environmental factors, food predictability and individual characteristics. Birds from the studied populations appear to react to energetic challenges on a short-term basis and in a highly flexible way. The coal tit (Parus ater) in Coll de Pal and the willow tit (Parus montanus) in Oulu, both hoarding species, relied mostly on short-term management of energy for winter survival. Social and residence status appeared {{to be the most important}} factors in determining the level of energy reserves, underlining the importance of food predictability for energy management in wintering tits. Further studies were carried out on two distinct populations of great tit (Parus major) exposed to different winter hardiness. Birds from both populations increased their resting metabolic rate (MR) with experimentally decreasing ambient temperatures. Birds from Oulu maintained higher expenditures than birds from Lund in all cases, but also experienced higher energetic cost of thermoregulation at the lowest temperatures. The differences probably did not arise from a differential insulation capacity between populations, despite the differences in plumage structure found, but from a differential metabolic acclimatization. Birds from Lund probably became hypothermic at the lowest temperatures, which may have exceeded the levels they were acclimatized for. The observed differences in basal MR in laboratory conditions were consistent in wild birds throughout the non-breeding season. Birds from both populations experienced similar patterns of variation in basal MR, with expenditures increasing with mass but decreasing with day length, size and age. Great tits modulate their energy expenditure in a flexible way as a means for surviving the non-breeding season. Further, despite such flexibility, populations appear to be locally adapted for such metabolic acclimatization. These results may have important implications on their life-history and distribution. Winter acclimatization appears to be a complex set of entangled strategies that are based on a metabolic adjustment to cope with changing energy requirements. Other mechanisms that apparently play a secondary role, for example the long term <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> through fattening or hoarding, or conserving heat through hypothermia and by developing a better insulative plumage, are certainly important emergency strategies that in natural conditions may explain how some populations can endure winter conditions...|$|E
