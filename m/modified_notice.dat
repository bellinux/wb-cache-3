Polymer quantum systems are quantum mechanical models quantized {{in a similar}} way as in loop quantum gravity that allow the study of the discreteness of space and other features of the loop quantization in a simplified way. We obtain the polymer <b>modified</b> thermodynamical properties <b>noticing</b> that the corresponding Fermi energy is exactly the same as if one directly polymerizes the momentum p_F. We also obtain the corresponding expansion of thermodynamical variables for small values of the polymer length scale λ. With this results we study a simple model of a compact object where the gravitational collapse is supported by electron degeneracy pressure. We find polymer corrections to the mass of the star. When compared with typical measurements of the mass of white dwarfs we obtain a bound on the polymer length of λ^ 2 ≲ 10 ^- 26 m^ 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The dynamic TCP {{acknowledgement}} problem {{formulated by}} Dooly et al. has been intensively {{studied in the}} area of competitive analysis. However, their framework does not consider the sliding window that restricts the maximum number of packets that the sender can inject into the network without an acknowledgement in TCP protocol. This paper proposes a new problem in which the sliding window is realistically integrated. We study how the ability of on-line algorithms change, depending on whether the receiver knows the window size. We show that a deterministic on-line algorithm extended from the optimal on-line algorithm for Dooly’s framework achieves the best competitive ratio of 2, if the window size is given. By contrast, if the window size is not given, the lower bound of the competitive ratio for an algorithm class which contains the algorithm by Dooly et al. depends on the peak packet rate from the sender and the window size. Significantly, our problem models the situation in which an on-line algorithm involuntarily transforms the input and processes the <b>modified</b> input without <b>noticing</b> the transformation. ...|$|R

6000|$|That Madame de Sablé {{herself had}} a tolerably just idea of La Rochefoucauld’s character, {{as well as}} of his maxims, may be {{gathered}} not only from the fact that her own maxims are as full of the confidence in human goodness which La Rochefoucauld wants, as they are empty of the style which he possesses, but also from a letter in which she replies to the criticisms of Madame de Schomberg. “The author,” she says, “derived the maxim on indolence from his own disposition, for never was there so great an indolence as his, and I think that his heart, inert as it is, owes this defect as much to his idleness as his will. It has never permitted him to do the least action for others; and I think that, amid all his great desires and great hopes, he is sometimes indolent even on his own behalf.” Still she must have felt a hearty interest in the “Maxims,” as in some degree her foster-child, and she must also have had considerable affection for the author, who was lovable enough to those who observed the rule of Helvetius, and expected nothing from him. She not only assisted him, as we have seen, in getting criticisms, and carrying out the improvements suggested by them, but when the book was actually published she prepared a notice of it for the only journal then existing—the Journal des Savants. This notice was originally a brief statement {{of the nature of the}} work, and the opinions which had been formed for and against it, with a moderate eulogy, in conclusion, on its good sense, wit, and insight into human nature. But when she submitted it to La Rochefoucauld he objected to the paragraph which stated the adverse opinion, and requested her to alter it.

40|$|International audienceSpermatogenesis is a cyclic {{process in}} which diploid {{spermatogonia}} differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. This process is highly regulated, notably at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules of about 20 - 25 nucleotides, are implicated in the regulation of many important biological pathways such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. We wondered whether miRNAs could play a role during spermatogenesis. The miRNA expression repertoire was tested in germ cells, and we present data showing that miR- 34 c was highly expressed only in these cells. Furthermore, our findings indicate that in male gonads, miR- 34 c expression is largely p 53 independent in contrast to previous results showing a direct link in somatic cells between the miR- 34 family and this tumor suppressor protein. In order to identify target genes involved in germinal lineage differentiation, we overexpressed miR- 34 c in HeLa cells, analyzed the transcriptome of these <b>modified</b> cells, and <b>noticed</b> a shift of the expression profile toward the germinal lineage. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that exogenous expression of Ddx 4 /Vasa in embryonic chicken stem cells (cESC) induces cESC reprogramming toward a germ cell fate. When we simultaneously expressed miR- 34 c in such cells, we could detect an up-regulation of germ cell-specific genes whereas the expression of other lineage specific markers remained unchanged. These data suggest that miR- 34 c could play a role by enhancing the germinal phenotype of cells already committed to this lineage...|$|R

However, its framework does not consider the sliding window in the TCP protocol that restricts the maximum number of packets that the sender can inject into the network without an acknowledgement. This paper proposes a new problem in which the sliding window is realistically integrated. We study how the ability of on-line algorithms changes, depending on whether the receiver is taught the window size. The greater part of this paper assumes that the window size is a constant integer W. We first show that, if W is given, the optimal on-line algorithm for the previous framework can be extended to our new framework and achieves the optimal competitive ratio of 2. Next we prove that, if W is not given, the lower bound of the competitive ratio for an algorithm class which contains the optimal algorithm for the previous framework depends on the peak packet rate T from the sender and W, and is not better than (TW+⌊TW⌋− 1) -competitive. Then, we prove that there exists an on-line algorithm that is (⌈TW⌉+ 2) -competitive, when W is unknown. An optimal off-line algorithm is also presented in this paper. Significantly, our problem models the situation in which an on-line algorithm involuntarily transforms the input and processes the <b>modified</b> input without <b>noticing</b> the transformation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a robust approach to binarize the detected rectangular text regions (text boxes) on news videos. The binarization {{problem can be}} traced back to 1970 s but it is still challenging in news video today since the background is complicated and unpredictable. The proposed algorithm adopts the line traversing method integrating the edge information and the intensity statistics to accomplish the binarization task. First, Canny edge detector is applied on a text box. Next, the vertical line scanning from left to right of the text box is performed twice. The vertical line traverses downwards until it hits an edge pixel or reaches the bottom of the box. Similarly, the vertical line traverses upwards until it hits an edge pixel or reaches the top of the box. These traversed pixels are classified as background pixels. From the histogram of those non-background pixels, the peak intensity p and the standard deviation s are evaluated. The threshold for text in news video is set to be T = (0, p+ks) or T = (p-ks, 255), depending on text polarity. In the case that the range of background intensity covers the entire intensity range of the image, the algorithm uses the temporal information of news video to remove most of the background. Moreover, the intensities of those background pixels, whose intensity is similar to the text pixels, are replaced by 255 or 0, depending on the text polarity. Finally, a binarization is performed in this <b>modified</b> text box. <b>Notice</b> that the proposed method is parameter-free, has no limitation on the text polarity and can handle the case of similar intensity in background and text for news video. The method has been extensively experimented on text boxes from various news videos, historical archive documents and other different documents. The proposed algorithm outperforms the well-known methods such as Otsu, Niblack, Sauvola, etc., in speed, precision and quality...|$|R
