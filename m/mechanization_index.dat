40|$|The {{present study}} {{reviewed}} {{the status of}} mechanized power and self-propelled paddy cultivation machinery in Langarud County {{in the province of}} Guilan in northern Iran. The data was collected in 2012 by questionnaire from paddy farmers and mechanization corporations in five rural districts (Chaf, Divshal, Gelsefid, Komleh, and Otaqvar). The following <b>mechanization</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated for each rural district and the entire region: unit area power, mechanization level, area per tractor, area per machine, and mechanization requirement. The results showed that the mean unit area power was 1. 37 hp ha- 1. There was considerable difference between <b>mechanization</b> <b>indices</b> in the rural districts. The regional mechanization requirement for land preparation was 0, for transplanting was 81. 50 %, for weeding was 94. 97 %, and for harvesting was 43. 20 %. The area per four-wheeled tractor was 176. 42 ha, and cultivated area per machine for transplanting was 416. 36, for weeding was 2081. 80, and for combine harvesting was 88. 21 ha. This indicates that there is insufficient mechanization for weeding followed by transplanting and that there is an urgent need to increase the available machinery for these operations in the paddy fields of Langarud County...|$|R
40|$|The {{major part}} of {{agriculture}} in Iran and especially in Khorasan province is yeoman farmers, and often the parts are less than one hectare. To evaluate the status of small farm mechanization (less than two hectares) in Khorasan Razavi province, three agricultural sub-regions that running small farms were identified. This research {{was carried out in}} 2009. The questionnaire was prepared for gathering basis and field information to determine the mechanization coefficients. The questionnaires were completed for total number of farmers in the areas studied. Results showed that mean of mechanization level and total mechanization degree were 3. 36 hp per hectare and 37. 7 percent respectively. The mean of mechanization degree in tillage was calculated 98. 3 percent. The mean power coefficient and the average hectare per tractor were 4. 37 and 27. 62 respectively. The farmers only use power available for the tillage in these regions. They were not able to use of tractors in other operations, because of being small farm, lack of technical knowledge and lack of implements. Development of mechanization cooperatives, training of farmers and conformity of machine and farm area can increase <b>mechanization</b> <b>indexes</b> and to decrease production costs...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{mechanization}} is {{a method}} for transiting from traditional agriculture towards industrial and sustainable one. Due to the limitation {{of natural resources and}} increasing population we need to have economical production of agricultural crops. For reaching this destination; agricultural mechanization has a remarkable role. So it is necessary to have an extensive view for mechanization, because with the help of mechanization the agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizer and even water and soil can effectively be managed for an economical and sustainable production. This study has been carried out in many provinces of Iran. The data of agricultural tractors and cereal combine harvesters were firstly gathered by means of questionnaire. The tractors were categorized in four power levels of less than 45, 45 to 80, 80 to 110, and more than 110 hp. In addition, it was also carried out for cereal combine harvesters; it was in three power levels, i. e. between 100 to 110, 110 to 155 and 155 to 210 horse-power in 3 ages, i. e. less than 13, between 13 to 20, and more than 20 years. Information regarding to cultivation areas, production volume, and yield of main crops gathered from statistics of Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture. Then agriculture <b>mechanization</b> level <b>index</b> (hp ha- 1) in each province was calculated. Four main crops including irrigated and rain-fed wheat and irrigated and rain-fed barley, which met the required criteria {{to be used in the}} model, were statistically analyzed. Correlation analysis was carried out in order to get an effective model between yield of the four main crops in Iran and agriculture <b>mechanization</b> level <b>index.</b> Pearson correlation index showed that there is a direct and significant correlation between these variables. Subsequently, outliers were identified in order to get a model with necessary efficiency to predict the yield through <b>mechanization</b> level <b>index,</b> by scatter diagram and estimating regression lines in 1 % probability level.

40|$|Agriculture is an {{activity}} of great {{expansion in the}} state of Mato Grosso (MT), which reflects on the city of Sinop and proximities, and in an intense way mechanization is intensively applied in these areas. This study aimed to diagnose the level of mechanization (Kw/ha) in relation to the cultivated agricultural area and the total area. To this, a sample of 15 agricultural properties located in the region of Sinop – MT were analyzed. For the scale representation of the properties, 4 strata were applied in function of the property total agricultural area. The availability of power in the property resulted in significant differences in the <b>mechanization</b> <b>index.</b> Stratification was efficient for the determination of the <b>mechanization</b> <b>index</b> in the strata, occurring similarities only between strata 2 (3001 – 5000 ha) and 3 (5001 – 9000 ha).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} and evaluate the <b>mechanization</b> <b>indices,</b> including energy and economic, in production of greenhouse cucumber and tomato, a study was carried out using sequential design- factorial with three replications in Khuzestan province, Iran, during 2011 - 2012. The greenhouse structures and production methods in all the systems were similar. The evaluated treatments included two cultivated areas in {{the northern and southern}} parts of the province (first factor), cucumber and tomato plants (second factor) and area under cultivation of 1000, 3000 and 5000 m 2 (third factor). First, by preparing a questionnaire and conducting the interviews with greenhouse owners, the questionnaires were completed for all the studied greenhouses and consumer information needed to calculate the energy inputs and energy and economic indices were then obtained. Results of the energy section showed that cucumber production in 3000 m 2 areas in south of the province and tomato production in 5000 m 2 areas in northern regions of the province had the highest energy productivity. In addition, results of the economic evaluation indicated that cultivation of tomato had more income and final gross profit, and with respect to internal rate of return index, the greenhouse tomato grown in northern regions of Khuzestan province was more affordable.

40|$|Abstract. Using a {{descriptive}} approach, {{a study of}} the dynamics of farm mechanization was performed in the agricultural regions of Delicias, Chihuahua and La Begoña, Guanajuato, México. The study was aimed at identifying patterns of farm equipment utilization through multivariate analyses of relevant data. A total of 135 farmers were interviewed, along with 21 extension agents and 22 farm machinery dealers. A <b>mechanization</b> <b>index</b> was developed to characterize the mechanization level of individual farmers. The methodology used for pattern definition was based on dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis. Three principal components were subjected to hierarchical clustering in order to assemble respondents into groups. Five distinct groups of farmers were identified in Delicias and four in La Begoña. Each group featured a unique combination of characteristics for which the use of farm equipment was well differentiated, including subsistence, and various forms of commercial agriculture. Results suggest that most farmers in the two regions have access to relatively large amounts of tractor power and other mechanical inputs through a diverse set of mechanisms. The proposed <b>mechanization</b> <b>index</b> relates actual mechanical work expenditure to mean regional values. The index was derived for each farmer from descriptions of farm operations obtained by survey. The mechanization inde...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{mechanization}} level on canola production was investigated by dividing the producers based on mechanization level and using of <b>mechanization</b> <b>index</b> in production function. The result showed that in low mechanization group following 10 % increase in water, poison and chemical fertilizer (labor) application, the output will increase (decrease) about 4. 3, 2. 2 and 6. 2 (8. 7) percent respectively. In the high mechanized group (farmers), specified that water, labor and machinery inputs {{have a negative effect}} on production and positive impact on seed. Evaluation the effect of mechanization based on value of total inputs in industry showed that following 10 % increase in mechanization the yield will increase about 1. 3 percent.

40|$|The Brazilian {{agriculture}} presents different {{production systems}} {{and a great}} variation of yield levels {{as a consequence of}} the regional inequality. These variations occur mainly because of the lack of technical information and financial support to acquire machinery and equipment used in agriculture. Considering the importance of this information, this study aimed to analyze the mechanization of agricultural properties in the municipality of Dracena/SP. The total number of land holdings in this area is 1, 024 and only 149 have wheel tractors; they were classified into groups according to their sizes. Data collection was done through a questionnaire about the characteristics of the production system, mechanization resources, operational cost, and operational intensity. The statistical significance of the experimental data was evaluated by analyses of variance followed by Kruskal Wallis ’ test (P< 0. 05). The analysis revealed that the average values of the <b>mechanization</b> <b>index</b> and the farmed area by tractor were, respectively, 2. 53 kW/ha and 103. 9 ha/tractor.

40|$|A single {{hidden layer}} {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) model was developed to estimate simultaneously two mechanization indicators, <b>Mechanization</b> <b>Index</b> (MI) and Machinery Energy Ratio (MER), used to characterize a group of farms in a target farming region. Values of the two mechanization indicators could be obtained without direct calculation of their equations by using the ANN model. To develop the model, data representative of a developing farming system in Mexico were obtained from farmers, local makers of agricultural machinery, researchers and government officials, {{as well as from}} relevant databases. A wide range of variables of farming activities were examined, and from these, 11 were used as input variables for the model. The values of the model’s outputs correlated well (Pearson’s = 0. 963 and 0. 947 for MI and MER respectively) with actual, calculated values, indicating that the model is valid. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to investigate the effects of each input item on the output values. Since the ANN model can predict two mechanization indicators for a target farming system, it could be a good tool for appraising mechanization of regional farms. Also it overcomes some of the limitations of using as inputs simple data available from local databases that may contai...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{approach}} {{the assessment of the}} vulnerability to land degradation of a typical Mediterranean environment using {{a modified version of the}} ESA model. This approach combines analyses of the socio-economic component with analyses of the vegetation trends. According to the standard ESA strategy, different indicators representing the impact of agricultural and grazing activities are used. The main feature of these indicators is that they are census-based and consequently suitable only for the analysis at municipal scale. Therefore we have also elaborated a <b>mechanization</b> <b>index</b> (proxy for soil compaction induced by agricultural machineries) that uses land cover and morphological data [36], enabling high spatial resolution and faster rate of update. The indicators related to the anthropic impact are integrated into an overall Land Management Index (LMI) and in each area it is possible to enhance the main contributing factors to highlight the prevailing forces that drive human-induced degradation processes. In order to include vegetation in the vulnerability map we analyze satellite vegetation index NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which is recognized as ideal tool for monitoring long term trends of degradation phenomena and assessing different values of severity of the concerned processes [37, 38]. The final result of our analyses is an integrated vulnerability map of the investigated region, accounting for management and vegetation factors, which allows us to identify priority sites where restoration/rehabilitation interventions are urgent. The adopted procedure can be easily applied to geographic contexts characterized by high complexity in terms of land cover type and economic vocation (intensive agriculture, grazing, industrial activities) thus enabling an early detection of the areas most vulnerable to land degradation...|$|E
