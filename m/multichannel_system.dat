50|$|Since the {{multichannel}} stereo systems require lots {{of reproduction}} channels, some researchers adopted the HRTF simulation technologies {{to reduce the}} number of reproduction channels. They use only two speakers to simulate multiple speakers in a <b>multichannel</b> <b>system.</b> This process is called as virtual reproduction. Essentially, such approach uses both interaural difference principle and pinna filtering effect theory. Unfortunately, this kind of approach cannot perfectly substitute the traditional multichannel stereo system, such as 5.1 surround sound system. That is because when the listening zone is relatively larger, simulation reproduction through HRTFs may cause invert acoustic images at symmetric positions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{protocol}} appropriate for multiple access in a multichannel environment. All free stations contend in one channel, while the busy stations construct one queue belonging to all retransmission channels for collision resolution. Thus asymmetric access methods, such as pre-selection or sequential selection of retransission channels. A queueing model appropriate for the analysis and performance evaluation of the proposed protocol is derived. Analytic solutions are developed for a system with a finite number of stations using discrete time Markov chains. Numerical results indicate the dependence of normalized performance (normalized throughput and normalized delay) on the number of channels. The cases in which the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> is superior to the single channel protocol are found. The stability of the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> with infinite population is studied. Pakes's Lemma criteria are applied to specify regions in which the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> is stable. The control parameters are the retransmission probabilities.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The paper {{proposes a}} method of {{deconvolution}} in a periodic setting which combines two important ideas, the fast wavelet and Fourier transform-based estimation procedure of Johnstone et al. [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 66 (2004) 547] and the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> technique proposed by Casey and Walnut [SIAM Rev. 36 (1994) 537]. An unknown function is estimated by a wavelet series where the empirical wavelet coefficients are filtered in an adapting non-linear fashion. It is shown theoretically that the estimator achieves optimal convergence rate {{in a wide range}} of Besov spaces. The procedure allows to reduce the ill-posedness of the problem especially in the case of non-smooth blurring functions such as boxcar functions: it is proved that additions of extra channels improve convergence rate of the estimator. Theoretical study is supplemented by an extensive set of small-sample simulation experiments demonstrating high-quality performance of the proposed method.
