5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> system is also {{equipped with a}} helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the <b>Main</b> <b>Propulsion</b> Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine room}} of a motor vessel {{typically}} contains several engines for different purposes. <b>Main,</b> or <b>propulsion</b> engines are used to turn the ship's propeller and move the ship through the water.

25|$|In ichthyosaurs, the <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> was {{provided}} by a lateral movement of the body. Early forms employed an anguilliform or eel-like movement, with undulations of the entire trunk and tail. This is usually considered rather inefficient. Later forms, like the Parvipelvia, has a shorter trunk and tail and probably used a more efficient carangiform or even thunniform movement, in which {{the last third of}} the body, respectively the tail end, is flexed only. The trunk in such species is rather stiff.|$|E

Trajectory corrections will be made using a set of eight 10 N thrusters, one attached to each corner of the spacecraft bus. The spacecraft configuration is optimized for a Soyuz/Fregat, and was fully compatible with a Delta II launch vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The typical plesiosaur had a broad, flat, {{body and}} a short tail. Plesiosaurs {{retained}} their ancestral two pairs of limbs, which had evolved into large flippers. Plesiosaurs {{were related to the}} earlier Nothosauridae, that had a more crocodile-like body. The flipper arrangement is unusual for aquatic animals in that probably all four limbs were used to propel the animal through the water by up-and-down movements. The tail was most likely only used for helping in directional control. This contrasts to the ichthyosaurs and the later mosasaurs, in which the tail provided the <b>main</b> <b>propulsion.</b>|$|E

500|$|While most {{of these}} were open-water fishes, one group, the Elpistostegalians, adapted {{to life in the}} shallows.

500|$|Salyut 6 ( [...] ; lit.Salute 6), DOS-5, was a Soviet orbital space station, {{the eighth}} flown {{as part of}} the Salyut programme. Launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket, the station {{was the first of the}} 'second-generation' type of space station. Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary {{advances}} over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design. These included the addition of a second docking port, a new <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> system and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M multispectral telescope. The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time. The early Salyut stations had no means of resupply or removing accumulated garbage (aside from the limited amount that cosmonauts could carry in their Soyuz spacecraft), nor could the propulsion system be refueled once it exhausted its propellant supply. Consequently, once the consumables launched with the station were used up, its mission had to be concluded and as a result, manned missions had a maximum duration of three months. Progress spacecraft could now bring fresh supplies and propellant and also be used to dispose of waste, which was then destroyed once the spacecraft was deorbited.|$|E

This was generally done in the sitting down position, using a removable seat which was hung from the engine room access ladder. Four levers were used to control the two Gardner 8L3s engine's RPM settings and the direction of drive to the propellers via reversing gearboxes. A governor (speed control) control lever was used to adjust the engine revolutions, and a gearbox lever was used with positions for ahead, neutral and reverse.|$|R

500|$|Following the {{retirement}} of the Space Shuttle, NASA announced on September 14, 2011, {{that it would be}} developing a new launch vehicle, known as the Space Launch System (SLS), to replace the shuttle fleet. The design for the SLS features the RS-25 on its core stage, with different versions of the rocket being installed with between three and five engines. The initial flights of the new launch vehicle will make use of flown Block II RS-25D engines, with NASA keeping the remaining such engines in a [...] "purged safe" [...] environment at Stennis Space Center, [...] "along with all of the ground systems required to maintain them." [...] In addition to the RS-25Ds, the SLS program will make use of the <b>Main</b> <b>Propulsion</b> Systems from the three remaining orbiters for testing purposes (having been removed as part of the orbiters' decommissioning), with the first two launches (SLS-1 and SLS-2) possibly making use of the MPS hardware from Space Shuttles [...] and [...] in their core stages. The SLS's propellants will be supplied to the engines from the rocket's core stage, which will consist of a modified Space Shuttle external tank with the MPS plumbing and engines at its aft, and an interstage structure at the top. Once the remaining RS-25Ds are used up, they are to be replaced with a cheaper, expendable version, currently designated the RS-25E. This engine may be based on one or both of two single-use variants which were studied in 2005, the RS-25E (referred to as the 'Minimal Change Expendable SSME') and the even more simplified RS-25F (referred to as the 'Low Cost Manufacture Expendable SSME'), both of which were under consideration in 2011.|$|E
