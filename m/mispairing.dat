40|$|Molecules of {{transfer}} RNA (tRNA) typically contain four stems composed of Watson–Crick (W-C) base pairs and infrequent <b>mispairs</b> such as G-U and A-C. The latter <b>mispairs</b> are fundamental units of RNA secondary structure found {{in nearly every}} class of RNA and are nearly isomorphic to W-C pairs. Therefore, they often substitute for G-C or A-U base pairs. The <b>mispairs</b> also have unique chemical, structural, and dynamic conformational properties, {{which can only be}} partially mimicked by W-C base pairs. Here, I characterize the identities and tasks of six mutant G-U and A-C <b>mispairs</b> in Escherichia coli tRNAGly using genetic and bioinformatic tools and show that <b>mispairs</b> are significantly more important for aminoacylation and translation than previously realized. <b>Mispairs</b> boost aminoacylation and translation primarily because they activate tRNA by means of their conformational flexibility. The statistical preservation of the six mutant <b>mispair</b> sites across tRNAGly in many organisms points to a fundamental structure–function signature within tRNAGly with possible analogous missions in other RNAs...|$|R

The specificity of restriction endonucleases is not absolute, yet many commonly used assays of biological phenomena and contemporary molecular biology techniques rely on the premise that restriction enzymes will cleave only perfect cognate recognition sites. In vitro, <b>mispaired</b> heteroduplex DNAs are commonly formed, especially subsequent to polymerase chain reaction amplification. We investigated a panel of restriction endonucleases to determine their ability to cleave <b>mispaired</b> heteroduplex DNA substrates. Two straightforward, non-radioactive assays are used to evaluate <b>mispaired</b> heteroduplex DNA cleavage: a PCR amplification method and an oligonucleotide-based assay. These assays demonstrated that most restriction endonucleases are capable of site-specific double-strand cleavage with heteroduplex <b>mispaired</b> DNA substrates, however, certain <b>mispaired</b> substrates do effectively abrogate cleavage to undetectable levels. These data are consistent with <b>mispaired</b> substrate cleavage previously reported for Eco RI and, importantly, extend our knowledge of <b>mispaired</b> heteroduplex substrate cleavage to 13 additional enzymes...|$|R

Model-based point mutation alleles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae msh 3 designed to disrupt <b>mispair</b> recognition fell into two classes. One class caused defects in repair of both small and large insertion/deletion <b>mispairs,</b> whereas the second class caused defects only in the repair of small insertion/deletion mispairs; mutations of the first class also caused defects in the removal of nonhomologous tails present {{at the ends of}} double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DSB repair, whereas mutations of the second class did not cause defects in the removal of nonhomologous tails during DSB repair. Thus, recognition of small insertion/deletion <b>mispairs</b> by Msh 3 appears to require a greater degree of interactions with the DNA conformations induced by small insertion/deletion <b>mispairs</b> than with those induced by large insertion/deletions that are intrinsically bent and strand separated.

A particular {{challenge for the}} enzymatic specificity is the recognition of a wrongly-placed native nucleotide such as thymine in T:G <b>mispairs.</b> An important step of substrate binding which is observed in many repair proteins is the flipping of the target base out of the DNA helix into the enzyme’s active site. In this work we investigate how much the intrinsic dynamics of <b>mispaired</b> DNA is changed compared to canonical DNA. Our molecular dynamics simulations of DNA with and without T:G <b>mispairs</b> show {{significant differences in the}} conformation of paired and <b>mispaired</b> DNA. The wobble pair T:G shows local distortions such as twist, shear and stretch which deviate from canonical B form values. Moreover, the T:G <b>mispair</b> is found to be kinetically less stable, exhibiting two states with respect to base opening: a closed state comparable to the canonical base pairs, and a more open state, indicating a proneness for base flip. In addition, we observe that the thymine base in a T:G <b>mispair</b> is significantly more probable to be flipped than thymine in a T:A pair or cytosine in a C:G pair. Such local deformations and in particular the existence of a second, more-open state can be speculated to help the target-site recognition by repair enzymes...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{mismatch}} repair {{is thought to}} act through two subpathways involving the recognition of base-base and insertion/deletion <b>mispairs</b> by the Msh 2 -Msh 6 heterodimer and the recognition of insertion/deletion <b>mispairs</b> by the Msh 2 -Msh 3 heterodimer. Here, through genetic and biochemical approaches, we describe a previously unidentified role of the Msh 2 -Msh 3 heterodimer in the recognition of base-base <b>mispairs</b> and the suppression of homology-mediated duplication and deletion mutations. Saccharomyces cerevisiae msh 3 mutants did not show {{an increase in the}} rate of base substitution mutations by the CAN 1 forward mutation assay compared to the rate for the wild type but did show an altered spectrum of base substitution mutations, including an increased accumulation of base pair changes from GC to CG and from AT to TA; msh 3 mutants also accumulated homology-mediated duplication and deletion mutations. The mutation spectrum of mlh 3 mutants paralleled that of msh 3 mutants, suggesting that the Mlh 1 -Mlh 3 heterodimer may also {{play a role in the}} repair of base-base <b>mispairs</b> and in the suppression of homology-mediated duplication and deletion mutations. <b>Mispair</b> binding analysis with purified Msh 2 -Msh 3 and DNA substrates derived from CAN 1 sequences found to be mutated in vivo demonstrated that Msh 2 -Msh 3 exhibited robust binding to specific base-base <b>mispairs</b> that was consistent with functional <b>mispair</b> binding...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{mismatch}} repair greatly increases genome fidelity by recognizing and removing replication errors. In {{order to understand}} how this fidelity is maintained, {{it is important to}} uncover the relative specificities of the different components of {{mismatch repair}}. There are two major <b>mispair</b> recognition complexes in eukaryotes that are homologues of bacterial MutS proteins, MutSa and MutSb, with MutSa recognizing base-base mismatches and small loop <b>mispairs</b> and MutSb recognizing larger loop <b>mispairs.</b> Upon recognition of a <b>mispair,</b> the MutS complexes then interact with homologues of the bacterial MutL protein. Loops formed on the primer strand during replication lead to insertion mutations, whereas loops on the template strand lead to deletions. We show here in yeast, using oligonucleotide transformation, that MutSa has a strong bias toward repair of insertion loops, while MutSb has an even stronger bias toward repair of deletion loops. Our results suggest that this bias in repair is due to the different interactions of the MutS complexes with the MutL complexes. Two mutants of MutLa, pms 1 -G 882 E and pms 1 -H 888 R, repair deletion <b>mispairs</b> but not insertion <b>mispairs.</b> Moreover, we find that a different MutL complex, MutLc, is extremely important, but not sufficient, for deletion repair in the presence of either MutLa mutation.

Insertions can expand simple tandem repeats by one or more units. In long repeats, expansions may involve two or more units. For example, insertion of a single repeat unit in GAGAGA expands the sequence to GAGAGAGA, while insertion of two repeat units in GA6 would produce GA8.

40|$|The {{fact that}} loosely bonded DNA bases could {{tolerate}} large structural fluctuations, form a dissipative environment for a charge {{traveling through the}} DNA. Nonlinear stochastic nature of structural fluctuations facilitates rich charge dynamics in DNA. We study the complex charge dynamics by solving a nonlinear, stochastic, coupled system of differential equations. Charge transfer between donor and acceptor in DNA occurs via different mechanisms depending on the distance between donor and acceptor. It changes from tunneling regime to a polaron assisted hopping regime depending on the donor-acceptor separation. Also we found that charge transport strongly depends on the feasibility of polaron formation. Hence it has complex dependence on temperature and charge-vibrations coupling strength. Mismatched base pairs, such as different conformations of the G・A <b>mispair,</b> cause only minor structural changes in the host DNA molecule, thereby making <b>mispair</b> recognition an arduous task. Electron transport in DNA that depends strongly on the hopping transfer integrals between the nearest base pairs, which in turn {{are affected by the}} presence of a <b>mispair,</b> might be an attractive approach in this regard. I report here on our investigations, via the I –V characteristics, of the effect of a <b>mispair</b> on the electrical properties of homogeneous and generic DNA molecules. The I –V characteristics of DNA were studied numerically within the double-stranded tight-binding model. The parameters of the tight-binding model, such as the transfer integrals and on-site energies, are determined from first-principles calculations. The changes in electrical current through the DNA chain due to the presence of a <b>mispair</b> depend on the conformation of the G・A <b>mispair</b> and are appreciable for DNA consisting of up to 90 base pairs. For homogeneous DNA sequences the current through DNA is suppressed and the strongest suppression is realized for the G(anti) ・A(syn) conformation of the G・A <b>mispair.</b> For inhomogeneous (generic) DNA molecules, the <b>mispair</b> result can be either suppression or an enhancement of the current, {{depending on the type of}} <b>mispairs</b> and actual DNA sequence...|$|R

On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-transcribed genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see TATA box).

50|$|The gap {{penalty is}} a scoring system used in {{bioinformatics}} for aligning {{a small portion}} of genetic code, more accurately, fragmented genetic sequences, also termed reads, against a reference genetic sequence (e.g. The Human Genome). The biological process of protein synthesis namely, transcription and translation or DNA replication can produce errors resulting in mutations in the final nucleic acid sequence. Therefore, in order to make more accurate decisions in aligning reads, mutations are annotated as gaps in the sequence. Gaps are penalised via various Gap Penalty scoring methods. Gaps in a DNA sequence result from either insertions or deletions in the sequence, sometimes referred to as indels. Insertions or deletions occur due to single mutations, unbalanced crossover in meiosis, slipped strand <b>mispairing</b> in the replication process and chromosomal translocation. In alignments gaps are represented as contiguous dashes on a protein/DNA sequence alignment. The scoring that occurs in Gap Penalty allows for the optimisation of sequence alignment in order to obtain the best alignment possible based on the information available.

Repair of this lesion is initiated by the bifunctional DNA glycosylase OGG1, which recognizes 8-oxoG paired with C.hOGG1 is a bifunctional glycosylase that belongs to the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) family.

Here, we tested whether such a gp 100 (280 - 288) - or p 53 (264 - 272) tumor antigen-specific scTCR is still prone to <b>mispairing</b> with TCRα. In a human Jurkat- 76 T-cell line lacking endogenous TCRs, surface expression and function of a scTCR could be reconstituted by any cointroduced TCRα-chain indicating <b>mispairing</b> to take place on a molecular basis. In contrast, transduction into human TCRα/β-positive T-cells revealed that <b>mispairing</b> is largely reduced. Competition experiments in Jurkat- 76 confirmed the preference of dcTCR to selfpair and to spare scTCR. This also allowed for the generation of dc/scTCR-modified cytomegalovirus/tumor antigen-bispecific T-cells to augment T-cell activation in CMV-infected tumor patients.

40|$|As {{the most}} {{nucleophilic}} site in DNA, the guanine N 7 atom {{is a major}} site of adduction by {{a large number of}} alkylating mutagens and carcinogens. Aflatoxin B(1), a powerful mutagen, is believed to act through its reaction with this DNA site. On the basis of the specificity of base substitutions induced by various adduct forms of aflatoxin, we have proposed that bulky guanine N 7 adducts elicit base substitutions by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is similar to that observed for a number of bulky noninstructive lesions, whereas the second mechanism invokes <b>mispairing</b> between N 7 -adducted guanine and thymine. A prediction of the <b>mispairing</b> hypothesis is that diverse bulky guanine N 7 adducts (regardless of structural similarities with the aflatoxins) should induce predominantly G-to-A transitions. Accordingly, we have recently observed that base substitutions induced by the acridine half-mustard ICR- 191 in the M 13 double-stranded DNA transfection system are predominantly G:C-to-A:T transitions. Here, by transfecting ICR- 191 -treated M 13 AB 28 single-stranded DNA into Escherichia coli, we show that base substitutions are predominantly targeted to guanines. Since the N 7 -adducted-guanine:thymine <b>mispairing</b> is proposed to require N 1 deprotonation promoted by the primary N 7 lesion, guanine imidazole ring-opening should abolish this <b>mispairing</b> property, and thereby alter the specificity of mutagenesis. Here, we show that the incubation of ICR- 191 -treated RF DNA at pH 10. 5 results in a significant reversal of the specificity of G:C-targeted substitutions such that G-to-T transversions predominated over G-to-A transitions. These data suggest that the ring-opened forms may be processed as classical noninstructional lesions as previously deduced for ring-opened aflatoxin-guanine lesions. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that <b>mispairing</b> by guanine N 7 adducts may be a source of induced as well as background mutagenesis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) increases replication fidelity by eliminating <b>mispaired</b> bases resulting from replication errors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, <b>mispairs</b> are primarily detected by the Msh 2 -Msh 6 complex and corrected following recruitment of the Mlh 1 -Pms 1 complex. Here, we visualized functional fluorescent versions of Msh 2 -Msh 6 and Mlh 1 -Pms 1 in living cells. We {{found that the}} Msh 2 -Msh 6 complex is an S phase component of replication centers independent of <b>mispaired</b> bases; this localized pool accounted for 10 %– 15 % of MMR in wild-type cells but was essential for MMR {{in the absence of}} Exo 1. Unexpectedly, Mlh 1 -Pms 1 formed nuclear foci that, although dependent on Msh 2 -Msh 6 for formation, rarely colocalized with Msh 2 -Msh 6 replication-associated foci. Mlh 1 -Pms 1 foci increased when the number of <b>mispaired</b> bases was increased; in contrast, Msh 2 -Msh 6 foci were unaffected. These findings suggest the presence of replication machinery-coupled and -independent pathways for <b>mispair</b> recognition by Msh 2 -Msh 6, which direct formation of superstoichiometric Mlh 1 -Pms 1 foci that represent sites of active MMR...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDNA polymerases {{generally}} {{select the}} correct nucleotide from {{a pool of}} structurally similar molecules to preserve Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. We report the structure of DNA polymerase β with DNA mismatches situated in the polymerase active site. This was achieved by using nicked product DNA that traps the <b>mispair</b> (template-primer, A-C or T-C) in the nascent base pair binding pocket. The structure of each <b>mispair</b> complex indicates that the bases do not form hydrogen bonds with one another, but form a staggered arrangement where the bases of the <b>mispair</b> partially overlap. This prevents closure/opening of the N subdomain that is believed to be required for catalytic cycling. The partially open conformation of the N subdomain results in distinct hydrogen bonding networks that are unique for each <b>mispair.</b> These structures define diverse molecular aspects of misinsertion that are consistent with the induced-fit model for substrate specificity...|$|R
