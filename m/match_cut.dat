5|$|Mystery Science Theater 3000 had {{the design}} of its main setting, the {{starship}} Satellite of Love, based on the bone-shaped satellite featured in the <b>match</b> <b>cut</b> from prehistoria to the future. The one-eyed design of the robot Gypsy led the show to do various scenes comparing it to HAL 9000, including {{a scene from the}} , where the opening featuring Mike Nelson jogging along the walls of the Satellite of Love parodies the scene where Frank Poole does the same in the Discovery.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural <b>match</b> <b>cut</b> following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
500|$|... 2001 {{contains}} a famous {{example of a}} <b>match</b> <b>cut,</b> a type of cut in which two shots are matched by action or subject matter. After an ape uses a bone to kill another ape at the watering hole, he throws it triumphantly into the air; as the bone spins in the air, the film cuts to an orbiting satellite, marking {{the end of the}} prologue. The <b>match</b> <b>cut</b> draws a connection between the two objects as exemplars of primitive and advanced tools respectively, and demonstrates humanity's technological progress since the time of the apes.|$|E
40|$|In a graph, a <b>matching</b> <b>cut</b> is an {{edge cut}} {{that is a}} <b>matching.</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Cut</b> {{is the problem of}} {{deciding}} whether or not a given graph has a <b>matching</b> <b>cut,</b> which is known to be NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs. It has been proved that <b>Matching</b> <b>Cut</b> is polynomially solvable for graphs of diameter two. In this paper, we show that, for any fixed integer d geq 4, <b>Matching</b> <b>Cut</b> is NP-complete in the class of graphs of diameter d. This almost resolves an open problem posed by Borowiecki and Jesse-Józefczyk in [Matching cutsets in graphs of diameter 2, Theoretical Computer Science 407 (2008) 574 - 582]. We then show that, for any fixed integer d geq 5, <b>Matching</b> <b>Cut</b> is NP-complete even when restricted to the class of bipartite graphs of diameter d. Complementing the hardness results, we show that <b>Matching</b> <b>Cut</b> is in polynomial-time solvable in the class of bipartite graphs of diameter at most three, and point out a new and simple polynomial-time algorithm solving <b>Matching</b> <b>Cut</b> in graphs of diameter 2...|$|R
40|$|In an undirected graph, a <b>matching</b> <b>cut</b> is a {{partition}} of vertices into two sets {{such that the}} edges across the sets induce a <b>matching.</b> The <b>matching</b> <b>cut</b> problem {{is the problem of}} deciding whether a given graph has a <b>matching</b> <b>cut.</b> The <b>matching</b> <b>cut</b> problem can be expressed using a monadic second-order logic (MSOL) formula and hence is solvable in linear time for graphs with bounded tree-width. However, this approach leads to a running time of f(ϕ,t) nO(1), where ϕ is the length of the MSOL formula, t is the tree-width of the graph and n is the number of vertices of the graph. In [Theoretical Computer Science, 2016], Kratsch and Le asked to give a single exponential algorithm for the <b>matching</b> <b>cut</b> problem with tree-width alone as the parameter. We answer this question by giving a 2 O(t) nO(1) time algorithm. We also show the tractability of the <b>matching</b> <b>cut</b> problem when parameterized by neighborhood diversity and other structural parameters...|$|R

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and filmed in Lake Como, Italy. [...] "It was obvious I was gonna ask her to do it", Stefani stated {{in an interview with}} VH1's Box Set. The video follows the song's theme and depicts the relationship that Stefani has with a former boyfriend, who is played by Spanish actor Daniel González. González and his new girlfriend—played by Tony Kanal's girlfriend, Erin Lokitz—are shown walking up to a villa where Stefani answers the door. The villa featured in the video is the Villa Erba, in the town of Cernobbio, which Stefani said was [...] "so beautiful". The three of them are seen in each other's company, with intercut scenes of Stefani singing on a bed. There are flashbacks to the time when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, where she has brunette hair. Flashbacks and present day images are linked with <b>match</b> <b>cut</b> cinematography. The lyrical theme of [...] "Cool" [...] is maintained in the video; frames are incorporated to portray Stefani feeling [...] "cool". She is depicted as cool with her former boyfriend and his girlfriend throughout most of the video.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening's {{animated}} series The Simpsons, {{of which}} Kubrick was a fan, and Futurama frequently reference 2001, {{along with other}} Kubrick films. In the opening of Episode 8F06 of The Simpsons (Lisa's Pony) the 'Dawn of Man' scene from 2001 is recreated with primates that include Homer; while all the primates are inspired to new levels of intellect by the monolith, the Homer primate uses it as a back rest to take a nap. [...] The Simpsons had in the episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] Bart throwing a felt-tip marker into the air; in slow motion it rotates, before a <b>match</b> <b>cut</b> replaces it with a cylindrical satellite. [...] In 2004 Empire magazine listed this as the third best film parody of the entire run of the show. The satellite docking sequence is also parodied as Homer Simpson floats through the spaceship eating potato chips. [...] In the Futurama episode [...] "Love and Rocket" [...] a sentient spaceship revolts {{in a manner similar}} to Hal. Games Radar listed this as number 17 in its list of 20 Funniest Futurama parodies, while noting that Futurama has referenced Space Odyssey on several other occasions.|$|E
50|$|Animator John McGrew {{borrowed}} much of {{the staging}} for the cartoon from Sergei Eisenstein's film The Battleship Potemkin.

500|$|The party scenes at Jesse's house {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Gilligan said these scenes were written {{because he wanted to}} demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences. The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale, and went with the course of events in [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience. Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} way to show a person going through a private hell. That everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy. Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse's state of mind, using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep. During one scene when Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together, Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs, then Skinny Pete pops back up in a <b>match</b> <b>cut.</b> The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming.|$|E

Planks and woodwork were piled on the decks {{to give to the}} two vessels the appearance of simple fireships. Thirty-two small craft, saturated with tar and turpentine and filled with inflammable materials, were to be sent down the river in detachments of eight every half hour, to clear away if possible the raft above the bridge and to occupy the attention of the Spaniards.|$|E

50|$|A film {{transition}} {{is a technique}} used in the post-production process of film editing and video editing by which scenes or shots are combined. Most commonly this is through a normal cut to the next shot. Most films will also include selective use of other transitions, usually to convey a tone or mood, suggest the passage of time, or separate parts of the story. These other transitions may include dissolves, L cuts, fades (usually to black), <b>match</b> <b>cuts,</b> and wipes.|$|R
