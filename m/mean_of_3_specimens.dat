ResultsBy designing primers specific for Staphylococcus aureus, specimens containing different kinds of pathogens were carried out by LAMP assay, and our data showed LAMP technology for the specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus in samples was successfully established. All clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were tested by both blood cultures and LAMP, and our data showed that compared wit blood culture method, the LAMP technology showed significantly high detection rate (P < 0. 01). ConclusionsAs a quick and easy detection of Staphylococcus aureus, the LAMP technology was successfully established, {{laid the foundation for}} the diagnosis and treatment of children Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and showed great promotion and application value...|$|R

This research is classified into Research and Development (R & D). This research was conducted through the following steps i. e.; (1) conducting the needs analysis, (2) writing a course grid, (3) writing the first draft, (4) getting expert judgment, and (5) writing the final draft. The subjects of this research were the ECC students of grade ten in SMA N 1 Kroya. The data were collected by distributing questionnaires and conducting interviews. There were two kinds of questionnaire. The questionnaires were administered {{to find out the}} needs of the ECC students in learning English and the feedback from the material experts. The data obtained were qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data were analyzed qualitatively, while the quantitative data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. In this research, the researcher designed three units of learning materials with eleven tasks in each unit. They are ‘Meta, What a Nice Bag!’, ‘That’s Surprising!’, and ‘Would You Like to Come?’.

The materials have been continually collected from the summer of 1949 by the Niishiomaru and the Hayatomaru of our college, and some fishing boats of Makurazaki. Till the summer of 1950, both species were perceived among them. The one was Evolantia micropterus (G. and V.) consisted <b>of</b> <b>3</b> <b>specimens</b> 40 to 65 mm in length, {{and the other was}} Exocoetus obtusirostris Gtr. <b>of</b> <b>3</b> <b>specimens</b> 33 to 51 mm in length. The author traced the alternation on the juvenile character of each species accompanied with the growth, comparing them with the numerous materials caught by the Hayatomaru during the summer of the last two years, mainly near Tane and Yaku Islands. In the former, within 65 mm in length, the lower jaw forms a beak-like extention as in Hemir hamphus, and its proportion to body length decreases gradually with the growth, although its actual length is not so shortened within these stages. Furthermore the posterior part of their dorsal is elevatd as in some species of Tylosurus. But in 86 mm-long specimen, the whole shape nearly agrees with the adult. In the latter, the body is deeper, lower jaw bears an unpaired barbel at its tip, the pectorals nearly transparent, and the ventral is deep black in the younger stages. Within 40 mm long, the length of barbel increases, while in the more advanced stages it does not; then, in about 65 mm long, the barbel dissapears suddenly. In the stages later than 65 mm long, the pectoral turns into dark, and the ventral into completely pale; and in 89 mm-long specimen, the whole shape is nearly identical with the adult...|$|R

In addition, the study analyzes relationship between HSQ and PS {{in the context of}} Iranian hospital services, using structural equation modeling (SEM) from patients’ perspectives. The maximum gap observed in “responsiveness” and the minimum one in “assurance”.
