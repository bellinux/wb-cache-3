5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
5|$|The new Jerash Bridge {{crosses the}} Zarqa {{upstream}} of King Talal reservoir, {{on the road}} from Amman to Jerash. The bridge {{is the site of}} a gauging station where flow <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> continuously taken.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} {{definition of}} the second is effectively {{the same as the}} current definition, the only difference being that the conditions under which the <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> made are more rigorously defined.|$|E
30|$|In the mandible, none of {{the angular}} <b>measurements</b> <b>were</b> significant. On the contrary, every {{difference}} between linear <b>measurements</b> <b>was</b> significant (P ≤  0.05). As in the maxilla, these <b>measurements</b> <b>were</b> greater in males than in females.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} downlink <b>measurements</b> <b>were</b> performed. The direct outdoor to indoor <b>measurement</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted with}} the relay node manually switched off.

5|$|For TSH, basal <b>{{measurements}}</b> <b>are</b> usually sufficient, {{as well as}} {{measurements of}} thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparation}} is normally necessary for this examination, {{but if a}} complementary study of abdominal veins is also required, the patient {{will be asked to}} fast for 12 hours beforehand. The sensitivity and specificity <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> around 90%.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Towers A, B, and C house mostly first-year freshmen. The towers {{are all of}} {{different}} heights, and differ slightly in their living accommodations. Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size, roughly 17ft (5.2m) by 11ft (3.4m). These <b>measurements</b> <b>are</b> not exact, however, because the three towers are cylindrical in shape (although actually twenty-sided) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat trapezoidal.|$|E
