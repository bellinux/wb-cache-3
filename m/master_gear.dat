40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{difficult}} problem of detection of pitch deviations of high-precision <b>master</b> <b>gears,</b> a new measuring instrument is developed. Detail description about measuring apparatus of pitch deviations developed for <b>master</b> <b>gears</b> was presented in the paper. Computer aided technology was used to deal with data collected by computer, and error analysis about the measuring apparatus was introduced, which affected measurement accuracy. The results confirm that the measuring apparatus is able to meet measurement requirement and improve efficiency through the measuring experiments on <b>master</b> <b>gears</b> of precision grade 2 and 1 with modulus 2 mm and 2. 5 mm, respectively. And the uncertainties of single pitch deviation and total cumulative pitch deviation are 0. 07 and 0. 26, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Evaluation of {{measurement}} {{performance of a}} gear measuring instrument (GMI) is not easy task since a <b>master</b> <b>gear</b> with sufficient accuracy has not been available. The manufacturing the <b>master</b> <b>gear</b> with an ideal involute form is very difficult and {{the accuracy of the}} <b>master</b> <b>gear</b> is not able to be estimated. Therefore, we have proposed a new artifact named Double Ball Artifact (DBA) which consists of a base plate and two balls for evaluating the gear profile measurement performance by the GMI [1, 2]. It has advantages of inexpensive, accurate, and calibrated with traceability. The DBA, however, is able only to evaluate the profile measurement capability of the GMI. In this paper, we describe a novel artifact evaluating the profile and the pitch measurement performances of the GMI simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aimed at the half-tooth <b>master</b> <b>gear</b> {{which is}} used for single and double–flank gear roll testing synchronously. By gear {{structure}} analysis, {{it was discovered that}} the half-tooth groove depth is the main fac-tor to determine gear tooth stiffness. On the basis, through the finite element analysis of gear with same mod-ule and several half-tooth groove depths, the relation between the maximal gear tooth deformation and the half-tooth groove depth was obtained and the optimal half-tooth groove depth corresponding the minimal gear tooth deformation was deduced. Then optimal half-tooth groove depths of several gears with different modules were obtained by the above methods, and an empirical equation was found by which the optimal half-tooth groove depth of a gear can be determined according to its module. Finally, the accuracy and appli-cability of the empirical equation were verified by example...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the vibration and noise of gears {{is an important issue}} in mechanical devices such as vehicles and wind turbines. The characteristics of the vibration and noise of gears are markedly affected by deviations of the tooth flank form of micrometre order; therefore, a strict quality control of the tooth flank form is required. The accuracy of the lead measurement for a gear-measuring instrument is usually evaluated using a <b>master</b> <b>gear</b> or a lead master. However, it is difficult to manufacture masters with high accuracy because the helix is a complicated geometrical form. In this paper, we propose a method of evaluating a gear-measuring instrument using a wedge artefact, which includes a highly precise plane surface. The concept of the wedge artefact is described and a mathematical model of the measuring condition of the wedge artefact is constructed. Theoretical measurement results for the wedge artefact are calculated. The wedge artefact is designed and produced {{on the basis of the}} theoretical measurement results. A measurement experiment using the wedge artefact is carried out and its effectiveness is verified...|$|E

40|$|Assistant professor,Mehanical department, vidya jyothi {{institute}} of technology,c. b. post. aziz nagar. Every component or structure is designed based on factor of safety. Which means the component should not fail below the design load. But in actual arena {{it is not}} so. There {{is a need for}} an analysis which predicts the life of the component. This requirement is satisfied by Fatigue analysis. It takes all types of loads i. e., static loads, random loads varying with time and gives life of the component as output. Present analysis is one such analysis of carrying fatigue test on spur gear using software package ANSYS. The gear fitted in the gearbox of armored tracked vehicle is vulnerable to considerable fatigue damage over its life period due to the dynamic excitations caused by the terrain undulations, the rotating wheel and track assemblies. For this purpose, initially static analysis of the model was carried out to validate the model and the boundary conditions correctness. Further Modal analysis is carried out to determine the dynamic characteristics of the gear model. The present work deals with the calculation of static and dynamic analysis, and fatigue life estimation of test gear, which is contacting <b>master</b> <b>gear</b> and assuming loading on the gear is random or constant amplitude by Finite Element package ANSYS. Initially gear system is modeled in CATIA V 5 later it is imported into ANSYS for further analysis...|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the success}} of Sonic games on the Sega Genesis, the series was {{introduced}} to the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. Sega began by releasing Sonic the Hedgehog, a 2D platform game, in 1991. The game featured Sonic's ability to run and to jump at high speeds like its Mega Drive/Genesis counterpart but with notably different level design and music. Sega later released Sonic the Hedgehog 2 another 2D platform game, in 1992. The game differed from its Genesis counterpart with different levels and music and by not including a [...] "spin dash" [...] maneuver. It also featured a different storyline in which Doctor Robotnik kidnaps Tails, who is non-playable in the <b>Master</b> System/Game <b>Gear</b> version. Sonic Chaos/Sonic and Tails (Japan), released in 1993, was similar to the earlier two Sega <b>Master</b> System/Game <b>Gear</b> Sonic games, but featured Tails as a playable character. A sequel, Sonic Triple Trouble/Sonic and Tails 2 (Japan), a 2D platform game, was released in 1994 for the Game Gear and introduced a new character, Nack the Weasel, who, along with Knuckles and Doctor Robotnik, raced to collect the Chaos Emeralds. One of the last games for the Sega Game Gear, Sonic Blast, was released in 1996 and featured prerendered sprites.|$|R
