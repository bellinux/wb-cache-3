In the aftermath, Kampung Akuarium became the most restive of Jakarta’s landscapes as residents returned to make claims for justice and compensation, and to remake their lives directly on the rubble of their old homes in defiance of the city government. Flanked by the preserved warehouses of the VOC, the ruined neighbourhood ultimately became a site where colonial histories, state- and capital-inflicted expropriation and ruination, and gendered forms of injury and struggle all found material modes of expression alongside one another. ...|$|R

50|$|Parts of {{the tactics}} and warfare of the Vikings were driven by their {{cultural}} beliefs, itself rooted in Norse culture and religion, and vividly recalled {{in the later}} Icelandic sagas. In the early Viking Age, during the late 8th century {{and most of the}} 9th, Vikings consisted of smaller tribal bands with a lack of any clear central authority, governance being rooted in tribal assemblies. Rooted in honour - a vital concept in Nordic pagan tradition - violence was used as a measure to moderate disputes with other tribal groups. This emphasis on violence as a decisive tool regarding disputes was not limited to a man, but extended to a man's kin. Violence was seen as a measure to defend honor. Honor was extremely important to Norsemen, and the sense of shaming one's honor extended beyond physical and <b>material</b> <b>injuries.</b> Honor could be shamed from mere insults, where Norsemen were expected to react with violence often resulting in death. Thus, with this prevalence of violence came the expectation of fearlessness.|$|R

The dismay of those on shore may be imagined, for now it seemed as if nothing could save their comrades from destruction; and certainly no human power did save them on that occasion; for, while they grasped the sides of the canoe helplessly, another wave drove them with a wild surge out of the tumbling water; so that the men were enabled to thrust her ashore; and, strange to say, though the frail vessel had been carried by tossing swells over rocks which were left naked a moment later, she had received no <b>material</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E

60|$|In {{proposing a}} {{modification}} of the Reparation terms, I have considered them so far only in relation to Germany. But fairness requires that so great {{a reduction in the}} amount should be accompanied by a readjustment of its apportionment between the Allies themselves, The professions which our statesmen made on every platform during the war, as well as other considerations, surely require that the areas damaged by the enemy's invasion should receive a priority of compensation. While {{this was one of the}} ultimate objects for which we said we were fighting, we never included the recovery of separation allowances amongst our war aims. I suggest, therefore, that we should by our acts prove ourselves sincere and trustworthy, and that accordingly Great Britain should waive altogether her claims for cash payment in favor of Belgium, Serbia, and France. The whole of the payments made by Germany would then be subject to the prior charge of repairing the <b>material</b> <b>injury</b> done to those countries and provinces which suffered actual invasion by the enemy; and I believe that the sum of $7,500,000,000 thus available would be adequate to cover entirely the actual costs of restoration. Further, it is only by a complete subordination of her own claims for cash compensation that Great Britain can ask with clean hands for a revision of the Treaty and clear her honor from the breach of faith for which she bears the main responsibility, as a result of the policy to which the General Election of 1918 pledged her representatives.|$|E
