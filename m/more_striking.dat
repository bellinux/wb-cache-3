5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is <b>more</b> <b>striking,</b> having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|Development of D {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{directed}} by WARP president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D would have never been created {{if it were not}} for playing those games. Eno and WARP were still relatively unknown in the industry, D would be their first major title. With this in mind, Eno felt that he was gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful he would stop developing games. There were three phases to Ds development: the adventure game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since the adventure gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game <b>more</b> <b>striking.</b> The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s.|$|E
50|$|In March 2016 <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> {{occurred}} after AFFCO announced staff layoffs.|$|R
50|$|Up to 1943, the {{occupation}} was relatively quiet. However, Danish acts of sabotage caused the Germans to harden their response, arresting those involved. This led to <b>strikes,</b> <b>more</b> arrests for civil disobedience, causing even <b>more</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After several <b>more</b> <b>strikes,</b> {{most notably}} against Fishery Products, {{trawling}} companies abandoned their insistence on unilaterally setting {{the price of}} fish and agreed to negotiated prices with fishermen.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, to create a <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E
5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In one of the <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> examples {{of the consequences of}} fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. It {{resulted in a}} rejection of the elaborate ornamentation of existing churches. New churches were produced in a plain style, often with a T-plan that emphasised the pulpit and preaching. This style was adopted by both Presbyterian and Episcopalian wings of the Scottish Kirk, but there were some attempts to introduce Baroque elements into church building after the Restoration. In the eighteenth century the influence of James Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple. This classicism continued into the early nineteenth century, but became increasingly controversial and began to be rejected for a version of the Gothic revival, which flourished into the early twentieth century. Between the world wars, a form of neo-Romanesque became the norm for new churches. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century new churches were highly influenced by modernism, resulting in rectangular and irregularly shaped buildings, built in new materials, although many of these were later demolished. As the level of new building reduced from the 1970s there was a move to functional and unambitious new churches, but in the 1980s there was a move back to <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> and original designs.|$|E
5|$|The protest {{movement}} {{spread to}} other cities, leading to <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for December 21, 1970.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the days}} that ensued, carrier planes hit not only targets in Japan but on Chichi Jima, hitting Japanese airfields. <b>More</b> <b>strikes</b> against Tokyo itself took place on 25 February.|$|R
50|$|Unrest {{amongst the}} railway workers would {{continue}} for another 3 years, with <b>more</b> <b>strikes.</b> The 1945 railway workers strike also inspired other groups, such as port and oil workers, to launch strike actions.|$|R
25|$|However, the semilattices used {{in these}} {{negative}} results are relatively complicated. The following result, proved by Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung in 1998, is <b>more</b> <b>striking,</b> because it shows examples of representable semilattices that do not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. We denote by FV(Ω) the free lattice on Ω in V, for any variety V of lattices.|$|E
25|$|Tchaikovsky {{considered}} his next ballet, The Sleeping Beauty, {{one of his}} finest works, according to Brown. The structure of the scenario proved more successful than that of Swan Lake. While the prologue and first two acts contain {{a certain number of}} set dances, they are not designed for gratuitous choreographic decoration but have at least some marginal relevance to the main plot. These dances are also far <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> than their counterparts in Swan Lake, as several of them are character pieces from fairy tales such as Puss in Boots and Little Red Riding Hood, which elicited a far more individualized type of invention from the composer. Likewise, the musical ideas in these sections are <b>more</b> <b>striking,</b> pointed and precise. This characterful musical invention, combined with a structural fluency, a keen feeling for atmosphere and a well-structured plot, makes The Sleeping Beauty perhaps Tchaikovsky's most consistently successful ballet.|$|E
25|$|However, {{more recent}} {{research}} has revealed {{that at least some}} prokaryotes have microcompartments such as carboxysomes. These subcellular compartments are 100–200nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins. Even <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> is the description of membrane-bound magnetosomes in bacteria, reported in 2006, as well as the nucleus-like structures of the Planctomycetes that are surrounded by lipid membranes, reported in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Ahidjo's {{battles with}} the UPC {{continued}} past Cameroon's independence on 1 January 1960. He outlawed the party's [...] "terrorist" [...] wing on 30 October 1963, leading to <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> in Bamileke population centres and subsequent military retribution.|$|R
50|$|Hioki faced Clay Guida on January 26, 2013 at UFC on Fox: Johnson vs. Dodson. Despite landing <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> than Guida, and {{consistently}} looking for submissions after {{being taken to}} the ground, Guida defeated Hioki via split decision.|$|R
5000|$|Combinations: Strikers may combine {{techniques}} {{in a series}} to ensure one or <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> impact their opponents. These attacks are thrown at various targets on the body, with the greatest force typically thrown with a particular technique in the sequence.|$|R
25|$|Far <b>more</b> <b>striking,</b> however, was {{the impact}} of Prohibition. Kenmore quickly became famous in Seattle for its fine country dining and, more importantly, its fine country drinking, as a {{substantial}} illegal alcohol industry developed {{to meet the demands}} of Jazz Age Seattle nightlife. Although relatively close to Seattle properthanks to Bothell Way's status as one of the few improved roads then heading north from downtown it was nonetheless far enough out that Department of Revenue officers could, for the most part, ignore it.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{coast of}} Patagonia was first fully {{explored}} in 1520 by the Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan, who on his passage {{along the coast}} named many of its <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> features – San Matías Gulf, Cape of 11,000 Virgins (now simply Cape Virgenes), and others. Magellan's fleet spent a difficult winter at what he named Puerto San Julián before resuming its voyage further south on 21 August 1520. During this time it encountered the local inhabitants, likely to be Tehuelche people, described by his reporter, Antonio Pigafetta, as giants called Patagons.|$|E
25|$|For <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> variants, Unicode has encoded variant characters, {{making it}} {{unnecessary}} to switch between fonts or lang attributes. In the following table, each row compares variants {{that have been}} assigned different code points. Note that for characters such as 入 (U+5165), {{the only way to}} display the two variants is to change font (or lang attribute) as described in the previous table. However, for 內 (U+5167), there is an alternate character 内 (U+5185) as illustrated below. For some characters, like 兌/兑 (U+514C/U+5151), either method can be used to display the different glyphs.|$|E
5000|$|... 1986 was a {{landmark}} year for Jacoby, as {{he earned his}} first All-Star Game appearance. While his statistics only improved slightly over 1985 (his average went up to [...]288 and 168 hits, with fewer home runs and RBI - and <b>more</b> <b>strike</b> outs).|$|R
6000|$|... "Proper {{laws for}} the {{maintenance}} of families would require further concession--but, in the outset, let but this law of wages be established, and if then we have any <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> you may denounce them without one word of remonstrance either from sense or sensibility.|$|R
50|$|Employers {{discouraged}} {{workers from}} joining unions through welfare capitalism. More unions/members meant <b>more</b> <b>strikes,</b> which also meant more loss of money. Employers like, Henry Ford, gave shorter work hours, shorter work days, higher pay, and some vacation {{time to keep}} the workers from joining the Union.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human habitation on Lewis {{is found in}} peat samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago much of the native woodland was torched {{to make way for}} grassland to allow deer to graze. The earliest archaeological remains date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds. The small houses of these people have been found throughout the Western Isles; in particular, at Dail Mhor, Carloway. The <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like Calanais.|$|E
25|$|The String Sextet, {{entitled}} Souvenir de Florence, {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} more interesting than the Piano Trio, better music intrinsically and better written. None of Tchaikovsky's other chamber works has a more positive opening, and the simplicity of the main section of the second movement is even <b>more</b> <b>striking.</b> After this very affecting music, the third movement progresses at least initially into a fresh, folksy world. Even more folksy is the opening of the finale, though Tchaikovsky takes this movement in a more academic direction with the incorporation of a fugue. This work has also been played in arrangements for string orchestra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few things <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E
40|$|For a two-period {{screening}} {{model of}} strikes it is shown that joint bargaining instead of enterprise negotiations lowers wages and implies <b>more</b> <b>strikes.</b> These results hold {{irrespective of the}} party possessing private information. The sensitivity of strike models to procedural assumptions thus seems less problematic than it may be conjectured. ...|$|R
50|$|On 12 October, {{rebel forces}} seized an air defense base {{east of the}} city, near al-Tana village and Koris {{military}} airport. After the capture, government air-strikes destroyed most of the rockets and radars at the base. By {{the end of the}} day, the rebels were preparing to withdraw, fearing <b>more</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the two previous Grand Prix cycles the number of tournaments was decreased from six to four and players playing just three tournaments. As a result there is no <b>more</b> <b>strike</b> result, but each tournament result counts toward the total points. Sixteen players were selected {{to compete in the}} tournaments.|$|R
25|$|We ought, then, to set {{up images}} of a kind that can adhere longest in memory. And we shall do so if we {{establish}} similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is <b>more</b> <b>striking,</b> or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.|$|E
25|$|Even <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> was the {{situation}} with Tāufaʻāhau, the later king George Tupou I. He {{was born in a}} chiefly family of lower rank, not belonging to the houʻeiki. As such he never could attend at the chiefly kava ceremonies as the equal of the high chiefs. By consequence he avoided them. Even after the Battle of Velata when he had defeated the Tuʻi Tonga and had become the most powerful man of the whole archipelago, he still remained a person of inferior rank. But then he had the power to take Lupepauʻu, who had been the wife of the Tuʻi Tonga and hence the highest ranking woman at that time as wife. Thus, paradoxically, his children were born into a higher 'status' than he had. Presently his descendants, the current royal family, are the highest ranking Tongans of all.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} living mammals, the <b>more</b> <b>striking</b> of Owen's {{contributions}} {{relate to the}} monotremes, marsupials and the anthropoid apes. He {{was also the first}} to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed (Perissodactyla) and the even-toed (Artiodactyla), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by Charles Darwin, in South America. Toxodon, from the pampas, was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata and herbivorous Cetacea. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant armadillo, which he named Glyptodon (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant ground-sloths, Mylodon (1842) and Megatherium (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the false killer whale in 1863.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} round, Griffin used his jab to keep Bonnar at a distance; Bonnar waited for counterpunching opportunities, opting {{at one point}} to attempt a {{spinning}} back kick. Eddie Bravo, the unofficial, commentator table judge, scored the first round in favor of Forrest Griffin. In the second round, Bonnar engaged <b>more</b> frequently in <b>striking</b> exchanges with Griffin. Bravo scored the round for Griffin. In the third round, Bonnar began landing <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> but Griffin finished the round by landing right hands.|$|R
5|$|News {{of the two}} strikes, {{with the}} mistaken reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly {{improved}} Japanese morale. The few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard Hiryū. Despite the heavy losses, the Japanese believed that they could scrape together enough aircraft for one <b>more</b> <b>strike</b> against what they {{believed to be the}} only remaining American carrier.|$|R
50|$|Etim faced Edson Barboza on 14 January 2012 at UFC 142. The two fought at {{a steady}} pace during the match with Barboza {{throwing}} <b>more</b> <b>strikes</b> while Etim went for takedowns. Etim was then knocked out {{in the third round}} by a spinning wheel kick. Both participants earned Fight of the Night honors for their performances.|$|R
