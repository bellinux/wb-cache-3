5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because tear propagation generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the creep behaviour should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical re-tensioning according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a monoaxial test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the <b>material</b> <b>strain</b> leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper climatic chamber for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of coated fabric and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the tear propagation with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E
5000|$|Zdeněk Bažant’s {{main focus}} is on {{mathematical}} modeling in mechanics of materials and structures. He has {{made significant contributions to}} several important engineering fields. E.g., in 1976 he showed by stability analysis that the concept strain-softening (then regarded by mechanics gurus as “insane”) does make sense if there is a finite material characteristic length that limits strain localization. Then, in 1983, he published a paradigm changing paper on the crack band model, which presented a simple way to handle nonlocal damage and avoid spurious mesh sensitivity. Both papers were hardly cited for two decades but then the citations exploded (even though the 1983 paper was declined in a premier American journal and then published in a French journal little known at that time; the citations of this papers now run several hundred a year and in 2016 exceeded 2600, on Google). The crack band model is now embedded in various commercial programs and is applied in user’s subroutines for concrete, rocks and comosites, and is the mainstay in design of large commercial composite airframes (e.g., at Boeing). [...] It was similar with Bažant’s (by now classical) material models for nonlocal damage, for energetic (non-statistical) size effect in quasibrittle fracture, for microplane constitutive modeling, for a solidifying material model for concrete creep, for calculations of moisture diffusion in nano-pores of concrete, and for his solution of elastic three-dimensional singularities at skew intersections of crack front line with a surface. They all became highly cited only recently. So did. his monumental treatise on stability of structures, innovative in treating the stability of fracture and damage, thermodynamics of structural stability, and objective stress rates for 3D bodies. Ditto his pioneering books on fracture and size effect in concrete, on concrete at high temperatures, and on concrete creep and shrinkage. Bažant is best known as the world leader in scaling research in solid mechanics. Bažant size effect law, with his demonstrations (mainly in six papers during 1976-91) of damage localization instabilitites and of spurious dependence of the early strain-softening models on element size, {{took a long time to}} sink in. But eventually it changed the design computations in concrete and geotechnical industry, and impacted the design practice in fiber composites (for large aircraft, ships and, car crashworthiness). The RILEM standard recommendation for testing of fracture energy and characteristic length of concrete (FMT/1990) is based on Bažant’s law. [...] Later Bažant extended his scaling research to statistical size effect. Exploiting the frequency law of interatomic bond breaks, he showed that, due to fracture process zone finiteness, the statistical strength of quasibrittle structures follows a graft of Gauss and Weibull distributions and exhibits a strong size effect, causing the safety factors and static and fatigue lifetimes of quasibrittle structures to be size dependent. He demonstrated that disregard of size effect was a major factor in many structural failures. His proposals of code provisions taking into account the size effect on shear failures of beams and slabs has been endorsed by ACI Committee 446 but not yet accepted for the ACI concrete design code. [...] Bažant’s microplane model for softening damage in concrete, rocks, composites, etc., in which the constitutive law is written in terms of stress and strain vectors on a generic plane, trades conceptual simplicity and clarity of physical interpretation for higher computational demands, which initially stifled applications but recently ceased to be an obstacle. The microplane model is now included in large-scale computer codes at U.S. national labs (EPIC, PRONTO, etc.) and in various commercial codes (ATENA, DIANA, SBETA, OOFEM). His microplane model for jointed rock is embedded, e.g., in ANSYS. With the microplane model, Bažant was able to capture the `vertex’ effect in softening damage, which is important for dynamics but cannot be simulated with the classical tensorial constitutive models (for concrete he also demonstrated by tests). He showed experimentally and theoretically that <b>material</b> <b>strain</b> softening reverses to hardening when the loading rate suddenly increases. [...] Bažant further made major theoretical and experimental contributions to the sustainability problems of infrastructure, to high temperature effects in nuclear containments and in tunnels exposed to fire, to thermodynamics and nano-mechanics of creep and shrinkage in hydrating cement, and to 3D singularities at fracture surface intersections. His Model B3 for practical prediction of concrete creep and shrinkage, calibrated by a worldwide database of thousands of laboratory tests assembled by his assistants, became an international standard recommendation (RILEM-CGS/1991). His nonlinear diffusion model for concrete is featured in Eurocode and widely used in durability analysis. His simple age-adjusted effective modulus method for concrete structure taking into account multi-decade chemical aging is embedded in the Eurocode as well as ACI standard recommendation. His unconditionally stable ‘exponential’ algorithm for rate-type concrete creep law is now standard in structural computations. [...] In finite strain theory and structural stability analysis, Bažant was the first to resolve the decades-old controversy about the 3D stability theories of Engesser, Haringx, Hencky, Truesdell, Biot, etc., as applied to soft-in-shear structures. In 1971, he showed by energy variational analysis that these theories correspond to different choices of objective stress rate and are all equivalent upon certain transformations of the tangential elastic moduli, and that some objective stress rates used in Abaqus, Ansys, LS-Dyna and other commercial codes do not conserve energy. This 1971 result was generally ignored until, a few years ago, Bažant demonstrated that the energy conservation error is non-negligible and can be of the order of 100% in the case of highly orthotropic structures, orthotropic damage, or high compressibility. Furthermore, he provided a coherent mechanical explanation of the collapse of WTC Towers in New York, and then derived the crush-down and crush-up differential equations of progressive collapse of tall buildings. [...] Bažant also developed a theory of the destructive alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete (including the diffusion of expanding gel) which matches test results; a theory on hundred year prediction of concrete creep based on inverse analysis of observed excessive bridge deflections, coupled with Bayesian extrapolation of short-time test data; and predictions models B3 and B4 for concrete creep and shrinkage (both drying and chemical-autogenous) which became standard international recommendations of RILEM. He also formulated new theory chemical aging due to cement hydration from hours to centuries at variable temperature and humidity, and a theory for of microprestress (eigenstress) in hydrated cement originating from disjoining pressures of hindered adsorbed water in nanopores. He extended his probabilistic theory of quasibrittle failure to the size effect on residual strength and lifetime, and on Paris law the cyclic crack growths in quasibrittle materials, and showed an analosy with dielectric breakdown. He demonstrated his non-statistical size effect for the fracture of bones and of dental materials. [...] Recently, with his motivated group of assistants, Bažant works on stability and propagation of hydraulic fracture in gas or oil shale and mitigation of environmental risks of fracking; on size effect in fatigue crack growth in quasibrittle materials; and on energy absorption in composite crush cans for cars. Considering the body forces do to water diffusing into shale pores, he showed that hydraulic fracture must branch laterally, and determined their spacing inversely, based on gas production observations. He formulated a new theory of comminution of solids under impact due to release of kinetic energy of high-rate shearing, analogous to turbulence. He examined critically the new theory of ‘peridynamics’ and showed its limitations. Bažant strives in his contributions for practical relevance, originality, clarity and mathematical simplicity. Despite engaging in some super-computer simulations, he prefers analytical approaches as a way to reach deeper understanding, even at the cost of inevitable simplifications. At the same time, he has always extensively validated his results by experimental data and, when facing a vacuum of experimental evidence, conducted a host of innovative experiments with his own research team. [...] By 2016, Bažant’s H-index reached 112, i10-index 550 and his total citations 54,000 (on Google Scholar, incl. self-cit.).|$|E

40|$|Direct displacement-based design (DDBD) {{represents}} an innovative philosophy for seismic design of structures. When structural considerations are more critical, DDBD design should {{be carried on}} the basis of limiting <b>material</b> <b>strains</b> since structural damage is always strain related. In this case, the outcome of DDBD is strongly influenced by the displacement demand of the structural element for the target limit strains.

However, in the previous studies, anchorage slip effect is either ignored or lumped into flexural deformations by applying the equivalent strain penetration length. In the light of the above, an attempt is made in this paper to include explicitly anchorage slip effect in DDBD of R/C column elements.

This phenomenon is especially strong in highly ductile steel alloys. The strain rate effect is rarely considered in commercial simulations of forming processes.

The idea is based on the ability to deduce Au nanoparticles (NPs) distance distributions from polarized optical extinction spectroscopy which could thus give access to <b>material</b> <b>strains.</b> Variations of interparticle distances distributions can indeed lead to variations of plasmonic coupling and thus to material color change as shown here experimentally and numerically for random Au NP assemblies deposited onto elastomer films...|$|R

Viscous materials, like honey, resist shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. Elastic <b>materials</b> <b>strain</b> when stretched and quickly return to their original state once the stress is removed. Viscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and, as such, exhibit time-dependent strain. Whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid, viscosity {{is the result of}} the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material.|$|R
