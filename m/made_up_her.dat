5|$|Abi and Babe {{discover}} that Ben's half sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) {{has been using}} Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that she would say yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it is over the letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts to undress her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people have been hurt. When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.|$|E

Her devotions aimed at gaining the favor of Shiva, the subsequent annihilation of Kamadeva, the consequent fall of the universe into barren lifelessness, regeneration of life, the subsequent marriage of Parvati and Shiva, the birth of Kartikeya, and the eventual resurrection of Kamadeva after Parvati intercedes for him to Shiva.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} intrigue failed, {{largely due}} to the intervention of Sophia's mother, Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Historical accounts portray her as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Johanna's hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for King Frederick of Prussia. The Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: she had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother Charles Augustus (Karl August von Holstein), who had died of smallpox in 1727 before the wedding could take place. In spite of Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to the daughter, who, on arrival in Russia in 1744, spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with the Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the Russian people. She applied herself to learning the Russian language with such zeal, she rose at night and walked about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons (even though she mastered the language, she retained an accent). This led to a severe attack of pneumonia in March 1744. When she wrote her memoirs, she said she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind when she came to Russia to do whatever was necessary, and to profess to believe whatever was required of her, to become qualified to wear the crown.|$|E
500|$|Donoghue {{wrote in}} The New York Times {{that he did}} not care much about what {{happened}} to Alice and her comrades. He felt that Lessing presents Alice as [...] "an unquestioned rigmarole of reactions and prejudices", which leaves no room for any further interest. Donoghue complained that Lessing has not <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind on whether her characters are [...] "the salt of the earth or its scum". In a review in the Chicago Tribune, Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable. He said Lessing's real interest is character development, but complained that the characters are [...] "trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions".|$|E

500|$|Blanchard had {{performed}} regularly at the Tivoli Gardens, making ascents {{twice a week}} {{when she was in}} Paris. She had been warned repeatedly of the danger of using fireworks in her exhibitions. This display was to be a particularly impressive one with many more pyrotechnics than usual, and it appears that the warnings had made an impression on her. Some spectators implored her not to make the ascent, but others, eager to see the show, urged her on. One report suggested that she finally <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind and stepped into her chair with the words [...] "Allons, ce sera pour la dernière fois" [...] ("Let's go, this will be for the last time").|$|E

[...] September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyoncé thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyoncé to record the song. Warren {{was present at the}} recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyoncé and Jay-Z on the phone.

There she became a friend of heiress Renée du Pont, a daughter of Senator T. Coleman du Pont of the du Pont family, and Mary Kirk, whose family founded Kirk Silverware. A fellow pupil at one of Wallis's schools recalled, [...] "She was bright, brighter than all of us. She <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind {{to go to the}} head of the class, and she did." [...] Wallis was always immaculately dressed and pushed herself hard to do well. A later biographer wrote of her, [...] "Though Wallis's jaw was too heavy for her to be counted beautiful, her fine violet-blue eyes and petite figure, quick wits, vitality, and capacity for total concentration on her interlocutor ensured that she had many admirers." ...|$|E

500|$|He also {{developed}} her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic {{so that the}} viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television. She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos, but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that [...] "You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent." [...] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone. Whitney described {{the application of the}} wig, saying [...] "they nailed it to my head every morning." [...] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it. In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hair instantly. The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{opted not}} to hire A-list celebrities to voice the film's main characters. Afterwards, the {{directors}} continued to audition hundreds of young actresses {{in the hopes of}} finding Rapunzel's voice, among them Broadway performer Idina Menzel, but none sounded quite right until they finally discovered singer and actress Mandy Moore. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney character as [...] "the ultimate fantasy", Moore was a long-time fan of Disney films. Initially, knowledge that the role was being heavily sought after at the time deterred her from auditioning in favor of avoiding disappointment. Once she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind to audition, Moore [...] "chased after" [...] the role, auditioning for it twice. Because the film is a musical requiring its cast to provide both their characters' speaking and singing voices, all candidates were asked to perform one song of their choice in the style of a singer-songwriter; Moore, a professional singer herself, auditioned with Joni Mitchell's [...] "Help Me". Child actress Delaney Rose Stein was eventually cast as a young version Rapunzel. According to co-director Byron Howard, Moore [...] "has this great soul to her voice" [...] as well as [...] "this down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that makes her everything you could hope for in a Disney heroine." ...|$|E
500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My feeling is that she is not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact". However, within a month she had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind. She wrote to a friend, [...] "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." [...] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters [...] "out of pity", and called the claims [...] "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, [...] "I never received any such telegram." [...] The supposed telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case. Xenia said, ...|$|E

She's strong, she's pretty and she's a proud Jewish woman." [...] Mutchnick revealed that Nicollette Sheridan was originally brought in to read the part of Grace, but even though she did a [...] "great job", her performance was [...] "too desperate". Mutchnick and Kohan decided to cast Messing in the role instead, {{who at the time}} was starring in ABC's drama Prey. After her first meeting with them, Messing was not convinced she wanted the role. Messing revealed that Mutchnick and Kohan showed up at her home with a bottle of vodka; [...] "They poured me several shots, we spoke for several hours and they pitched me the show. I'm a lightweight. I didn't need much to be a little giddy. By the end of the evening, they said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Let's talk tomorrow.'" [...] They called her the next day to inform her that they [...] "loved her" [...] and asked [...] "if she'd <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind". Messing still did not make her mind up. However, the following day, she called Mutchnick and Kohan and accepted the role. In discussion of the character, Messing said: [...] "I have a lot more confidence and I'm much more relaxed. I feel comfortable that Grace will be a character I'll enjoy doing for a long time." [...] She later, however, admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace. Messing was the last actor to be cast.|$|E

2500|$|After the Civil War broke out, {{the town}} of Concord, Massachusetts rallied, inspiring many young men to volunteer. The company {{assembled}} on the town common on April 19, 1861, {{the anniversary of the}} Battles of Lexington and Concord as they set off. Louisa May Alcott wrote to her friend Alf Whitman that it was [...] "a sight to behold". She was disappointed that she had to stay behind, lamenting, [...] "as I can't fight, I will content myself with working with those who can." [...] She joined local women who volunteered to sew clothes and provide other supplies. On her 30th birthday on November 29, 1862, she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind to do more.

2500|$|Arbuckle's {{attorneys}} later concentrated {{their attention}} on one woman named Helen Hubbard who had told jurors that she would vote guilty [...] "until hell freezes over". She refused {{to look at the}} exhibits or read the trial transcripts, having <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind in the courtroom. Hubbard's husband was a lawyer who did business with the D.A.'s office, and expressed surprise that she was not challenged when selected for the jury pool. While much attention was paid to Hubbard after the trial, some other jury members felt Arbuckle was guilty but not beyond a reasonable doubt, and various jurors joined Hubbard in voting to convict, including – repeatedly at the end – Thomas Kilkenny. Arbuckle researcher Joan Myers describes the political climate and the media attention to the presence of women on juries (which had only been legal for four years at the time), and how Arbuckle's defense immediately singled out Hubbard as a villain; Myers also records Hubbard's account of the jury foreman August Fritze's attempts to bully her into changing her vote. While Hubbard offered explanations on her vote whenever challenged, Kilkenny remained silent and quickly faded from the media spotlight after the trial ended.|$|E
