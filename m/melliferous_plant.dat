40|$|Background: Honey {{and honey}} based-products {{have a long}} {{tradition}} as a food source in Uzbekistan. The melliferous flora {{is one of the}} main resources for honey production. In this study, we present a review of some honey-based foods made in Uzbekistan and on the current state of the wild melliferous flora of Karakalpakstan, which is located in the northwestern part of Uzbekistan. This is the first such statistical study in a region in Uzbekistan after nearly 30 years. Methods: Field studies were carried out between 2013 and 2015. The <b>melliferous</b> <b>plants</b> were collected on territory of Karakalpakstan. More than 450 samples of plants have been collected from this region. Results: According to the literature, in 1978, there were 68 species of <b>melliferous</b> <b>plants</b> belonged to 32 genera of 19 families. In this study on the territory of Karakalpakstan, we found 206 species of wild vascular plants, which belonged to 134 genera of 46 families, that have commercial value for beekeeping. Among the 206 species of wild <b>melliferous</b> <b>plants</b> identified, 196 species are considered to have medicinal properties. An analysis of 13 leading families containing five or more types of <b>melliferous</b> <b>plants</b> showed that these families comprise 72. 05 % of the total melliferous flora. Discussion: The obtained data on the sequence of flowering of wild <b>melliferous</b> <b>plants</b> show that the vegetation period starts from March. After June, the bees start to collect honey from the cultivated species. These data suggest that the melliferous flora of Karakalpakstan has a fairly powerful resource base, which with a right approach can help us to get dozens of tons of high-quality, environmentally friendly honey, catering to all needs of Uzbekistan...|$|R

Therefore perennial plants constitute the most reliable bio materials for determining and evaluating the beekeeping regions of the Republic of Benin. A silvo-melliferous region (S-MR) is a geographical area characterised by a particular set of homogenous melliferous plants that can produce timber. Using both the prevailing climatic and the agro-ecological conditions six S-MRs could be identified, i. e. the South region, the Common Central region, the Central West region, the Central North region, the Middle North region and the Extreme North region. At the country level, the melliferous plants were dominated by Vitellaria paradoxa which is common to all regions. The most diversified family was the Caesalpiniaceae (12 species) followed by the Combretaceae (10 species) and Combretum being the richest genus. The effect of dominance is particularly high in the South region where Elaeis guineensis alone represented 72. 6 % of the tree density and 140 % of the total plant importance.

40|$|According to the {{evidence}} of linguistics, the Hungarians brought the knowledge of beekeeping {{with them to the}} Carpathian Basin. Beekeeping and the consumption of honey must have been a common practice in Csongrád (historically the county seat in the early Middle Ages), a settlement surrounded by water, as records show that in 1138 the people here were required to pay a tax in márc (mead). In Turkish times, mid- 16 th-century defters (taxation lists) provide evidence of beekeeping during that period. After the Turks were driven out of Hungary, a record dating from 1731 shows that as part of his economic organising activity the Hungarian landowner Sándor Károlyi wanted to make beekeeping a taxable activity. Notitia, an 18 th-century description by Mátyás Bél (minister of religion, teacher, historian), and the survey ordered in the time of Joseph II record the endowments for beekeeping (extensive natural stretches of water and melliferous wildflowers) as well as the man-made conditions (cultivated <b>melliferous</b> <b>plants</b> such as tobacco, grapevines, fruit trees). 19 th-century sources also confirm the existence of local beekeeping. Material collected orally in 2004 shows that folk and peasant beekeeping was practised at several places in the area in the late 19 th and the 20 th centuries.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} method to predict the honey production of an apiary by means of landscape variables. A model was built using attractivity and productivity formulae based upon the flowering periods, the distances to the apiary, and the density and specific nectar productivity of the floral species surrounding the apiary. Honey harvests of 12 apiaries in Wallonie, Belgium (Fig. 1), were recorded from 1998 to 2000. The plant species, location and absolute percentage of cover of nectar-producing (<b>melliferous)</b> <b>plants</b> within a radius of two km of each apiary were surveyed during the summer 2000. These data were encoded and geo-referenced with a Geographical Information System (GIS). This software used tables containing data from field survey and the theoretical melliferous potentials of encountered plants (Tab. I). The model brought out the listing of foraged flowers and their potential honey productivity during flowering periods for each foraging area studied (e. g. Fig. 3). The predictions of honey production (kg/hive/year) were compared to the actual production and the model explained 60 % of the variance of the observations (F- 1,F- 10 = 37. 76; P < 0. 001; r(2) = 0. 60; Fig. 2). Some tests of the sensitivity of the results to changing parameters showed the importance of a minimal 2 -km radius to model the foraging range (Tab. II). Taking into account landscape diversity, the abundance of areas containing dense melliferous flora was also essential. This work improves our understanding of the melliferous value of the landscape around an apiary. This model represents an interesting tool for beekeepers that would like to evaluate the potential honey production of an area and represents progress in the cartography of regional beekeeping potential...|$|R

Our study describes the application and development of SRAP procedures to A. exscapus ssp. transsilvanicus, including sampling, DNA extraction, PCR amplification and electrophoresis. Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) molecular marker {{system is going to}} be applied to samples from eight different populations of A. exscapus ssp. transsilvanicus to identify the degree of polymorphism and to determine the survival potential of the subspecies. The results confirmed the suitability of the DNA extraction method to be applied and the optimal PCR protocol of the SRAP technique for large-scale studies we are performing on this vulnerable subspecies...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{over the last years}} in techniques using alternative and pharmaceutical plants due to their wide potential ap-plications. These species are characterised by valuable and multidirectional usable features, due to which their practical application is superior to their physiognomic features. These plants may provide a raw material for pro-duction of medicines, cosmetics or may be used for animal feeds. Moreo-ver they may be used as ornamental, <b>melliferous</b> and energy <b>plants.</b> Owing to their generally low soil requirements they are used in the reclamation of degraded land. Among the species characterized by multidirectional use are Silphium perfoliatum, Helichrysum arenarium and Stevia rebaudiana. These plants are characterized by a high content of active compounds and a number of pro-health characteristics. Because raw materials for production of medicines and cosmetics should be standardized, cultures maintained under controlled conditions are a good source of seedlings...|$|R
40|$|The {{soil and}} climate {{conditions}} in Romania are favorable for the sunflower crops. The sunflower {{is one of}} the main large culture crops in Romania and the most important oilseed plant, being on the third place as cultivated area, after corn and wheat. This makes the sunflower the most important <b>melliferous</b> crop <b>plant,</b> ensuring the last great production harvest before winter. This importance results both from the period and the duration of flowering, and from the large number of flowers per unit of area and the great nectar secretion. Yet, the melliferous capacity in sunflower is affected by the climate conditions [3], fact ascertained by beekeepers over great variations in time and space of honey productions. Likewise, the melliferous capacity in sunflower differs from one hybrid to another [1][2], the beekeepers being interested in the melliferous capacities specific to various sunflower hybrids cultivated in our country. The current work depicts the results of researches on the melliferous capacity on a variety of 4 sunflower hybrids cultivated over 5 periods, under the conditions of the southern part of Romania, (15 km North-East from Bucharest) and under the climate conditions of 2007. The studied sunflower hybrids were: Fleoret OR, Melodi, Sunko and Arena. By the cultivation over different periods it was intended that the flowering period to overlap periods with different climate conditions, so to determine the melliferous potential in the hybrids studied in different climate conditions and to note the way in which the vary according to the climate conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in Matipwili village area in Bagamoyo District, Coast Region to assess the viability and implementation of beekeeping as a means of income generation and environment conservation. The project comprises of community needs assessment supplemented by socio-economic study and a project implementation. Data were collected using interviews, questionnaires, observation, and documentary search. The socio-economic study established that beekeeping project is viable and there was a need for capacity building to MEDEC a CBO engaged in beekeeping for income generation and environment conservation. The implementation of the beekeeping project aimed at training MEDEC members and sensitizing community on beekeeping, adopting beekeeping techniques using Longstroth hives and <b>planting</b> <b>Melliferous</b> trees for bee foraging. The project objectives attained includes <b>planting</b> 420 <b>Melliferous</b> trees, keeping 10 Longstroth hives, training of all MEDEC members; sensitizing and mobilizing community members for beekeeping and environment conservation. It was recommended further studies on the role of beekeeping in generating income for rural communities. (Author abstract) Mariki, B. E. (2007).

40|$|The Maya of the Yucatan {{region have}} a long history of keeping the native stingless bees (subfamily Meliponinae). However, market forces in the last few decades have driven the Maya to favor the use of {{invasive}} Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) for producing large quantities of high quality honey that has an international market. Furthermore, the native bees traditionally used by the Maya are now disappearing, along with the practice of keeping them. ^ An interdisciplinary approach was taken in order to determine the social factors behind the decrease in stingless beekeeping and the ecological driving forces behind their disappearance from the wild. Social research methods included participant observation with stingless beekeepers, Apis beekeepers, and marketing intermediaries. Ecological research methods included point observations of commonly known <b>melliferous</b> and polliniferous <b>plants</b> along transects in three communities with different degrees of human induced ecosystem disturbance. ^ The stingless bee species most important to the Maya, Melipona beecheii, has become extremely rare, and this has caused a breakdown of stingless beekeeping tradition, compounded with the pressure of the market economy, which fuels Apis beekeeping and has lessened the influence of traditional practices. The community with the heaviest amount of human induced ecosystem disturbance also had the highest degree of dominance of Apis mellifera, while the area with the most intact ecosystem had the highest diversity of stingless bees, though Apis mellifera was still the dominant species. Aggressive competitive behavior involving physical attacks by Apis mellifera against stingless bees was observed on several occasions, and this is a new observation previously unreported by science. ...|$|R
