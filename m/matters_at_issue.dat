There is no infamy too great or too little for the partisans of the various candidates to commit and accuse their opponents of committing. While {{every one of them}} declares, and in his heart believes, that honest arguments have greater weight than dishonest; that falsehood reacts on the falsifier's cause; that appeals to passion and prejudice are as ineffectual as dishonorable, few have the strength and sense to deny themselves the luxury of all these methods and worse ones. The laws against bribery, made by themselves, are set at naught and those of civility and good breeding are forgotten. The best of friends quarrel and openly insult one another. The women, who know almost as little of the <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> as the men, take part in the abominable discussions; some even encouraging the general demoralization by showing themselves at the public meetings, sometimes actually putting themselves into uniform and marching in procession with banners, music and torchlights.|$|E

60|$|All {{the earlier}} biographers of Swift Mr. Forster brushes contemptuously aside, {{though we do}} not find much that is {{important}} in his own biography which industry may not hit upon somewhere or other in the confused narrative of Sheridan, for whom and for his sources of information he shows a somewhat unjust contempt. He {{goes so far as}} sometimes to discredit anecdotes so thoroughly characteristic of Swift that he cannot resist copying them himself. He labors at needless length the question of Swift's standing in college, and seems to prove that it was not contemptible, though {{there can be no doubt}} that the contrary opinion was founded on Swift's own assertion, often repeated. We say he seems to prove it, for we are by no means satisfied which of the two Swifts on the college list, of which a facsimile is given, is the future Dean. Mr. Forster assumes that the names are ranked in the order of seniority, but they are more likely to have been arranged alphabetically, in which case Jonathan would have preceded Thomas, and at best there is little to choose between three mediocriters and one male, one bene, and one negligenter. The document, whatever we may think of its importance, has been brought to light by Mr. Forster. Of his other materials hitherto unpublished, the most important is a letter proving that Swift's Whig friends did their best to make him a bishop in 1707. This shows that his own later account of the reasons of his change from Whig to Tory, if not absolutely untrue, is at least unjust to his former associates, and had been shaped to meet the charge of inconsistency if not of desertion to the enemy. Whatever the motives of his change, it would have been impossible to convince a sincere Whig of their honesty, and in spite of Mr. Forster's assertion that Addison continued to love and trust him to the last, we do not believe that there was any cordiality in their intercourse after 1710. No one familiar with Swift's manner of thinking will deem his political course of much import in judging of his moral character. At the bottom of his heart he had an impartial contempt for both parties, and a firm persuasion that the aims of both were more or less consciously selfish. Even if sincere, the <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> between them were as despicable to a sound judgment as that which divided the Big and Little-endians in Lilliput. With him the question was simply one between men who galled his pride and men who flattered it. Sunderland and Somers treated him as a serviceable inferior; Harley and Bolingbroke had the wit to receive him on a footing of friendship. To him they were all, more or less indifferently, rounds in the ladder by which he hoped to climb. He always claimed to have been a consistent Old Whig--that is, as he understood it, a High-Churchman who accepted the Revolution of 1688. This, to be sure, was not quite true, but it could not have been hard for a man who prided himself on a Cavalier grandfather, and whose first known verses were addressed to the non-juring primate Sancroft after his deprivation, to become first a Tory and then a conniver at the restoration of the Stuarts as the best device for preventing a foreign succession and an endless chance of civil war. A man of Swift's way of thinking would hardly have balked at the scruple of creed, for he would not have deemed it possible that the Pretender should have valued a kingdom at any lower rate than his great-grandfather had done before him.|$|E

He also characterised the Eighteenth Annual Report of the Board of Managers of the Boston Prison Discipline Society (1843) on the <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> as a [...] "flagrant instance of trickery". A sequel was Our Present Gaol System Deeply Depraving to the Prisoner and a Positive Evil to the Community: Some Remedies Proposed (1847).

40|$|In the {{two decades}} before the First Jewish war, litigants or diplomats from the {{province}} of Judaea had recourse to Roman emperors {{on a number of}} occasions. In some cases the <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> involved objections against actions of Roman prefects of Judaea. Evidence about the outcomes of the hearings and diplomatic encounters shows that the emperors Claudius and Nero usually gave decisions in favour of the Jewish side, especially when the Jewish party was the Jerusalem priesthood. It is argued that it was a consistent policy of these emperors to be fair and more than fair to the Jerusalem priests in these years—to the point of ruling against their own procurators on a number of occasions. It is suggested, in view of this, that when the case of Paul of Tarsus came before Caesar in the early sixties, the decision probably went in favour of Paul's accusers. 23 page(s...|$|E

The article introduces {{a contribution to the}} theoretical reflections about the concepts of ethics and responsibility. The treatment crosses the concepts and it deal with them having recourse to definitions proposed in social psychology, philosophy, and economy. Specifically, our concern is addressed to the related themes which, in latest years, have been linked to ethics and responsibility: trust, social capital, cooperation and competition: Which are implications of reciprocal behaviors? Which processes does reciprocity feed, and which implications towards a collective responsibility? How could scholars define and study collective responsibility beyond risks of disengagement? The whole account plays between theoretical frames and real life contexts and between individual aspects and collective dimensions of processes and <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue.</b> Theoretical proposals are discussed by means of organizational world and real life contexts in order to make our reader - reflexively and actively - actor of his own future, which is already here...|$|E

40|$|This book is chiefly {{addressed}} to my fellow economists. I {{hope that it}} will be intelligible to others. But its main purpose is to deal with difficult questions of theory, and only in the second place with the applications of this theory to practice. For if orthodox economics is at fault, the error is to be found not in the superstructure, which has been erected with great care for logical consistency, but in a lack of clearness and of generality in the pre misses. Thus I cannot achieve my object of persuading economists to re-examine critically certain of their basic assumptions except by a highly abstract argument and also by much controversy. [ [...] ] The <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> are of an importance which cannot be exag-gerated. But, if my explanations are right, it is my fellow economists, not the general public, whom I must first convince. At this stage of the argument the general public, though welcome at the debate, are only eavesdroppers at an attempt by an economist to bring to an issue the deep divergences of opinion between fellow economists which have for the time being almost destroyed the practical influence of economic theory, and will, until they are resolved, continue to do so...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{starts from}} the {{proposition}} that although the Rehnquist Court imposed limits on federal power {{in the name of}} states 2 ̆ 7 rights far more aggressively than did its post- 1937 predecessors, it just as often chose not to impose limits in cases that otherwise fairly can be thought to have presented a question of federalism. The article then makes three claims. First, the article argues that any ultimately satisfying account of the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism doctrine must acknowledge that the decisions have often appeared to be driven as much by the Justices 2 ̆ 7 policy preferences about the underlying substantive <b>matters</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> in the cases as they have by any neutral theory of federalism. Second, the article acknowledges that there are other accounts of why the Rehnquist Court only selectively invoked federalism, but argues that none of those accounts is superior to the instrumentalist account as a descriptive matter. To the extent that those accounts do accurately capture the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism doctrine, moreover, the article argues that they nonetheless leave the Justices room to choose when to invoke federalism and when to preference other values, constitutional or otherwise. And it is in the exercise of this doctrinal discretion that the Rehnquist Court has invited the charge that its federalism cases are driven as much by instrumentalist goals as by neutral principles of federalism. Whereas the first two claims address the ends in federalism cases - {{in the sense that the}} Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism cases cannot be understood without considering the underlying policy objectives advanced by those decisions - the article 2 ̆ 7 s third claim concerns the means in federalism cases. Specifically, the article considers why, if the instrumentalist account is correct, the ostensible constraints of judicial convention - particularly the requirement of a reasoned judicial opinion and the practices of adherence to precedent and (for those who claim to be originalists) reliance on a finite set of original source materials - have failed in federalism cases. The article 2 ̆ 7 s third claim is that careful study of the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism decisions reveals that the Justices systematically made careful, selective use of precedent and selectively relied on founding-era voices in cases in which originalism was the chosen methodology...|$|E
