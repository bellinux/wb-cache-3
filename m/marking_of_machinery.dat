In 1917, during the First World War, the Allevard forges passed into the control of the Compagnie des forges et aciéries de la marine et d'Homécourt (Company of marine forges and steelworks and of Homécourt) (FAMH) under the guidance of Théodore Laurent. It was a time of great innovation - new hydro-electric developments on the Breda and concentration of production around springs, magnets, and ferro-alloys. The 1930 crisis significantly affected Allevard and severely restricted its production. In 1940, the defeat and catastrophic floods in the upper valley of Breda and even stopped all production for some time. Liberation <b>marked</b> the renewal <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> (10,000 tons / year of rolled products) and a steady influx of immigrant workers on three industrial sites: The Gorge of Allevard - Champ Sappey, Saint-Pierre-d'Allevard, and Le Cheylas. Subsequent years would see the adoption of continuous casting and the unfortunate association with Ugine for the manufacture of magnets. In 1973-1974 the completion of the power station <b>of</b> Moulins <b>marked</b> paradoxically the end of the forges from their home since the 15th century.|$|R

40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the challenges and}} prospects of private forest owners’ cooperation based on the use <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> in Slovenia applying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats approach (SWOT analysis) {{in combination with the}} analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The data from questionnaires with forest owners and presidents <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> rings were used to develop and to analyze the strategies for forest owners’ cooperation. The results reveal that the members <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> rings are only partly satisfied with the operation of the existing rings and that the activities of rings meet the members’ interests related to forest management. Thus, machinery rings are recognized as a suitable form of forest owners’ cooperation. The presidents <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> rings perceive the integration of farmers and private forest owners, as well as knowing the level of mechanization of members as major strengths <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> rings. Further, strengthening the operation <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> rings in the field of forestry is recognized as an important opportunity. The shortage of means for operation is identified as a weakness for machinery rings, and the lack of subsidies for investments in equipment is identified as a critical threat. However, the rank of importance of the SWOT groups leads to defensive approach in the strategic planning where machinery rings have to minimize weaknesses in order to avoid threats. These results provide important insights in the future development of forest owners’ cooperation based on common use <b>of</b> <b>machinery...</b>|$|R
30|$|Proper {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> {{and equipment}} depends on appropriate security and ensuring their work continuity {{and efforts to}} improve their performance.

40|$|It is an {{important}} matter to decrease the {{mean time to repair}} (MTTR) in order to improve the reliability <b>of</b> <b>machinery.</b> When the factory workers repair as non routine operations, there is no operation manual. Therefore, the repairing quality depends on the maintenance engineer’s skill or the operator’s skill. However, in the non-routine operations, the correlation of the maintenance engineer’s experience and the decrease of MTTR does not necessarily exist. This is {{an important}} problem in optimum maintenance planning. So, an analysis of the influence of the human factor on the reliability <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> is desired. In this research, we make an action model for coping with the failures of maintenance engineers, and analyze the human factor which affects the reliability <b>of</b> <b>machinery.</b> In addition, we consider the improvement of the reliability <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> by reducing the MTTR...|$|R
