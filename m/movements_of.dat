5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows {{that marked the}} <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting sun at the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as CT scanning, of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the brain was very small relative to body size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the eye with <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey.|$|E

50|$|Ludwig van Beethoven wrote many {{variation}} sets in his career. Some were independent sets, {{for instance}} the Diabelli Variations, Op. 120, and the Eroica Variations in E major, Op. 35.

Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E
