50|$|The <b>megrim</b> {{prefers a}} sandy or muddy sea floor. They are predators and eat small fish and squid and also consume crustaceans. In turn <b>megrim</b> are {{themselves}} prey for larger {{species such as}} sharks, seals and large cod. <b>Megrim</b> spawn in deep waters off Iceland and the west of Ireland, {{while there is a}} separate spawning population in the Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|<b>Megrim</b> are commercially {{valuable}} and are caught {{by a number}} of nations around Europe. It is caught by bottom trawling and is directly targeted in some fisheries, whereas in others it is retained as a valuable bycatch. France and Spain are the largest consumers of this species with most of the <b>megrim</b> caught in British water being exported to these nations. However, there has been a drive in Britain to get people to eat more <b>megrim</b> as a way of taking pressure off overexploited fish such as cod and haddock.Megrim can be cooked {{in a number of different}} ways with grilling, baking, frying and poaching all effective ways of preparing this species. In the UK <b>megrim</b> is sometimes given an alternative name such as <b>megrim</b> sole and Cornish sole as a way of making this species more appealing to consumers.|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} <b>megrim</b> occur in Irish waters but Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis {{constitutes}} {{the bulk of}} the catch by the Irish demersal fleet. <b>Megrim</b> is exploited as a by-catch of gadoid fisheries and is particularly associated with fisheries for Nephrops, angler and ray. Over the past 25 years <b>megrim</b> landings from the ICES divisions adjoining Ireland have fluctuated between 6, 000 and 21, 000 tonnes but there has been a gradual upward trend of which Ireland has taken an increasing share, rising to 1, 800 tonnes in 1980. Spain exerts most influence in this fishery, being the location of the main market for <b>megrim</b> as well as having the greatest catching power. The most significant developments in the exploitation of <b>megrim</b> over the past twenty years are identified as the establishment of the European Exclusive Fishery Zone in 1977 and the entry of Spain to the Community in 1986. The importance of division Vlla as a producer of <b>megrim</b> has declined and the main fisheries for the species are in divisions VlIg-k. This assessment of the species is based on material gathered in 1989 and 1990 when length frequency data from the landings were collected from the west and south coasts. Lengths of approximately 8, 000 <b>megrim</b> from landings from all divisions were collected in 1989, 28, 000 the following year, and 1, 400 were aged in the two years. Samples of the landings are comparable with graded exports from the fleet. The most intensive work was undertaken on a Nephrops and mixed whitefish fishery in Vllj. <b>Megrim</b> discards (round) are estimated to weigh 13. 2 % of landings (gutted). Few <b>megrim</b> of less than 20 cm were captured and no 0 group <b>megrim</b> was encountered. A growth curve is calculated for females and for females and males combined. For males the to value is outside the range of that parameter recorded elsewhere. Males are however a small proportion of the total, their higher mortality and slower growth giving them a skewed frequency distribution and reducing their contribution to the landings. Catch curves provided values for Z of 0. 45 and 0. 49 for females and combined sexes. Yield per recruit curves indicate exploitation is close to F max for females and on the negative slope for the sexes combined...|$|R

50|$|The four-spot <b>megrim</b> (Lepidorhombus boscii) is {{a species}} of {{flatfish}} in the Scophthalmidae family.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of <b>megrim</b> captured by Irish and joint venture (Spanish) vessels in Divisions Vll b, c, j, k {{is based on}} landings from both fleets and discards from Irish vessels targeting whitefish and Nephrops. Fishing activity by the joint venture fleet is centred on the 200 m depth contour. <b>Megrim</b> CPUE has declined since 1985. Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis constitutes {{the majority of the}} landings by joint venture vessels; L. boscii amounts up to 2 % by weight of the landings from deeper waters. In catches of undersized <b>megrim,</b> L. boscii was 12 % of the total. Landings of L. whiffiagonis have similar length frequency distributions in the Irish inshore and joint venture fleets. There are indications of what may be seasonal abundance in the discards and landings of Irish vessels fishing inshore. Discards were calculated as 77 % of landed weight {{in the first half of}} the year and 31 % in the second. <b>Megrim</b> with an inshore provenance were slightly larger than those coming from deeper waters. The following growth parameters were calculated: L∞ = 51. 2 cm, k = 0. 17 and to = - 0. 97. A catch curve derived from the combined landed and discarded <b>megrim</b> has a value of Z = 0. 45, slightly less than the value calculated for the inshore Irish fleet (0. 49). F is consequently in much the same position as in the 1989 - 90 assessment, on the negative slope of the yield per recruit curve. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R

40|$|Gelatin gels {{made from}} cod and <b>megrim</b> skins were formed using high {{pressure}} and subsequent cooling at 7 °C during 16 - 18 h. Pressure treatments {{were carried out}} at two temperatures (20 and 7 °C) and 200, 300 and 400 MPa. Turbidity, gel strength and viscoelastic properties of these gels were studied. Gelatin gels from <b>megrim</b> showed lower degree of turbidity, independent of the treatment, only small significant differences were observed amongst them. In cod gelatins turbidity decreased as pressure increased, being higher at higher temperature. Gel strength of gelatin gels from <b>megrim</b> was about three times higher than gels from cod. High-pressure treatments improved gel strength only in gelatin gels from cod. However, in gels from <b>megrim,</b> which has high gelling capacity in comparison to cod gelatins, gel strength values of pressurized gels were lower than the control. Melting and gelling points did not vary substantially with pressure although values tend to improve. Initial values of G′ and G″ at 5 °C after setting during 16 - 18 h were higher for <b>megrim</b> gelatins than cod gelatins except for high-pressure treated cod (400 and 200 MPa, 20 °C) that showed the highest value. Gelation mechanism appears to be different between pressure- and heat-induced gels and they affect different to bonds that stabilise or destabilise the gel network. The properties of the resulting gelatins are also influenced by the initial collagen (that is different depending on the fish species and amino and imino acid content) and by the concrete treatment process. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The icing system was prepared with two different concentrations of a commercial acid mixture-formula containing the three organic acids at 800 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg (C- 800 and C- 400 batches, respectively). Aerobic mesophiles, psychrotrophs, proteolytic bacteria, trimethylamine and pH were evaluated and the results compared with sensory analyses. Significantly (P < 0. 05) lower counts of mesophiles were found for hake and <b>megrim</b> in the C- 800 and C- 400 batches compared with the control batch. In the case of angler, significantly (P < 0. 05) lower counts of mesophiles, psychrotrophs and proteolytic microorganisms (P < 0. 05) were found for fish stored in the C- 800 icing conditions.

Her determination had brought her husband thither, and her determination further carried the day, when the captain, after staring at the solid-looking turf, stamping on the one stone that was visible, and trampling down the bunch of nettles beside it, declared that the entrance had been so thoroughly stopped that it was of no use to dig farther. It was Madam Martha who demanded permission to offer the four soldiers a crown apiece if they opened the vault, a guinea each if they found anything. The captain could not choose but grant it, though with something of a sneer, and the work was begun. He walked up and down with Robert, joining in hopes that the lady would be satisfied before dinner- time. The two clergymen likewise walked together, arguing, as was their wont, on the credibility of apparitions. The two ladies stood in almost breathless watch, as the bricks that had covered in the opening were removed, and the dark hole brought to light.

40|$|The {{sex ratio}} in the catches of <b>megrim</b> (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis, Walbaum) varied {{systematically}} with depth on three independent trawl survey series off {{the west coast}} of Ireland. Female <b>megrim</b> dominated the shallow catches, while males were more common in catches from deeper waters. The size difference between the sexes alone cannot explain this pattern because it remained evident when fish length was taken into account. Therefore size-specific habitat preferences or size-selective fishing mortality cannot fully explain the observed trend in the sex ratio of <b>megrim.</b> Female <b>megrim</b> grow to a larger size, at a faster rate than males and it is likely that their differences in habitat preferences are related to this. Shallower waters are warmer during the growing season and are likely to provide better conditions for fast growth. An understanding of the mechanisms behind these patterns is an important consideration in the management and conservation of this fish stock, which might be particularly vulnerable because the commercial landings are to a large extent dominated by female megrimNOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Journal of Sea Research.
