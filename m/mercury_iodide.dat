5000|$|In {{the early}} years of rubber production, high quality natural rubber was {{obtained}} from the tree, Hevea braziliensis, found in the regions bordering the Amazon river. [...] The high quality rubber exhibited desired properties, such as a high tensile strength (greater than 2800 psi) and a two-hour vulcanization time. Vulcanization is the process by which natural rubber is strengthened by cross-linking the different polymer chains, with either elemental sulfur bridges or other molecules known as accelerators. However, high quality natural rubber was expensive, with a price exceeding $1.50 per pound. [...] Diamond Rubber experimented with various additives, such as <b>mercury</b> <b>iodide</b> and aniline, in an attempt to improve the properties of lower quality rubber. The addition of only 2.5 to 6 percent of these additives improved the tensile strength of low quality rubber from 1800 psi to 2800 psi, and shortened the vulcanization time to a 90 minutes. However, these additives were detrimental to the lifetime of the rubber. In 1912, Spence was working with George Onsager at Diamond Rubber to discover different additives to overcome these shortcomings. Working off of Onsager's aniline additives, Spence discovered that p-aminodimethylaniline was a far superior accelerator, requiring only 0.5 weight percent added to the vulcanization process, to vastly improve the tensile strength of the rubber. [...] P-aminodimethylaniline was adopted as the accelerator of choice by the Diamond Rubber Company in 1912.|$|E

40|$|El nombre sífilis proviene del griego siph: cerdo y philus: amor. Recuerda al personaje de una obra, llamado Syphilo, que fue castigado por los dioses a sufrir una terrible enfermedad. Se analizan los datos sobre la sífilis en la antigüedad (que difieren según su fuente). Su mención en la Edad Media, su {{controversial}} origen, la ayuda de los paleopatólogos para encontrarlo. Luego de la Revolución Francesa y el inicio de la Edad Contemporánea, el porcentaje de enfermos fue creciendo y se acentuó la segregación de los mismos por la sociedad. Desde el año 1500 hasta principios del siglo XX el tratamiento de la sífilis dependía del mercurio. Tenía una gran variedad de formas de aplicación. La vía tópica: el ungüento gris, en calomelano o tabletas, en inyecciones, en fricciones y fumigaciones en donde el mercurio se introducía en el cuerpo por lo pulmones. Se adjudicó a la madera del guayaco pretendidas características curativas, que no poseía. Los ioduros se utilizaron para el terciarismo. Ehrlich en 1907, patentó el compuesto 606 o Salvarsan y en 1910, el Neo-Salvarsan o Arsfenamina (compuesto 914). Por estos descubrimientos recibió el Premio Nobel. En 1887, Julios Wagner Jauregg sugirió que la fiebre terapéuticamente inducida era útil en el tratamiento de enfermos psicóticos. En 1912 publicó sus satisfactorios resultados al tratar la paresias con una combinación de mercurio-iodo y tuberculina de Koch. En 1917 ingresó a su servicio un enfermo de malaria, con cuya sangre escarificaron la piel palúdica de tres paréticos, en lugar de darle inmediatamente quinina. Por ello fue galardona con el Premio Nobel. Se utilizó luego el bismuto, a partir de 1922, pero posteriormente fue sustituido por las sulfamidas, de aplicación dificultosa. El avance terapéutico más importante ocurrió en 1943, año en que se comenzó a utilizar la penicilina por Mahoney y colaboradores. Luego se confirmó la eficacia de la tetraciclina para los alérgicos a la penicilina. Últimamente se confirmó la eficacia de la azitromicina en dosis de 500 mg cada día, durante los 10 días o el régimen de 500 mg en días alternos. The name Syphilis {{comes from}} greek language: Siph: Pig and Philus: Love, meaning, {{in honor of}} the Sheppard of a story where the Character, Named Syphilo, is punished by the gods to suffer a terrible disease. Data about Syphilis was analized in ancient times (which differ according to the source). Its mention in the middle age, its controversial origin, the help provided from paleopathologists to find it. When the French revolution {{and the beginning of the}} contemporary age began, the percentage of sick people grew. The segregation of these is proved by the society. From the year 1500 to the beginnings of the XX century, the treatment of Syphilis depended on mercury. There were a great variety of application methods: topical: the grey ointment, in «calomelanos or tabs», in injections, in frictions and fumigations where the mercury was introduced in the body by the lungs. Guayacos wood was named with curative features which it did not posses. The iodides were used for tertiary syphilis. In 1907, Ehrlich formulates the 606 compound or Salvarsan and in 1910 the Neo-Salvarsan or Arsfenamina or compound 914. Due to these discoveries he received the nobel prize. In 1887, Julius Wagner of Jauregg suggested that: the inducted therapeutic fiber was useful in the treatment of the psychosis. In 1912 he published his satisfactory results in treating the paresis with a combination of <b>mercury</b> and <b>iodides</b> and tuberculin of Koch. In 1917 he treated a patient who had malaria and instead of giving him immediately quinine, he made a scarification with his paludic blood the skin of 3 paretic patients.

Os filmes foram depositados a partir da evaporadora térmica construída no próprio departamento e caracterizados em função de três distâncias de deposição. O melhor filme obtido foi produzido a 5 cm de distância da fonte, apresentando valores de gap de energia de 2, 39 eV e energia de ativação de 1, 1 eV.

In {{the last}} {{years there has been}} a growing interest in semiconductor materials with high atomic number and optical band gap for applications as ionizing radiation detectors at room temperature, using the direct method of detection. Some materials such as lead iodide (PbI 2) and <b>mercury</b> <b>iodide</b> (HgI 2) have an optical band gap above 2, 0 eV, operate at room temperature with low noise and low leakage current, present a high carrier mobility and high stopping power for ionizing radiation. Alternative methods are investigated by several researchers for the fabrication of these materials on top of large areas, with low fabrication time and costs as desirable for applications in medical imaging. In this sense, we present two methods {{for the development of the}} detectors. Thermal evaporation, with the development of the deposition system and chamber, is used for the fabrication of lead iodide thin films. The properties of the films were investigated as a function of deposition height. On the other hand, isothermal evaporation was used for the fabrication of <b>mercury</b> <b>iodide</b> milimetric crystals, for the first time using the organic solvent N. N- dimetilformamide (DMF). The properties of the crystals are investigated as a function of concentration and growth temperature. The structural, morphological and compositional properties of the films and crystals were investigated. The optical and electrical properties were also investigated for both films and crystals. The activation energy for electric transport and the test of the materials as sensors (using X-rays in the mammographic region) were studied. This work presents the main results for both materials: films of lead iodide and milimetric crystals of <b>mercury</b> <b>iodide.</b> The crystalline planes of the films have a preferential orientation along the (110) direction, and a morphology of vertical leaves, not similar to other reported results. The obtained composition is PbI 2, 5. The combination of the morphology and the configuration of co-planar contacts for charge collection reduce the sensitivity to X-rays exposure. A current density ratio (illuminated to dark) of the order of 1. 53 was obtained. The best film was deposited at a distance of 5 cm to the source, and it has an optical gap of 2, 39 eV and activation energy of 1, 1 eV. With increasing deposition distance a degradation of the structural, optical and electrical properties was observed, even with the variation of the composition of the films. For <b>mercury</b> <b>iodide,</b> for any growth rate the shape of the crystals is always cubic. The morphology of the surface depends on the evaporation rate (it can be smooth or present macroscopic holes). The best results were obtained for a growth at 80 o C, what leads to a crystal with optical gap of 2. 2 eV and electrical resistivity of the order of 108 Ohmcm, what suggests non-intentional doping or excess of defects. The obtained composition was HgI 3, and the current ratio (illuminated by mammographic X-rays to dark) was about 25. According to the discussions in the text and in the conclusions, the suggested optimizations could lead to the development of materials that might be useful for technological applications in medical imaging for the mammographic energy range...|$|E

The anode solution was then mixed with hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) containing water, causing precipitation of mercury sulphide. The H 2 S was produced at site by a SRB reactor. Precipitation problems arising from {{the nature of the}} anode solution were expected, since this solution is highly acidic, very oxidised and may contain iodide/iodine that strongly complexes mercury and can hinder mercury sulphide precipitation. Mercury concentrations in the anode solution were up to 65. 7 mg/L (field) and 15. 4 mg/L (lab. scale). Reduction of mercury in the water was > 93 % at all times. Iodide did not hinder the process: Nonetheless, in the lab system, iodide concentration was high in the anode solution but mercury reduction was > 99. 9 %. The redox potential was sufficiently low for HgS precipitation during the experiments, except for a short period, when the mercury removal decreased to 94 %. Sulphate reducing bacteria are shown as a viable tool for the treatment of mercury contaminated, acidic, oxidative, iodide containing water, such as that produced by electrokinetic remediation. A second SRB step or other water treatment is required to reduce the mercury concentration to environmentally acceptable levels. Redox. potential is the most sensitive factor in the system...|$|E
