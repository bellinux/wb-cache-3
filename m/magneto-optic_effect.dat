We further demonstrate the gate control of <b>magneto-optic</b> Kerr <b>effect</b> (MOKE) in bilayer MnPSe 3 using first-principles calculations.

In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the polarization plane can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of such a reflection are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not {{to be confused with the}} nonlinear Kerr effect). Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations are called optical isomers.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to a magnetic field, some materials can have a dielectric tensor that is complex-Hermitian; {{this is called a}} gyro-magnetic or <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect.</b> In this case, the principal axes are complex-valued vectors, corresponding to elliptically polarized light, and time-reversal symmetry can be broken.

50|$|Refractive {{modulators}} {{most often}} {{make use of}} an electro-optic effect. Some modulators utilize an acousto-optic effect or <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> or take advantage of polarization changes in liquid crystals. The refractive modulators are named by the respective effect: i.e. electrooptic modulators, acousto-optic modulators etc.The effect of a refractive modulator {{of any of the}} types mentioned above is to change the phase of a light beam. The phase modulation can be converted into amplitude modulation using an interferometer or directional coupler. Separate case of modulators are spatial light modulators (SLMs). The role of SLM is modification two dimensional distribution of amplitude and/or phase of an optical wave.|$|E
50|$|Quadratic {{magnetic}} rotation (also {{known as}} QMR or QMR effect) {{is a type}} of <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect,</b> discovered in the mid 1980s by a team of Soviet physicists. QMR, like the Faraday effect, establishes a relationship between the magnetic field and rotation of polarization of the plane of linearly polarized light. In contrast to the Faraday effect, QMR originates from the quadratic proportionality between the angle of the rotation of the plane of polarization and the strength of the magnetic field. Mostly QMR can be observed in the transverse geometry when the vector of the magnetic field strength is perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> is {{any one of}} {{a number}} of {{phenomena}} in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through a medium that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field. In such a material, which is also called gyrotropic or gyromagnetic, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds, leading to a number of important phenomena. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the plane of polarization can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator.

An electromagnetic theory of multilayered structures allows regression analysis fits between acquired data and parameter dependent model analysis. Recently, we determined the single layer Co magneto-optic Voigt parameter and found that it depends on Co layer thickness. In the present work, we report an in-depth study of interfacial <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effects</b> for a large number of Pt/Co multilayer samples.

5000|$|Here, the Q-switch is an {{externally}} {{controlled variable}} attenuator. This {{may be a}} mechanical device such as a shutter, chopper wheel, or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity, or (more commonly) it may be some form of modulator such as an acousto-optic device, a <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> device or an electro-optic device — a Pockels cell or Kerr cell. The reduction of losses (increase of Q) is triggered by an external event, typically an electrical signal. The pulse repetition rate can therefore be externally controlled.Modulators generally allow a faster transition from low to high Q, and provide better control. An additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity {{and can be used}} for something else. Alternatively, when the modulator is in its low-Q state, an externally generated beam can be coupled into the cavity through the modulator. This can be used to [...] "seed" [...] the cavity with a beam that has desired characteristics (such as transverse mode or wavelength). When the Q is raised, lasing builds up from the initial seed, producing a Q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed.|$|E
50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is an optical device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} optical {{coatings}} on the longitudinal <b>magneto-optic</b> Kerr <b>effect</b> response from 10 nm thin films of permalloy (Ni 84 Fe 16) has been studied. Enhancement of the <b>magneto-optic</b> Kerr <b>effect</b> signal contrast {{of a factor}} 1. 76 has been observed for P- polarized incident light on a trilayer configuration of aluminium, magnesium fluoride, and permalloy. A quadrilayer structure where the trilayer is overcoated with zinc sulphide enhances the signal contrast by a factor 4. 05 for P-polarized light. The enhancement is also observed for S-polarized light, and is shown to be reproducible using nickel as the magnetic material and gold instead of aluminium. The experimental data are compared to a simplified theoretical model where the electric field components are calculated using a 4 x 4 matrix algorithm. The model {{is found to be}} inadequate in predicting the longitudinal <b>magneto-optic</b> Kerr <b>effect</b> response from complex multilayer structures. This is believed to be due to a simplification in the model disregarding the phase factors of the different components reflected off the multilayered samples...|$|R

The accuracy of this method is explored through inversion of synthetic Stokes profiles subjected to varying levels of random noise, instrumental wave-length resolution, and line profile sampling. The level of error introduced by the systematic effect of profile sampling over a finite fraction of the 5 minute oscillation cycle is also investigated.

40|$|The F {{center is}} the {{prototype}} of the excess electron color centers. Although many of the properties of this center are well understood, some interesting questions still remain concerning {{the nature of its}} relaxed excited state. The influence of uniaxial stress upon the luminescences has yielded new evidence for the diffuse nature of this state. A contrast will be made of the influence of uniaxial stress upon the absorption and the luminescence. The association of F centers forms higher order complex centers. Studies of the polarization of the optical absorption and the luminescence bands, the stress induced splittings of the zero phonon lines, the <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> associated with absorption, and the electron spin resonance have been particularly valuable in establishing the symmetry and microscopic configuration of a number of these centers. A brief review will be given of the properties of the neutral complex, the singly ionized complex, and the complex centers that have trapped an extra electron.

In addition we can select one optical arrangement out of four that detects the longitudinal effect with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. Compared to finite loop-area Sagnac interferometers operating at oblique incidence, the zero loop-area interferometer involves significantly fewer optical elements and is thus more stable against drifts in the optical system.
