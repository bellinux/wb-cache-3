5|$|On August11, a {{tropical}} cyclone appeared east of Luzon. Over {{the next few}} days, it <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, passing near the island of Mindoro on August13. The system <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South China Sea, intensifying into a typhoon as it approached Vietnam. Although it paralleled the coast, the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August17.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} {{weather in}} the central Atlantic managed to gain enough organization to be designated Tropical Depression Two on July 31. The depression <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic without strengthening due to high upper-level wind shear, and dissipated near the Lesser Antilles on August 3.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical wave that <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, and formed into a tropical depression on October 29. Convection increased, {{and the system}} formed into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, reaching its peak strength as a Category 4. One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five named storms, there were three non-developing tropical depressions. The first struck Texas in August, causing street flooding and killing three. The second of three formed off {{the west coast of}} Florida and flooded widespread areas after 1 in 100 year rainfall. The floods affected 5,000houses and caused millions in damage. The third of three non-developing storms <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean before striking Nicaragua in October. The season officially ended on November15.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June a {{group of}} rebels reached Thetford, and from there the revolt spread over {{south-western}} Norfolk towards the Fens. At {{the same time the}} rebels, led by Geoffrey Litster, <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> north-eastern part of the county and tried to raise support throughout the local area. Over the next few days, the rebels converged on Norwich, Lynn and Swaffham.|$|E

50|$|Not only do {{polarization}} patterns remain consistent as <b>the</b> sun <b>moves</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{but also}} as <b>the</b> moon <b>moves</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> sky at night. The moon creates the same polarization pattern. Thus {{it is possible to}} use the polarization patterns as a tool for navigation at night. The only difference is that the degree of polarization is not quite as strong.|$|R

5|$|On 22 September 1950, two EF-84Es, {{flown by}} David C. Schilling and Col. William Ritchie, flew across the North Atlantic from Great Britain to the United States. Ritchie's {{aircraft}} {{ran out of}} fuel over Newfoundland but the other successfully made the crossing which took ten hours two minutes and three aerial refuelings. The flight demonstrated {{that large numbers of}} fighters could be rapidly <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On June29, a {{tropical}} cyclone developed southeast of Palau. It {{moved to the}} northwest, remaining east of Palau and the Philippines. Later classified as a typhoon, the system turned {{to the west and}} struck Taiwan, then known as Formosa, on July7. It <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island, crossed the Taiwan Strait, and dissipated over China on July9.|$|E

The original log church was <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> road and subsequently used as a sexton's house, Sunday school classroom, and public schoolhouse (attended by future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump).|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the system {{can be traced to}} a {{tropical}} wave that <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> eastern Caribbean in the last week of May. The wave gradually organized itself as it entered the western Caribbean Sea on June 1. The circulation continued to close up on June 2 and that evening it was declared Tropical Depression One while east of Honduras.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} June, a {{tropical}} depression <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Philippines through the Visayas, first observed on June26. After moving westward into the South China Sea, the depression turned to the northeast, reaching the Luzon Strait. Later, the depression recurved back to the west, dissipating over China on July3.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Allison {{developed}} from a tropical wave {{in the northern}} Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the northern Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, turned to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued towards the east-northeast, made landfall on Louisiana and then <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the first storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to affect the northern Texas coastline.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle was {{the only}} {{tropical}} storm {{to move through the}} Caribbean Sea in 1986. A short-lived cyclone, Danielle developed on September7 to the east of the southern Lesser Antilles. Strengthening to peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a rainband <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> main island with hurricane-force gusts. Continuing westward, Danielle absorbed dry air from northern South America and dissipated on September10.|$|E
5|$|While passing between Saipan and Anatahan in the NMI, {{the eye of}} Joan {{was visible}} by NEXRAD from Guam, despite being 285km (180mi) north of the island. An outer rainband <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island, {{producing}} 56mm (2.2in) of rainfall at Anderson Air Force Base and a wind gust of 66km/h (41mph) at the National Weather Service office in Tiyan.|$|E
5|$|A deep low {{pressure}} system (with a pressure of 977mbar at its peak) <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Coast on October 15 and then crossed the Rockies {{during the following}} day and touched out some moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, major source for storm development and intensification. Not part of the main outbreak, 3 tornadoes were reported, during the overnight hours of October 16 towards October 17, across Randall County, Texas south of Amarillo on October 16 with 1 of them confirmed as a high EF1. That tornado caused damage to trees, fences, power poles, steel pipes, trailers and barns.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area formed along a dissipating cold front {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October13. The next day, the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida. On October15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm was never fully tropical, as its winds and precipitation extended far away from the center. The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at 65mph (100km/h) early on October16. After affecting Florida, the storm crossed the western Atlantic and <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Outer Banks. The storm became extratropical on October17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E
5|$|A typhoon {{approached}} eastern Luzon on September 16, and <b>moved</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island on {{the next}} day. In the municipality of Baler on the east coast, a minimum pressure of 969 mbar (28.63 inHg) was recorded. The typhoon's eye passed over and nearly destroyed the town. A tornado spawned by the typhoon hit Metro Manila. The typhoon progressed westward into the South China Sea, later curving to the northwest and entering the Gulf of Tonkin near the island of Hainan. After the storm, the Philippine government provided aid to residents.|$|E
