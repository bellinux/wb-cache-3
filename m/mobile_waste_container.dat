The primary component of the EBS is a multi-barrier <b>waste</b> package <b>container.</b> Simplifying the geometry of the cylindrical <b>waste</b> package <b>container</b> and the underlying invert into the equivalent spherical configuration, mathematical models are developed for steady-state and transient diffusive releases from the failed <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> with multiple perforations (or pit penetrations) at the boundary of the invert. Using the models the steady-state and transient diffusive release behaviors form the failed <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> are studied. The analyses show {{that the number of}} perforations, the size of perforation, the container wall thickness, the geometry of the <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> and invert, and the adsorption of radionuclide in the invert are the important parameters that control the diffusive release rate. It is emphasized that the failed (or perforated) <b>waste</b> package <b>container</b> can still perform as a potentially important barrier (or diffusion barrier) to radionuclide release...|$|R

The action concentration can be determined using total VOC concentrations or actual concentration of each individual VOC.

40|$|The Central Waste Complex (CWC) is {{the interim}} storage {{facility}} for Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) mixed waste, transuranic waste, transuranic mixed waste, low-level and low-level mixed radioactive waste at the Department of Energy's (DOE'S) Hanford Site. The {{majority of the}} waste stored at the facility is retrieved from the low-level burial grounds in the 200 West Area at the Site, with minor quantities of newly generated waste from on-site and off-site waste generators. The CWC comprises 18 storage buildings that house 13, 000 <b>containers.</b> Each <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> within the facility is scanned into its location by building, module, tier and position and the information is stored in a site-wide database. As waste is retrieved from the burial grounds, a preliminary non-destructive assay is performed {{to determine if the}} waste is transuranic (TRU) or low-level waste (LLW) and subsequently shipped to the CWC. In general, the TRU and LLW <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> are stored in separate locations within the CWC, but the final disposition of each <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> is not known upon receipt. The final disposition of each <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> is determined by the appropriate program as process knowledge is applied and characterization data becomes available. <b>Waste</b> <b>containers</b> are stored within the CWC based on their physical chemical and radiological hazards. Further segregation within each building is done by container size (55 -gallon, 85 -gallon, Standard Waste Box) and waste stream. Due to this waste storage scheme, assembling <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> for shipment out of the CWC has been time consuming and labor intensive. Qualitatively, the ratio of containers moved to containers in the outgoing shipment has been excessively high, which correlates to additional worker exposure, shipment delays, and operational inefficiencies. These inefficiencies impacted the LLW Program's ability to meet commitments established by the Tri-Party Agreement, an agreement between the State of Washington, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These commitments require <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> to be shipped off site for disposal and/or treatment within a certain time frame. Because the program was struggling to meet production demands, the Production and Planning group was tasked with developing a method to assist the LLW Program in fulfilling its requirements. Using existing databases for container management, a single electronic spreadsheet was created to visually map every <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> within the CWC. The file displays the exact location (e. g., building, module, tier, position) of each container in a format that replicates the actual layout in the facility. In addition, each container was placed into a queue defined by the LLW and TRU waste management programs. The queues were developed based on characterization requirements, treatment type and location, and potential final disposition. This visual aid allows the user to select containers from similar queues and view their location within the facility. The user selects containers in a centralized location, rather than random locations, to expedite shipments out of the facility. This increases efficiency for generating the shipments, as well as decreasing worker exposure and container handling time when gathering containers for shipment by reducing movements of <b>waste</b> <b>container.</b> As the containers are collected for shipment, the remaining containers are segregated by queue, which further reduces future container movements...|$|R

40|$|Radioactive {{waste from}} the nuclear {{industry}} and hazardous products from chemical industries need to be effectively isolated from the biosphere {{for a very long}} time. Highly radioactive waste gives off heat and requires disposal at depth in special repositories while low-level radioactive waste, pesticides and mercury and arsenic, can be stored in deep mines. The multiple barrier principle implies that the rock and engineered barriers combine to provide isolation but assessment of the constitution and performance of crystalline rock reduces its role to provide “mechanical support” to <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> rather than true isolation of them. Smectitic clay is required for achieving this but its isolating capacity is limited over time, and long-lasting <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> are needed as well. The waste isolation effect of clay and containers can allow for constructing repositories in rock of rather poor quality, represented by abandoned mines, and <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> of 100 % copper further reduce the need for very well planned and constructed repositories.

40|$|The Flammability Assessment Methodology Program (FAMP) was {{established}} to investigate the flammability of gas mixtures found in transuranic (TRU) <b>waste</b> <b>containers.</b> The FAMP results {{provide a basis for}} increasing the permissible concentrations of flammable volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in TRU <b>waste</b> <b>containers.</b> The FAMP results will be used to modify the ''Safety Analysis Report for the TRUPACT-II Shipping Package'' (TRUPACT-II SARP) upon acceptance of the methodology by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Implementation of the methodology would substantially increase the number of drums that can be shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) without repackaging or treatment. Central to the program was experimental testing and modeling to predict the gas mixture lower explosive limit (MLEL) of gases observed in TRU <b>waste</b> <b>containers.</b> The experimental data supported selection of an MLEL model that was used in constructing screening limits for flammable VOC and flammable gas concentrations. The MLEL values predicted by the model for individual drums will be utilized to assess flammability for drums that do not meet the screening criteria. Finally, the predicted MLEL values will be used to derive acceptable gas generation rates, decay heat limits, and aspiration time requirements for drums that do not pass the screening limits. The results of the program demonstrate that an increased number of <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> can be shipped to WIPP within the flammability safety envelope established in the TRUPACT-II SARP...|$|R

All of the tritium contained in the waste {{was assumed to be}} available as a gas in the free volume inside the <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> at the beginning of disposal, and to then permeate the stainless steel <b>waste</b> <b>container.</b> From estimates of the tritium content of each waste form, the void or free volume of the package, disposal temperature and container geometry, the amount of tritium exiting the <b>waste</b> <b>container</b> by permeation was calculated. Two tritium permeation paths were considered separately: through the entire wall surface area and through the weld area only, the weld area having reduced thickness and significantly less surface area compared to the wall area. Permeation out of the five APT <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> at 50 degrees Celsius is mainly through the welds, and at 100 degrees Celsius is through the permeation out of the entire wall surface area. The largest maximum offgas rate from an APT waste stream at 50 degrees Celsius (estimated disposal temperature) was 1. 8 E- 6 Ci/year from the weld of the Window waste package, and the smallest maximum offgas rate was 3. 7 E- 5 Ci/year from the weld of the Lead waste package. Permeation from the CLWR-TEF overpack at 40 degrees Celsius is mainly through the entire wall surface area, with a maximum offgas rate of 1. 3 E- 5 Ci/year...|$|R
