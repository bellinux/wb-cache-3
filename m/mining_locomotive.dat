Substantiated, that during constant locomotive speed V, variation of the tangential component Qx occurs when the increment speed of the boundary layers of friction pair materials δV leads to energy loss in the contact area. This provokes unstable state of the electromechanical system. To increase stability and safety, reduce the load on the bogie, {{as well as on}} the rail track, additional movability of the kinematic connection of its links can be used. Basing on the thrust forces equations subject to adhesion and permissible power for definite conditions, we can determine the values of engine voltage Uc as a function of the locomotive speed...|$|E
5000|$|The first {{electric}} <b>mine</b> <b>locomotive</b> in the United States {{went into}} service in mid 1887 in the Lykens Valley Coal Company mine in Lykens, Pennsylvania. The 35 hp motor for this locomotive {{was built by}} the Union Electric Company of Philadelphia. [...] The 15000 pound (6800 kg) locomotive was named the Pioneer, and by mid 1888, a second electric locomotive was in service at that mine. [...] Use in the Appalachian coal fields spread rapidly. By 1903, there were over 600 electric <b>mine</b> <b>locomotives</b> in use in America with new ones being produced {{at a rate of}} 100 per year.|$|R

5000|$|Porter, Bell & Co. {{appears to}} have built the first {{underground}} <b>mining</b> <b>locomotives</b> used in the United States around 1870. By 1874, the Consolidation Coal Company and Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company were using several Porter locomotives in their underground mines in the Georges Creek Valley of Maryland. Other users included several coal mines near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company and an iron mine in the Lake Superior Iron Ranges. Porter's <b>mine</b> <b>locomotives</b> required a minimum 5-foot clearance and 4-foot width when operating on 3-foot gauge track, where they could handle a 20-foot radius curve. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works built similar locomotives, starting in 1870. [...] By the early 20th century, very small British-made oil-fired steam locomotives were in use in some South African mines. [...] Porter and Vulcan (Wilkes-Barre) advertised steam <b>mine</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1909 and 1911. [...] By the early 1920s, only a few small mines in the Pocahontas Coalfield in West Virginia were using steam locomotives underground. [...] Nonetheless, both Baldwin and Vulcan continued to advertise steam locomotives for underground use outside the coal industry as late as 1921.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, {{the company}} {{changed its name}} to SA Moteurs Moës, Waremme.

5000|$|The Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (Deutz Gas Engine Company), now Deutz AG, {{introduced}} a single-cylinder benzine locomotive {{for use in}} mines in 1897. Their first <b>mining</b> <b>locomotives</b> were rated at 6 to 8 hp and weighed 5280 pounds. [...] The original 6 hp engine was 8 feet 6.5 inches long, 3 feet 11 inches wide and 4 feet 3.5 inches high and weighed 2.2 long tons. [...] Typical Deutz mine engines in 1906 were rated at 8 to 12 hp. [...] By this time, double-cylinder 18 hp. engines built by Wolseley Motors were being used in South African mines. [...] By 1914, Whitcomb Locomotive Works, Vulcan Iron Works, and Milwaukee Locomotive Manufacturing Co. (later merged with Whitcomb) were making gasoline <b>mining</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the United States with 4 and 6 cylinder engines.|$|R

40|$|New {{applications}} for phosphoric acid fuel cells {{were identified and}} evaluated. Candidates considered included all possibilities except grid connected electric utility applications, on site total energy systems, industrial cogeneration, opportunistic use of waste hydrogen, space and military applications, and applications smaller than 10 kW. Applications identified were screened, with the most promising subjected to technical and economic evaluation using a fuel cell and conventional power system data base developed in the study. The most promising applications {{appear to be the}} underground <b>mine</b> <b>locomotive</b> and the railroad locomotive. Also interesting are power for robotic submersibles and Arctic villages. The <b>mine</b> <b>locomotive</b> is particularly attractive since it is expected that the fuel cell could command a very high price and still be competitive with the conventionally used battery system. The railroad locomotive's attractiveness results from the (smaller) premium price which the fuel cell could command over the conventional diesel electric system based on its superior fuel efficiency, and on the large size of this market and the accompanying opportunities for manufacturing economy...|$|R
