5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving is <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> a shotline, {{but does not}} reach {{all the way to}} the bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today are <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{essential}} problem of large tribal {{groups on the}} frontier remained <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined. The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|As {{they were}} playing a four-man bowling attack, and had spent longer in the field than they had wanted, England opted not to enforce the follow-on. Batting again, England pressed to score quickly, but were pegged back by regular dismissals: no batsman scored more than 40 runs, and the run rate was <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> their first innings. Shakib Al Hasan claimed four wickets, and England batting 50 minutes into the fourth morning before declaring on 209 for 7, leaving Bangladesh {{requiring}} 513 runs in their second innings to win.|$|E

The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in reality the Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the}} assumption that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E

5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> it did when it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone {{and the only way}} into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in other reptiles, but crocodilians {{do not have}} a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E

He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: {{he said that the}} book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.|$|E

5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear {{of the person who}} is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>as</b> Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E

5|$|The legions, {{which had}} been a mix of life {{professionals}} and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of the cohort army remained <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in the late Republic, although around the 1st centuryAD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size {{to a total of}} 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.1AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.|$|E
5|$|The quarter-final draw also {{determined}} the teams' routes to the final, with Barcelona facing {{the prospect of}} meeting either Chelsea or Liverpool in the semi-finals. After a 3–1 win at Anfield, Chelsea qualified for the semi-finals with a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge. The semi-final first leg was played at the Camp Nou; although Barcelona enjoyed {{the majority of the}} possession, Chelsea's defence was resolute and they became the first side to keep a clean sheet in Barcelona in this season's competition, coming away with a goalless draw. Barcelona needed to avoid defeat to reach the final, but they found themselves a goal down within 10 minutes; after they failed to clear Frank Lampard's pass into the penalty area, Michael Essien fired a left-footed volley past Víctor Valdés into the roof of the net. The rest of the match continued <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the first leg, with Barcelona retaining most of the possession. Despite this, they found themselves guilty of several fouls, while Chelsea made four unsuccessful penalty appeals during the match. Meanwhile, Dani Alves received his third yellow card of the knockout phase, ruling him out of Barcelona's next match, and Éric Abidal was given a straight red card for a foul on Nicolas Anelka as the French forward was through on goal. However, television replays after the incident showed that there was little contact between Abidal and Anelka. Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø allowed a minimum of fourminutes of injury time {{at the end of the}} second half; in the third of those fourminutes – just when it looked like Chelsea were about to secure a repeat of the 2008 final – Messi played the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Andrés Iniesta, who shot just past Petr Čech's outstretched hand for the away goal that would send Barcelona to the final.|$|E
