These larger fish are sometimes caught by bottom-fishers with heavy tackle, though they still remain difficult to land due to their speed and proximity to sharp reef bottoms.|$|E

50|$|The {{stream is}} an {{important}} seasonal freshwater artisanal fishery producing an annual catch, as of 2016, of about US$500,000 from an average weekly catch of 5 to 15kg by each fisherman. In the lower reaches of the stream, this low catch of smaller immature fish is evidence of lack of management of the fishery. Less than 1% {{to as much as}} 10% of the local population may be engaged at least part-time as fishermen, most are men. Full-time fishermen earn about US$1,000 to 2,000 per year, which is below the poverty line. Gill nets, cast nets, long lines, fish hooks and line sets, spears, traps and traditional fishing boats are used. The catch includes Snapper (Aha-an), Flagtail (Aligaman), Crab (Alimango), Red-tailed goby (Anga), Squaretail mullet (Balanak), Goby (Batinga), Silver perch (Bugaong), Otomebora Mullet (Bunak), Indo-Pacific Tarpon (Buwan-buwan), Loach goby (Dalapakan), Mountain bass (Damagan), Indian pellona (Ibis), Flathead grey mullet (Gisaw), Gourami (Gurami), Mudfish (Halu-an), Shrimp (Hipon, Goby (Iswil), Carp (Karpa), Eel (Kasili), Spotted Scat (Kikilo), Mullet (Muli), Cyprinidae (Pait), Catfish (Pantat), Rock goby (Pigok), <b>Mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Tadlungan), Tilapia.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} study, {{it still}} {{is not clear whether}} artificial reefs produce new fish biomass or whether they only attract various species and make them more vulnerable to fishing mortality. To further evaluate this question, the size and age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) were sampled from April to November 2010 at artificial reefs south of Mobile Bay off the coast of Alabama and compared with the age of the artificial reef at the site of capture. Red snapper were collected with hook and line and a fish trap and visually counted during scuba-diver surveys. In the laboratory, all captured <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> were weighed and measured, and the otoliths were removed for aging. The mean age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> differed significantly across reefs of different ages, with older reefs having older fish. The mean age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> at a particular reef was not related to reef depth or distance to other reefs. The positive correlation between the mean age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and the age of the reef where they were found supports the contention that artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico enhance production of <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> The presence of fish older than the reef indicates that <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> are also attracted to artificial reefs...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} broodstock diet (39 % protein, 8. 6 % lipid) was formulated for the <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> {{as part of}} {{a project}} to ensure consistent production of good quality eggs and larvae through broodstock nutrition. Reproductive performance of <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> broodstock fed practical diet (n= 14 females) was enhanced in comparison to those fed raw fish (n= 12 females). Broodstock fed practical diet had total egg production of 82. 34 million from 68 spawns for two spawning seasons while broodstock fed raw fish produced 77. 64 million eggs from 66 spawns. Mean percent of egg viability, hatching rates and percent of normal larvae did not vary between the two groups. However, broodstock fed the practical diet had higher mean cumulative survival rate of eggs to normal larvae (40. 4 %) than that of broodstock fed raw fish (35. 2 %). Also, survival activity index (4. 08) of broodstock fed practical diet was higher than that of broodstock fed raw fish (2. 97). The results clearly indicate the improvement of reproductive performance of <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> fed practical diet.

Special attention {{was paid to}} arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Total lipids of hatchery-produced eggs and newly hatched larvae of <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> unexpectedly had equal levels of ARA and EPA. Ovarian polar lipids were subsequently found to have intermediate or high ARA (5. 5 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 10. 7 %) and DHA (14. 4 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 20. 4 %) levels but relatively low EPA levels (1. 5 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1. 9 %), consequently showing high ARA/EPA (4. 4 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 6. 0) and DHA/EPA (7. 4 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 14. 9) ratios in wild <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and rabbitfish (S. guttatus and S. canaliculatus). Similar trends were observed even in hatchery-reared <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> rabbitfish (S. guttatus) and coral trout. Not only ovary but also liver and muscle contained relatively higher ARA compared with EPA in <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> regardless of the sample source. ARA, EPA and DHA levels in the polar lipids of wild fry (whole body) ranged respectively from 3. 2 % to 4. 0 %, from 2. 7 % to 4. 7 % and from 23. 5 % to 27. 6 % with intermediate or high ARA/EPA (0. 8 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1. 5) and DHA/EPA (5. 9 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 8. 8) ratios in <b>mangrove</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> rabbitfish (S. canaliculatus) and striped jack. As overall traits, the five species in the Central Philippines appear to have intermediate or high ARA and DHA levels with low EPA level, consequently having high ARA/EPA and DHA/EPA ratios compared to species in high and temperate northern hemisphere. Thus, the present results indicate that ARA is not a minor component in the tropical species, suggesting that ARA may be nutritionally much more important for egg development and larvae growth in the tropical species than in cold water species.

40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} nature of direct and {{indirect}} species interactions is a critical pre-cursor to successful resource management. In the northern Gulf of Mexico fisheries ecosys-tem, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) are two commercially harvested species within a larger reef fish complex. These two species share similar habitats and diets; however, {{little is known about}} how these species partition habitat and dietary resources.

Specifically, we examined the effects of fish size, commercial shrimp trawling, and habitat type on total Hg concentrations and stable nitrogen isotope ratios (d 15 N; a proxy for trophic position) in <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> Red snapper Hg concentrations and d 15 N values were positively and significantly correlated with fish size. In addition, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> collected over trawled habitats had significantly higher Hg concentrations and d 15 N values than did <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> collected from similar, nontrawled habitats. Red snapper also exhibited habitat-specific differences in Hg concentrations and d 15 N values, but differences were size dependent and generally small. Our study suggests that the Hg concentrations of juvenile <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in the northern GOM are elevated in areas where commercial shrimp trawling occurs, possibly due to increases in both <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> trophic position and bioavailable Hg in trawled areas. Additional studies are needed to determine whether Hg concentrations are elevated in fish from trawled areas in other marine ecosystems.
