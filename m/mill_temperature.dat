In this work, we prepared SmCo 5 nanoRakes by SABM at low temperature, and 2 -methyl pentane and trioctylamine were specially selected as solvent and surfactant, respectively, due to their low melting points. The effects of <b>milling</b> <b>temperature</b> on the morphology, microstructure and magnetic performance of SmCo 5 nanoflakes were investigated systematically. Comparing with the samples <b>milled</b> at room <b>temperature,</b> the SmCo 5 nanoflakes prepared at low temperature displayed more homogeneous morphology and lower oxygen content. Remarkably, better crystallinity, better grain alignment and larger remanence ratio were shown in the samples <b>milled</b> at low <b>temperature,</b> which resulted from the distinct microstructure caused by low <b>milling</b> <b>temperature.</b> The differences in structural evolution between the SmCo 5 nanoflakes <b>milled</b> at room <b>temperature</b> and low temperature, including the formation of nanocrystalline, grain boundary sliding, grain rotation, et al., were discussed. It was found that lowering the temperature of SABM was a powerful method for the fabrication of RE-TM nand-lakes, which showed better hard magnetic properties and lower oxygen content. This was important for the preparation of high-performance sintered magnets, bonded magnets and nanocomposite magnets. (c) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Titanium {{and carbon}} {{elemental}} powder mixtures with compositions of Ti 100 –xCx (x= 50, 40, 30) were milled under a helium atmosphere using a magnetoball mill. For Ti 50 C 50 and Ti 60 C 40 powder mixtures, the combined results of external <b>mill</b> <b>temperature</b> monitoring and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that, after a specific incubation period, titanium carbide (TiC) was formed rapidly via a highly exothermic mechanically induced reaction.

Eggs, young larvae, large larvae, pupae, and adults, confined in plastic compartments with dusting of flour and 2 -cm deep flour, were exposed at 25 mill locations to two MB and two SF fumigations; in May and August 2009. MB and SF treatments were conducted by commercial fumigators, and each fumigation lasted 24 h. Gas monitoring lines were placed near the bioassay boxes to measure gas concentrations over time during fumigations. Both MB treatments killed 100 % of all stages in the boxes except for large larvae in a few locations. In these locations, the mortality of large larvae ranged from 96 - 98 %. SF treatments killed 100 % of all stages except eggs. In the May treatment with SF, egg mortality ranged from 44 - 100 % with only two boxes showing 100 % mortality, because of under-dosing. Under-dosing occurred because the <b>mill</b> <b>temperature</b> {{was assumed to be}} greater than 27 ºC when it was actually below 27 ºC.

40|$|In {{structural}} fumigations, half-loss time (HLT) is {{the most}} frequently used indicator for comparing fumigant leakage rates. In practical situations where gas leakage rates during structural fumigations are compared, environmental conditions generally are not analyzed in detail and sealing quality is assumed to be constant or fixed. This gives a false impression that a certain gas fumigant might be contained in a structure better than another fumigant. During commercial structural fumigations at the Hal Ross Flour Mill, Department of Grain Science and Industry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA, leakage characteristics of Methyl bromide (MB) and Sulfuryl fluoride (SF) were compared by taking internal and external environmental conditions into consideration. Two sets of one 24 -h MB and one 24 -h SF fumigation experiments were conducted in May and August 2009. Mill sealing and fumigations were conducted by two separate commercial fumigators. After sealing, sealing quality prior to a fumigation was verified by a building pressurization test. The mill was subjected to different pressure levels generated by a specially made fan. At each pressure level, the air flow rate through a calibrated fan was measured. The observed air flow rate plotted as a function of pressure quantified leakage characteristics of the mill. In two MB and SF fumigations, gas concentrations were continuously monitored during the entire fumigation period. A weather station was installed {{on the roof of the}} mill to monitor outside barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity. Inside the mill, a temperature and relative humidity data logger was placed on each of the five floors of the mill. Results of this study provided a quantitative side-by-side comparison between MB and SF in the same facility. The pressurization test showed that sealing effectiveness can be quantitatively determined ahead of fumigation. It also confirmed the sealing quality for all fumigations was essentially similar. MB and SF showed similar gas distribution and leakage characteristics. Although the observed HLTs of the fumigations were different, those differences could be explained by the differences in environmental conditions, primarily wind speed, and to a certain extent <b>mill</b> <b>temperature,</b> rather than inherent properties of MB and SF gases...|$|E

5000|$|Heat {{generated}} in the grinding process causes gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) to lose water, forming bassanite (CaSO4.0.2-0.7H2O) or γ-anhydrite (CaSO4.~0.05H2O). The latter minerals are rapidly soluble, and about 2% of these in cement is needed to control tricalcium aluminate hydration. If more than this amount forms, crystallization of gypsum on their re-hydration causes [...] "false set" [...] - a sudden thickening of the cement mix {{a few minutes after}} mixing, which thins out on re-mixing. High <b>milling</b> <b>temperature</b> causes this. On the other hand, if <b>milling</b> <b>temperature</b> is too low, insufficient rapidly soluble sulfate is available and this causes [...] "flash set" [...] - an irreversible stiffening of the mix. Obtaining the optimum amount of rapidly soluble sulfate requires milling with a <b>mill</b> exit <b>temperature</b> within a few degrees of 115 °C. Where the milling system is too hot, some manufacturers use 2.5% gypsum and the remaining calcium sulfate as natural α-anhydrite (CaSO4). Complete dehydration of this mixture yields the optimum 2% γ-anhydrite. In the case of some efficient modern mills, insufficient heat is generated. This is corrected by recirculating part of the hot exhaust air to the mill inlet.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of the reaction to form titanium carbide (TiC) during the high-energy milling of titanium and carbon powder mixtures because a more thorough understanding of this reaction is required if high-energy milling is to be developed as a commercially viable process for the production of TiC and/or TiC-Ti powders. Titanium and activated carbon powder mixtures with compositions of Ti 100 -xCx (x = 50, 40, 30) were milled under a helium atmosphere using a magneto ball mill. For Ti 50 C 50 and Ti 60 C 40 powder mixtures milled in the higher milling energy impact mode, the combined results of external <b>mill</b> <b>temperature</b> monitoring and X-ray diffractometry indicated that, after a specific milling period of tig, TiC was formed rapidly via a highly exothermic mechanically-induced reaction. However, contrary to the current understanding of mechanically-induced self-propagating reactions, Raman spectroscopy clearly showed the formation of non-stoichiometric TiC in Ti 50 C 50 and Ti 60 C 40 powders prior to tig. This result has not been reported in previous studies that used only XRD analysis to characterise the as-milled powders. It is now thought that a significant component of the heat generated at tig may be due to a combination of rapid grain growth and/or recrystallisation of the pre-existing TiC, rather than the direct formation of TiC. When milling Ti 70 C 30 in impact mode, the reaction to form TiC proceeded gradually as milling progressed. It was found that, when milling powder mixtures with compositions of Ti 100 -xCx (x = 50, 40, 30) in the lower milling energy shearing mode, TiC was formed gradually as milling progressed. It was also found that, for the starting powder compositions investigated in this study, increasing the carbon content of the titanium and activated carbon starting powder mixture results in a slowing of the milling process. This slowing of the milling process is thought to be due to the volume of powder in the milling vial increasing as the carbon content is increased. This would have a similar effect to decreasing the ball to powder weight ratio, which is known to slow the milling process. This study also revealed that moisture adsorbed by the activated carbon starting powder could prevent, or at least delay, the reaction to form TiC during controlled ball milling. It is thought that the moisture adsorbed by the activated carbon may result in the formation of an oxide layer on the newly created titanium surfaces produced during milling, which prevents the reaction to form TiC. The above results demonstrate that controlled ball milling of titanium and carbon powder mixtures using a magneto ball mill can be used to produce nanocrystalline TiC and TiC-Ti powders. Such powders could be used for the synthesis of high-performance TiC reinforced titanium matrix materials...|$|E

A photocatalytic technique using semiconductor materials such as Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2) activated by lights has been considered as one economical method to solve this problem. Approach: We attached titanium dioxide {{on the surface of}} polymer grains as photocatalyc agents using a cylinder milling method. Photodegradation processes were observed in decomposition of Methylene Blue (MB) solutions, as waste model, under solar illumination. Several parameters were optimized such as the <b>milling</b> <b>temperature,</b> the <b>milling</b> period, number of coated grain layers {{on the surface of the}} waste.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, {{mechanical}} alloying/milling (MA/MM) process {{has been applied to}} produce different types of metastable or non-equilibrium materials such as metallic glasses, quasi-crystalline materials, nanocrystalline metals, compounds and supersaturated solid solutions. It appears that MA offers greater latitude in controlling the microstructure than other non-equilibrium processing methods such as rapid solidification. Despite a considerable number of experiments using MA/MM, many questions regarding the mechanisms of phase transformations induced by MA, especially the mechanism of amorphization, remain to be answered. In this thesis, the sequence of phase transformations induced by the mechanical alloying of aluminum and zirconium has been studied. The structural analysis indicated that none of the thermodynamically stable intermetallic compounds found in the phase diagram are formed during MA of the Al-Zr system. Instead, the nanocrystalline supersaturated [alpha]-Zr solid solution and amorphous phase are synthesized depending on the initial composition of the powder mixture. The thermodynamic and structural properties of these ball-milled materials have been characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As we know, one of the crucial aspects of nanophase and amorphous phase materials is the stability against grain growth and crystallization. In Chapter 4, the metastability of nanocrystalline materials based on the thermodynamics and grain boundary segregation arguments proposed by Johnson has been discussed. The thermal stabilities of the nanostructured [alpha]-Zr solid solutions and amorphous materials have also been studied. The experiments found that the grain size of nanocrystalline supersaturated solid solution is stable under heat treatment until reaching a temperature where the crystallization of an equilibrium compound phase occurs. In Chapter 5, the temperature effects on the mechanical alloying of Al and Zr have been studied by milling at different ambient temperatures. The experiments reveal that the ultimate grain size of nanostructured materials prepared by ball milling is determined by two main factors. One is densities of structural defects which depends on the competition between the severe plastic deformation induced by MA and the recovery behavior of the materials. Another is chemical effects which are related to the composition of the sample and the interactions among the components. Obviously, the recovery or relaxation behavior is temperature dependent, so the <b>milling</b> <b>temperature</b> could influence the average grain size. The chemical effects on grain size may also change with the <b>milling</b> <b>temperature.</b> The experimental results suggest that the steady state obtained by ball <b>milling</b> at higher <b>temperature</b> is much closer to a chemical equilibrium state compared with the state formed by <b>milling</b> at room <b>temperature.</b> A faster alloying rate is obtained at higher <b>temperature</b> <b>milling.</b> This is consistent with the solid state reaction mechanism by MA.

Stiffening attributed to uncontrolled reaction of C 3 A is referred to as flash set. False setting may be overcame by extended mix period, while flash setting is usually more serious and workability is usually diminished with extended mixing. ASTM C 359 has been used to detect early stiffening with mixed results. The mini slump cone test was developed by Construction Technology Laboratories (CTL), Inc., as an alternative method of determining early stiffening. This research examined the mini slump cone test procedure to determine the repeatability of the results obtained from two different testing procedures, effect of w/c ratio, lifting rate of the cone, and accuracy of the test using a standard sample...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an {{approach}} for thermal stress evaluation and fatigue life assessment of work rolls in hot rolling <b>mills.</b> <b>Temperature</b> and thermal stress distributions are calculated with a simplified finite element approach, {{based on a}} plane model of work roll loaded on its boundary by rotating thermal actions for a typical hot rolling configuration. A transient of one hour is simulated and the calculated temperature field is next applied as thermal loading in elastic–plastic mechanical simulation, to get thermal stresses and elastic–plastic strains in work roll. Calculated cyclic stresses and strains are finally used to estimate work roll service life, based on Universal Slopes equation that is modified {{to account for the}} multiaxial stress state. A comparison of results by three multiaxial fatigue criteria is provided. The obtained results show that, according to such multiaxial criteria, stress multiaxiality would have a great effect on fatigue life, despite it is generally neglected in approaches usually adopted in literature...|$|R
40|$|Milling of {{hardened}} steel components provides considerable benefits {{in terms of}} reduced manufacturing cost and time compared to traditional machining. <b>Temperature</b> variation in <b>milling</b> {{is an important factor}} affecting the wear of cutting tools. The poor selection of milling parameters may cause excessive tool wear and increased work surface roughness. Hence, {{there is a need to}} study the machinability aspects during milling of {{hardened steel}} components. In the present work, influence of cutting speed, feed rate and radial depth of cut on <b>milling</b> <b>temperature,</b> surface roughness and cutting force during milling of AISI D 2 steel has been investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) based models. From the parametric analysis, it is revealed that temperature increases linearly, whereas surface roughness increases non-linearly with cutting speed. However, for higher values of feed rate, an increased cutting speed considerably reduces the cutting force for specified depth of cut range. The present work also reveals that the selection of best cutting conditions is useful at the CAPP stage in the milling process particularly with tight tolerances...|$|R
40|$|By using {{torsional}} test, microstructural {{changes in}} commercially available C-Mnand vanadium microalloyed steel were studied {{and changes in}} austenite on rolling through roughing and finishing mills were estimated {{on the basis of}} preliminary static recrystallization determinations. Amethodfor determining the temperature at which recrvstaflization starts to be inhibited in microalloyed steel involving experimenta] measurementsof the activation energy wasdeveloped. The influenoe of the activation energy on changes in austenite brought about by rolling at an ordinary hot strip mill wasestablished by torsional simulation of various thermal cycles, both at a roughing and at a finishing mill, Austenite in C-Mnsteel wasfound to be impossible to harden under these conditions-not even on rolling at a finishing <b>mill</b> at <b>temperatures</b> close to Ar 3 -as a result of its activation energy being constant at all temperatures. Onthe other hand. hardening of austenite in microalloyed steel wasreadily accomplished at a finishing <b>mill</b> at <b>temperatures</b> belbw the critical recrystallization temperature (915 ºC) as the activation energy increases sharply below such a temperatute.
