5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, {{opened up the}} possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining {{the possibility of a}}tomic bombs, and warning of the danger of a German nuclear weapon project. He convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it, lending his fame to the proposal. This resulted in support by the U.S. government for research into nuclear fission, which became the Manhattan Project.|$|E

25|$|When mass {{immunization}} {{programs are}} part of the health services in FID, it can be wise to avoid extreme measures to keep insurgents from receiving immunization.

25|$|Although the Melbourne Cricket Club {{members were}} {{instrumental}} in founding Australian Rules Football, there were understandable concerns {{in the early days}} about the damage that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to the playing surface if football was allowed to be played at the MCG. Therefore, football games were often played in the parklands next to the cricket ground, and this was the case for the first documented football match to be played at the ground. The match which today is considered to be the first Australian rules football, played between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar over three Saturdays beginning 7 August 1858 was played in this area.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{is often}} {{separated from the}} body of the church by railings and screens, and, in the case of Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, by an iconostasis which forms a complete visual as well as physical barrier. The sanctuary is usually the most ornately decorated part of a church, creating a visual focus towards the altar. This <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in several ways. There might be a carved or painted altarpiece, a large carved screen called a reredos, or a structure called a ciborium which form a canopy over the altar. In English churches that have a square eastern end, a very large stained glass window often fills the wall behind the altar.|$|E

25|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{dimension is}} the airfoil chord. In these tests the jet width {{was sufficient to}} keep the vortex shedding coherent across it. On an airfoil {{there would be a}} correlation length less than the wingspan resulting in a number independent dipoles arrayed laterally. The sound power would be diminished somewhat. Since the dipole model is based on the time rate of change of the force, reduction of sound power might be accomplished by reducing that rate. One possible means would be for the opposite sides of the surface to gradually sense each other spatially prior to the trailing edge and thus reduce the rate at the edge. This <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by a section of graduated porous or flexible materials.|$|E
25|$|Commissioned by {{impresario}} Richard D'Oyly Carte in {{the late}} 1880s, it was designed by Thomas Edward Collcutt. Carte intended {{it to be the}} home of English grand opera, much as his Savoy Theatre had been built as a home for English light opera, beginning with the Gilbert and Sullivan series. The foundation stone, laid by his wife Helen in 1888, can still be seen on the fa√ßade of the theatre, almost at ground level {{to the right of the}} entrance. The theatre's design was considered to be novel. The upper levels are supported by heavy steel cantilevers built into the back walls, removing the need for supporting pillars that impede the view of the stage. The tiers, corridors, staircases, landings are all constructed of concrete to reduce the risk and damage that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by fire.|$|E
25|$|To perform row {{reduction}} on a matrix, {{one uses}} {{a sequence of}} elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations: 1) Swapping two rows, 2) Multiplying a row by a non-zero number, 3) Adding a multiple of one row to another row. Using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix, and in fact one that is in row echelon form. Once all of the leading coefficients (the left-most non-zero entry in each row) are 1, and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix {{is said to be}} in reduced row echelon form. This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence of row operations used. For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where multiple elementary operations <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> at each step), the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.|$|E

500|$|In the 82nd Congress, Senator Bricker {{introduced}} {{the first version}} of his amendment, S.J. Res. 102, drafted by Bricker and his staff. [...] The American Bar Association was still studying the issue of how to prevent an abuse of [...] "treaty law" [...] when Bricker introduced his resolution on July 17, 1951, without the ABA's involvement, but the Senator wanted to begin immediate debate on an issue he considered vital. [...] Bricker was not trying to reverse the Yalta Agreement, in contrast to the goals of some of his conservative colleagues; he was worried most about what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by the United Nations or under an executive agreement. A second proposal, S.J. Res 130, was introduced by Bricker on February 7, 1952, with fifty-eight co-sponsors, including every Republican except Eugene Millikin of Colorado.|$|E
500|$|Justice Wayne, {{noted that}} the case {{involved}} the same plaintiff as in Mitchel v. United States (1835), a decision of the Marshall Court. [...] Therefore, Wayne opined, [...] "he case before us does not require any discussion upon {{the nature and extent}} of the property held by the Florida Indians in these lands, under Spain. That was satisfactorily done in the decision given by this court in the original case." [...] The Court further noted: [...] "We will not enter into the question, how far the appropriation of the land for a fortress, by order of the government, extinguished the Indian title. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> successfully, upon the positions taken by this court in respect to the rights of European monarchs to Indian lands in North America, in Johnson v. McIntosh.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Carr, an {{academic}} and practising lawyer, called {{the implementation of}} Section 1 [...] "slightly awkward", suggesting {{that in some ways}} it was more limited than the provisions contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1893 from the seller's point of view. Unlike with the 1893 Act, a seller cannot exclude the provisions, and while the right to sell can be excluded {{it is not clear how}} this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Turpin complimented the section on hire-purchase agreements, although noting some flaws in draftsmanship; he also questioned whether or not the protection given to consumers would be sufficient. Prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was one of the few limitations on clauses in consumer contracts. Most of it was eventually superseded by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the Act's provisions.|$|E
500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time.

Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|R

500|$|Battleships {{were the}} {{embodiment}} of sea power. For Alfred Thayer Mahan and his followers, a strong navy was vital {{to the success of}} a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. [...] Mahan's theory, proposed in The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660‚Äì1783 of 1890, dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas. While the work of escorting, blockading, and raiding <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by cruisers or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. This concept of [...] "potential threat" [...] can be further generalized to the mere existence (as opposed to presence) of a powerful fleet tying the opposing fleet down. [...] This concept {{came to be known as}} a [...] "fleet in being" [...] ‚Äì an idle yet mighty fleet forcing others to spend time, resource and effort to actively guard against it.|$|E
500|$|Every shot in {{the film}} passed through the hands of eight {{different}} teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting. Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting {{the location of the}} virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes. Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, each shot went to the animation department from the layout. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical. The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or [...] "keyframes") was created, the software would build poses for the frames in-between. The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing. To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.|$|E
