25|$|A simple {{staircase}} {{with square}} balusters, turned newel post and <b>molded</b> <b>rail</b> {{rises from the}} central hall to the second story. The balustrade continues along the stairwell in the second floor hallway. Like the first floor, many original finishes remain. A door in the hallway conceals a short stair to the attic, which also mostly remains as it was originally constructed. Modern metal suspension rods {{have been added to}} support the ceiling, and one of the original wooden tie beams has been replaced with a metal one.|$|E

50|$|From the paneled {{double door}} on the {{centrally}} located main entrance under the front porch, {{there is a small}} vestibule that opens into two parlors on either side. Both have a large fireplace and original mantel. A finely <b>molded</b> chair <b>rail</b> runs around both rooms. In the kitchen wing there is some exposed brick from the original construction.|$|R
50|$|Olive Hill is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Matoaca, Chesterfield County, Virginia. It was built c.1740, and is a two-story, five-bay-wide, white frame house in the Georgian style. The original structure measures 38 feet by 32 feet. It is sheathed in molded weatherboard and topped by a pedimented roof. The interior features a Chinese lattice stair with a <b>molded</b> hand <b>rail.</b>|$|R
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a <b>molded</b> chair <b>rail</b> with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have <b>molded</b> chair <b>rails</b> and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|R
50|$|The PLR-16's {{frame is}} {{constructed}} of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny <b>rail</b> <b>molded</b> {{to the top}} of the receiver to accept various optical sights.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a central}} hallway in the home with a large parlor on either side. The walls in the hallway are {{plastered}} but feature wainscoting on the lower portion. The plastered walls in the other rooms are lined with a <b>molded</b> chair <b>rail.</b> The open-string two flights staircase {{is on the left}} side of the main hallway. The staircase features curved brackets and square balusters. An enclosed staircase is located in the east end parlor.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical beadboard and <b>molded</b> chair <b>rail</b> complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between {{the walls and}} ceiling. The slip pews are made of oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors {{in the center and}} side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the house}} has a center-hall plan and many {{original}} finishings. From the former main entrance there are six-paneled doors, cased in molded architraves leading to the parlor on the north, the dining room {{to the south and}} {{the other half of the}} entrance hall on the west, which also provides access to a small bathroom and closet. A stair with newel and squared balusters is against the south wall. Walls and ceilings are plaster with a <b>molded</b> chair <b>rail.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the main}} {{entrance}} leads to an 8-foot-wide (2.4 m) central hallway, the axis of a symmetrical floor plan. The rooms on the west are a double parlor; those on the east are {{the dining room and}} library. All have most of their original trim, including baseboards, cornices, <b>molded</b> chair <b>rails</b> and diagonally oriented corner fireplaces that share a chimney with the other room on that side. Paneled doors lead between all spaces. Flooring is random-width wide pine boards, and those in the southwest parlor are clear-grained. All first-story rooms share 9 ft ceilings with the hallway. All windows have paneled shutters that recess into the 24-inch-deep (61 cm) walls with window seats below.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the parkway}} concept of Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, {{designers}} of New York City's Central Park, the planners of the Colonial Parkway used {{a model of}} a limited access highway with broad sweeping curves, set in a landscaped right-of-way devoid of commercial development. These features, derived from 19th-century Romantic landscape theories, created a safer and more pleasant drive compared to the increasingly congested urban strips. In addition to protecting the views, culvert headwalls and parkway underpasses were clad in [...] "Virginia-style" [...] brick laid in English and Flemish bonds to promote a [...] "colonial-era" [...] effect. Design features such as <b>molded</b> coping <b>rails,</b> string courses and buttresses followed the historical prototypes found at Williamsburg.|$|R
50|$|The VP9 has an {{extended}} full size Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 <b>rail</b> <b>molded</b> into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail {{has been tested}} and certified to handle the heavier mounted accessories because of its full size which adds rigidity. This rigidity gives the VP9 superior capabilities compared to some of its polymer competitors whose frames flex under use and cannot handle the weight {{of some of the}} medium to larger mounted lights.|$|R
50|$|Also on {{the east}} wall, a five-panel door opens into the closed stair along the east wall. A small storage room in the {{northwest}} corner is accessed from this space, divided from the main hall by a partially glazed wall on the south. The stair itself, located behind another paneled door {{at the north end}} of the entrance hall, is lit by the windows on that elevation. The dogleg stair itself has simple square balusters, a <b>molded</b> top round <b>rail</b> and square newel.|$|R
50|$|The {{sliding table}} allows a {{straight}} edge to be cut on rough lumber, {{without the use of}} a fence. It also allows a cut to be made accurately at any angle across a sheet of plywood in just seconds - something that cannot be done nearly as easily, if at all, on a table saw. Used in conjunction with the shaper, the sliding table allows <b>molding,</b> door panels, <b>rails</b> and stiles, to be milled quickly and more accurately than a stand-alone shaper.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} house included an off-center hallway with a large room on one end and a smaller room on the other end. The smaller room was later divided with the rear portion being converted into a kitchen. Plastered walls and <b>molded</b> chair <b>rails</b> run along the entire lengths {{of the first and}} second floors. The Federal style stairway features a transverse landing, a square newel, and a rounded handrail on top of rectangular pickets. The step-ends are decorated with a wavy bracket. The Adamesque style mantels in the larger rooms have fluted pilasters while the smaller rooms have simple paneled pilasters. The attic has three rooms; the stair rises into a center passage. The east room is {{the same size as the}} rooms immediately below. The space above the first and second floor west rooms is divided longitudinally into two rooms. These garret rooms have batten doors.|$|R
50|$|A $1.3 million {{rehabilitation}} {{was completed}} in 2009 to bring the home to its historic condition. While the house was in decay, restoration-construction experts had much original material to work with: exterior brick, stone foundation, floor joists, walnut flooring, cabinets, sills, interior <b>molding</b> and chair <b>rails.</b> Rehabilitation efforts included pouring a new foundation; restoring original window size and replacing panes and sashes; re-shingling the roof in period materials; removing paint from and stabilizing exterior brick; refinishing original floors and woodwork; and restoring interior plaster. In addition, the four chimneys were rebuilt from a state of disrepair, and a summer kitchen was reconstructed based on archaeological and historical information.|$|R
50|$|The {{main block}} of the Osgood House is a two story wood frame structure, five bays in width and depth, with a hip roof and a granite foundation. A two-story gable-roofed ell {{extends to the}} west, ending in a small shed which {{replicates}} an earlier, similar structure. The main entrance, facing east, is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a louvered fan. A secondary entrance is centered on the south facade, framed by pilasters and a transom window and entablature. The interior follows a fairly typical Federal period central hall plan, with turned newel post and balusters, and applied sawn ornamentation. Federal style paneling, door and window <b>molding,</b> and chair <b>rails</b> decorate the public rooms.|$|R
2500|$|To {{continue}} {{providing for}} the family after the fire, Nist and sons established the Queen City Box Manufacturing company and began production in October 1889. The original Queen City Manufacturing facility was next to the Nist family home {{on the shore of}} Lake Union. The company started slowly, and according to the Seattle City Directory three of Nist's sons, Michael, Jacob J., and John were also employed in 1890 by Skookum Manufacturing Company, another local sawmill. The company made millwork, sashes and door frames. The Nists incorporated the company two years into production, in November 1891, with $10,000 capital, 100 shares at $100 each. The company objectives were to [...] "manufacture, buy, sell and deal in all kinds of lumber, sashes, doors, window blinds, <b>molding,</b> stairs, stair <b>rails</b> and banisters, and all kinds of woodwork and finishing material−to operate sawmills, sash and door factories, shingle mills, box factories, and to build houses, deal in timber and own land." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Gremlin X {{version was}} added in 1976 as a {{separate}} model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger [...] I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright <b>molding</b> package (drip <b>rails,</b> wheel arches, rocker panels), wheel trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the [...] "Navajo" [...] pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual seat configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.|$|R
