40|$|The {{presence}} of cracks in {{any type of}} structure is undesirable as they often lead to fracture {{or failure of the}} structure. <b>Marine</b> <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> is a key component in marine propulsion systems; moreover due to the strenuous working conditions, to which it is subjected during its marine operation, it is prone to develop crack(s). The presently available crack detection methods, either require disassembly of the shaft substructure for visual inspection or require external excitation of the relevant portion of the shaft for subsequent dynamic analyses; consequently these methods are quite complex and time consuming. In this study a simpler crack detection method is proposed for crack detection in rotating marine propeller shafts. The crack detection method is based on simple strain and displacement measurements at identified locations and hence easy to execute. The study was carried out using Finite Element Analysis through ABAQUS, a well-known commercial finite element package. The analysis was carried out both for the existence of single bending crack and single circumferential crack, on the body of the rotating shaft component, and the proposed method was able to identify both types of cracks at quite early stages of their growth and development. It was found that if measured at the proper locations, the percentage changes and slopes of percentage changes for these parameters (strain and displacement) changed more rapidly than frequencies, due to the {{presence of}} a crack. Only two measurements were required to get such identification which could be directly related to crack location and size. Based on the computed and analyzed numerical results, a simple but effective crack detection method has been proposed which would eliminate the complexities present in the currently available crack detection methods for such structures...|$|E

Generally the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> has a two-piece steel structure of more than 10 kg of weight. In this paper, we designed the one-piece hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> using the aluminum, {{carbon fiber composite material}} and glass fiber composite material. Research on the adhesive strength of the hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> with respect to roughness of aluminum surface was conducted. The one piece hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> satisfying the performance standards of <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> such as statistic torsion torque strength and first bending natural frequency was manufactured.

40|$|This degree {{project has}} been made in {{cooperation}} with engineers working for GM Engineering/Saab Automobile AB in Trollhättan. The given name by Saab for the project is “Fuel efficiency improvements in All Wheel Drive(AWD) -system”. The main tasks of this thesis work were to investigate the size of the power losses in different parts on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> to design a computer program that calculates coordinates and angles on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> and to investigate the possibilities to put together a simplified formula that calculates the natural frequencies on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft.</b> The main parts of this report are a compilation of the theory about AWD and mostly about the parts on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> and also a description of the developed computer program called <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator. This report doesn’t concern power losses in the different joints because there were no such general equations to be found. The most common way to calculate the power losses inside a joint is to do tests were the power loss is measured at different angles, torque and speed and then use that data to put together an approximated equation. Most of the work on this {{project has been}} on theory studies and on programming. The main result of the project is the program <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator. <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator is a program that is designed in Microsoft Excel. All the menus are programmed in the visual basic editor in Excel. The program is supposed {{to be used as a}} help while designing new <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts.</b> <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator can calculate all the coordinates, lengths, angles and directions on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft.</b> It also calculates natural frequencies, plunge, estimated power loss on the second shaft and angles in the joints. In the program you can choose to do calculations on four different configurations of <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> but can quite easy upgrade the program with more choices. Basically the program works like this: First you choose the right <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> in the main menu. Then you fill out the indata sheet with coordinates, lengths, material data and so on. As you type in the input data the output data will appear in the out-data sheet next to the in-data. Every <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> has also a calculations sheet were more detailed calculations can be found.

An example is represented by drilling operations performed with semi submersible rigs where the control of position and heading requires high accuracy.
