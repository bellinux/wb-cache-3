5|$|Both sides {{had played}} several matches already, which was unusual as the Super Cup would {{normally}} {{have been the}} first significant match the two teams had played. Liverpool had been forced to enter the first qualifying round of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, despite being champions. They had failed to finish in the top four during the 2004–05 FA Premier League, which would ensure Champions League qualification. UEFA granted them special dispensation to enter the competition as holders. Meanwhile, CSKA Moscow were in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> domestic season. At the time of this match they were second in the 2005 Russian Premier League, seven points behind leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} well into their {{respective}} domestic competitions. São Paulo's domestic season had finished {{two weeks before}} the final. They finished the 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 11th position after 42 games, they won and lost 16 games each and drew 10. Liverpool were in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> domestic season, they were competing in the 2005–06 Premier League. They were second in the table and won their last match before the competition 2–0, against Middlesbrough. The victory meant Liverpool had gone 10 matches without conceding a goal, which equalled a club record.|$|E
5|$|Kahin {{helped develop}} Indonesian {{studies in the}} United States {{at a time when}} the {{majority}} of material on Indonesia was held at Leiden University in the Netherlands. At Cornell, he introduced a postgraduate education program for diplomats from around the world who were in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> careers. He also helped many Indonesian intellectuals, including Deliar Noer and sociologist Selo Soemardjan, obtain education in the United States. Several of Kahin's students and associates, including Herbert Feith, went on to establish similar programs at the universities where they subsequently taught.|$|E

5|$|Meredith spirals further when Ellis is {{admitted}} to the hospital, revealing Ellis' diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's and her verbally abusive tendencies. Meredith self-destructive behavior increases when she saves a patient with a bomb in their chest by impulsively inserting her hand to hold it until the bomb squad can remove it. Mereidth has a series of one-night stands, including one with George, who {{is in love with}} her. When she cries in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> encounter, their friendship temporarily ends. Meredith swears off her behavior, agrees to be friends only with Shepherd, and embarks on a relationship with veterinarian Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 2001, {{the team}} was {{involved}} {{in what was then}} the most-attended hockey game in history: The Cold War. The Spartans set up a hockey rink in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> football stadium, Spartan Stadium and played U-M before a crowd of 74,554. The game ended in a 33 tie. A decade later, the same two teams were again involved in the most-attended ice hockey game in history. This time, Michigan hosted the rivalry game at its Michigan Stadium. The Big Chill at the Big House set the current record with an officially certified crowd of 104,173.|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E

5|$|The optimal {{crossing}} point ran over Norwegian Talc's plant, and would involve placing the western pylon in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> area. The company offered the authorities free {{land on the}} condition that they received a satisfactory intersection with the bridge. A formal agreement was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan had to be made, which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land not already owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of this type of}} filtering is that it lets ordinary users help identify spam, and not just administrators, thus vastly increasing the pool of spam fighters. The disadvantage is that spammers can insert unique invisible gibberish—known as hashbusters—into the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>their</b> messages, thus making each message unique and having a different checksum. This leads to an arms race between the developers of the checksum software and the developers of the spam-generating software.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a mobile}} war party of 150 Albany militia and Iroquois warriors under Captain John Schuyler marched and canoed {{overland}} to Montreal, imitating the petite guerre tactics (long-range expeditions into enemy territory) perfected by the French colonists. Schuyler's expedition {{was designed to}} seize Montreal and pin French forces south of Quebec, allowing the Boston fleet to sail against the capital unopposed. Smallpox, lack of supplies, and disagreements among the officers caused most of the militia and Iroquois to turn back in disgust, leaving Schuyler with {{a fraction of the}} 855 men promised by the New England authorities. On 4 September the English raiders attacked settlements south of Montreal, killing some 50 habitants in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> harvests. Too weak to risk a battle with the town's garrison, Schuyler wrapped up the New England invasion and turned home. Thus, when Phips was sighted off Tadoussac, Frontenac ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivières to make for the threatened capital with all haste. Four days later the Governor arrived in Quebec with 200–300 troops freed-up by the failure of Schuyler's invasion, considerably lifting the capital's spirit of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking {{around the time of}} breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey {{accepted}} Burchard's {{appointment in}} December 1189, but then excommunicated Burchard in January 1190. The excommunication, which was shared with Henry Marshal, was retaliation for {{a dispute with}} the archbishop-elect that happened during a church service. The actual dispute occurred on 5 January 1190 when Burchard and Marshal were conducting vespers, either early or on time, depending on whose side was telling the story. Geoffrey appeared in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service and attempted to perform the same service, either late or on time, again depending on who was relating the story. When Burchard and Marshal finished their service, they put out all {{the lights in the}} church, leaving the archbishop in the dark. Despite that, he finished the service but then complained to the cathedral chapter of York about the incident. Attempts to mediate a dispute led nowhere, and the citizens of York soon became involved. Geoffrey attempted to keep the townspeople from abusing his two opponents, but Burchard was eventually forced to take refuge in the tomb of William of York, an earlier Archbishop of York. Hugh du Puiset then intervened with the king, and Geoffrey once more lost the royal favour. The king sent Burchard to Rome, along with Reginald fitzJocelin the Bishop of Bath, to attempt to secure the deposition of Geoffrey from York. Although Burchard's efforts in Rome in mid-1190 contributed to a papal prohibition on Geoffrey's consecration by Pope Clement III, Geoffrey was not deposed. Burchard did secure his own absolution of the excommunication placed by Geoffrey in January.|$|E

5|$|Several units lost crucially needed {{supply lines}} in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> offensives, {{particularly}} when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining. The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid-August, forcing one of its regiments {{to withdraw from the}} captured Triangulation Hill. At Naktong Bulge, the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river, but it still suffered serious food, ammunition, weapon, and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing. It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems. The situation was most dire for units in the east, where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge. The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20, a key factor in their defeat there. In some instances, desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them. North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly, and their logistical system, stretched beyond its limit, collapsed at a key point in the war. Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies. North Korean units instead turned to foraging for what they could find in the countryside or raiding UN supplies. Small guerrilla units, such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment, could do this effectively.|$|E
