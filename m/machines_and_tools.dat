2500|$|A {{production}} system comprises both the technological elements (<b>machines</b> <b>and</b> <b>tools)</b> and organizational behavior (division {{of labor and}} information flow). An individual {{production system}} is usually analyzed in the literature referring to a single business, therefore it's usually improper to include in a given production system the operations necessary to process goods that are obtained by purchasing or the operations carried by the customer on the sold products, the reason being simply that since businesses need to design their own production systems this then becomes the focus of analysis, modeling and decision making (also called [...] "configuring" [...] a production system) [...]|$|E
6000|$|It {{was this}} {{practical}} impossibility of suppression that interested both the guild of publishers {{and the government}} in the conditions of the book trade. The former were always harassed, often kept poor, and sometimes ruined, by systematic piracy and the invasion of their rights. The government, on the other hand, could not help seeing that, as the books could not possibly be kept out of the realm, it was to be regretted that their production conferred no benefit on the manufacturing industry of the realm, the composition, the printing, the casting of type, the fabrication of paper, the preparation of leather and vellum, the making of <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> <b>tools.</b> When Bayle's Dictionary appeared, it was the rage of Europe. Hundreds of the ever-renowned folios found their way into France, and were paid for by French money. The booksellers addressed the minister, and easily persuaded him of the difference, according to the economic light of those days, between an exchange of money against paper, compared with an exchange of paper against paper. The minister replied that this was true, but still that the gates of the kingdom would never be opened to a single copy of Bayle. [...] "The best thing to do," [...] he said, [...] "is to print it here." [...] And the third edition of Bayle was printed in France, much to the contentment of the French printers, binders, and booksellers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an intelligent process planning system for generating machining instructions for prismatic parts. The generated instruction includes machine tool information, <b>machining</b> sequence, <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> setup information, <b>machining</b> parameters, <b>and</b> <b>tool</b> path. In the proposed system, part information is {{received as a}} STEP AP 224 feature model. One novel aspect of the proposed system is implementation of a formal OWL ontology for representation of <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> cutting <b>tool</b> capability knowledge as well as part information. OWL-based ontology enables automated ontological reasoning during process planning. Also, SWRL rule modeling approach is adopted for identifying feasible <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> cutting <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> also specifying process parameters. A proof-of-concept implementation is presented as well in this paper...|$|R
