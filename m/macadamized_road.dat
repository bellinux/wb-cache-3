Ladd in 1883, it was Portland’s first home-based fire insurance company. Other firms were agents for large national and foreign insurance companies).

His other businesses included the Portland Cordage Co., Portland Linseed Oil Co., The Portland Rope Works, Oregon Transfer Co., The Portland Gas Company, The Trinidad Asphalt Company and The <b>Macadamized</b> <b>Road</b> Company (built as a toll road where Macadam road is now, running almost parallel with Corbett Ave.).|$|E

60|$|Then {{six miles}} of <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> showed {{us that the}} team could move. A railway ran {{between us and the}} banks of the Willamette, and another above us through the mountains. All the land was dotted with small townships, and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons, bunches of tow-haired, boggle-eyed urchins sitting in the hay behind. The men {{generally}} looked like loafers, but their women were all well dressed.|$|E

60|$|After due {{refreshment}} and repose {{we continued}} our route, ascending the Jura, towards the Dôle, {{which is the}} highest mountain of that range. A <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> coiled up the mountain side, affording us at every turning {{a new and more}} splendid view of the other shore of the lake. At length we reached St. Cergue, and leaving the carriage, H. and I, guided by a peasant girl, went through the woods to the highest point, where were the ruins of the ancient chateau. Far be it from me to describe what we saw. I feel that I have already been too presumptuous. We sat down, and each made a hasty sketch of Mont Blanc.|$|E
60|$|We {{walked a}} mile over a raised <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> of uniform width; a road paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a {{considerable}} degree of engineering skill. Some {{say that that}} wise old pagan, Kamehameha I planned and built it, but others say it was built so long before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out of the traditions. In either case, however, as the handiwork of an untaught and degraded race it {{is a thing of}} pleasing interest. The stones are worn and smooth, and pushed apart in places, so that the road has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of Rome which one sees in pictures.|$|E
60|$|He {{lived in}} a large new house of red brick, {{standing}} outside a mass of homogeneous red-brick dwellings, called Wiggiston. Wiggiston was only seven years old. It had been a hamlet of eleven houses {{on the edge of}} healthy, half-agricultural country. Then the great seam of coal had been opened. In a year Wiggiston appeared, a great mass of pinkish rows of thin, unreal dwellings of five rooms each. The streets were like visions of pure ugliness; a grey-black <b>macadamized</b> <b>road,</b> asphalt causeways, held in between a flat succession of wall, window, and door, a new-brick channel that began nowhere, and ended nowhere. Everything was amorphous, yet everything repeated itself endlessly. Only now and then, in one of the house-windows vegetables or small groceries were displayed for sale.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads,</b> the Cleveland Bay horse was considered not fast enough, and as a result, some Cleveland Bays were bred to Thoroughbred horses to produce the Yorkshire Coach Horse. In 1887 a Yorkshire Coach Horse Stud Book was introduced, which contained horses that were three-quarters Cleveland Bay and one-quarter Thoroughbred.|$|R
2500|$|During the 19th Century {{quarrying}} {{of granite}} {{for use in}} England became a valuable trade good from Guernsey, adding value by creating cobblestones for London streets, although after 1847 gravel was exported for <b>macadamizing</b> <b>roads.</b> [...] In 1861 St Sampson’s harbour saw 142,866 tons of stone loaded in 737 ships, it became very crowded and required piers to be rebuilt and repaired, by 1913, annual tonnage had risen to 453,947.|$|R

60|$|The cave was on {{or in the}} top of {{a little}} spur of the Catskills that had strayed down to the river's edge, and, not having a ferry ticket, had to stop there. The bijou {{mountains}} were densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer transients. Like a badly sewn strip of white braid, a <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the river's edge. A dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermit's cave. One mile upstream was the Viewpoint Inn, to which summer folk from the city came; leaving cool, electric-fanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine, shrieking, in gasoline launches, by spindle-legged Modreds bearing the blankest of shields.|$|E
60|$|A long, wide, and {{smoothly}} <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> stretched {{itself from}} the considerable town of Glenford onward and northward toward {{a gap in the}} distant mountains. It did not run through a level country, but rose and fell {{as if it had been}} a line of seaweed upon the long swells of the ocean. Upon elevated points upon this road, farm lands and forests could be seen extending in every direction. But there was nothing in the landscape which impressed itself more obtrusively upon the attention of the traveler than the road itself. White in the bright sunlight and gray under the shadows of the clouds, it was the one thing to be seen which seemed to have a decided purpose. Northward or southward, toward the gap in the long line of mountains or toward the wood-encircled town in the valley, it was always going somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|Presently we drew rein, and {{exchanged}} our pace {{for one more}} seasonable, whilst the sun began to tell on man and beast. High raised as we were above the ground, the reflected heat struck us sensibly, and the glare of a <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> added a few extra degrees of caloric.[FN#5] The Badawin, to refresh themselves, prepare to smoke. They fill my chibuk, light it with a flint and steel, and cotton dipped in a solution of gunpowder, and pass it over to me.[FN#6] After a few puffs I return it to them, and they use it turn by turn. Then they begin to while away the tedium of the road by asking questions, which passe-temps is not easily exhausted; for they are never satisfied till they know as much of you as you do of yourself. They next resort to talking about victuals; for with this hungry race, food, as a topic of conversation, {{takes the place of}} money in happier lands. And lastly, even this engrossing subject being exhausted for the moment, ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, the area {{currently}} occupied by Bel-Air Village was part of the former Nielson Airport in Nielson Field, Rizal Province, Luzon. At the time, this airport was the only commercial flight server in Manila. The runways of Nielsen Airport were wide and <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads</b> that are now the major thoroughfares known as Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas. Philippine Airlines, which was then owned by Don Andres Soriano, Sr., operated domestic flights from Manila to Baguio and Paracale, with 9-passenger twin engine planes flown by American pilots.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 Kessler {{moved to}} St. Louis, Missouri. In 1912 and 1913 he {{designed}} the expansive Longview Farm for Robert A. Long, south of Kansas City. With over 1700 acre, it was community bigger than some small towns, with over 50 buildings. The landscaping earned the farm {{the title of}} The World's Most Beautiful Farm. The community had underground electricity, filtered water from a 100000 gal L water tower, steam heating, and indoor plumbing, as well as 7 mi of <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads</b> that was innovative for that era. The landscape layout around the mansion included manicured shrubbery, fountains, and a tennis court.|$|R
5000|$|A {{dirt road}} or track {{is a type}} of unpaved road made from the native {{material}} of the land surface through which it passes, known to highway engineers as subgrade material. Dirt roads are suitable for vehicles; a narrower path for pedestrians, animals, and possibly small vehicles would be called a dirt track - the distinction is not well-defined. Unpaved roads with a harder surface made by the addition of material such as gravel and aggregate (stones), might be referred to as dirt roads in common usage but are distinguished as improved roads by highway engineers. (Improved unpaved roads include gravel roads, laterite roads, murram <b>roads</b> and <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads.)</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|But [...] "drinking the waters" [...] {{was only}} a small portion of the torture I {{experienced}} during that memorable month--a month which was, without exception, the most miserable I have ever spent. During the best part of it I religiously followed the doctor's mandate and did nothing whatever, except moon about the house and garden and go out for two hours a day in a Bath chair. That did break the monotony to a certain extent. There is more excitement about Bath-chairing--especially if you are not used to the exhilarating exercise--than might appear to the casual observer. A sense of danger, such as a mere outsider might not understand, is ever present to the mind of the occupant. He feels convinced every minute that the whole concern is going over, a conviction which becomes especially lively whenever a ditch or a stretch of newly <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> comes in sight. Every vehicle that passes he expects is going to run into him; and he never finds himself ascending or descending a hill without immediately beginning to speculate upon his chances, supposing--as seems extremely probable--that the weak-kneed controller of his destiny should let go.|$|E
60|$|The midnight {{hour for}} which there has been {{occasion}} to wait at length arrives, and I journey towards the stronghold in obedience to a request urged earlier in the day. It concerns an appointment, which I rather regret my decision to keep now that night is come. The route thither is hedgeless and treeless--I need not add deserted. The moonlight is sufficient to disclose the pale riband-like surface {{of the way as}} it trails along between the expanses of darker fallow. Though the road passes near the fortress it does not conduct directly to its fronts. As the place is without an inhabitant, so it is without a trackway. So presently leaving the <b>macadamized</b> <b>road</b> to pursue its course elsewhither, I step off upon the fallow, and plod stumblingly across it. The castle looms out off the shade by degrees, like a thing waking up and asking what I want there. It is now so enlarged by nearness that its whole shape cannot be taken in at one view. The ploughed ground ends as the rise sharpens, the sloping basement of grass begins, and I climb upward to invade Mai-Dun.|$|E

50|$|The farm had a list {{of modern}} marvels {{including}} experimental innovations. In the mansion Long {{did not want to}} use antique furniture because it was used. Long had new antique style replica furniture shipped from New York. The farm had a telephone system, complete plumbing, 25 mi of white wooden fence that was built without nails or bolts, and over seven miles (11 km) of <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads.</b> The roads were not innovative because in the 1820s John Loudon McAdam, a Scottish engineer, pioneered the state-of-the-art Macadam road. Aside from the natural grass fields there were many acres of hay fields and feed still had to be brought in to feed all the livestock.|$|R

"The key-notes of {{the modern}} {{movement}} are the reduction of {{a great number of}} tasks to one pattern; the diminution of friction of every kind which might hinder powerful agencies from combining their action and spreading their influence over vast areas; and the development of transport by new methods and new forces. The <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads</b> and the improved shipping of the eighteenth century broke up local combinations and monopolies, and offered facilities for the growth of others extending over a wider area: and in our own age the same double tendency is resulting from every new extension and cheapening of communication by land and sea, by printing-press and telegraph and telephone."

50|$|Alderman John Birchenough JP (November 1, 1825 - May 7, 1895) was a {{prominent}} local politician and silk manufacturer in Macclesfield, Cheshire in the nineteenth century.

He was a Wesleyan Methodist and was a prolific supporter of local charities in Macclesfield. Birchenough was a member of the Macclesfield Town Council for nearly forty years during a time of great transformation for the town when many public works - such as the waterworks, the cemetery, enlargement of the Town Hall, extensions at the gasworks, and the transformation of the muddy streets into cleanly paved, and hard <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads</b> - were carried out.|$|R

60|$|The day {{succeeding}} that {{in which}} the conversation just mentioned occurred, was one of great expectation and delight in the Wigwam. Mrs. Hawker and the Bloomfields were expected, and the morning passed away rapidly, under the gay buoyancy of the feelings that usually accompany such anticipations in a country-house. The travellers were to leave town the previous evening, and, though the distance was near two hundred and thirty miles, they were engaged to arrive by the usual dinner hour. In speed, the Americans, {{so long as they}} follow the great routes, are unsurpassed; and even Sir George Templemore, coming, as he did, from a country of <b>MacAdamized</b> <b>roads</b> and excellent posting, expressed his surprise, when given to understand that a journey of this length, near a hundred miles of which were by land, moreover, was to be performed in twenty-four hours, the stops included.|$|R

50|$|The Russians would rely on two {{of their}} three {{railways}} that ran up to the border; each would provision an army. The railways ended at the border, as Russian trains operated on a different rail gauge than Western Europe. Consequently, its armies could be transported by rail {{only as far as}} the German border and could use Prussian railways only with captured locomotives and rolling stock. The First Army would use the line that ran from Vilnus, Lithuania, to the border 136 km southeast of Königsberg. The Second Army railway ran from Warsaw, Poland, to the border 165 km southwest of Königsberg. The two armies would take the Germans in a pincers. The Russian supply chains would be ungainly because—for defense—on their side of the border {{there were only a few}} sandy tracks rather than proper <b>macadamized</b> <b>roads.</b> Adding to their supply problems, the Russians deployed large numbers of cavalry and Cossacks; every day each horse needed ten times the resources that a man required.|$|R

60|$|The convent {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{established}} by a certain Bernard de Menthon, an Augustine of Aoste, in 962, who was afterwards canonized for his holiness. In that remote age the institution must have been eminently useful, for posting and <b>Macadamized</b> <b>roads</b> across the Alps were not thought of. It even does much good now, as nine-tenths who stop here are peasants that pay nothing for their entertainment. At particular seasons, and on certain occasions, they cross in great numbers, my guide assuring me he had slept at the convent when there were eight hundred guests; a story, by the way, that one of the monks confirmed. Some fair or festival, however, led to this extraordinary migration. Formerly the convent was rich, and able to bear the charges of entertaining so many guests; but since the Revolution it has lost most of its property, and has but a small fixed income. It is authorized, however, to make periodical quêtes in the surrounding country, and obtains a good deal in that way. All who can pay, moreover, leave behind them donations of greater or less amount, and by that means the charity is still maintained.|$|R
