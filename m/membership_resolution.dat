5000|$|The {{spokesperson}} for the , , charges that the PRO process was introduced by the executive board in a [...] "hush-hush operation" [...] (Nacht-und-Nebel-Aktion) without a resolution from the General Assembly—and which just happened to benefit {{the members of the}} executive board, including its chairman at the time, Otto Krause. He accused him of exploitation and personal enrichment, because he sometimes collected sums that were 100 times the incoming licensing fees collected for his old Schlager songs, while rock musicians only earned 10% of the licensing fees their music earned. Furthermore, he claimed that a statistics professor that had been appointed to assess the rationale for the distribution process had had absolutely no expertise in the field of live music and was deliberately misinformed by the executive board. Furthermore, a 2005 verdict by the federal court demanded that the PRO process be subject to a vote by the membership, which has yet to occur. Seelenmeyer also sharply criticized the term [...] "solidarity principle" [...] (Solidarprinzip), arguing that it disguises and sugarcoats a planned- and intentionally-unfair distribution process. He cited {{the former chairman of the}} GEMA board of directors , who wrote regarding the introduction of the PRO process that, [...] "For an extrapolation process heavily impacting the income distribution of members to be introduced without a <b>membership</b> <b>resolution</b> is simply intolerable and furthermore against regulations, according to the opinion of many legal experts." [...] Evers further charged: [...] "This paternalism would rob GEMA members of their voting rights regarding an essential domain of their assets. They are almost being deprived of their right of decision by their own trustees!" [...] Evers demanded that: [...] "The only way that the executive board and directorial board can get out of this crisis of confidence that has arisen through the patronization of members lies in the immediate dismissal of the PRO process and the development of a new process with the participation and approval of its members!" ...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{fuzzy set}} {{theoretical}} approaches for representing spatial relationships provides an intuitive {{way of expressing}} the diffuse localization and limits of image components. Fuzziness can be present in images {{as a consequence of}} noise introduced during the imaging process, in which case it should preferably be removed, and as imprecision inherent to the observed objects, in which case it provides important information that should be utilized during the image analysis process. A general goal for the research presented in this thesis has been to develop shape analysis methods that can be applied to fuzzy segmented images in 2 D and 3 D. A demand for the developed methods has been to respect the specific nature of a fuzzy representation of the studied shapes and, especially, the consequences of discretization. We have studied representation and reconstruction of a shape by using moments of both its crisp and fuzzy discretization. We show, both theoretically and statistically, that the precision of estimation of moments of a shape is increased if a fuzzy representation of a shape is used, instead of a crisp one. The signature of a shape based on the distance from the shape centroid is studied and two approaches for its calculation for fuzzy shapes are proposed. A comparison of the performance of fuzzy and crisp approaches is carried out through a statistical study, where a higher precision of shape signature estimation is observed for the fuzzy approaches. The measurements of area, perimeter, and compactness, as well as of volume, surface area, and sphericity, are considered, too. New methods are developed for the estimation of perimeter and surface area of a discrete fuzzy shape. It is shown through statistical studies that the precision of all the observed estimates increases if a fuzzy representation is used and that the improvement is more significant at low spatial resolutions. In addition, a defuzzification method based on feature invariance is designed, utilizing the improved estimates of shape characteristics from fuzzy sets to generate crisp discrete shapes with the most similar shape characteristics. This defuzzification method, performed on a fuzzy segmentation, can be seen as an alternative to a crisp segmentation of an image. The presented results can be applied wherever precise estimates of shape properties are required, especially in conditions of limited spatial resolution. We have showed, either theoretically, or empirically, that <b>membership</b> <b>resolution</b> available can be successfully utilized to overcome a lack of spatial resolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{evolutionary}} changes {{recorded by the}} fossil record has long been controversial, with particular disagreement concerning the relative frequency of gradual change versus stasis within lineages. Here, I present a large-scale, statistical survey of evolutionary mode in fossil lineages. Over 250 sequences of evolving traits were fit by using maximum likelihood to three evolutionary models: directional change, random walk, and stasis. Evolution in these traits was rarely directional; in only 5 % of fossil sequences was directional evolution the most strongly supported of the three modes of change. The remaining 95 % of sequences were divided nearly equally between random walks and stasis. Variables related to body size were significantly less likely than shape traits to experience stasis. This finding is in accord with previous suggestions that size may be more evolutionarily labile than shape and is consistent with some {{but not all of}} the mechanisms proposed to explain evolutionary stasis. In general, similar evolutionary patterns are observed across other variables, such as clade <b>membership</b> and temporal <b>resolution,</b> but {{there is some evidence that}} directional change in planktonic organisms is more frequent than in benthic organisms. The rarity with which directional evolution was observed in this study corroborates a key claim of punctuated equilibria and suggests that truly directional evolution is infrequent or, perhaps more importantly, of short enough duration so as to rarely register in paleontological sampling...|$|R
50|$|Latin American Perspectives {{emerged from}} the {{political}} and intellectual ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, notably the civil rights and anti-war movements that raised concerns about social justice and questioned the rationale and goals of U.S. foreign policy. Young academics, influenced {{by the work of}} radical scholars like C. Wright Mills and Paul Baran, critical of U.S. intervention in Latin America, and supportive of movements for social change, particularly the Cuban Revolution, formed the Union of Radical Latin Americanists (URLA) under the direction of Chilcote and Joel Edelstein within the Latin American Studies Association (LASA). Their objectives included opening up the field to methodological approaches including Marxism and to cutting edge work by Latin American theorists and scholars. They urged LASA to create a new journal that would reflect these concerns, and the LASA <b>membership</b> approved a <b>resolution</b> in support. Chilcote was invited by LASA to develop a proposal for an alternative journal in 1970. However, after LASA failed to secure support from the Ford Foundation and it was unable to fund the proposed journal, the project was carried forward by Chilcote and a group based in Southern California, who were also involved in the Los Angeles Group for Latin American Solidarity (LAGLAS) which at the time was very active in solidarity with Allende’s Chile.|$|R
40|$|The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe {{applied for}} first step funding in 2007 and was awarded in October of that year. We wanted {{to perform an}} audit to begin {{fulfilling}} two commitments we made to our <b>membership</b> and <b>resolutions</b> that we adopted. One was the Kyoto Protocol and reduce our carbon emissions by 25 % and to produce 25 % of our energy by sustainable means. To complete these goals we needed to begin with first assessing what our carbon emissions are and begin taking the steps to conserve on the energy we currently use. The First Step Grant gave {{us the opportunity to}} do this. Upon funding the Energy Project was formed under the umbrella of the LCO Public Works Department and Denise Johnson was hired as the coordinator. She quickly began fulfilling the objectives of the project. Denise began by contact the LCO College and hiring interns who were able to go to each Tribal entity and perform line logging to read and document the energy used for each electrical appliance. Data was also gathered for one full year from each entity for all their utility bills (gasoline, electric, natural gas, fuel oil, etc.). Relationships were formed with the Green Team and other Green Committees in the area that could assist us in this undertaking. The Energy Task Force was of great assistance as well recommending other committees and guidance to completing our project. The data was gathered, compiled and placed into spreadsheets that would be understandable for anyone who didn't have a background in Renewable Resources. While gathering the data Denise was also looking for ways to conserve energy usage, policies changes to implement and any possible viable renewable energy resources. Changes in the social behaviors of our members and employees will require further education by workshops, energy fairs, etc [...] This will be looked into and done in coordination with our schools. The renewable resources seem most feasible are wind resources as well as Bio Mass both of which need further assessment and funding to do so will be sought. While we already are in ownership of a Hydro Dam it is currently not functioning to its full capacity we are seeking operation and maintenance firm proposals and funding sources. One of our biggest accomplishment this project gave us was our total Carbon Emissions 9989. 45 tons, this will be the number that we will use to base our reductions from. It will help us achieve our goals we have set for ourselves in achieving the Kyoto Protocol and saving our Earth for our future generations. Another major accomplishment and lesson learned is we need to educate ourselves and our people on how to conserve energy to both impact the environment and our own budgets. The Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO) Energy Analysis Project will perform an energy audit to gather information on the Tribe's energy usage and determine the carbon emissions. By performing the audit {{we will be able to}} identify areas where conservation efforts are most viable and recommend policies that can be implemented. These steps will enable LCO to begin achieving the goals that have been set by the Tribal Governing Board and adopted through resolutions. The goals are to reduce emissions by 25 % and to produce 25 % of its energy using sustainable sources. The project objectives were very definitive to assist the Tribe in achieving its goals; reducing carbon emissions and obtaining a sustainable source of energy. The following were the outlined objectives: (1) Coordinate LCO's current and future conservation and renewable energy projects; (2) Establish working relationships with outside entities to share information and collaborate on future projects; (3) Complete energy audit and analyze LCO's energy load and carbon emissions; (4) Identify policy changes, education programs and conservation efforts which are appropriate for the LCO Reservation; and (5) Create a plan to identify the most cost effective renewable energy options for LCO...|$|R
