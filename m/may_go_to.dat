25|$|The {{increasing}} automation of {{the crystal}} structure determination process has resulted in ever higher publishing rates of new crystal structures and, consequentially, new publishing models. Minimalistic articles contain only crystal structure tables, structure images, and, possibly, abstract-like structure description.

More elaborate contributions <b>may</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> traditional subscriber-financed journals. Hybrid journals, on the other hand, embed individual author-financed open-access articles among subscriber-financed ones. Publishers may also make scientific articles available online, as Portable Document Format (PDF) files.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{getting out}} of prison, Turner sets up a gang that engages in shady {{activities}} that are just {{within the boundaries of}} the law. She also marries Gilder's son.

25|$|The afterlife is {{a complex}} matter in Norse mythology. The dead <b>may</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the murky realm of Hel—a realm ruled over by a female being of the same name, may be ferried away by valkyries to Odin's martial hall Valhalla, or may be chosen by the goddess Freyja to dwell in her field Fólkvangr. The goddess Rán may claim those that die at sea, and the goddess Gefjon {{is said to be}} {{attended}} by virgins upon their death. Texts also make reference to reincarnation. Time itself is presented between cyclic and linear, and some scholars have argued that cyclic time was the original format for the mythology. Various forms of a cosmological creation story are provided in Icelandic sources, and references to a future destruction and rebirth of the world—Ragnarok—are frequently mentioned in some texts.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2017, Reinhart {{was arrested}} for battery after {{allegedly}} punching a bouncer. Reinhart's lawyer, Dina LaPolt, says of the incident that Reinhart was assaulted by bouncers at Lamplighter Inn in Palatine, Illinois without provocation and forcefully removed from the establishment while a friend in her party was violently beaten, sustaining multiple injuries. LaPolt expressed plans to take legal action against the bouncers involved in the incident. An active investigation into the event is underway, with police confirming on July 12, 2017, that a person was injured during the altercation, without revealing {{the identities of the}} injured person or their attacker. Reinhart appeared in court on August 2, 2017, and plead not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery. Her next court date is scheduled for October 6, 2017, at which time the case <b>may</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> trial. During the hearing, Reinhart's lawyer, Carmine Trombetta, described Reinhart as a victim, not a perpetrator in this case, and stated he is working on obtaining security footage to corroborate witness statements he already obtained in regards to the incident.|$|E

25|$|This section deals {{primarily}} with Dmitri's wild and distraught pursuit of money {{so he can}} run away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fiancée Katerina and will believe {{himself to be a}} thief if he does not find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka. This mad dash for money takes Dmitri from Grushenka's benefactor to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka <b>may</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his father Fyodor and marry him because he already has the monetary means to satisfy her. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor's home, but quickly discovers she deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to his father's home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him from the window. He takes the pestle from his pocket. Then, there is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running away off his father's property, knocking the servant Gregory in the head with the pestle with seemingly fatal results.|$|E
25|$|Other {{anomalies}} of {{the classic}} Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose, redundant skin, and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek. The ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large. The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due {{to the absence of}} upward renal pressure. The bladder is often small, nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid. In males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent, while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent. Other abnormalities include anal atresia, absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon, esophageal and duodenal atresia, and a single umbilical artery. Presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetuses/infants. Additionally, the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop {{as a result of the}} reduced volume of amniotic fluid. Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation (however, some of these pregnancies <b>may</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> term) and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours. These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee might call for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill <b>may</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|E
