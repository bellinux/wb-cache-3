5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a wide range of animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
5|$|A band of Middle Devonian {{limestone}} runs west to {{east from}} Cremyll to Plymstock including the Hoe. Local limestone <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> numerous buildings, walls and pavements throughout Plymouth. To the north and north east {{of the city is}} the granite mass of Dartmoor; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult. A common {{approach}} in some histories and studies is to use Rocky Mountain Saints for those denominations headquartered in the American West and Prairie Saints for those denominations that formed in and around Nauvoo, Illinois; Voree, Wisconsin; Independence, Missouri; and other locations in the Midwest and East. These terms do not necessarily relate the current geographical locations of all denominations within those two groupings, but rather the original location of their respective parent organizations, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the table below.|$|E

5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly {{to an understanding of the}} enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Themistocles, with a {{power base}} firmly established amongst the poor, filled the vacuum left by Miltiades's death, and in the following decade became the most influential politician in Athens. During this period, Themistocles continued to support the expansion of Athens' naval power. The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended, and Themistocles's naval policies <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> {{the light of the}} potential threat from Persia. Aristides, Themistocles's great rival, and champion of the zeugites (the 'upper hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.|$|E

5|$|Although little {{trace of}} the 10th-century church has been discovered, save {{possibly}} some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave, there is much evidence of the monastery of 1093. This work in the Norman style <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the northwest tower, the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings. The abbey church, beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end, was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14thcenturies. At {{the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, the cloister, the central tower, a new south transept, the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style, and the southwest tower of the façade had been begun. The west front was given a Tudor entrance, but the tower was never completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E

50|$|Twinning wisps or intergrowths <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> diamonds. These {{formations}} {{are usually}} inclusions in diamonds that have twisted together {{during the time}} of diamond formation. Thus, various inclusions such as pinpoints, needles or feathers may form together, creating a white strip inside the diamond. Surface graining <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> some cases. Such intergrowths <b>are</b> more commonly <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> fancy cut diamonds and are extremely rare in ideal cut diamonds.|$|R
5|$|Stephen of Ripon {{says that}} Wilfrid stayed in Lyon for three years, leaving {{only after the}} archbishop's murder. However, Annemund's murder took place in 660 and Wilfrid {{returned}} to England in 658, suggesting that Stephen's chronology is awry. Stephen says that Annemund gave Wilfrid a clerical tonsure, although this {{does not appear to}} mean that he became a monk, merely that he entered the clergy. Bede is silent on the subject of Wilfrid's monastic status, although Wilfrid probably became a monk during his time in Rome, or afterwards while he was in Gaul. Some historians, however, believe that Wilfrid was never a monk. While in Gaul, Wilfrid absorbed Frankish ecclesiastical practices, including some aspects from the monasteries founded by Columbanus. This influence <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Wilfrid's probable adoption of a Frankish ceremony in his consecration of churches later in his life, as well as in his employment of Frankish masons to build his churches. Wilfrid would also have learned of the Rule of Saint Benedict in Gaul, as Columbanus' monasteries followed that monastic rule.|$|E
5|$|The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts {{and sandy}} and stony deserts. They even occur in {{extremely}} arid areas, {{with less than}} 100mm annual rainfall. They also inhabit deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population {{is present in the}} Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> north Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the antelope is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there are no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping {{with the lack of}} {{resources}} available in international emergency medicine <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
