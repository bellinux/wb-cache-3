5|$|T. m. azorensis {{is a small}} race which breeds in the Azores. The <b>male</b> <b>is</b> {{darker and}} glossier than merula.|$|E
5|$|A. c. cervicapra (Linnaeus, 1758) : Known as {{the southeastern}} blackbuck. Occurs in southern, {{eastern and central}} India. The white eye ring of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> narrow above the eye and the leg stripe is well defined and reaches all along the leg.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Males</b> <b>are</b> likely non-migratory, {{and adult}} <b>males</b> <b>are</b> rarely {{encountered}} in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Similar to females, the head, thorax and abdomen of M. nuda <b>males</b> <b>are</b> dark black. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> {{differentiated}} {{by having}} much less scopa, or hair, on their posterior tibiae. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> characterized by yellow markings on their heads, the broad {{plate on the}} front of the head being completely yellow.|$|R
5000|$|Silver - Another common feather coloring. Both {{females and}} <b>males</b> <b>are</b> a light grey. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} with {{a black and white}} face.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, a lone male {{sea otter}} took up {{residence}} at Simpson Reef off of Cape Arago for six months. This <b>male</b> <b>is</b> thought to have originated from a colony in Washington, but disappeared after a coastal storm.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, {{and less}} {{white in the}} tail feathers. They can also be {{distinguished}} by their constant begging calls. It {{is not possible to}} tell the sexes apart until the male's bill begins to darken. This begins when the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> around one year old, and is complete some time after two years of age.|$|E
5|$|R. r. tristis (Pleske, 1892). Breeds in China and Central Asia, {{wintering}} {{in northeastern}} Afghanistan. Records of this race from Ladakh claimed by Meinertzhagen {{are considered to}} be fraudulent. It is distinctive, with the black edges to the crest largely absent. The crown of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> yellower than in other forms, and the underparts are much duller and greyer.|$|E
50|$|Maximum {{total length}} for <b>males</b> <b>is</b> 671 mm; for females, 650 mm. Maximum tail length for <b>males</b> <b>is</b> 125 mm; for females, 115 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} of the <b>males</b> <b>is</b> 10-14 mm. Females <b>are</b> wingless. Adult <b>males</b> <b>are</b> on wing {{from the}} beginning of April to the end of March.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Males</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished}} from females {{by the absence}} of an ovipositor. At the end of the abdomen there are simply two cerci. Unlike females, however, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> able to produce sounds or chirps. Thus, <b>males</b> can <b>be</b> identified through sound while females cannot.|$|R
5|$|The {{body of the}} <b>male</b> <b>is</b> black, {{except for}} the orange middle part of the abdomen. The wings are yellowish-translucent and the {{antennae}} are black. The front pair of legs have a yellowish-orange colour, the back pair is heavily thickened and is coloured black on the posterior splint and tarsus, while the femur is orange.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} <b>male</b> <b>is</b> bright russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts {{from its}} crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E
50|$|In size, {{elephant}} beetles {{range between}} 7 and 12 cm (2.75-4.75 in); <b>males</b> <b>are</b> sometimes even bigger. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> around 2 to 3 times {{bigger than the}} females.|$|R
50|$|As of 2011 India Census, Aripanthan has a total {{population}} of 5,268, out of which <b>males</b> <b>are</b> 2,739 and females are 2,529 in number. Total population in {{the age group of}} 0-6 years is 1,044, out of which <b>males</b> <b>are</b> 606 and females 438 in number. As of 2011 census Aripanthan has total 899 family residing. Number of literates as per census is 2772 out of which <b>males</b> <b>are</b> 1,636 and females 1136 in number.Total number of illiterates is 2,496, out of which <b>males</b> <b>are</b> 1,103 and females are1,393 in number.|$|R
25|$|Social insect <b>males</b> <b>are</b> {{often seen}} as mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males {{encounter}} costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of energy investment. Therefore, P. dominula <b>males</b> <b>are</b> able to recognize female castes and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While <b>males</b> <b>are</b> able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes. Therefore, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> not able to evaluate the true reproductive potential of the females they encounter.|$|R
5|$|The {{idiosoma}} of the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> 450 to 480μm {{long and}} 270 to 300μm wide, the dorsal shield is 440 to 475 by 250 to 270μm, and the holoventral shield is 360 to 395μm and 189 to 207μm wide.|$|E
5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> a vibrant yellow {{in the summer and}} an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{breeding}} <b>male</b> <b>is</b> mostly a deep shade of chestnut in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding <b>male</b> <b>is</b> not easily confused {{with any other}} birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones {{on the cutting edge of}} the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} the predation sex rate, the consumption rate of ten <b>males</b> <b>was</b> estimated {{under the same}} conditions, and to calculate the female daily consumption rate, the daily predation rate of <b>males</b> <b>was</b> subtracted from the average predation rate of the pairs. During {{the first week of}} the experiment, each dead <b>male</b> <b>was</b> replaced by an alive individual (Farhadi et al. 2011).|$|R
50|$|Major Mitchell {{females and}} <b>males</b> <b>are</b> almost identical. The <b>males</b> <b>are</b> usually bigger. The female has a broader yellow stripe {{on the crest}} and develop a red eye when mature.|$|R
50|$|Characteristics of {{offenders}} {{vary from}} the average for specific types of crimes and specific crimes. In terms of violent crime by gender, in 2011, 80.4% of arrested persons <b>were</b> <b>male</b> and 19.6% <b>were</b> female. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> 88.2% of those arrested for homicide, while females were 11.8%. Among those arrested for rape in 2011, <b>males</b> <b>were</b> 98.8% and females were 1.2%. For property crime in 2011, 62.9% of arrested persons <b>were</b> <b>male</b> and 37.1% <b>were</b> female.|$|R
5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> more wary of human contact.|$|E
5|$|Although the American white ibis is {{predominantly}} monogamous and both sexes provide parental care to their young, the male often flies off {{to engage in}} extra-pair copulation with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner. These extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations, and make up about 45% of all total matings, although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful. By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> able to increase its reproductive success considerably. Although females are receptive towards extra-pair copulations, male mate-guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra-pair copulations by other males.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Male</b> {{homosexuality}} <b>is</b> {{illegal in}} the Cook Islands. Consensual <b>male</b> sodomy <b>is</b> punishable {{by up to}} seven years' imprisonment, while indecency between <b>males</b> <b>is</b> punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|According to Census 2001, Desuri has a {{population}} of 5,787, where <b>male</b> <b>are</b> 3,050 and female are 2,737. While Rohat tehsil population <b>is</b> 102,599, where <b>male</b> <b>are</b> 52,215 and female are 50,384.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} Platysaurus exhibit sexual dimorphism. Females and juveniles often have black or brown backs with white stripes, while <b>males</b> <b>are</b> much more colored. Also, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> {{somewhat}} larger than females.|$|R
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked <b>male</b> <b>is</b> interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the <b>male</b> <b>is</b> feeding her.|$|E
5|$|If a <b>male</b> <b>is</b> interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5000|$|Male {{circumcision}} [...] "would have greatest impact" [...] {{in countries}} where the HIV infection rate among heterosexual <b>males</b> <b>is</b> greater than 15 percent and fewer than 20 percent of <b>males</b> <b>are</b> circumcised.|$|R
50|$|By fifteen, 38% {{of females}} and 38% of <b>males</b> <b>are</b> sexually active. There are no {{markedly}} differences between gender compared to Greenland and Romania. In Greenland, 71% females and 46% <b>males</b> <b>are</b> sexually active, and in Romania, 17% females and 48% <b>males</b> <b>are</b> sexually active. Schools provide sex education, {{including the use}} of contraceptives. Sex education includes a visit to a family planning clinic.|$|R
50|$|Males {{found in}} Polybia emaciata nests are usually very young, which {{suggests}} that they are just coming into adulthood when they mate and then eventually leave the nest. During the reproductive time period in the nest all <b>males</b> <b>are</b> very young, {{which suggests that}} the older males have gone elsewhere and that these <b>males</b> <b>were</b> born in the nest. <b>Males</b> will <b>be</b> produced only when the number of queens in the nest <b>is</b> low. Therefore, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> produced during reproductive times.|$|R
