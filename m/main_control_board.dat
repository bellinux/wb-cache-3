40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} development of seismic detectors {{over the last}} 80 years. However, {{there is still a}} need to further develop new earthquake exploration and data acquisition systems with high precision. In particular, for China {{to keep up with the}} latest technology of these systems, it is important to be involved in the research and development, instead of importing systems that soon fall behind the latest technology. In this study, the features of system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) technology are analyzed and used to design a new digital seismic-data acquisition station. The hardware circuit of the station was developed, and the analog <b>board</b> and the <b>main</b> <b>control</b> data-transmission <b>board</b> were designed according to the needs of digital seismic-data acquisition stations. High-definition analog-to-digital converter sequential digital filter technology of the station (cascade integrator comb filter, finite impulse response digital filter) were incorporated to provide advantages to the acquisition station, such as high definition, large dynamic scope, and low noise. A specific data-transmission protocol was designed for the station, which ensured a transmission speed of 16 Mbps along a 55 -m wire with low power consumption. Synchronic acquisition was researched and developed, so as to achieve accuracy better than 200 ns. The key technologies were integrated into the SoPC of the <b>main</b> <b>control</b> data-transmission <b>board,</b> so as to ensure high-resolution acquisition of the station, while improving the accuracy of the synchronic acquisition and data-transmission speed, lowering the power consumption, and preparing for the follow-up efforts to tape out. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the advantages of simultaneous utilization of photovoltaic and wind electricity in an autonomous system, supplying the household with electricity without connection to the electrical grid. The most used methods of connecting photovoltaic modules and wind generators to chemical batteries are discussed. Several {{maximum power point tracking}} methods and their properties are described. A block schematic diagram of an autonomous off-grid system utilizing chemical accumulators is proposed. The system also contains an inverter producing standard mains voltage 230 VAC to supply common household appliances. A Quasi-Square Wave converter topology was chosen for all three power converters. An experimental 180 W output power QSW converter with one controllable switch was designed, simulated with Pspice, manufactured and tested to verify the efficiency of the topology. Excellent agreement was found between predicted and measured efficiency at full output power. Efficiency for reliable operation varies between 89 % and 92, 2 % at full power and depends mainly power inductor and MOSFET used. After successful evaluation of QSW topology, the power converters for the main system were designed. Because of higher power, the converters were designed as four-phase, whereas each phase contains two controllable switches to boost efficiency mainly in low-power area. The most critical and difficult part of the project was to design the mixed-signal control sections for the converters to ensure proper switching of two controllable MOSFETs in each phase.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a control hardware and software for a nano-fiber electro-spinning system. The hardware consists of motor driver boards, a high DC voltage board, and a <b>main</b> <b>control</b> <b>board.</b> The user interface software on PC is developed using Visual Studio C # 2010 express edition. The motor driver boards are controlled by an ATmega 8 microcontroller IC, while the main board is controlled by an ATmega 128 microcontroller IC. Communication between the main board and the motor driver boards uses the inter integrated circuit (I 2 C), while communication between PC and the main board uses a serial communication at a baud rate of 9, 600 bps. The high DC voltage generator is designed to have an output of 0 - 25 kV. High DC voltage output is configurable by giving a combination of low logic and high impedance into a six bit input. The result show that maximum output of high DC voltage is 25. 025 kV with formula of curve is y = 1 x – 0. 0244 with R 2 = 0. 9998 and PC software interface can work very well. Polymer flow rate can be configured from PC interface software via I 2 C connected to the main board. The flow rate y follows the RPM setting x, according to the formula y = 0. 954 x – 0. 0099 with R 2 = 1. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) for morphology analysis of PVDF copolymer composite nano-fiber shows that the average diameter of the resulted fiber is 136. 43 nm, when output high DC voltage is set to 15 kV and speed of syringe pump is set to 5 RPM.    </div...|$|E
