25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, <b>Margaret</b> <b>Carlson,</b> Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

Jackson Jr. {{was the last of}} the five children to speak and introduced his father with the words [...] "a man who fights against the odds, who lives against the odds, our dad, Jesse Jackson." [...] At the time, in Time magazine, <b>Margaret</b> <b>Carlson</b> depicted the younger Jackson as a well-spoken and compelling personality who would likely carry any of his father's political aspirations that his father was unable to achieve himself. [...] His experience with the DNC gave him the opportunity to work on numerous congressional election races. After the convention he also became a vice president of Operation PUSH.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the Senate Ethics Committee conclusions. Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, which had initially demanded the investigation, thought {{the treatment of the}} senators far too lenient, and said, [...] " [...] action by the Senate Ethics Committee is a cop-out and a damning indictment of the committee," [...] and [...] "The U.S. Senate remains on the auction block to the Charles Keatings of the world." [...] Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, called it a [...] "whitewash". Jonathan Alter of Newsweek said it was a classic case of the government trying to investigate itself, labeling the Senate Ethics Committee [...] "shameless" [...] for having [...] "let four of the infamous Keating Five off with a wrist tap." [...] The New York Times ran several editorials criticizing the Ethics Committee for having let the senators off lightly. <b>Margaret</b> <b>Carlson</b> of Time suspected the committee had timed its first report to coincide with the run-up to the Gulf War, minimizing its news impact. One of the San Francisco bank regulators felt that McCain had gotten off too lightly, saying that Keating's business involvement with Cindy McCain was an obvious conflict of interest.|$|E
