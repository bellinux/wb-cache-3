40|$|We {{consider}} {{the control of}} a manufacturing system executing single-product remanufacturing operations in a close-loop system. In this paper, the remanufacturing resources respond to planned demand executed {{at the end of}} the expected life of each individual equipment and unplanned demand triggered by a major equipment failure. Remanufacturing operations for planned demands can be executed at different rates, which referred to different component replacement and repair strategies. The system objective is to define the remanufacturing rate as a function of the serviceable equipment inventory level that minimizes the repair and inventory/shortage cost over an infinite horizon. The proposed policy, called <b>multiple</b> <b>hedging</b> point policy (MHPP), is described by two thresholds related to two accelerated repair rates. To determine the parameters of the control policy, and hence, to achieve a close approximation of the optimal repair policy, an experimental approach based on design of experiment, simulation modeling and response surface methodology is used. Our results show that the optimal cost incurred under the developed control policy is lower than that incurred under the classical hedging point policy (HPP). ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{combining}} <b>multiple</b> <b>hedge</b> fund alpha streams yields diversification benefits to the resultant portfolio. Additionally, crossing trades between different alpha streams reduces transaction costs. As the number of alpha streams increases, the relative turnover of the portfolio decreases as more trades are crossed. However, we argue, under reasonable assumptions, that as the number of alphas increases, the turnover does not decrease indefinitely; instead, the turnover approaches a non-vanishing limit related to the correlation structure of the portfolio's alphas. We also point out that, more generally, computational simplifications can arise when the number of alphas is large. Comment: 19 pages; expanded versio...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{diversification}} benefits {{of increasing the}} number of hedge funds in an investment portfolio. Conventional wisdom suggests that investors should construct a portfolio of 20 to 30 hedge funds in order to achieve a reasonably low portfolio variance. We show using Monte Carlo simulations that the marginal benefit of including an additional hedge fund in a fund portfolio diminishes significantly once the number of hedge funds increases beyond ten. Specifically, the annualized standard deviation of a fund portfolio diminishes from 16. 55 percent to 7. 40 percent as we increase the number of funds from one to ten. However, the standard deviation only drops by an additional 0. 55 percent when we increase the number of funds to 15. Investors can crimp portfolio variance further by spreading their capital judiciously across <b>multiple</b> <b>hedge</b> fund strategies. These findings are especially relevant for investors who are transiting from indirect investments via funds of hedge funds to direct investments in single-manager hedge funds...|$|E
40|$|Alternate Models for Forecasting Hedge Fund Returns Michael Holden Faculty Sponsor: Gordon Dash, Finance and Decision Sciences Investors {{have always}} wanted to improve the {{efficiency}} of modeling realized volatility to maximize directional trading returns and substantially improve profitability. As proposed, this honors project will provide evidence from hedge fund returns that a Radial-Basis Function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN), specifically the Kajiji- 4 RBF-ANN dominates other forecast methods in producing one-period ahead change-of-direction when forecasting the expected returns of various hedge fund indexes. I began this project by collecting historical economic data in monthly increments to serve as the dependent variables. The primary independent variable used in this study are two types of Treasury securities (short-term and long-term) to represent interest rates as well as the Volatility Index (VIX). The VIX index serves as a proxy for options implied volatility in the equity markets. These independent variables are used to predict the returns of <b>multiple</b> <b>hedge</b> fund indexes which serve as the dependent variables. The data was plugged into the RBF-ANN in order to solve the economic models. The ANN first took time to train using 33 % of the data, and then it validated the remaining 67 % of the data to measure the fitness. The study proceeded to calculate the residual by taking the difference of the actual data and the RBF-ANN predicted data. The RBF-ANN showed that the data was very fit as the mean square error (MSE) was relatively small. Overall, I have found that the RBF-ANN has done quite well in predicting the returns of various hedge fund indexes. The scope of the project will examine three well-known hedge fund styles...|$|E

40|$|Vetiver {{grass is}} a {{sustainable}} and innovative {{solution for the}} protection of banks. It is shown that Vetiver grass is able to establish a full-stop of bank erosion caused by rapid drawdown. Therefore it provides us with strong indications that it is highly suitable as an anti-erosion measure. A combination of cohesive soil and Vetiver grass provides the best protection against erosion, which implies that it is highly suitable for banks in delta areas, which consist pre-dominantly of cohesive soil. A single hedge of Vetiver grass planted on the outer slope of a dike can reduce the wave run-up volume by 55 %, in contrary with sod-forming grasses that give no reduction. Planting <b>multiple</b> <b>hedges</b> along the contour of the outer slope might result in even more reduction. The application of Vetiver grass on existing dikes may provide a substantial reinforcement of these dikes. The advantages of Vetiver grass above conventional methods with the use of stone are numerous: Â· Vetiver grass is sustainable. Vetiver hedges of over 100 years old have been found. Vetiver grass is not invasive and no significant diseases are known. Vetiver grass will, in contrary with traditional methods, increase in strength in time. Â· Vetiver grass is an economic attractive solution. In most countries in South-East Asia Vetiver grass can be planted for less than $ 3 per meter, while solutions consisting of stone and concrete are expensive in delta areas. Vetiver grass allows people to protect their own property. Since the costs are low and it is easy to use local initiatives can be easily achieved.

40|$|Chapter 1 compares and {{contrasts}} the activism {{styles and}} outcomes of hedge-fund activists versus traditional institutional activists {{in an attempt}} to understand what drives the returns of institutional activism. Contrary to the popular belief that hedge-fund activism is designed to achieve a short-term payoff at the expense of long-term profitability, I find some evidence consistent with the hypothesis that hedge-fund activists can be effective monitors, especially when <b>multiple</b> <b>hedge</b> funds collaborate on the monitoring efforts. This result is supported by examining the relations between the holdings by different types of hedge-fund activists and the outcomes of proposed M 2 Ì 6 A deals, such as acquirer announcement-period CARs, buy-and-hold abnormal returns, acquirer long-run operating performance, means of financing, deal status, and deal attitude. On the other hand, hedge funds that carry out individualistic activism efforts don 2 Ì 7 t appear to exert effective monitoring efforts in the context of M 2 Ì 6 As. Concurring with the previous studies on pension-fund activism, this paper finds that traditional institutional activists, as represented by activist pension funds and several activist mutual funds, tend to be effective monitors of M 2 Ì 6 A acquirers. Additionally, cross-holding analysis of the two groups of institutional activists (hedge funds vs. non-hedge funds) provides further evidence corroborative of the hypothesis that cross-holding activists who realize gains in both acquirers and targets tend to be effective monitors at the first place. Chapter 2 examines an expanded version of acquisition probability hypothesis proposed by Song and Walkling (2000). In contrast to the previous papers that find positive rival announcement-period abnormal returns, I find only rivals associated with value-creating deals experience positive announcement-period abnormal returns. In addition to studying the announcement-period abnormal returns, I also analyze the extent of impact on rivals around deal terminations and deal completions. The results show that rivals that experience higher announcement-period abnormal returns also tend to experience higher termination-period and completion-period returns, consistent with the predictions of the acquisition probability hypothesis. More direct tests of the hypothesis confirm that the rival announcement-period CARs are positively and significantly associated with the predicted probability of rivals becoming subsequent targets, and thus providing direct evidence corroborative of the acquisition probability hypothesis. Chapter 3 studies the impact of CalPERS Focus List (CFL) program have on bondholders 2 Ì 7 wealth. In contrast to the extant research documenting positive abnormal returns to shareholders of the firms subject to pension fund activism, I find that CalPERS Focus List (CFL) program significantly reduces existing bondholders 2 Ì 7 wealth.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} two main issues. First we study {{crude oil prices}} in view of weak-form efficiency. Thereupon we look into {{different}} hedging strategies {{that could be used}} to stabilize income in a market with high volatility. The data used are crude oil prices of West Texas Intermediate between 1987 and 2010. We conclude that the spot crude price and the 3 month future price for the same oil type are weak-form efficient. The two prices tend towards a long-run equilibrium and differences in prices are quickly adjusted. OPECâs role in the market is discussed as a weakness to price efficiency. Based on efficient prices, we find that the minimum variance hedging method gives the lowest risk, but a naive hedge ratio is easiest to implement in a business strategy for a risk averse management. On the other hand, a risk neutral oil company would get a higher added return by merely buy and sell in the spot market. By introducing a <b>multiple</b> risks <b>hedging</b> model consisting of price risk and exchange rate risk, we suggest that a Norwegian company could reduce its total risk of the portfolio by increasing its exposure in the currency market...|$|R

40|$|When hedging {{longevity}} risk with standardized contracts, the hedger needs to calibrate the hedge carefully {{so that it}} can effectively reduce the risk. In this article, we present a calibration method that is based on matching mortality rate sensitivities. Specifically, we introduce a measure called key q-duration, which allows us to estimate the price sensitivity of a life-contingent liability to each portion of the underlying mortality curve. Given this measure, one can easily construct a longevity hedge with a handful of mortality forwards. Our empirical results indicate that using key q-durations, a hedge effectiveness of more than 97 % can be attained with only five mortaltiy forwards. We also investigate other important issues that are related to standardized longevity hedges, including the adaptation needed for <b>hedging</b> <b>multiple</b> birth cohorts, and the quantification of sampling risk and basis risk...|$|R
40|$|The classic {{prescription}} for hedging the market {{risk associated with}} derivatives positions is to restrict the possible process dynamics sufficiently so that the payoff can be spanned by (completely) dynamic trading in the underlying asset(s). This approach introduces model risk. â¢ We explore alternative strategies for hedging claims written on the price path of a single underlying asset. â¢ When many derivatives trade on the same underlying assetâs price path, there can be <b>multiple</b> perfect <b>hedges</b> under the restricted process dynamics. â¢ We find that for some claims, some of these alternative hedges succeed when the restrictions are lifted. 3 Robust Hedging â¢ A robust hedge strategy is one that theoretically works for a wide class of models. â¢ For example, PCP implies that {{the sale of a}} European call can be robustly hedged by buying the underlying stock on margin and also buying the right put. â¢ As the example shows, robust hedging strategies typically work only for a small class of claims being hedged. Also, they succeed even under stochastic volatility and jumps. In fact, they succeed even though volatility of volatility and the jump arrival rates are unknown. Hence, model risk is largely overcome. â¢ There may need to be some restrictions on the stochastic process for the underlying asset price. For example, a long forward position can be robustly replicated by buying and borrowing only by assuming that dividends are suitably restricted. â¢ Robust hedging strategies {{may or may not be}} (fully) dynamic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on strategic capacity management concerned with determining the sizes, types, and timing of capacity investments and adjustments under uncertainty. Specific attention is given to recent developments to incorporate multiple decision makers, <b>multiple</b> capacity types, <b>hedging,</b> and risk aversion. Capacity {{is a measure of}} processing abilities and limitations and is represented as a vector of stocks of various processing resources, while investment is the change of capacity and includes expansion and contraction. After discussing general issues in capacity investment problems, the paper reviews models of capacity investment under uncertainty in three settings: The first reviews optimal capacity investment by single and multiple risk-neutral decision makers in a stationary environment where capacity remains constant. Allowing for multiple capacity types, the associated optimal capacity portfolio specifies the amounts and locations of safety capacity in a processing network. Its key feature is that it is unbalanced; i. e., regardless of how uncertainties are realized, one typically will never fully utilize all capacities. The second setting reviews the adjustment of capacity over time and the structure of optimal investment dynamics. The paper ends by reviewing how to incorporate risk aversion in capacity investment and contrasts hedging strategies involving financial versus operational means.
