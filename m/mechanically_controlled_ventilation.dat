40|$|Five {{cases of}} {{awareness}} {{have been identified}} during total i. v. anaesthesia with <b>mechanically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> and neuromuscular block. Two of the cases resulted from inability to deliver the target dose of anaesthetics, while the patient's need for anaesthetics was greater than anticipated in three. It is concluded that all cases were caused primarily by lack of experience, and could have been prevented. These five cases occurred in experience from approximately 2500 patients anaesthetized with this technique.

40|$|International audienceAfter {{several cases}} of health {{problems}} in French schools, a methodology for health risk assessment related to indoor air quality (IAQ) was required. Based on measured concentrations in schools where acute symptoms possibly due to exposure to airborne sensory irritants were reported, an index quantifying the sensory irritation potential was built and used. This paper focuses on one classroom where the index was successively applied without any ventilation system, after the implementation of passive ventilation grids and with a <b>mechanically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The decrease of the index value was correlated with an improved IAQ perception by pupils and teachers since no complaint occurred any longer.

40|$|The {{fraction}} of fresh gas flow useful for gas exchange during mechanically controlled venti-lation in partial rebreathing systems {{is equal to}} alveolar ventilation (Conway, 1976). This is, however, difficult to estimate in clinical practice. Non-alveolar rebreathing affects only deadspace and {{is not likely to}} affect end-tidal or arterial carbon dioxide tensions. If, on the other hand, alveolar rebreathing occurs, the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension increases. During <b>mechanically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> in T-piece systems the {{fraction of}} fresh gas flow that participates in gas exchange varies with minute ventilation (FE) and with fresh gas flow (FGF) (Nightingale, Richards and Glass, 1965; Conway, 1976; Rose and Froese, 1979). Froese and Rose (1982) made recommendations for FGF and VE designed to produce predictable arterial carbon dioxide tensions in children weighing between 10 and 30 kg. In order to evaluate the degree of alveolar rebreathing at different FGF in infants and young children ventilated in a partial rebreathing system, and to test the recommendations made by Froese and Rose (1982), inspired and end-tidal car-bon dioxide tensions were measured at different fresh gas flow settings and at various in-spiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratios. Minute venti-lation and ventilatory rate were kept constant throughout the study...|$|E

Eleven animals (b. w. 25 - 30 kg) were investigated under balanced anesthesia. <b>Ventilation</b> was <b>mechanically</b> <b>controlled.</b> Hemodynamics, pulmonary <b>ventilation,</b> and gas exchange were serially recorded. Seven animals were pretreated with 40 % ethanol in saline and four with saline only. Ninety {{minutes after the}} ingestion of alcohol or saline, the animals were subjected to a standardized soft-tissue trauma. Cardiac output decreased significantly 2 minutes after trauma and remained low in both groups throughout the observation period of 30 minutes. Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly increased in the alcohol-pretreated group but was virtually unchanged in the control animals. Systemic vascular resistance was similarly reduced in the two groups. Total compliance was somewhat lower in alcohol-pretreated animals and 10 minutes after the trauma arterial oxygen tension was significantly lower in the alcohol group than in control animals. Carbon dioxide elimination was reduced after trauma in both groups. It is concluded that pulmonary vascular response increased and that total pulmonary compliance is somewhat decreased shortly after trauma in the alcohol group while gas exchange is almost unchanged. The results indicate a negative interaction between alcohol and traum...|$|R
40|$|Pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>{{ventilation}}</b> is {{a common}} mode of ventilation used to manage both adult and pediatric populations. However, {{there is very little}} evidence that distinguishes the efficacy of pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> over that of volume <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> in the adult population.

This report aimed at describing a case of anaesthesia for EXIT in a fetus with cervical teratoma. A 30 -year-old woman, 70 kg, 160 cm, gravida 2, para 1, was followed because of polyhydramniosis diagnosed at 24 weeks′ gestation. During a routine ultrasonographic examination at 35 weeks′ gestation, it was noticed that the fetus had a tumoral mass on the anterior neck, the mass had cystic and calcified components and with a size of was 10 x 6 x 5 cm. The patient with physical status ASA I, was submitted to caesarean section under general anaesthesia with <b>mechanically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> for exutero intrapartum treatment (EXIT). Anaesthesia was induced in rapid sequence with fentanyl, propofol and rocuronium and was maintained with isoflurane in 2. 5 at 3 % in O 2 and N 2 O (50 %). After hysterotomy, fetus was partially released assuring uterus-placental circulation, followed by fetal laryngoscopy and tracheal intuba-tion. The infant was intubated with an uncuffed, size 2. 5 endotracheal tube. Excision of the mass was performed under general anaesthesia. After surgical intervention, on the fourth postoperative day, the infant was extubated and the newborn was discharged to the pediatric neonatal unit and on the seventh day postoperatively to home without complications. Major recommendations for EXIT are maternal-fetal safety, uterine relaxation to maintain uterine volume and uterus-placental circulation, and fetal immobility to help airway handling.

40|$|Occupant's {{behavioural}} patterns {{determine a}} significant level of uncertainty in building energy performance evaluation. It {{is difficult to}} account for this uncertainty in the design phase when operational and occupancy profiles are unknown. The relevant “performance gap” usually encountered between simulated and measured energy performance is clearly connected to biased assumptions in modeling, especially in the initial design phase. A probabilistic modeling approach is proposed to improve simulation reliability and robustness with respect to variability in occupancy patterns. The case study presented is the eLUX lab of the “Smart Campus” of Brescia University in Italy. Occupancy dependent input parameters such as air change rates (i. e. <b>mechanically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation)</b> and internal heat gains (i. e. due to people, lighting and appliances) are described by means of probability distributions to obtain probabilistic thermal demand and load profiles as output. Probabilistic results enables a more reliable identification of energy saving strategies (operational and environmental settings) with respect to highly variable operating conditions. Further, simulation data are processed to obtain a weather-adjusted energy demand visualization, suitable for establishing a continuity between modeling in design and operation phases, with calibration purpose. Calibrated energy models {{can be used for}} several specific tasks in the operation phase, in particular condition monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis, supervisory control and energy management. For the case study presented, a detailed data acquisition scheme has been designed to enable an effective monitoring activity in the operation phase, aimed at experimenting model-based approaches for the tasks reported. The proposed research is the point-of-departure for a general activity aimed at assessing critically the issues of reliability and robustness of simulation results obtained with conventional modeling approaches, in particular with respect to occupants’ behaviour, exploiting {{at the same time the}} possibility of using measured data as a direct feedback to promote behavioural change. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} summarizes {{a research}} effort on demand <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> and classroom ventilation. The research on demand <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> included field studies and building energy modeling. Major findings included: ?	The single-location carbon dioxide sensors widely used for demand <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> frequently have large errors and {{will fail to}} effectively <b>control</b> <b>ventilation</b> rates (VRs). ?	Multi-location carbon dioxide measurement systems with more expensive sensors connected to multi-location sampling systems may measure carbon dioxide more accurately. ?	Currently-available optical people counting systems work well {{much of the time}} but have large counting errors in some situations. ?	In meeting rooms, measurements of carbon dioxide at return-air grilles appear to be a better choice than wall-mounted sensors. ?	In California, demand <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> in general office spaces is projected to save significant energy and be cost effective only if typical VRs without demand <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> are very high relative to VRs in codes. Based on the research, several recommendations were developed for demand <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> specifications in the California Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards. The research on classroom ventilation collected data over two years on California elementary school classrooms to investigate associations between VRs and student illness absence (IA). Major findings included: ?	Median classroom VRs in all studied climate zones were below the California guideline, and 40 percent lower in portable than permanent buildings. ?	Overall, one additional L/s per person of VR was associated with 1. 6 percent less IA. ?	Increasing average VRs in California K- 12 classrooms from the current average to the required level is estimated to decrease IA by 3. 4 percent, increasing State attendance-based funding to school districts by $ 33 M, with $ 6. 2 M in increased energy costs. Further VR increases would provide additional benefits. ?	Confirming these findings in intervention studies is recommended. ?

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> (PCV) is {{available}} in anesthesia machines, {{but there are no}} studies on its use during CO 2 pneumoperitoneum (CPP). This study aimed at evaluating pressure-controlled ventilation and hemodynamic and ventilatory changes during CPP, as compared to conventional volume <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> (VCV). METHODS: This study involved 16 dogs anesthetized with thiopental, fentanyl and pancuronium, which were randomly assigned to two groups: VC - volume <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> (n= 8) and PC - pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> (n= 8). Hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters were monitored and recorded in 4 moments: M 1 (before CPP), M 2 (30 minutes after CPP = 10 mmHg), M 3 (30 minutes after CPP= 15 mmHg) and M 4 (30 minutes after deflation). RESULTS: With CPP, there has been significant increase in tidal volume in PC group; there has been increase in airway pressures (peak and plateau), decrease in compliance with increase in CPP pressure, increase in heart rate, maintenance of mean blood pressure with higher values in the VC group in all stages; there was also increase in right atrium pressure with significant decrease after deflation, decrease in arterial pH with minor variations in PC group, greater arterial pCO 2 stability in PC group, and no significant changes in arterial pO 2. CONCLUSIONS: There were some differences in hemodynamic and ventilatory data between both <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> modes (VC and PC).
