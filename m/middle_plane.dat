5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle near the <b>middle</b> <b>plane</b> of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, {{which in turn}} collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E
500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis. The {{main reasons for}} this disk-like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's {{magnetic field}} lines, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20RJ from the planet. The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the <b>middle</b> <b>plane,</b> approximately near the magnetic equator. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located {{inside and outside the}} core. The physical power density distribution control system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral biological shield tank. The external sensors in the tank are located around the reactor <b>middle</b> <b>plane,</b> therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in {{the central part of the}} core. [...] There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing self-powered detectors. Reactivity meters and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.|$|E

Three paintings of this period that Grabar himself considered seminal (February Glaze, March Snow and Piles of Snow) garnered wide and generally positive critical response. Kazimir Malevich wrote that, {{had it not been for}} linear perspective that Grabar preserved in his March Snow [...] "as a remnant of narrative from the nineteenth century", the whole picture would blend in [...] "a uniform painterly texture" [...] without clearly defined front and <b>middle</b> <b>planes.</b> In 1905 Grabar travelled to Paris to study the new works of French postimpressionists and changed his technique in favor of complete separation of colours.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in the compressive and tensile strengths of graphite-epoxy laminates with thickness discontinuities due to dropped plies was studied by experiment and analysis. The specimens were fabricated with all the dropped plies lumped together {{in the center of}} a sixteen-ply quasi-isotropic layup, such that one surface was flat and the slope of the opposite surface changed abruptly at the dropped ply location to accommodate the thickness change. Even though the thick and thin sections are symmetrically laminated, there exists bending-extension coupling due to the geometric eccentricity of the <b>middle</b> <b>planes</b> of the thick and thin sections. Experiments were conducted on fifty-four specimens that differed in the configuration of the dropped plies only. The strength of a laminate with dropped plies is less than the strength of its thin section, and the compressive strength of a laminate with dropped plies is less than its tensile strength. The {{reduction in}} strength is directly related to the axial stiffness change between the thick and thin sections. To examine the mechanism of failure, the three-dimensional state of stress in the dropped ply region was evaluated by the finite element method. A tensile interlaminar criterion predicted the correct location of failure, but underestimated the failure load...|$|R

40|$|Two {{versions}} of the asymptotic method, which enables the initial problem to {{be broken down into}} two simpler problems which can be solved using the classical theory of plates, are considered for solving problems in the theory of three-layer plates in the formulation previously proposed (VOLOKH K. Yu., A theoretical-experimental investigation and optimization of three-layer plates supported at points. Candi-date dissertation, Moscow, 1991). These methods are used for a static and dynamic analysis of a rectangular three-layer plate supported on hinges along the contour. Estimates are obtained for the errors of the approximate solutions obtained after an arbitrary number of iterations. 1. THE EQUATIONS of equilibrium in displacements and the natural boundary conditions of the theory of three-layer plates with a rigid filler that is uncompressed in a transverse direction were obtained by the author using the well-known broken-line hypothesis [l] and Lagrange’s variational principle. For a mainly bending deformation arranged symmetrically over the thickness of a three-layer plate for tangential displacements of the <b>middle</b> <b>planes</b> of the outer bearing layers (i = 1, 2) it is necessary to put u 1 =-u 2 = u and u 1 =- u 2 = u; there are no tangential surface and external contour forces; Et = E 2 = E, q = vz = v, hI = h 2 = h, where Ei are the moduli of elasticity, vi are Poisson’s ratios and hi are the thicknesses of the outer layers.

To evaluate the quality of spectral fitting of the (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio of a prostate phantom using MRSI at different field strengths and various coils. Experiments were using 1. 5 -T and 3. 0 -T MR systems. Measurements were taken on a homemade prostate phantom with different coils: spinal array; abdominal array; and endorectal. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of choline, creatine, and citrate peaks {{as well as the}} (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio in each voxel were compared among groups using multi-way analysis of variance. Magnetic field strength, coils, and plane position had a significant effect on the SNR or (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio, and there were interactions among groups (all P[*]=[*] 0. 000). The 1. 5 -T (0. 228 [*]±[*] 0. 044) exhibited a higher (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio than the 3. 0 -T (0. 125 [*]±[*] 0. 041) magnetic field strength (F[*]=[*] 3238, P[*]=[*] 0. 000).
