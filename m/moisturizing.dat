2500|$|The lack of hair {{leads to}} a {{reputation}} for being clean, for being easy to wash with a sponge, and for a natural lack of fleas or other parasites. They also do not cause typical allergic reactions to dog-sensitive humans because they lack the normal dog dander. [...] Despite this, the dog needs care, but in another way. The skin should be washed {{from time to time to}} remove dirt and prevent clogging of pores. Baby cleaners are a good choice provided that they do not contain lanolin. Some dogs are prone to have acne or at least blackheads. The skin sometimes becomes too dry and can then be treated with <b>moisturizing</b> cream. Again, baby lotion without lanolin is a good product choice to soften and moisturize cleansed skin. [...] The dogs themselves seem to prefer olive, vegetable or coconut oil, possibly because of the perfumes and other chemicals found in commercial <b>moisturizing</b> creams.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, perfumed soaps {{were offered}} as gifts in Europe {{and as a}} result, handiwork {{developed}} in Tripoli.

2500|$|Hemp {{is used to}} make {{a variety}} of {{commercial}} and industrial products including rope, clothes, food, paper, textiles, plastics, insulation and biofuel. The bast fibers {{can be used to make}} textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other organic fibers such as flax, cotton or silk, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as [...] "drying"), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a <b>moisturizing</b> agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed.|$|E

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a <b>moisturizing</b> agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the keys}} to {{treatment}} and prevention involves keeping the skin <b>moisturized.</b> Lotions, creams, and bath oils may help prevent an outbreak.

More severe cases sometimes respond to ultraviolet light treatment.|$|R
