6000|$|The social compact thus made is {{essentially}} {{different from the}} social compact which Hobbes described as the origin {{of what he calls}} commonwealths by institution, to distinguish them from commonwealths by acquisition, that is to say, states formed by conquest or resting on hereditary rule. [...] "A commonwealth," [...] Hobbes says, [...] "is said to be instituted when a multitude of men do agree and covenant, every one with every one, that to whatsoever man or assembly of men shall be given by the major part the right to present the person of them all, that is to say, to be their representative; every one ... shall authorise all the actions and judgments of that man or assembly of men, {{in the same manner as}} if they were his own, to the end to live peaceably among themselves, and be protected against other men."[231] But Rousseau's compact was an act of association among equals, who also remained equals. Hobbes's compact was an act of surrender on the part of the <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> or a number. The first was the constitution of civil society, the second was the erection of a government. As nobody now believes in the existence of any such compact in either one form or the other, it would be superfluous to inquire which of the two is the less inaccurate. All we need do is to point out that there was this difference. Rousseau distinctly denied the existence of any element of contract in the erection of a government; there is only one contract in the state, he said, and it is that of association.[232] Locke's notion of the compact which was the beginning of every political society is indefinite on this point; he speaks of it indifferently as an agreement of a body of free men to unite and incorporate into a society, and an agreement to set up a government.[233] Most of us would suppose the two processes to be as nearly identical as may be; Rousseau drew a distinction, and from this distinction he derived further differences.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{cried the}} Baron, roughly, [...] "I said nothing of ceasing from war. By heaven, no! I will have revenge!" [...] And he clashed his iron foot upon {{the floor and}} {{clinched}} his fists and ground his teeth together. [...] "Listen," [...] said he, [...] "and I will tell thee how my troubles happened. A fortnight ago I rode out upon an expedition against a caravan of fat burghers in the valley of Gruenhoffen. They outnumbered us <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one,</b> but city swine such as they are not of the stuff to stand against our kind for a long time. Nevertheless, while the men-at-arms who guarded the caravan were staying us with pike and cross-bow from behind a tree which they had felled {{in front of a}} high bridge the others had driven the pack-horses off, so that by the time we had forced the bridge they were a league or more away. We pushed after them as hard as we were able, but when we came up with them we found that they had been joined by Baron Frederick of Trutz-Drachen, to whom for three years and more the burghers of Gruenstadt have been paying a tribute for his protection against others. Then again they made a stand, and this time the Baron Frederick himself was with them. But though the dogs fought well, we were forcing them back, and might have got the better of them, had not my horse stumbled upon a sloping stone, and so fell and rolled over upon me. While I lay there with my horse upon me, Baron Frederick ran me down with his lance, and gave me that foul wound that came so near to slaying me--and did slay my dear wife. Nevertheless, my men were able to bring me out from that press and away, and we had bitten the Trutz-Drachen dogs so deep that they were too sore to follow us, and so let us go our way in peace. But when those fools of mine brought me to my castle they bore me lying upon a litter to my wife's chamber. There she beheld me, and, thinking me dead, swooned a death-swoon, so that she only lived long enough to bless her new-born babe and name it Otto, for you, her father's brother. But, by heavens! I will have revenge, root and branch, upon that vile tribe, the Roderburgs of Trutz-Drachen. Their great-grandsire built that castle in scorn of Baron Casper in the old days; their grandsire slew my father's grandsire; Baron Nicholas slew two of our kindred; and now this Baron Frederick gives me that foul wound and kills my dear wife through my body." [...] Here the Baron stopped short; then of a sudden, shaking his fist above his head, he cried out in his hoarse voice: [...] "I swear by all the saints in heaven, either the red cock shall crow over the roof of Trutz-Drachen or else it shall crow over my house! The black dog shall sit on Baron Frederick's shoulders or else he shall sit on mine!" [...] Again he stopped, and fixing his blazing eyes upon the old man, [...] "Hearest thou that, priest?" [...] said he, and broke into a great boisterous laugh.|$|E

50|$|An entity on a {{peer-to-peer}} network {{is a piece}} of software which has access to local resources. An entity advertises itself on the {{peer-to-peer network}} by presenting an identity. More than one identity can correspond to a single entity. In other words, the mapping of identities to entities is <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one.</b> Entities in peer-to-peer networks use multiple identities for purposes of redundancy, resource sharing, reliability and integrity. In peer-to-peer networks, the identity is used as an abstraction so that a remote entity can be aware of identities without necessarily knowing the correspondence of identities to local entities. By default, each distinct identity is usually assumed to correspond to a distinct local entity. In reality, many identities may correspond to the same local entity.|$|E
5000|$|This {{function}} {{is one to}} one in that it assigns exactly one meaning to every Global Role. According to Fodor and Lepore, holistic inferential role semantics leads to the absurd conclusion {{that part of the}} meaning of [...] "brown cow" [...] is constituted by the inference [...] "Brown cow implies dangerous."This is true if the function from meanings to Global Roles is one to one. In this case, in fact, the meanings of [...] "brown", [...] "cow" [...] and [...] "dangerous" [...] all contain the inference [...] "Brown cows are dangerous"!! But this only true if the relation is one to one. Since it is one to one, [...] "brown" [...] would not have the meaning it has unless it had the global role that it has. If we change the relation so that it is <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> (h*), many global roles can share the same meaning. So suppose that the meaning of [...] "brown [...] "is given by M("brown"). It does not follow from this that L("brown", [...] "brown cow", [...] "dangerous") is true unless all of the global roles that h* assigns to M("brown") contain ("brown cow", [...] "dangerous"). And this is not necessary for holism. In fact, with this <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> relation from Global Roles meanings, it is possible to change opinions with respect to an inference consistently. Suppose that B and C initially accept all of the same inferences, speak the same language and they both accept that [...] "brown cows imply dangerous." [...] Suddenly, B changes his mind and rejects the inference. If the function from meanings to Global Role is one to one, then many of B's Global Roles have changed and therefore their meanings. But if there is no one to one assignment, then B's change in belief in the inference about brown cows does not necessarily imply a difference is the meaning of the terms he uses. Therefore, it is not intrinsic to holism that communication or change of opinion is impossible.|$|E
50|$|Another general {{approach}} is primarily associated with Michael Artin. Here {{the idea is}} to start with any object of the kind to be classified and study its deformation theory. This means first constructing infinitesimal deformations, then appealing to prorepresentability theorems to put these together into an object over a formal base. Next an appeal to Grothendieck's formal existence theorem provides an object of the desired kind over a base which is a complete local ring. This object can be approximated via Artin's approximation theorem by an object defined over a finitely generated ring. The spectrum of this latter ring can then be viewed as giving a kind of coordinate chart on the desired moduli space. By gluing together enough of these charts, we can cover the space, but the map from our union of spectra to the moduli space will in general be <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one.</b> We therefore define an equivalence relation on the former; essentially, two points are equivalent if the objects over each are isomorphic. This gives a scheme and an equivalence relation, which is enough to define an algebraic space (actually an algebraic stack if we are being careful) if not always a scheme.|$|E

Starting from the model provided by the French troubadours, they took Italian poetry a step further and inaugurated the volgare illustre, that higher standard of Italian language that survives almost unchanged to the present day. The founder of this school, Guido Guinizzelli, a law professor at Bologna's University wrote the first poem of this kind, a poem whose importance does not so much lie in its literary merits but in outlining what would be the fundamentals of the Stil Novo program, which was further perfected by a second generation of poets, including Dante, Cino da Pistoia, Lapo Gianni, and Guido himself.

5000|$|A Topwater fishing lure {{is a type}} {{of fishing}} lure, usually floating, that may be moved about the surface of water in order to attract and cause fish to attempt to strike the lure. Non-floating {{versions}} may be retrieved at sufficient speed to cause them to travel at the water's surface.Such lures are often designed to resemble smaller creatures that would normally be considered as food for the target fish species. (They are painted to look like the prey of the target species; usually smaller fish, frogs, or insects.) One of the key features of the topwater lure is the [...] "action" [...] that it imparts as it travels along the water's surface. The more effective lures have an action that closely resembles that of the actual living creature. The lure is typically fitted with one of more fish hooks (usually treble hooks) to hook the target fish as it strikes the lure. Variations exist that include internal rattles to generate sound that might be similar to the sounds created by the actual, live creature being emulated. some also include small light sources such as LEDs that might be battery powered. There are also jointed bodies, moving eyes, holographic finishes, etc. all of which are incorporated to encourage the target species to strike the lure. The lure is normally attached {{to the end of a}} fishing line that is attached to a fishing rod and reel and is cast into areas where the target species might be found and [...] "worked" [...] skillfully within that area to encourage strikes. This type of fishing is considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the more exciting methods used to catch fish. A frequent mistake when fishing topwater lures is to initiate the hookset immediately upon seeing the fish strike the lure. In many species, especially bass, it is important to wait a few seconds before initiating the hookset to ensure that the lure is in the best position in the fish's mouth to optimize the chances of a successful hooking. Black bass, spotted seatrout, ladyfish, redfish, bluefish, tarpon, bonefish, barracuda, & pickerel are examples of fish that might be taken by the topwater approach.|$|E
