25|$|All of {{the most}} common types of acro {{footwear}} provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the hard floor. Cushioning serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. Cushioning is especially important when a <b>Marley</b> <b>floor</b> is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.|$|E
40|$|A 4 x 4 {{prototype}} floor sensor {{that employs}} densely arranged force sensing resistors {{has been developed}} to provide real time data of activity. With an active area of 3 x 3 the sensor has 2. 4 inter sensor resolution. The construction consists of an MDO board that houses a controller board and the sensor interconnect wiring, a standard <b>Marley</b> <b>floor</b> top layer {{and a set of}} carefully selected neoprene blocks affixed under a bottom cover layer. The controller board samples the 256 sensors and sends the data through a standard Cat 5 network cable. This cable is the only wire connected to the floor sensor and it provides power and connectivity with Macintosh or Windows computers. A custom GUI that uses National Instruments 3 D graphing components is used for 3 D visualization of the data, and recording and playback of sessions on the Windows platform. An adapter and a sample patch have also been developed to present and manipulate the data using the ubiquitous Max/MSP/Jitter software on the Macintosh platform. Target applications for the device include interactive dance floor, motion capture, gaming, rehabilitation and athletics training...|$|E
50|$|Dance {{performance}} surfaces made of sheet vinyl {{are also}} called dance <b>floors</b> and <b>marley</b> <b>floors.</b> They are called marley-type floors {{from a very}} popular reversible vinyl flooring manufactured for years until about 1978 by <b>Marley</b> <b>Floors</b> Ltd.|$|R

50|$|On September 18, 2006, the New Dance Group officially {{opened the}} doors to a new state-of-the art 21000 sq ft studio located at 305 West 38th Street just west of 8th Avenue. Nearly double {{the size of its}} prior {{location}} (where it had resided for 55 years), New Dance Group's renovated upgrade, led by architect Howard Spivak, included two floors of studios complete with sprung wood or <b>Marley</b> <b>flooring,</b> new pianos, floor to ceiling mirrors, a recording studio and vocal room, sound systems, large dressing rooms, teacher lounge, stretch area, private entrance, art exhibit gallery, merchandise boutique, and two performance spaces complete with raked seating for over 100 people. This space was used for all NDG programming but was also available for rentals.|$|R
5000|$|Marley Homecare {{was a part}} of the Marley Group which {{included}} the Marley Tile Company, Marley Extrusions, Marley Roofing and <b>Marley</b> <b>Floors.</b> Starting initially as Marley Retail Limited, the first High Street shop opened in Southampton in 1959. It was the first company to bring DIY to UK High Streets. The Head Office was situated in South Park, Sevenoaks, close to the manufacturing bases at Lenham and Riverhead. The chain of shops (300 across the UK at its peak), in the 1960s were solely outlets for Marley products; sheet and tile flooring, adhesives, wall ceramics, extruded roofing sheets, rainwater and plumbing goods and carpets from the Marley owned West Of England Carpets. Carpet and hard flooring installation was also provided.|$|R
