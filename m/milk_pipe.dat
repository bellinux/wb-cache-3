40|$|This {{study is}} related to the POM - Measure 2 - Project B 15 “Veterinary {{services}} computerization and technical support to livestock farms”, in which innovative plants solutions has been introduced to recognize the single animal to measure the quantity of produced milk, to centralize and automate the management, in different cow and sheep and goats breedings in Puglia and Basilicata regions. The experimentation has foreseen dynamic tests, during the real milking of the cows, in an apulian plant in which different measurers of the quantity of milk have been installed: weigh jar, electronic weighing “bascule” milk-meter, electronic proportional milk-meter. In a mechanical point of view, the vacuum level and the vacuum fluctuations in three different <b>milk</b> <b>pipe</b> sections have been valued: at short milk tube, downstream from the claw, prior to the milk meter. Comparing the results, authors deduced that the electronic milk-meters, like the electronic proportional milk meter, allows inferior vacuum degree variations and less mechanical solicitations in cow udder; such situation is particularly evident with higher milk flow. The study also underlines that the vacuum drops during milking can be very critical if not immediately compensate with a suitable planning and periodic revision of the plants...|$|E
40|$|In several European {{countries}} {{there is}} a demand that milk producers with automatic milking systems (AMS) must clean the milking system three times a day. Cleaning an AMS reduces possible milking {{time as well as}} consuming considerable amounts of hot water and detergents. Therefore, it is important to acquire greater knowledge during practical conditions to better understand the consequences of less frequent cleaning. This study was carried out on 9 Swedish farms during a period of 16 weeks. Three AMS brands were included in the study with three farms of each brand. The two investigated treatments were cleaning with 8 and 12 hours intervals. Milk quality was analysed for total bacterial count (TBC), coliform count (CC), psychrotrophic count (PC) and thermoduric count (TC). To ensure that milk cooling and cleaning have been done correctly during the sampling period, the temperature was monitored in the <b>milk</b> <b>pipe</b> and in the bulk tank. The difference for TBC was significant (p< 0. 05) with different cleaning frequencies, but no significant difference was obtained for the other groups of bacteria. Cleaning the system twice a day resulted in a TBC of log 4. 15 compared to log 3. 98 when cleaning the system three times a day. The milk in the bulk tank contained an acceptable average level of CC irrespective of farm and cleaning frequency. However, the variation between farms and cleaning frequency was high with the lowest value of 0 and the highest value of log 3. 9 CC. With a limit for TC of 200 cfu/ml, all farms regardless of cleaning frequency exceeded that limit for almost all of the milk samples (mean between log 3. 02 - log 3. 19) ...|$|E
40|$|Microbial damages {{caused by}} biofilm forming {{bacteria}} in the dairy industry are a fundamental threat to safety and quality of dairy products. In order to ensure the optimal level of equipment hygiene in the dairy industry, {{it is necessary to}} determine the biofilm removal efficiency of cleaning agents used for cleaning-in-place procedures. However, currently there is no standard method available for evaluating and comparing cleaning agents for use in cleaning-in-place procedures in the dairy industry under realistic conditions. The present study aims to establish a cleaning-in-place model system {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} cleaning agents in removal of biofilm derived spores from the surfaces of stainless steel which is the predominant substrate in milking equipment on dairy farms. The system is based on Bacillus subtilis spores surrounded with exopolymeric substances produced by bacteria during biofilm formation. The spores applied on sampling plates were mounted on T-junctions protruding 1. 5 – 11 -times the <b>milk</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter from the main loop to resemble different levels of cleaning difficulty. The cleaning tests were conducted using commercial alkaline detergents and caustic soda at conditions which are relevant to actual farm environment. The spores removal effect was evaluated by comparing the number of viable spores (attached to sampling plates) before and after cleaning. Evaluation of the cleaning and disinfecting effect of cleaning agents towards biofilm derived spores was further performed, which indicates whether spores elimination effect of an agent is due to killing the spores or removing them from the surfaces of dairy equipment. Moreover, it was established that the presence of extracellular matrix is an important factor responsible for high level of cleaning difficulty characteristic for surface attached spores. In overall, the results of this study suggest that the developed model system simulates actual farm conditions for quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting agents and their cleaning and disinfecting effect on removal of biofilm derived spores...|$|E

40|$|Aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of three volumes monthly milk sales, months of year, types of coolers and milking systems on the freezing point of milk, fat percentage, somatic cell count (SCC) and bacterial count Total (CBT) milk come from producers that sell to a dairy of Western of Paraná. We evaluated twelve months for volume, fat, freezing point, SCC and TBC {{with a total of}} 7, 105 records. Samples for analysis were collected by milk transporters. The information was classified by monthly volume purchased from each producer (up to 4, 500 gallons between 4, 500 - 15, 000 liters and more than 15, 000 liters), by milking systems (manual, bucket foot, piped and protractor) and types of coolers (immersion, bulk and freezer) used by each producer. The milk got of producers with volumes exceeding fifteen thousand liters per month has a freezing point and fat content lesser, but have a better CBT and CCS. There were seasonal variations of freezing point, fat, CBT and CCS. Variations of CBT during periods of the year are lower in milk derived from bulk cooling and <b>milking</b> <b>piped</b> system. There are factors related to handling and cleaning of milking equipment and cooling that need to be worked with the milk producers. ...|$|R

If the players dropped the ball, then they would have to start again from scratch. At 28 minutes, it was thought that the assignment was won, but a rule violation was revealed whereby Nick was revealed to have held together two pipes using two hands. This resulted in a $2,000 penalty from the pot, but with 28 minutes remaining they were successful in re-attempting the assignment, and thus $3,000 was won.|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} the bacterial risks and factors associated with those risks in the informal milk market in Nairobi and Kiambu districts. The study was carried out as part of integrated studies on milk marketing and associated public health risks in Kenya with the aim of making recommendations to improve milk quality without loading unrealistic costs and restrictions on traders and the milk market. The specific objectives were to: 1) assess milk quality along raw milk marketing pathways and the risk factors involved; 2) identify the critical control points for along each major milk market pathway; and 3) adapt the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system as a tool and guideline for improving milk quality along the informal milk marketing chain. The study was conducted among 162 raw milk traders of various cadres between March and May 1999. Traders were selected in a stratified random sample, stratified on proximity to consumers (Nairobi) and producers (Kiambu). Milk handling practices for each trader were both observed and recorded on a questionnaire. Milk samples were collected and assessed for total and coliform bacterial plate counts, addition of inhibitors and adulteration. The observed counts and levels were compared to quality thresholds based on Kenyan national standards. Critical control points (CCPs) and associated risk factors for not meeting these standards were identified. About 75 % of milk samples were collected within two hours of their receipt by traders. The majority of respondents were milk shop/kiosk (27 %) followed by milk bars (25 %), mobile or itinerant (18 %), collection centers (12. 9 %), cooperatives (9 %) and milk bar/snack bar (8 %). Market points with one or more intermediate steps comprised 41 % of samples collected. Direct sales occurred between producers and dairy co-ops (20 %), hawkers (15 %), milk-/snack-bar (13 %) and kiosks/shops (12 %). Most respondents were male (64 %) aged between 16 and 70 years (mean= 32 and 28 yrs for Kiambu and Nairobi, respectively). The majority of respondents (78 %) did not have any form of training in milk handling and quality control, and 41 % did not practice any form of quality control prior to purchasing their supplies. Approximately one-quarter (27 %) of the milk traders had been medically examined as required by the Ministry of Health but none met the frequency of medical examination required (four times/year). Only 22 % and 13 % of milk collected from Kiambu and Nairobi, respectively, had total bacterial counts of acceptable standards according to Kenya Bureau of Standards (KBS). Applying the same standards for coliform counts, 56 % and 29 % of the samples collected from Kiambu and Nairobi, respectively, were acceptable. The proportion of milk samples that were adulterated was 14 % and 12 % in Nairobi and Kiambu, respectively. Overall, milk samples collected from Kiambu were of significantly better microbial quality than those from Nairobi. Two market channel types (retail agents other than dairy co-ops and multiple selling steps) and four risk factors: scooping of milk, higher <b>milk</b> temperature, <b>piped</b> water and use of plastic versus metal containers were associated with higher coliform counts (the former three risk factors were also associated with higher total bacterial counts). Against expectation, time in the market chain and distance to retail points showed no significant association with total or coliform counts. This most likely reflected the presence of a CCP between the dairy, farm and the first milk market agent. Though the majority of milk that reached consumers is below Kenyan national standards, bacterial health risks were determined to be minimal given the common consumer practice of boiling of milk prior to consumption.
