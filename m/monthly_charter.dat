The airport's largest creditor was Stord Municipality, to whom it owed NOK5.5 million. In December 2002, the airport company transferred the ownership of the real estate in exchange for the debt being wiped. Coast Air moved its technical base from Florø Airport to Sørstokken in April 2003, and in April started flights to Oslo using ATR 42 aircraft up to three times per day. There was not sufficient traffic for both airlines, and Coast Air terminated the route from June. In August the airline started flights on Friday and Sunday, but these were again terminated in March 2004. In 2004, Aker Stord started leasing British Aerospace 146-200 aircraft operated by Atlantic Airways. The airline also offered <b>monthly</b> <b>charter</b> flights to Vágar Airport on the Faeroe Islands.|$|E

Why, the first thing I did before I'd raised a cent, and with this other notion in my head already--the first thing I did was to secure the schooner. The Norah Creina she is, sixty-four tons--quite big enough for our purpose since the rice is spoiled, and the fastest thing of her tonnage out of San Francisco. For a bonus of two hundred, and a <b>monthly</b> <b>charter</b> of three, I have her for my own time; wages and provisions, say four hundred more: a drop in the bucket. They began firing the cargo out of her (she was part loaded) near two hours ago; and about the same time John Smith got the order for the stores. That's what I call business." ...|$|E
