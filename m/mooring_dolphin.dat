40|$|The Adriatic LNG {{terminal}} is a liquefied {{natural gas}} offshore terminal located about 17 km {{off the coast of}} Rovigo, Italy in the northern Adriatic, where the water depth is approximately 29 m. Scour protection was needed around the GBS and the <b>mooring</b> <b>dolphins</b> to prevent the bed material under them from washing out. This paper presents a description of the scour protection design for the GBS and the <b>mooring</b> <b>dolphins.</b> The paper will first present the design criteria and the design approach. The dynamic stability approach, which has been developed in the recent years, was applied. This approach allows the profile of the armor rock to deform, but damage (loss of rocks from the scour protection system) must be very limited under the specified design environmental conditions. Particular aspects influencing the design of the scour protection in this case are the use of skirts and the composition of the upper layers of the seabed. The paper will further highlight the way in which existing data and physical modeling were used to arrive at the final design. In particular it will be demonstrated that this is an effective way to carry out the design and that the adaptations of the final design developed and tested during the physical model tests are important.

40|$|The {{stability}} of stones in propeller-induced jet wash is still difficult to predict. Especially {{the trend of}} bowthrusters increasing in size and power in sea going ships (especially ferries) {{over the last years}} may be a reason for concern when dealing with the protection of slopes and beds. But also ships used in inland navigation are using bowthrusters more intensively. Because of high costs of crew, many inland navigation ships try to sail with a minimum of crew. In order to allow mooring with a limited number of staff, the manoeuvrability of the ship has to be improved, which is often done by making a bowthruster in the ship.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this master thesis is {{introduced}} {{by the lack of}} regulations for the design of flexible dolphins. Currently, the design of flexible dolphins is based on the Eurocode, which does not cover all aspects which are of importance in dolphin design. Consequently, different countries and associations developed their own guidelines, which often do not coincide and are used interchangeably by different advisers. Nowadays, there is no uniform design approach for the design of flexible dolphins. The partial safety factors used in dolphin design are therefore not consistent and often subject of debate. This master thesis starts with a literature review on the available design models which are nowadays most often used in flexible dolphin design. The oldest model which is still frequently used in the preliminary design stage, is the empirical method of Blum. The simplicity of this model also introduces several limitations. Some more advanced models are D-Sheet Piling and D-Pile Group, which approach the behaviour of the soil by bi-linear and non-linear springs along the pile. However, research reveals that the Finite Element Method approaches the behaviour of laterally loaded piles best. With Plaxis 3 D it is possible to assign a different soil model to the each individual layer of soil, resulting in a relatively accurate approximation of the soil behaviour. However, because of the complexity of Plaxis 3 D and the lack of probabilistic tools, this model is not considered to be the most appropriate for this master thesis. In order to determine which of the two springs models, D-Sheet Piling or D-Pile Group, is most appropriate for the derivation of the partial safety factors, a comparison between the models was made based on the results obtained from performed tests. It was demonstrated that both models tend to overestimate the bending moments which develop in laterally loaded piles, whereas D-Pile Group seems to give a better approximation of the deformations. However, it was found that under some conditions, D-Pile Group overestimates the reliability of the structure. Therefore, D-Sheet Piling was considered to be most suited for the determination of partial factors for dolphin design. To determine the partial safety factors for flexible dolphins, a reliability analysis was carried out with the probabilistic toolbox Prob 2 B. With this toolbox a FORM-analysis was performed on a flexible <b>mooring</b> <b>dolphin</b> from practice. The evaluations were performed with respect to three different limit states, namely structural failure of the cross-section of the pile, excessive deformations and soil mechanical failure. After the evaluation of the initial <b>mooring</b> <b>dolphin</b> design, modifications were introduced to the soil structure in order to examine the sensitivity of the influence factors and partial safety factors to changes. From the probabilistic evaluations with respect to structural failure, it was concluded that the reliability of the structure is mainly defined by the exerted mooring load and the structural parameters of the pile. The soil hardly has any influence on the reliability of the structure. Only the most upper soil layer prevents the development of the bending moment in the structure, and an increasing strength of this layer therefore introduces a higher reliability. With respect to the deformations of the structure, it was concluded that again the mooring load strongly contributes to the reliability of the dolphin. Furthermore, the strength of the upper soil layers is of importance. The influence of the soil on the reliability of the structure appears to decrease with increasing depth. Moreover, it was concluded that the influence of the different variables is most sensitive to changes in strength and layer thickness. The final limit state which was evaluated, was soil mechanical failure. As a result of the lateral load exerted on the pile, a passive wedge develops at the rear side of the structure. At a certain point, this wedge is fully developed and soil mechanical failure of the structure is induced. From the probabilistic analysis {{it was found that the}} mooring load also has a large, but smaller, influence on the reliability of flexible dolphins with respect to this limit state. Furthermore, it could be concluded that the soil parameters which have most influence on the reliability are the weight of the soil and the angle of internal friction. Finally, a recommendation has been made for a set of partial safety factors for flexible <b>mooring</b> <b>dolphin</b> design. It was proposed to apply partial factors equal to 1. 30 on the characteristic mooring load and the stiffness of the soil. Furthermore, it was recommended to apply a partial safety factor equal to 1. 15 on the characteristic value of the friction angle of the soil and to apply a factor equal to 1. 05 on the mean wall thickness of the pile. For the other parameters, a partial safety factor equal to 1. 00 was recommended. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Natural gas is {{a highly}} {{desirable}} energy source because of its high calorific value and clean-burning characteristics compared to other fuels. Natural gas, which is composed primarily of methane (CH 4), occurs as associated and non-associated form in reservoirs. The largest gas reserves are located in remote and thinly populated areas, viz. in Eastern Europe & Former USSR and the Middle East. Natural gas is transported either by pipeline {{in the form of}} compressed gas or after liquefaction by LNG carrier in the liquid state as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). LNG is inherent to transport by LNG carrier. It can also be transformed by chemical conversion and transported by a chemicals tanker. While the market for chemicals remains small, the LNG trade is expanding considerably. The expanding LNG trade is caused by the growing gas demand combined with the fact that where {{there is little or no}} gas supplies available or where long distance pipeline gas transport is economically or technically unfeasible, LNG transport generally appears to be the only feasible solution. BNE Ballast Nedam Engineering (BNE) is the in-house design company of the international contractor Ballast Nedam. BNE has the intention to extend her field of action from the final design phase to the earliest stages of LNG projects. In these earliest stages of LNG projects it has to be evaluated whether or not an acceptable rate of return is possible. Within this report it has been determined whether it is possible to develop a financial evaluation model for a quick reliable estimate of the LNG jetty investment and an accurate evaluation of the project's feasibility. The product 'standard LNG jetty' In order to enable quick estimating of the jetty investment, the LNG jetties are considered as a standard product. The product 'standard LNG jetty' consists of (1) a loading platform which supports loading-, fire-fighting- and miscellaneous equipment and provides vehicular and pedestrian access; (2) breasting and <b>mooring</b> <b>dolphins</b> which absorb berthing energy and transmit breasting forces to the subsoil respectively keep the ship close to the berth by transmitting breast line forces to the subsoil and (3) a trestle which connects the loading platform to the shore in order to provide vehicular and pedestrian access and support to the LNG (un) loading lines, vapor return line and cable trays. Opportunities and threats The market for LNG and the market for the product 'standard LNG jetty' look strong for the period through 2015. LNG trade is expected to expand by over 90 % between 19992010 under a scenario most likely, reaching 241. 3 billion m 3 of gas. An important factor in this growth is the governmental agreement relating to caps on carbon emissions according to the Kyoto protocol through which the need for natural gas increases. Moreover, modern natural gas fired combined cycle power plants have very high efficiencies, which can exceed 55 % and their capital costs are about 60 % lower than that of a similar sized coal- or nuclear plants. Opposed to this, the close location of natural gas hydrates to some of the major markets for LNG or the technical and economic improvements of deepwater gas pipelines could dampen growth in the LNG market.

The side-by-side Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) offloading operation from floating terminals to LNG carriers is very similar to that from super-container ships to floating quay-walls. The hydrodynamic interaction effects among a fixed quay, container ship and floating quay, which are parallel to one another, are investigated. The three body side-by-side arrangement is compared with the individual freely floating body in the absence/presence of the fixed quay to identify the interaction effects. Hydrodynamic coefficients of the interacting bodies are obtained using a three dimensional constant panel method, WAMIT. Using a vessel-lines coupled dynamic analysis computer program WINPOST, the relative motion between floating quay and container ship is simulated in time domain.

A 350 [m]? 160 [m] box-type barge is selected as the floating harbor and it is positioned by a <b>dolphin</b> <b>mooring</b> system. The container ship is tied to the land wall by hawsers. The hydrodynamic interactions between floating bodies and a fixed quay wall in close proximity with a side-by-side arrangement are investigated. A three dimensional wave-body diffraction/radiation panel program WAMIT is used for the calculation of hydrodynamic information and response amplitude operators (RAO) of the three bodies in frequency domain. Subsequently, the vessel-mooring coupled dynamic analysis program WINPOST is employed to produce motion time histories in time domain. The frequency-domain RAO is successfully compared with time-domain RAO in case viscous forces are neglected. Compared to Brajesh Kumar?s (2005) study, 12 ? 12 full hydrodynamic interactions between the two floating bodies are included and dynamic wind loading is considered in addition to wave and current loadings. All the relative motion statistics are calculated from the respective motion time histories for a typical operational condition and a typical survival condition.

A finite difference method with SURF scheme, assuming a singlevalued free surface profile, is applied for the direct simulation of liquid sloshing. The computed sloshing forces and moments are then applied as external excitations to the ship motion. The calculated ship motion is in turn inputted as the excitation for liquid sloshing, which is repeated for the ensuing time steps. For comparison, linear inner-fluid motion was calculated using a 3 D panel program and it is coupled with the vessel motion program in the frequency domain. The developed computer programs are applied to a barge-type FPSO hull equipped with two partially filled tanks. The time domain simulation results show reasonably good agreement when compared with MARIN's experimental results. The frequency domain results qualitatively reproduce the trend of coupling effects but the peaks are usually over-predicted. It is seen that the coupling effects on roll motions appreciably change with filling level. The most pronounced coupling effects on roll motions are the shift or split of peak frequencies. The pitch motions are much less influenced by the inner-fluid motion compared to roll motions. A developed program is also applied to a more realistic offloading configuration where a LNG-carrier is moored with a floating terminal in a side-by-side configuration. First, a hydrodynamic interaction problem between two bodies is solved successfully in frequency and time domain. A realistic mooring system, including fender, hawser, and simplified mooring system, is also developed to calculate the nonlinear behavior of two bodies in time domain simulation. Then, the LNG-carrier and sloshing problem are coupled in frequency and time domain, similar to the method in the MARIN-FPSO case. Sloshing effect on LNG-carrier motion is investigated with respect to different tank filling levels including various conditions such as gap distance between two bodies, selection of <b>dolphin</b> <b>mooring</b> system, and different cases of environmental conditions using wave, wind, and current...|$|R
