40|$|The {{physiological}} {{condition of}} <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies,</b> Anastrepha ludens (Loew), affected their attraction to 2 similar but qualitatively different synthetic lures in wind-tunnel bioassays. The 2 lures were BioLure (ammonium acetate and putrescine) and AMPu (ammonium carbonate, methylamine HCI, and putrescine). Effects of food deprivation on {{attraction to the}} lures were smaller than the effects of sex, time of day, and irradiation. Sugar-fed, protein-starved flies were attracted more strongly than other hunger-status groups to the lures. Sugar-starved, protein-starved females were less responsive than other groups of females to AMPu. Protein-starved males were more responsive than protein-fed males to BioLure. Females were nearly twice as responsive as males to the lures. Both lures were more attractive to females early and late in the photophase and more attractive to males during midphotophase. Gamma irradiation of flies greatly reduced their attraction to both lures. Fly age from 6 to 17 dafter eclosion {{had little effect on}} attraction to the lures. AMPu was more than twice as attractive as BioLure summed over all wind-tunnel experiments.

40|$|Estimating {{an overall}} density {{function}} from repeated observations {{on each of}} a sample of independent subjects or experimental units is of interest. An example is provided by biodemographic studies, where one observes age-at-death for several cohorts of flies. Cohorts are kept in separate cages, which form the experimental units. Time variation then is likely to exist between the cohort densities and hazard rates due to cage effects on aging. Given the densities of age-at-death for the individual cohorts, one aims to obtain an estimate for the underlying overall density and hazard rate. In microarray gene expression experiments, similar problems arise when addressing the need for normalization of probe-level data from different arrays. Conventional methods, such as the cross-sectional average density, ignore time variation and hence are often not representative for such data. We view densities as functional data and model individual densities as warped versions of an underlying overall density, where the observed densities {{are assumed to be}} realizations of an underlying stochastic process. Quantile-synchronized distribution functions are obtained from an inverse warping mapping, based on quantile synchronization, leading to quantile-synchronized density and hazard functions. Kernel type smoothing methods with plug-in bandwidth selection can be used for estimating the components of the model. Asymptotic properties of the synchronized density estimates are derived. Simulation results show that functional density synchronization is often advantageous when compared to conventional density averaging or simple time-shift warping. Our approach complements previous quantile normalization methods used for microarray expression data and is illustrated with both longevity data obtained for 54 cohorts of mexflies (<b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies)</b> and gene expression data of the Ts 1 Cje mouse study for Down syndrome.

50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> has {{not been}} spotted in the US for many years because of many {{management}} tactics used by the USDA to control the threat of an invasion. The USDA has placed a quarantine on these flies so that if any are spotted, that area is to be isolated. Also, the USDA has released many sterile male flies into the environment. The sterile flies mate but do not produce offspring, causing the population to slowly die off. Also, there are commercially available pheromones that are used by farmers to detect infestations early. Because of these measures, the population has been under control.|$|E
50|$|Factors like {{nutrition}} {{contribute to}} {{factors that influence}} reproductive success. These include different amounts of consumption and more specific carbohydrate to protein ratios. In some cases, the amounts or ratios of intake are more influential during certain stages of the lifespan. For example, in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly,</b> male protein intake is critical only at eclosion. Intake at this time provides longer lasting reproductive ability. After this developmental stage, protein intake will have no effect and is not necessary for reproductive success. In addition, Ceratitis capitata males were experimented on to see how protein influence during the larval stage affects mating success. Males were fed either a high protein diet, which consisted of 6.5g/100mL, or a no protein diet during the larval stage. Males that were fed protein had more copulations than those that weren’t fed protein, which ultimately correlates with a higher mating success. Protein-deprived black blow fly males have been seen to exhibit lower numbers of oriented mounts and inseminate fewer females than more lively fed males. In still other instances, prey deprivation or an inadequate diet {{has been shown to}} lead to a partial or complete halt in male mating activity. Copulation time lasted longer for sugar-fed males than protein-fed flies, showing that carbohydrates were more necessary for a longer copulation duration.|$|E
50|$|Males {{can live}} {{for many months}} and {{occasionally}} can live for a full year. Females survive longer than males and can sometimes live for 16 months. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> goes through four phases of growth. They start their life out as an egg, then a larva, a pupa, and an adult fly. The rate at which they mature {{is directly related to}} the environment that they live in. A general rule is that the warmer the area in which they live, the faster the more rapidly they develop. Their life starts when a female lays eggs. They are usually laid in groups of ten eggs. These eggs are laid on the surface of fruits, especially those with broken skin or exposed flesh. The eggs hatch six to ten days later and they enter their second stage of development, the larval stage.The larvae burrow their way into the fruit and begin to devour the fruit from the inside. This stage lasts for three to four weeks, depending on the temperature and conditions. While inside the fruit, the larvae continue to grow until they are old enough to enter their next stage of development, the pupal stage.After the larvae are old enough, it begins to pupate. During this stage, the larvae grow wings and metamorphosize into a fly. This is analogous to the caterpillar retreating into a cocoon to become a butterfly. After it matures, the fly emerges as an adult.The adult fly then mate and lay more eggs, restarting the cycle. The female fly can lay over 1500 eggs in its lifetime.|$|E

40|$|A genetic sexing {{strain of}} Anastrepha ludens (Loew), Tapachula- 7, was {{developed}} by the <b>Mexican</b> Program Against <b>Fruit</b> <b>Flies</b> to produce and release only males in programs where the sterile insect technique (SIT) is applied. Currently, breeding are found at a massive scale, and it is necessary to determine the optimum irradiation dose that releases sterile males with minimum damage to their sexual competitiveness. Under laboratory and field conditions, we evaluated the effects of gamma irradiation at doses of 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 Gy on the sexual competitiveness of males, the induction of sterility in wild females and offspring survivorship. The results of the study indicate that irradiation doses {{have a significant effect on}} the sexual behavior of males. A reduction of mating capacity was inversely proportional to the irradiation dose of males. It is estimated that a dose of 60 Gy can induce more than 99 % sterility in wild females. In all treatments, the degree of offspring fertility was correlated with the irradiation dose of the parents. In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that a dose of 60 Gy can be applied in sterile insect technique release programs.

40|$|Superparasitism, a {{strategy}} {{in which a}} female lays eggs in/on a previously parasitized host, was attributed {{in the past to}} the inability of females to discriminate between parasitized and non-parasitized hosts. However, superparasitism is now accepted as an adaptive strategy under specific conditions. In fruit fly parasitoids, superparasitism has mainly been studied as concerns the new association between Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> Anastrepha ludens (Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae), wherein this phenomenon is a common occurrence in both mass rearing and field conditions. Studies of this species have shown that moderate levels of superparasitism result in a female-biased sex ratio and that both massreared and wild females superparasitize their hosts without detrimental effects on offspring demographic parameters, including longevity and fecundity. These studies suggest that superparasitism in this species is advantageous. In this paper, we review superparasitism in D. longicaudata, discuss these findings in the context of mass rearing and field releases and address the possible implications of superparasitism in programs employing augmentative releases of parasitoids for the control of fruit fly pests...|$|E

Males and females stemming from widely separated locations with similar environmental conditions and males and females stemming from populations within individual-flight range, but collected in different hosts (a native and an exotic one), mated randomly amongst themselves when placed in a field cage. Despite the fact that sibling males and females from two distinct populations also mated randomly amongst themselves, siblings engaged in significantly longer copulations than non-siblings, indicating that perhaps adults discriminated mates with similar genetic compositions. Our results have important practical implications as A. ludens is the most devastating pest of citrus in Mexico and Central America, and large-scale releases of sterile flies are used to control it...|$|E

40|$|Site-specific {{recombination}} {{technologies are}} powerful new tools for {{the manipulation of}} genomic DNA in insects that can improve transgenesis strategies such as targeting transgene insertions, allowing transgene cassette exchange and DNA mobilization for transgene stabilization. However, understanding the fitness cost implications of these manipulations for transgenic strain applications is critical. In this study independent piggyBac-mediated attP target-sites marked with DsRed were created in several genomic positions in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly,</b> Anastrepha ludens. Two of these strains, one having an autosomal (attP F 7) {{and the other a}} Y-linked (attP 2 -M 6 y) integration, exhibited fitness parameters (dynamic demography and sexual competitiveness) similar to wild type flies. These strains were thus selected for targeted insertion using, {{for the first time in}} mexfly, the phiC 31 -integrase recombination system to insert an additional EGFP-marked transgene to determine its effect on host strain fitness. Fitness tests showed that the integration event in the int 2 -M 6 y recombinant strain had no significant effect, while the int F 7 recombinant strain exhibited significantly lower fitness relative to the original attP F 7 target-site host strain. These results indicate that while targeted transgene integrations can be achieved without an additional fitness cost, at some genomic positions insertion of additional DNA into a previously integrated transgene can have a significant negative effect. Thus, for targeted transgene insertions fitness costs must be evaluated both previous to and subsequent to new site-specific insertions in the target-site strain...|$|E
40|$|Background Reliable marking {{systems are}} {{critical}} to the prospective field release of transgenic insect strains. This is to unambiguously distinguish released insects from wild insects in the field that are collected in field traps, and tissue-specific markers, {{such as those that}} are sperm-specific, have particular uses such as identifying wild females that have mated with released males. For tephritid fruit flies such as the <b>Mexican</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly,</b> Anastrepha ludens, polyubiquitin-regulated fluorescent protein body markers allow transgenic fly identification, and fluorescent protein genes regulated by the spermatocyte-specific β 2 -tubulin promoter effectively mark sperm. For sterile male release programs, both marking systems can be made male-specific by linkage to the Y chromosome. Results An A. ludens wild type strain was genetically transformed with a piggyBac vector, pBXL{PUbnlsEGFP, Asβ 2 tub-DsRed. T 3 }, having the polyubiquitin-regulated EGFP body marker, and the β 2 -tubulin-regulated DsRed. T 3 sperm-specific marker. Autosomal insertion lines effectively expressed both markers, but a single Y-linked insertion (YEGFP strain) expressed only PUbnlsEGFP. This insertion was remobilized by transposase helper injection, which resulted in three new autosomal insertion lines that expressed both markers. This indicated that the original Y-linked Asβ 2 tub-DsRed. T 3 marker was functional, but specifically suppressed on the Y chromosome. The PUbnlsEGFP marker remained effective however, and the YEGFP strain was used to create a sexing strain by translocating the wild type allele of the black pupae (bp+) gene onto the Y, which was then introduced into the bp- mutant strain. This allows the mechanical separation of mutant female black pupae from male brown pupae, that can be identified as adults by EGFP fluorescence. Conclusions A Y-linked insertion of the pBXL{PUbnlsEGFP, Asβ 2 tub-DsRed. T 3 } transformation vector in A. ludens resulted in male-specific expression of the EGFP fluorescent protein marker, and was integrated into a black pupae translocation sexing strain (T(YEGFP/bp+), allowing the identification of male adults when used in sterile male release programs for population control. A unique observation was that expression of the Asβ 2 tub-DsRed. T 3 sperm-specific marker, which was functional in autosomal insertions, was specifically suppressed in the Y-linked insertion. This may relate to the Y chromosomal regulation of male-specific germ-line genes in Drosophila...|$|E
