5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 85, Agricola was {{recalled}} to Rome by Domitian, {{having served}} for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era. Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: {{on the one}} hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post {{in spite of his}} experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|In 1655 Wheelwright {{moved back}} to England with his family, and preached {{near his home in}} Lincolnshire.

The political tide turned markedly during the <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> he was there, and following Cromwell's death and Vane's execution, Wheelwright returned to New England to become the minister in Salisbury, Massachusetts, where he spent the remainder of his life.

5|$|Parallel with {{improvements}} in sound-on-film technology, {{a number of}} companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith's failed silent film Dream Street. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, Dream Street was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. There would be no others for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Florida Constitution of 1838 {{provided}} that a governor be elected every four years, {{who was not}} allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term.

5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity.

In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home to share with the England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> later.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the 2004census {{indicates}} that only about 15per cent of foreign workers are in the skilled category, with the remainder mostly working in agriculture, cleaning and domestic service.

Saudi businesses have traditionally adopted an ethnically defined hierarchical organisation. For example, a recent academic study of a Danish manufacturing company's Saudi subsidiary noted that a manager had to be European, a supervisor had to be Egyptian, Filipino employees often had technical roles, and Indians, the lowest in the hierarchy, worked in production. Foreign workers' presence in Saudi Arabia tends to be transitory: only 3% remain in the country for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

This lasted through V-J Day and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard , so Washington received orders to voyage to Philadelphia, where she arrived on 17 October.

5|$|The intense {{fighting}} {{during the}} Battle of Dak To took a heavy human {{toll on the}} 173rd. While several of its units, including the 2-503rd and A/3-319th were ordered to Tuy Hòa to repair and refit, the 173rd was transferred to Camp Radcliff in An Khê and Bong Son areas during 1968, seeing very little action while the combat ineffective elements of the brigade were rebuilt. Company D, 16th Armor was engaged in a battle that took place on 4 March 1968 at North Tuy Hòa. During the day, the company lost 8 men killed and 21 wounded. The enemy took a much greater loss. An estimated 2 enemy battalions, 85th Main Force (VC) and the 95th NVA Regiment, were rendered ineffective as they had 297 KIA's, with D/16 Armor receiving credit for killing 218. The company commander, Captain Robert Helmick, was awarded the DSC. One of few combat operations that brigade conducted during this time was an amphibious assault against North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces {{as part of an}} operation to clear the rice-growing lowlands along the Bong Song littoral. The unit then served in An Khê until mid-1969, seeing {{little in the way of}} heavy fighting. From April 1969 until its withdrawal from Vietnam in 1971, the brigade served in Bình Định Province. From April until August 1971, the unit underwent the process of redeployment to Fort Campbell, Kentucky in the United States, the first time that the 173rd Airborne Brigade in name had returned to the country since 1942. During <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> of continuous combat, the brigade earned 14 campaign streamers and four unit citations, the Presidential Unit Citation, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, a Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, and a Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal.

Initially the limit applied to partial terms for those elected in a special election but the amendment was revised in 2002 to exclude from the circulation service of less then one-half a term (i. e. one year in the House or two years in the Senate). The amendment can be found in article III, section 8 of the Missouri Constitution.
