40|$|NIST {{has played}} a key role in many of the one-on-one, domestic, and {{international}} interlaboratory comparisons of measurements on superconductors. The history of interlaboratory comparisons of measurements on superconductors tells us that careful measurement methods are needed to obtain consistent results. Inconsistent results can lead to many problems including: a mistrust of the results of others, unfair advantages in commerce, and erroneous feedback in the optimization of conductor performance. NIST has experience in many interlaboratory comparisons; a long-term commitment to measurement accuracy; and independent, third-party laboratory status. The principal investigator's direct involvement in the measurements and daily supervision of sample mounting is the unique situation that has allowed important discoveries and evolution of our capabilities over the last 30 years. The principal investigator's research and metrology has helped to improve the accuracy of critical-current (I{sub c}) measurements in laboratories throughout the world. As conductors continue to improve and design limits are tested, the continuation of the long-term commitment to measurement accuracy could be vitally important to the success of new conductor development programs. It is extremely important to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturers to get accurate (high certainty) I{sub c} measurements in order to optimize conductor performance. The optimization requires the adjustment of several fabrication parameters (such as reaction time, reaction temperature, conductor design, doping, diffusion barrier, Cu to non-Cu ratio, and twist pitch) based on the I{sub c} measurement of the conductor. If the I{sub c} measurements are made with high variability, it may be unclear whether or not the parameters are being adjusted in the optimal direction or whether or not the conductor meets the target specification. Our metrology is vital to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturers in the highly competitive international arena and to meet the aggressive performance goals. The latest high-performance Nb{sub 3 }Sn wires are being designed with higher current densities, larger effective filament diameter, less Cu stabilizer, and, in some cases, larger wire diameters than ever before. In addition, some of the conductor designs and heat treatments cause the residual resistivity ratio (RRR, ratio of room temperature resistivity to the resistivity at 20 K) of the stabilizer to be less than 20. These parameters are pushing the conductors towards less intrinsic stability, into a region we call marginally stable. These parameters also create a whole series of challenges for routine I{sub c} testing on short-samples, even when tested with the sample immersed in liquid helium. High-current, variable-temperature I{sub c} measurements are even more difficult than those made in liquid helium because the sample is only cooled by flowing helium gas. Providing accurate I{sub c} results under these conditions requires a complex system that provide adequate cooling as well as uniform sample temperature. We have been make variable-temperature measurements for about 15 years, but we started to design the first high-current (at least 500 A), variable-temperature, variable-strain apparatus in late 2006. Our first critical-current measurements as a function of strain, temperature, and magnetic field, I{sub c}(B,T,{var_epsilon}), in a new single, unified apparatus (full matrix characterization) were made in the summer of 2008. This is the only such facility in the U. S. and it has some unique components that are not duplicated anywhere in the world. The compounding of all three variables (H, T, {var_epsilon}) makes an already labor and time intensive characterization very formidable; however, the results cannot be generated any other way and are needed to answer key questions about strain and temperature safety margins and about the reliability of using scaling laws based on small data sets to predict performance. In the future, this new apparatus will allow NIST to create a database on strands that would benefit U. <b>S.</b> superconductor <b>wire</b> manufacturers, national research laboratories, and programs using superconductor strands such as HEP and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) ...|$|R

To identify the heritability of various brain connections, we scanned healthy young adult twins with high-field, highangular resolution diffusion MRI.

40|$|Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) {{are being}} {{developed}} for use as enabling materials for advanced aeropropulsion engine and high speed civil transport applications. The characterization and testing of these advanced materials in hostile, high-temperature environments require accurate measurement of the material temperatures. Commonly used wire Thermo-Couples (TC) can not be attached to this ceramic based material via conventional spot-welding techniques. Attachment of wire TC's with commercially available ceramic cements fail to provide sufficient adhesion at high temperatures. While advanced thin film TC technology provides minimally intrusive surface temperature measurement and has good adhesion on the CMC, its fabrication requires sophisticated and expensive facilities and is very time consuming. In addition, the durability of lead wire attachments to both thin film TC's and the substrate materials requires further improvement. This paper presents a newly developed attachment technique for installation of free filament wire TC's with a unique convoluted design on ceramic based materials such as CMC's.

It was not then intended as a sweeping federal effort to curtail public access to gambling. Further, the fact that the same committee in which the attorney general received his initial education in organized crime proposed, in the following year, an expansion of the Act to cover technologies not specified in the original law, suggests that the Wire Act was intended to cover only a limited range of wire facilities—not the broad spectrum of communications technologies, most of which had not yet been invented in 1961, for which later prosecutors dusted it off...|$|R

40|$|Mesoscopic physics investigates {{structures}} {{smaller than}} the everyday macroscopic scale but larger than the scale of individual atoms, with properties that can often only be {{explained in terms of}} the laws of quantum mechanics. A typical mesoscopic electrical component is a tunnel junction, formed by a thin insulating oxide layer separating two metallic electrodes. In this thesis, various mesoscopic circuits containing sub-micron tunnel junctions between normal (N) and superconducting (S) metals are studied experimentally at sub-kelvin temperatures. An emphasis is placed on the influence of electrical fluctuations on the systems, as well as the strong connection between electrical and thermal transport in them. We first demonstrate that a Josephson tunnel junction between two S electrodes functions as an on-chip detector of current fluctuations in a wide band of frequencies, potentially useful for studying charge transport in various mesoscopic systems. The lifetime of the zero-voltage state in a current-biased junction is very sensitive to the fluctuations in the bias current. We are able to observe the non-Gaussian nature of the shot noise generated by electrons tunneling across another nearby tunnel junction coupled to the detector junction. Several of the experiments in this thesis probe how the transport close to a transparent interface between a superconducting and a normal conducting electrode is modified by the phenomenon of superconducting proximity effect. We present direct measurements of electron overheating in a normal metal weak link between two superconductors, explaining the routinely observed hysteretic current-voltage characteristic. Electronic temperature is probed locally by contacting the N island to an additional S electrode via an oxide barrier (I), thereby forming an NIS tunnel junction. Connecting the S electrodes of such a proximity SNS weak link into a closed loop, we further demonstrate use of the structure as a sensitive magnetometer with low dissipation. We probe also the electronic thermal conduction of short <b>S</b> <b>wires</b> between two N terminals. Due to the inverse proximity effect, the thermal conductance is found to be strongly enhanced beyond the value for a bulk superconductor. We consider theoretically the prospects for rectifying thermal fluctuations by an NIS junction in a suitable electromagnetic environment, thereby realizing a Brownian refrigerator. Finally, we report the observation of increased cooling power in a voltage-biased NIS junction in small applied magnetic fields. This is attributed to enhanced relaxation of the hot electrons injected into the S lead of the junction...|$|R

This paper presents a polynomial approximation algorithm for the generalized version of A-Tree problem with upper-bounded delays along each path from the driver to the sinks and with restrictions {{on the number of}} Steiner nodes. We refer to it as "Deep-submicron Steiner tree" as minimizing the number of Steiner nodes is crucial for signal integrity issues in deep-submicron very-large-scaled-integrated-circuit (VLSI) designs. The idea behind the algorithm is to control two parameters in order to construct a feasible (with respect to the paths delays and the number of Steiner nodes) tree of small cost. The simulation results show the high efficiency of our approach. 1 Introduction With the scaling of device technology to deep submicron dimension, gate delay is getting faster by device scaling factor <b>S</b> and scaled <b>wires</b> increase d [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHeat {{exchangers}} {{tubes in}} critical thermal {{power plants and}} waste heat recovery boilers are typically made of SA 210 A 1 ferritic steels operated in the temperature range of 300 - 400 °C. In this study, an attempt {{has been made to}} investigate the weldability of SA 210 A 1 rifle tubular steel using Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA) welding technique employing ER 70 <b>S</b> 2 filler <b>wire</b> and Shielded Metal Arc (SMA) welding technique using E 7018 electrode. Comparative studies were performed to investigate the effect of welding process on the metallurgical and mechanical properties of these weldments. Microstructure studies inferred the formation of Widmanstatten ferrite and ferrite- cementite matrix (alternate lamellas) at the heat affected zone in both the weldments. Tensile studies confirmed that the GTA weldments have better mechanical properties compared to the SMA weldments. A detailed structure - property relationship has been made using the combined techniques of optical and SEM microscopy...|$|R
