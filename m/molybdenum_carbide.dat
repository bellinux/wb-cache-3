The phase and facet of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbides</b> greatly affect the electrochemical performance. Carburization of MoO 3 inside a transmission electron microscope to monitor the growth process of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbides</b> is performed. Carbon sources with different activities are used and the controllable growth of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbides</b> is investigated. The {{results show that the}} relatively inert amorphous carbon film produces Mo 2 C, where the interstitial sites formed by hexagonal closed packing molybdenum atoms are partially occupied by carbon atoms. In contrast, the carbon decomposed from the sucrose has a high portion of sp(3) hybridized and crosslinked carbon atoms with high reactivity, leading to the formation of MoC with full occupation of interstitial sites by carbon atoms. In addition, the MoC growth experiences a (111) to (100) facets change with the increase of temperature. The (111) facet formed at low temperature has Mo-terminated or C-terminated surface with higher surface energy and higher reactivity, while the (100) facet with 1 : 1 C/Mo ratio on the surface exhibits enhanced stability.

40|$|The {{search for}} fuel sources that provide {{alternatives}} to crude oil {{has been a}} continuing priority. The research described investigates material property-reactivity relationships that influence the catalytic performance of early transition-metal carbides and nitrides for reactions involved in the conversion of biomass to liquid transportation fuels, namely selective hydrogenation of oxygenates, water-gas shift, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. 	In particular, this work focuses on understanding the role of three main physical properties on catalyst chemistry, composition, structure, and catalytic reactivity: hydrogen adsorption sites; surface redox chemistry; and strong metal-catalytic support interactions. Experimental and computational results indicate that molybdenum nitride contains hydrogen adsorption sites both on the surface (NH) and in the subsurface layers (MoH). The relative density of surface versus subsurface hydrogen {{was found to have}} a direct effect on the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, with materials consisting of 95 % subsurface hydrogen yielding ~ 93 % selectivity to crotyl alcohol (C=O hydrogenation). Another study compared the synthesis, structural and compositional properties, and water gas shift activities of catalysts produced by depositing platinum onto unpassivated and passivated <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbide.</b> Passivation (controlled surface oxidation) {{had a profound effect on}} the character of interactions between the Pt and support resulting in deleterious effects on Pt loadings, structures, and water gas shift rates. In particular, the unpassivated support adsorbed 3 times as much Pt and exhibited water-gas shift turnover frequencies nearly 4 times higher than those for the passivated support. These differences were determined to result from redox chemistry occurring between <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbide</b> and the depositing Pt. Lastly, the presence of strong interactions, facilitated at high temperatures, between a <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbide</b> support and deposited early transition metals was probed using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Ruthenium and cobalt were found to be inactive when supported on <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbide</b> but not on silica, a typical Fischer-Tropsch support. By avoiding high temperature treatments, addition of ruthenium to <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbide</b> resulted in turnover frequencies 18 times higher than those of bare <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbide</b> alone and 4 times that of ruthenium on silicon dioxide.

In order to characterise the reactivity of the lattice carbon and nitrogen species within the obtained materials various techniques have been applied.

Therefore, {{a small amount of}} platinum metal added onto the WC component is very convenient to gain the advantage of the synergetic effect between Pt and WC [91, 111, 112]. Meanwhile, Hassan et al. [109] revealed that the common impurity (CO species) that forms during methanol oxidation has strong binding energy on the Pt surface; therefore, it must be oxidized {{so that it can be}} removed from the Pt active sites. The addition of WC component in Pt/WC electrocatalyst has shown high CO tolerance for MOR, which indicates the existence of synergetic effects between the Pt metal and WC as the support component. The study was also performed by another researcher by using less Pt metal to reduce the cost of Pt, while maintaining good electrocatalytic performance.|$|R

The cohesion at these grain boundaries affects the hardness, deformability and toughness of the material {{and it can be}} enhanced or decreased by segregated impurities. In this context, it is essential to understand interfacial cohesion and impurity segregation in detail, and it is vital to investigate the relationship between these microscopic features and the macroscopic properties in order to find general rules describing the latter. Knowing these rules will enable us not only to understand but also to some extent manipulate the material properties. In this work the influence of the interstitial impurities B, C, N, O, and H on the interfacial cohesion and structure of a special grain boundary in the body- centered cubic transition metals Nb and Mo is investigated by means of ab-initio calculations. The method is based on the local-density-functional theory (LDFT) and uses the mixed-basis pseudopotential approach. The analysis of interface energies and geometric translation states, site-projected densities of states and bonding electron densities yields systematic trends according to the valence configuration of the involved elements. In a continued study the influence of a MoC precipitate at the Mo grain boundary on the atomic structure and the material's properties is investigated. This investigation facilitates the interpretation of high-resolution transmission-electron-microscopy (HRTEM) images of the investigated grain boundary. Within this part of the work the limits of a sensible use of the ab-initio method are reached. Thus, in {{the last part of the}} thesis, the possibilities of describing the Mo-C system by a semi-empirical tight-binding model and of fitting the models free parameters to ab-initio data of different bulk phases of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>carbides</b> and semicarbides are discussed.
