500|$|Iñárritu {{has made}} a special point of {{emphasizing}} the importance of historical issues of ethnicity approached in the film and reflected in the mixed ethnic background of Hugh Glass's son portrayed in the film (portrayed as half Pawnee by Glass's wife) as relating to his own life and his identification with ethnic concerns. Iñárritu has referred to having encountered constant xenophobia and stated that: [...] "These constant and relentless xenophobic (comments) have been widely spread by the media without shame, embraced and cheered by leaders and communities around the U.S. The foundation {{of all this is}} so outrageous that it can easily be minimized as an SNL sketch, a mere entertainment, a joke ... I debated with <b>myself,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should bring up this uncomfortable subject tonight but in light of the constant and relentless xenophobic comments that have been expressed recently against my Mexican fellows, it is inevitable." ...|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

[...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had to. As Latinas, we have to... Because writing is like putting your head underwater." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do it to <b>myself.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> have to go into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I told <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, [...] "'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And {{it was beginning to}} rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to ask <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. So maybe {{it would be fun to}} stick around for a couple more years - if I'm wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|This led Morgan to ask Morley {{about the}} League of Nations: [...] "A mirage, {{and an old}} one". Morgan asked: [...] "How {{are you going to}} enforce it?", whereupon Morley replied: [...] "How indeed? One may as well talk of London {{morality}} being due to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But take away Scotland Yard!" [...] When asked in 1919 about the Covenant of the League of Nations Morley said: [...] "I have not read it, and I don't intend to read it. It's not worth the paper it's written on. To the end of time it'll always be a case of 'Thy head or my head'. I've no faith in these schemes". When a prominent Liberal praised someone as [...] "a good European" [...] Morley remarked: [...] "When I lay me down at night or rise in the morning I do not ask <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am a good European".

2500|$|He assumed co-editorship of the School for Living's Brookville, Ohio-based Balanced Living {{magazine}} in 1962 and briefly returned to New York as {{associate editor of}} Ralph Ginzburg's quarterly fact: before leaving for Playboy, where he served as an associate editor from 1965 to 1971. According to Wilson, Playboy [...] "paid me a higher salary than any other magazine at which I had worked and never expected me to become a conformist or sell my soul in return. I enjoyed my years in the Bunny Empire. I only resigned when I reached 40 and felt I could not live with <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{make an effort to}} write full-time at last." [...] Along with frequent collaborator Robert Shea, Wilson edited the magazine's Playboy Forum (not to be confused with The Playboy Advisor). During this period, he covered Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert's Millbrook, New York-based Castalia Foundation at the instigation of Alan Watts in The Realist, cultivated important friendships with William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, and lectured at the Free University of New York on 'Anarchist and Synergetic Politics' in 1965.|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt <b>myself</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E

2500|$|Origen of Alexandria (c. 240), as {{quoted by}} Eusebius (c. 330) {{had this to}} say on the matter: [...] "That the {{character}} of the diction of the epistle entitled To the Hebrews has not the apostle’s rudeness in speech, who confessed himself rude in speech, that is, in style, but that the epistle is better Greek in the framing of its diction, will be admitted by everyone who is able to discern differences of style. But again, on the other hand, that the thoughts of the epistle are admirable, and not inferior to the acknowledged writings of the apostle, to this also everyone will consent as true who has given attention to reading the apostle…. But as for <b>myself,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to state my own opinion, I should say that the thoughts are the apostle’s, but that the style and composition belonged to one who called to mind the apostle’s teachings and, as it were, made short notes of what his master said. If any church, therefore, holds this epistle as Paul’s, let it be commended for this also. For not without reason have the men of old handed it down as Paul’s. But who wrote the epistle, in truth God knows. Yet the account which has reached us , some saying that Clement, who was bishop of the Romans, wrote the epistle, others, that it was Luke, he who wrote the Gospel and the Acts." ...|$|E
