50|$|<b>Micrometeorology</b> is {{significant}} in that sound waves can be refracted by wind gradients or thermoclines, effectively dismissing {{the effect of}} some noise barriers or terrain intervention. Geometry of area structures is an important input, since the presence of buildings or walls can block sound under certain circumstances, but reflective properties can augment sound energy at other locations.|$|E

50|$|Noise {{barriers}} can {{be applicable}} for {{existing or planned}} surface transportation projects. They are probably the single most effective weapon in retrofitting an existing roadway, and commonly can reduce adjacent land use sound levels by up to ten decibels. A computer model is required to design the barrier since terrain, <b>micrometeorology</b> and other locale specific factors make the endeavor a very complex undertaking. For example, a roadway in cut or strong prevailing winds can produce a setting where atmospheric sound propagation is unfavorable to any noise barrier.|$|E
50|$|The {{content of}} this journal covers physical, {{chemical}} and biological processes occurring in the lowest few kilometres of the Earth's atmosphere. During its existence, Boundary-Layer Meteorology has become the primary medium for the publication of theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of the atmospheric boundary layer over both land and sea surfaces. Subject areas covered in the journal include: agriculture and forestry, air pollution, hydrology, theoretical and numerical experimental studies of the atmospheric boundary layer over land and sea surfaces, <b>micrometeorology,</b> the planetary boundary layer, numerical modelling of the lower atmosphere, remote sensing and urban meteorology.|$|E
50|$|The eddy {{covariance}} (also {{known as}} eddy correlation and eddy flux) technique {{is a key}} atmospheric measurement technique to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within atmospheric boundary layers. The method analyzes high-frequency wind and scalar atmospheric data series, and yields values of fluxes of these properties. It is a statistical method used in meteorology and other applications (<b>micrometeorology,</b> oceanography, hydrology, agricultural sciences, industrial and regulatory applications, etc.) to determine exchange rates of trace gases over natural ecosystems and agricultural fields, and to quantify gas emissions rates from other land and water areas. It is frequently used to estimate momentum, heat, water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes.|$|E
5000|$|An {{idealized}} {{vertical profile}} of the mean flow for a neutral boundary layer is the logarithmic wind profile derived from Prandtl's mixing length theory, which states that the horizontal component of mean flow {{is proportional to the}} logarithm of height. M-O similarity theory further generalizes the mixing length theory in non-neutral conditions by using so-called [...] "universal functions" [...] of dimensionless height to characterize vertical distributions of mean flow and temperature. The Obukhov length (...) , a characteristic length scale of surface layer turbulence derived by Obukhov in 1946, is used for non-dimensional scaling of the actual height. M-O similarity theory marked a significant landmark of modern <b>micrometeorology,</b> providing a theoretical basis for micrometerological experiments and measurement techniques.|$|E

He was awarded the William Farrer Memorial Scholarship and entered Cornell University, where he completed a Master of Science in <b>Micrometeorology,</b> and a Ph.D in biochemistry, organic chemistry and plant sciences. After post-graduate studies at Brandeis University and the Charles F. Kettering Research Institute, he worked for a year in the advance staff in Senator Eugene McCarthy’s unsuccessful campaign for the US presidency in 1968. This was followed in 1969 by work for the City of New York in the social justice program ‘Model Cities’.

She did pioneer work on the relaxed eddy accumulation technique to measure trace gas fluxes. She has contributed to international efforts for verifying process-based models for greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia volatilization from agricultural sources, and for assimilating biophysical descriptors using remote sensing data in soil and crop growth models.In her research, she evaluates the impact of beneficial management practices on air quality {{and the impact of}} climate variations on the sustainability of crop production.In other current projects, she quantified crop growth and biomass in response to weather and soil conditions using remote sensing, <b>micrometeorology,</b> and modelling techniques, and she quantified greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices at the field-, farm-, and regional-scales using micrometeorological techniques and laser instrumentation. She also developed biophysical descriptors and procedures for assimilating remote-sensing data to derive yield estimates and determine site-specific agricultural management practices.She was an active participant in The Boreal Ecosystem - Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), and she measured the fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, and isoprene in the Southern Old Black Spruce site in Saskatchewan.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the Pacific Northwest have {{suggested}} a link between forest logging and increased streamflows. We present {{a brief overview of}} previous experimental efforts designed to identify mechanisms for these increases, especially during rain-on-snow (ROS) and spring snowmelt events. To extend the applicability of these data, we describe our measurement of snow accumulation, melt, and <b>micrometeorology</b> in existing uncut forest and shelterwood units as part of the Demonstration of Ecosystem Management Options (DEMO) study. Uncut forest units are dominated by over 100 -year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) with stand basal areas of ca. 40 m 2 /ha. <b>Micrometeorology</b> is measured 2 m above the ground surface in each 13 -ha unit. Snow accumulation and melt are measured via weekly snow courses. Snowpack outflow is obtained from two 2. 6 m 2 non-weighing snow lysimeters in each unit. Large (25 m 2) weighing lysimeters provide a continuous record of snowpack evolution at scales unaffected by variability in canopy throughfall. Snow interception is measured by continuous weighing of cut trees. Harvest treatments will be imposed during summer 1998 and additional post-harvest data will be collected. Pre-harvest data indicate up to 60 % greater (33 mm) 3 -day production of runoff and 150 % greater (22 mm) 3 -day snowmelt (outflow minus throughfall) in the shelterwood than in the uncut forest unit during ROS events. Snowmelt during radiation-dominated spring events is ca. 50 % greater (15 mm) in the shelterwood. Results from the weighing lysimeters show high correlation with snow course data from the shelterwood but poor correlation with those from the uncut forest due to small scale spatial variability in tree canopy coverStorck et al "Measurement of differences in snow accumulation, melt, and <b>micrometeorology</b> due to forest harvesting.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{monitoring}} and predictive alarm systems {{is necessary for}} successful overhead power transmission line icing. Given the characteristics of complexity, nonlinearity, and fitfulness in the line icing process, a model based on a multivariable time series is presented here to predict the icing load of a transmission line. In this model, the time effects of <b>micrometeorology</b> parameters for the icing process have been analyzed. The phase-space reconstruction theory and machine learning method were then applied to establish the prediction model, which fully utilized the history of multivariable time series data in local monitoring systems to represent the mapping relationship between icing load and <b>micrometeorology</b> factors. Relevant to the characteristic of fitfulness in line icing, the simulations were carried out during the same icing process or different process to test the model’s prediction precision and robustness. According to the simulation results for the Tao-Luo-Xiong Transmission Line, this model demonstrates a good accuracy of prediction in different process, if the prediction length is less than two hours, and would be helpful for power grid departments when deciding to take action in advance to address potential icing disasters...|$|E

30|$|The {{evolution}} of PG and CO 2 during those nights, {{particularly when the}} GEC signal was anticipated, suggests that when CO 2 is increasing stably and has high concentrations, PG is suppressed and GEC observation is not possible. Therefore, CO 2 variations during stable nights could be complementarily used for categorizing days as suitable or not suitable in GEC monitoring, assuming the absence of factors that could exclusively change PG such as charged clouds overhead and aerosols. Additionally, single-point CO 2 measurements can be utilized as turbulence proxies and can give information on the {{evolution of}} atmospheric electricity properties (i.e., PG). In that way, a connection between <b>micrometeorology,</b> atmospheric gases, and atmospheric electricity is established.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{multi-layer}} 'K-theory ' {{model for}} gaseous deposition to a deciduous forest is described and discussed. The model incorporates realistic physiological concepts to improve upon earlier multi-layer models {{found in the}} literature. Computations of deposition fluxes and velocities are most sensitive to variations in parameters relating to stomatal resistance. The model computations of deposition velocities are less sensitive to aerodynamic parameters since the canopy resistance of a deciduous forest is generally {{much greater than the}} aerodynamic resistance. Model computations of SO 2 flux and deposition velocities are tested against deposition measurements made over a deciduous forest; these computations are not significantly different from measured values. Estimates of deposition fluxes, computed with multi-layer model, improve upon those values estimated with a "big-leaf " model.

The average vapor phase and particle phase PAHs concentration in Shenzhen was 101. 3 and 26. 7 ng m 2 ̆ 2123, respectively. Meteorological conditions showed great effect on PAH concentrations. The higher PAHs concentrations observed during haze episode might result from the accumulation of pollutants under decreased boundary layer, slower wind speed, and long-term dryness conditions.
