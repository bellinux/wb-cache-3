50|$|Harry Ferguson {{applied for}} a British patent for his three-point hitch in 1926, a three-point {{attachment}} of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The Ferguson-Brown Company produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed hydraulic hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world.

This allows the operator to drive the tractor backwards and use rear <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> more efficiently. Only Fendt has provided a similar fully integrated reverse-drive system, while in other brands such devices have been post-manufacture, third party additions.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1930s the linkage design was {{finalised}} {{and is now}} adopted as international standard category I. Just one prototype Ferguson System tractor, known as the Ferguson Black, was built to further technical development and for demonstrating to potential manufacturers. During 1936 the first production Ferguson tractors were built in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, by the David Brown Company. This tractor, the Ferguson Model 'A', incorporated Harry Ferguson's 'suction side' hydraulic control system, the key to solving sensitive automatic control of three point <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> and patented on 5 February 1936 (patent no 470069). The combination of Ferguson's converging three point hitch, patented on 3 July 1928 (patent no 320084) with his 'suction side control' valve {{is the key to}} the success of all subsequent Ferguson and later Massey Ferguson 'Ferguson System' tractors, the most important of which are the TE and TO 20 models.

For {{measuring the}} forces between the tractor and the <b>mounted</b> <b>implements,</b> three-point hitch dynamometers are used. In this research, an adjustable three-point hitch dynamometer with a draft capacity of 25 kN was designed and built which is made up from two frames {{that one of them}} placed inside the other. The force sensing elements were comprised of a loadcell that was installed between the frames. All mounted tillage implements were able to be tested by this measuring device excluding <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> which are powered by PTO and by using this dynamometer, the variations of implements draft force in the different tillage conditions consist of the various work depths and different forward speeds would be studied.

In this introductory study, the effect of some characteristic parameters, such as tyre pressure, and herewith related tyre stiffness, and mass addition on the dynamic behaviour and, more specifically, on the resonance frequencies of a lawn mower, are analysed by experimental modal analysis. After adapting the modal model, field unevenness instead of disturbance forces could be introduced as excitation inputs. A final validation of the adapted modal models shows good agreement with measured lawn mower vibrations. (C) 1997 ISTVS. status: publishe...|$|E

Como elemento sensor, usou-se um anel simples para tração/compressão, {{instruments}} do a extensômetros elétricos em ponte completa, conectado por cabos de aço flexíveis entre a barra do implemento e a base da torre intermediária. Projetado para trabalhos na faixa de 0 - 6. 000 N, submetido a testes de calibração estática, mostrou alta linearidade de resposta com R = 0, 9997, um excelente retorno ao zero e resolução em torno de 70 N. O conjunto, levado a testes com uma unidade semeadora-adubadora de sete linhas, em terreno firme, plano e inclinado, acusou esforços altamente consistentes com valores resultantes de cálculos simples; isso, aliado à simplicidade de sua concepção, confere-lhe um caráter de alta confiabilidade. O uso do conjunto altera a geometria trator-implemento, o que não constitui problema maior quando se está interessado em esforços de fração apenas, em se tratando desse tipo de implemento. Valores obtidos em trabalhos em terreno plano e preparado para plantio, bastante discrepantes dos encontrados em literatura, mostram a conveniência da execução de trabalhos sistemáticos para o conhecimento das reais necessidades de tração desses implementos em nossas condições. An intermediary tower-articulated arm device, for {{attachment to}} three-point hitch of <b>mounted</b> <b>implements,</b> with ground whells, more specifically, multiple row seed-planters, {{was developed and}} tested on draft determination works. A single ring with electrical extensometers connected in full bridge, was used for sense traction compression efforts, anchored by flexible steel cables between the implement bar and {{the base of the}} intermediary tower. Designed for works on tie range of 0 - 6, 000 N, submitted to static calibration tests, showed high linearity, with R = 0. 9997, an excellent zero return and a resolution of around 70 N. A seven row seed-planter was then tested in two sites, firm ground, plane and inclined, and plane, prepared for planting. Draft values from the two first conditions were highly consistent with results obtained from simple theoretical calculus. This, allied to it's simplicity of conception, confers to tire device a great deal of reliability. It's use alters the tractor-implement geometry, not being a major problem if there is interest on draft efforts only, for these kind of implements.

40|$|An {{instrumentation}} system to measure tractor field performance {{was developed and}} refined. The system consisted of four sections: transducers, a signal conditioner, a data acquisition system, and a data analysis system;A John Deere 4430 tractor was equipped with the {{instrumentation system}}. The transducers measured fuel flow, travel speed, wheel rotational speed, drawbar pull, and rear axle torque. The data acquisition system included an interface board, an AIM 65 microcomputer and a digital cassette recorder (Techtran 817). The microcomputer program was developed with an assembly language so that the system could display and record the data including time, fuel flow rate, travel speed, distance traveled, wheel slip, drawbar pull, and axle torque. The data collected in the field were dumped to and analyzed by a main frame computer. This system functioned relatively well, but still needed some modifications;To improve the system, an RM 65 microcomputer was substituted for the AIM 65. The RM 65 was more compact in size and flexible in design. A computer programmable signal conditioner with 16 dual channels was built to replace the original signal conditioner.

40|$|Problem statement: Field {{machines}} {{contribute a}} major portion of the total cost of crop production. Proper selection and matching of farm machinery is essential {{in order to reduce the}} cost of crop production. Performance data for tractors and implements are, therefore, essential for farm machinery operators and manufacturers alike. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an instrumentation system for tractor and agricultural implements. Approach: An instrumentation system was developed and mounted on an MF 3090 tractor to measure and record data for the various performance parameters of the tractor and attached tillage implements. The system was designed to measure: drawbar pull, three-point linkage forces, rear and front wheel forces, PTO torque, ground speed, tillage depth, fuel consumption, engine speed and fluid temperatures. Results: The system performed well during the field operations and the results obtained showed that the accuracies of the transducers were acceptable. The wheel torque and weight transducers measured the torque and forces acting on the tractor wheels with high accuracy. The other transducers measured the vertical and the horizontal forces on <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> of categories II (40 - 100 hp) and III (80 - 225 hp). The field tests showed significant increase in the draft with increases in the depth and speed. A general regression equation to predict draft of the implements was developed. Conclusion: The system was capable of measuring the draft of primary tillage implements on sandy loam soils at various speeds and depths with high accuracy. The data was recorded, displayed and analyzes simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|For {{measuring}} draft {{force and}} drawbar power requirements for <b>mounted</b> <b>implements,</b> precise instruments such as three-point hitch dynamometers and tractor speed measurement devices are needed. In this research, a frame-type three-point hitch dynamometer was built and evaluated. Forces applied to dynamometer are measured by three separate load cells {{located on a}} frame which can be attached to tractor’s three-point hitch. Each dynamometer’s load cell measures load using a strain gauge bridge circuit. Each load cell was calibrated by applying a known load and measuring bridge circuit’s output voltage. Dynamometer was calibrated by the application of known forces and measuring the output voltage of the strain gauge bridges. The calibration showed {{a high degree of}} linearity between the applied forces and the bridge outputs (R 2 = 0. 996). The hysteresis effect between loading and unloading as well as the effect of the position of the applied forces from the longitudinal axis of the dynamometer was small. For measuring actual tractor speed, a fifth wheel equipped with an encoder shaft was designed and built. The calibration on tarmac and soil surfaces showed a highly linear relation between measured forward speed and output of encoder’s rotation (R 2 = 0. 994). The errors in speed measurements at low speed in field and at high speed (up to 12. 5 km/h) on tarmac surface were approximately 3 and 8 %, respectively. The data acquisition system, not only could display the instantaneous force and speed, it could also show force-time and force-distance curves on the system’s monitor...|$|E

40|$|When {{introducing}} a new farm tractor in the market, manufacturers undergo a tight homologation path {{under the supervision}} of the OECD centres technicians. Two of the most requested tests, although not mandatory for the commercialization of a tractor, are the individuation of the centre-of-gravity and of the lateral rollover angle on a tilting platform. The results of these tests are very interesting for the technical characterization of a vehicle but still far from its real working conditions, even if the tilting platform test forecasts, for example, the presence of fuel in the tank and the use of some weights to simulate the driver. Indeed, in this last test, no mounted implement (or equivalent mass) is connected to the tractor, hence limiting a lot the use of the results of the described tests. Therefore, a numeric stability simulator was developed to overcome this problem, thus managing the variety of the possible implements to be connected to a tractor and giving the farmers effective indications concerning their vehicles’ safety while working on hillsides. This simulator, based on a Newtonian approach, is able to compute the stability of a vehicle formed by a tractor and an implement. It was used to verify the possibility of safety using some common <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> with a compact wheeled articulated tractor, specifically designed to work within terraced orchards/vineyards, common in mountain areas. This tractor was chosen because of its particular architecture: it gives the tractor a higher agility and a shorter turning radius than conventional tractors with the same dimensions, but also a very different stability behaviour, maybe not completely predictable in all situations by inexperienced drivers...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of transition of <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> from operation to transport on longitudinal stability of a tractor that works on sloping land, a mathematical model was developed. In this model two operation modes for a mounted chisel plow were considered: penetration of the plow into the soil and depth reduction of it, {{and the effects of}} transferred forces and torques from the plow on longitudinal stability index of tractor were studied. Longitudinal stability index of tractor was defined as the ratio of the dynamic load of tractor front axle to the static load of it when tractor is on level ground. To test the model, different geometries and mass specifications of tractor MF 285 and chisel plow combination were used as the input parameters of the model. According to the results of this study, during plow penetration into the soil, internal forces of the connecting rods were zero and positive values were obtained for the internal force of the connecting rods during depth reduction of the plow; therefore, connecting rods acted only as pulling beams. Furthermore, when the plow depth was increased, the model predicted the increase of the force exerted on the center of gravity of tractor in X direction; however, the force exerted on the center of gravity of tractor in Z direction was almost not affected by the plow depth and height ratio variations. These results were expected and verified that the assumptions of the model have been rational. Moreover, longitudinal stability index of tractor during plow penetration was approximately constant. However at the moment of transition of the plow from operation to transport, this index was reduced abruptly. Therefore in situations that tractor works on steep slopes, plow transition from operation to transport should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|A methodological {{approach}} for evaluating a priori {{the stability of}} agricultural vehicles equipped with different <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> and operating on sloping hillsides is shown here. It uses a Matlab simulator in its first phase and, subsequently, the Response Surface Modelling (RSM) to evaluate the coefficients {{of a set of}} regression equations able to account for the Type-I and Type-II stability of the whole vehicle (tractor + implement with known dimensions and mass). The regression equations can give reliable punctual numeric estimations of the minimum value of the Roll Stability Index (RSI) and can verify the existence of a Type-I equilibrium without the need of using the simulator or knowing any detail about the model implemented in it. The same equations {{can also be used to}} generate many intuitive graphs (“equilibrium maps”) useful to verify quickly the possible overturning of the vehicle. A case-study concerning a 4 -wheel drive articulated tractor is then presented to show the potential of the approach and how using its tools. The tractor has been studied in three scenarios, differing on where the implement has to be connected to the tractor (1 : frontally; 2 : frontally-laterally; 3 : in the back). After performing a series of simulations, a set of polynomial models (with 6 independent variables) has been created and verified. Then, these models were used, together with the related equilibrium maps, to predict the stability of 8 implements for scenario 1, 7 implements for scenario 2, and 3 implements for scenario 3, evidencing in particular the danger of using a lateral shredder with a mass greater than 245 kg. The proposed approach and its main outcomes (i. e., the regression equations and the equilibrium maps) can give an effective contribution to the preventive safety of the tractor driver, so it could be useful to integrate it in the homologation procedures for every agricultural vehicle and to include the resulting documentation within the tractor logbook...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the comfort and the {{preservation}} of the health of the operators became central issues in the evolution of agricultural machinery and led to the introduction of devices aimed at improving working conditions. Thereby, for instance, the presence of air conditioner, soundproof cab and driver seat suspension became normal on agricultural tractors. The vibrations {{are one of the most}} complex issues to deal with, being determined by the characteristics and interaction of elements such as tyres, axles, mainframe, cab and seat suspension. In this respect, manufacturers are trying to improve their products, even integrating these elements with new devices such as the suspension on the front axle of the tractor, aimed at reducing the level of vibrations during the transfers at high speed. One of these underwent tests at CRA-ING. Since its purpose is to reduce the level of vibration transmitted to the driver, their measurements in different points of the tractor and in different operating conditions, were compared in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the device, expressed as time of exposure. The suspension system of the front axle is designed to absorb the oscillations (especially pitching) determined by irregularities in the road surface, allowing an increased control of the vehicle at high speed, as demonstrated by the test results and confirmed by the driving impressions outlined by the operator. The action of the device under these conditions results in an increase of the exposure time, important fact because of the relevance of the road transfer operations of tractors with <b>mounted</b> <b>implements</b> or trailers to tow and of the tendency to increase the speed limit for the road tractors (in Germany were brought to 50 km h– 1 for several years). The action just described is less evident with increasing irregularity of the road surface and with the decrease of the travel speed. Nevertheless, in such conditions, the device appears to positively work along the other directions, in particular in the Z-axis, improving the action of the suspension of the driver seat...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{population}} is driving automatization in agricultural industry {{to strive for}} more productive arable land. Being part of this process, this work is aimed to investigate the possibility to implement sensor-based automation in a particular system called Front End Loader, which is a lifting arms that is commonly mounted {{on the front of}} a tractor. Two main tasks are considered here, namely Electronic Self Leveling (ESL) and payload estimation. To propose commercially implementable solutions for these tasks, specific objectives are set, which are: 1) to propose a controller to perform ESL under typical disturbances 2) to propose a methodology for payload estimation considering realistic estimation conditions. Lastly, aligned with these goals, 3) to propose models for the Front End Loader under consideration for derivation of solutions of the specified tasks. The self-leveling task assists farmers in maintaining the angular position of the <b>mounted</b> <b>implements,</b> e. g. a bale handler or a bucket, with respect to the ground when the loader is manually lifted or lowered. Experimental results show that different controllers are required in lifting and lowering motions to maintain the implement's angular position with a required accuracy due to principle differences in gravity impact. The gravity helps the necessary correction in lifting motion, but works against the correction in lowering motions. This led us to propose a controller with a proportional term, a discontinuous term and an on-line disturbance estimation and compensation as well as the tuning procedure to achieve a 2 degrees tracking error for lowering motions in steady state. The proposed controller shows less sensitive performance to lowering velocity, as the main disturbance, in comparison to a linear controller. The second task, payload estimation, assists farmers to work within safety range as well as to work with a weight measurement tool. A mechanical model derived based on equations of motion is improved by a pressure based friction to sufficiently accurately represent the motion of the front end loader under consideration. The proposed model satisfies the desired estimation accuracy of 2 % full scale error in a certain estimation condition domain in constant velocity regions, with off-line calibration step and off-line payload estimation step. An on-line version of the estimation based on Recursive Least Squares also fulfills the desired accuracy, while keeping the calibration step off-line...|$|E
