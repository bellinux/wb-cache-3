During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square. In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.|$|E

He transferred West and served throughout the campaign before Vicksburg, leading the assaults made by General Sherman; and upon its fall was placed in command of a division in the XVI Corps. At Chattanooga, he was given command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps, which formed the advance of Sherman's army and carried Missionary Ridge. Prior to the Battle of Chattanooga, Ewing's command led a diversionary raid {{that resulted in the}} destruction of the Empire State Iron Works in Dade County, Georgia, which was being refurbished to increase the South's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capability.</b> Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander.|$|E
40|$|Many large {{companies}} {{have for a}} long time been very successful in their industries by combining leading edge R&D and marketing with strong internal <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> An alternative model is now getting increased attention, where R&D and marketing is conducted internally and manufacturing performed by outsourcing partners. This development is partly due to divergent views on the strategic role of manufacturing capabilities: expendable commodities that can be purchased from a low-cost provider versus resources essential for sustaining long-term competitive advantage. Although assessments of the strategic role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> have been performed previously, recent supply chain trends such as globalisation and fragmentation mean that they may no longer be relevant. The purpose of the thesis is to assess the strategic role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> for a product-owning firm, by focusing on what impact its internal <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> have on the effectiveness of the supply chain. Two methods have been used for the research: survey and case study. The survey is representative for the entire Swedish manufacturing sector, whereas the case studies are to some extent industry- or company-specific. Two companies were researched: one in the telecom equipment sector, the other a supplier to multiple sectors, including the telecom equipment sector. The results of the research have been presented in five scientific articles that are also found in the appendices. The thesis argues that in order to evaluate the strategic role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities,</b> it is important to look at how they contribute to the focal firm’s competitive priorities. When the technology is new, the competitive priority tends to be innovation, and the role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> is to facilitate more efficient NPD. When products mature, low cost becomes the dominant competitive priority, and the role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> is to facilitate a high operational efficiency of the supply chain. Although the potential role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> is dependent on the firms’ competitive priorities, just possessing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> will not automatically translate into high performance. Instead, the performance outcome is dependent on both the level of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> and, even more importantly, how they are leveraged through the integration of customers, suppliers and the product development department. This thesis contributes to the discourse on the role of manufacturing in two ways. First, the thesis investigates how competitive priorities impact the role of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> in the supply chain. Second, this thesis explores how <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> influence the efficiency of integration. The main theoretical contribution is to develop and test the concept of manufacturing absorptive capacity within the context of manufacturing capabilities’ role in the supply chain. The thesis concludes that <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> are almost inevitably seen as strategic because they help firms integrate external sources more efficiently, thereby achieving performance improvement in terms of both operational efficiency and efficient product development. When the performance improvement corresponds with the prevailing competitive priority, the supply chain can be said to be effective. <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> can thus act as a catalyst for effective supply chain management.

Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford.

500|$|Gottschalk {{learned from}} one of his vendors that Bausch & Lomb, whom Fox had {{contracted}} to manufacture CinemaScope lenses, was having difficulty filling the lens orders for theatrical anamorphic projection equipment. He teamed up with William Mann, who provided optical <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capability,</b> and Walter Wallin, an optical physicist who was an acquaintance of Mann's. The anamorphic lens design they selected was prismatic rather than the cylindrical design of the Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lens. This design meant the anamorphic lens extension factor—how much the image is horizontally unsqueezed—could be manually shifted, useful for projectionists switching between nonanamorphic ("flat" [...] or [...] "spherical") trailers and an anamorphic feature. The result was the anamorphosing system, designed by Wallin, used in the Panatar lens; the patent for the system was filed on August 11, 1954, and awarded five years later.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA five-step {{framework}} {{to support the}} development of strategic <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> through dynamic process cost modelling is presented. The framework aims to develop insight into what <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> are required to reach the strategic goals. The framework combines system dynamics simulation with process cost modelling and visual exploratory data analysis in an iterative process of hypothesis formulation and model development. The presented framework links the strategy process to the choice of production and operations improvement initiatives on the plant level. System dynamics encourages a high level perspective that permits <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> to be interpreted in terms of generic production features instead of choice of technology or practice. The value of dynamic process cost modelling as a support to the strategy formulation process is shown. The applicability of the five-step framework is demonstrated through a case study from the steel industry...|$|R

Significant amounts of 125mm anti-tank rounds manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board were rejected. The problems were traced to improper packaging {{of the charges}} by the OFB, leading to propellant leakage during storage at high temperatures. The locally developed rounds were rectified and requalified. Production of these local rounds was then restarted. Since 2001, over [...] rounds have been manufactured by the OFB. The DRDO said in 2005 that it had developed a Mk2 version of the 125mm round, with higher power propellant for greater penetration.
