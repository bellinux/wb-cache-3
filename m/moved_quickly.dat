5|$|In June 1945, Bradman faced a {{financial}} crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{stricken}} with polio, {{and was one}} of the moving forces of the March of Dimes. The ten-cent coin could be changed by the Mint without the need for congressional action, and officials <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to replace the Mercury dime. Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock prepared models, but faced repeated criticism from the Commission of Fine Arts. He modified his design in response, and the coin went into circulation in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|After the {{approval}} of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members decided to have the coin show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned Sherry Fry, who had created a statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design the coin. On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon London, called Lundenwic, {{was located}} a mile west of Roman Londinium, but Lundenwic was undefended, and the {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} inside {{the walls of the}} old Roman city, especially an area close to the River Thames now called Queenhithe, but which was then known as Æthelred's Hythe after its Mercian ruler. Æthelred <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to restore the area; in 889 he and Alfred granted property there to the Bishop of Worcester, and in 899 they made another grant to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both bishops were, like Æthelred, Mercians and strong allies of King Alfred, who had the right to all tolls from markets along the river bank.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> from one point to another, always changing the course of events wherever they appeared, and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|By 926 Sihtric {{had evidently}} {{acknowledged}} Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within {{the year he}} may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, Gofraid, who had remained as his deputy in Dublin, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan <b>moved</b> <b>quickly,</b> seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, {{the kingdom of the}} English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the Firth of Forth.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Claudette was {{the third}} {{tropical}} storm and first hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. A fairly long-lived July Atlantic hurricane, Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean. It <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> westward, brushing past the Yucatán Peninsula before moving northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O'Connor, Texas, when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime, resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iniki made {{landfall}} on the south-central {{portion of}} Kauai island, bringing its dangerous inner core {{to the entire}} island. Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5–6feet (1.4–1.8m), with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet (5.5m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35feet (10.5m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800feet (250m) inland. Because it <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> through the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court martial of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though {{the men who were}} court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.|$|E

5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Airlanding Brigade <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> {{to secure}} the landing zones. The 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment moved into Wolfheze, the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment secured DZ 'X', {{deploying}} its companies around the DZ and in Renkum, and the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers moved to secure DZ 'Y'. Here, they ambushed the Dutch SS Wach Battalion as it headed toward Arnhem from Ede. Units of the Airlanding Artillery and Divisional HQ headed into Wolfheze and Oosterbeek where medical officers set up a Regimental Aid Post {{at the home of}} Kate ter Horst.|$|E
5|$|Michael II in Epirus was {{not part}} of the brothers' agreement, and {{continued}} to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles. In 1241, when Manuel died, Michael <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to occupy Thessaly. In June of the same year, John Asen died, leaving the throne to his seven-year-old son Kaliman (r. 1241–46). Coupled with the increasingly deteriorating situation of the Latin Empire, this development left John Vatatzes of Nicaea as the pre-eminent ruler of the region, and the obvious candidate for the capture of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|On February2, a non-frontal low {{formed in}} the western Caribbean Sea {{two months after the}} end of the {{hurricane}} season. It <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> north-northwestward and acquired gale-force winds as it brushed the northern coast of Cuba. Early on February3, the storm struck Cape Sable, Florida and quickly crossed the state. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68mph (110km/h) during its passage. The winds damaged windows and power lines, catching residents and tourists off-guard. The cyclone also dropped 2–4inches (50–100mm) of precipitation along its path, causing crop damage in Miami-Dade County.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> to take {{advantage}} of their victory: a Byzantine army invaded Arab-held Armenia, and sometime in October or November, defeated and killed the emir Ali ibn Yahya. Thus, within a single campaigning season, the Byzantines had eliminated the three most dangerous opponents on their eastern border. In retrospect, these successes proved decisive, as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene. The Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the strategic balance in the region, and heralded the beginning of Byzantium's century-long offensive in the East.|$|E
5|$|Though Gloria <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> {{through the}} region, it dropped {{moderate}} rainfall in locations, including 6.04 inches (153 mm) at Baltimore–Washington International Airport. In addition, some unofficial reports in southeastern Virginia indicated amounts {{of up to}} 8 inches (200 mm) of rain. Because much of the Mid-Atlantic experienced the western, weaker side of this hurricane, damage was relatively light. High winds downed numerous trees throughout the area, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, including 237,000 in New Jersey, 124,000 in Maryland, and 56,000 in Virginia. Extreme rainfall in Virginia resulted in $5.5 million (1985 USD) in damage. Intense flood waters split Long Beach Island in half {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
