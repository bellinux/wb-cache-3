40|$|A damaged input pinion, part No. 201 P 636 H 1302 201 bearing Sl. No. HDSN 527, {{belonging}} to Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) was forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed {{loss of material}} by spalling on the loading flank of two teeth of the pinion. Spalling was resulted due to surface contact fatigue. It was discovered that there were rough <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> on the flank of the teeth. The stress concentrators at these <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> {{were responsible for the}} premature surface contact fatigue crack initiation in the teeth. Subsequently, the surface contact fatigue has manifested in the form of spalling leading to loss of material from the loading flank surface. Evidences also suggest that probably, the working load on the pinion was in the higher side. It is believed that this in conjunction with the stress concentrators in the form of <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> has accelerated the surface contact fatigue crack initiation. Laboratory test results show that the material of construction of the pinion conforms to the design specification in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, surface hardness, case depth, and core hardness. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure of the pinion. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of two air-abrasive prophylaxis systems and the effect of inlet air pressure on the surface of BrÅnemark titanium abutment cylinders. Materials and Methods : Single abutment cylinders were treated with either the Prophy-Jet system (sodium bicarbonate abrasive) (Dentsply International, York, PA) or the Microprophy system (aluminum oxide abrasive) (Danville Engineering Co, Danville, CA) for 60 seconds at an inlet air pressure of 60 psi or 90 psi. The effects on the surface of each abutment cylinder were visually inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Results : A comparison of abutment cylinder surfaces after treatment showed that the Prophy Jet system removed <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> to a greater degree than the Microprophy system. Sodium bicarbonate particles from the Prophy-Jet system were significantly larger than the aluminum oxide particles used with the Microprophy system, potentially accounting for the difference in abrasivity. In addition, inlet air pressure of 60 psi caused removal of <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> to a greater degree than an inlet air pressure of 90 psi. The principle of phase separation may account for the lower inlet air pressure causing more removal of <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> than the higher inlet air pressure. Conclusions : Under the experimental conditions tested, neither of the two systems tested seemed to cause significant abrasion of the surface of titanium abutment cylinders...|$|E

40|$|Single-point diamond {{turning of}} soft metals {{could provide a}} much shiny surface with an optimal feed rate; however, the {{machining}} mark would be left on the machined surface, which caused the roughness cannot be neglected. If the feed rate is too small, the roughness of the surface could be improved but the reflectiveness would be decreased because of damaging the profile. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop a lapping method to reduce the roughness by removing the machining mark, while the reflectiveness can be kept at the original level simultaneously. In this study, the novel lapping method, using strands of wool fibers to deliver the abrasive slurry to rub against the lens, was proposed for removing the <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> on the mold of a lenticular lens by lapping without damaging the profile of the mold. Even though the normal pressure applied by the wool strands onto the mold surface is very low, the coefficient of friction would be increased significantly with the application of the abrasive slurry. The combined effect was to provide a relatively large shear force to lap the surface with a minimal normal force. Therefore, the proposed method could theoretically avoid damaging the lens while effectively removing the irregularities that appeared on the surfaces. In order to evaluate the proposed lapping method, we firstly lapped the <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> with different lapping parameters (speed, grit size, time, and pressure) to find out the relationship between these parameters and roughness with the same profile of the mold. Secondly, the optimal lapping parameters were designed based on the above lapping results to deduce the best lapping solution for processing the <b>machining</b> <b>marks.</b> Thirdly, the lapped surface profile of the mold was test by optical profiling system, and the features of the surface can be categorized into various spectral distribution groups. Finally, by comparing the variation of the spectral distribution groups, it is verified that based on our proposed methodology, selective removal of surface spectral groups of features becomes possible.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{advantages}} provided by modular hip implants have been overshadowed by reports suggesting that the junction between modular components is susceptible to fretting wear and fretting corrosion. Although the fracture resistance and locking strength of the junction {{do not appear to}} be at risk, the particulate debris generated and released into the joint space may elicit adverse biologic reactions that could eventually compromise fixation of the implant in the bone. It is hypothesized that improving the mechanical linkage between modular hip implant components connected via a Morse taper may mitigate the adverse effects of fretting. Three design parameters, surface finish, taper mismatch, and taper size, were examined in a simplified model of a Morse taper femoral head/neck connection to evaluate their effect on fretting damage at the junction under cyclic load. Microscopic and profilometric methods were used to assess fretting damage on the male tapers qualitatively and quantitatively after 2 or 5 million cycles. Fretting wear was evidenced by damage to the peaks of the <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> on all taper surfaces. A smooth surface finish of 0. 2 $ mu$m RMS on the male taper contained less volume of material in the <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> compared with a rough surface finish of 1. 6 $ mu$m RMS, and thus had the potential to generate less particulate debris. Taper mismatches of $ pm$ 8 $ sp prime$ appeared to have no significant effect on the overall fretting wear compared to a 0 taper mismatch. Large tapers with a two-fold increase in surface area and a four-fold increase in flexural rigidity compared to small tapers significantly reduced fretting wear, presumably because of lower shear forces at the taper interfaces...|$|E

The fatigue crack initiation was due to stress concentration arising from a depression mark at the keyway end surface.

40|$|Two {{compressor}} stator blades from Stages I and II of an aeroengine {{were sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that both the blades failed by fatigue. The fatigue was of high cycle-low stress type. The fracture surface of blade- 377 (Stage-I) was damaged due to rubbing of the mating fracture surfaces and therefore, the crack origin in the blade could not be determined. In blade- 17 (Stage-II), the fatigue crack initiated at the hub (concave surface) at about 2 mm away from the fillet.

Eccentricity produces a similar effect. Provided that the tool has eccentricity and helix angle, different profiles will be obtained at different workpiece’s heights.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the failure {{investigation of a}} tubular shaft {{that is part of}} a hammer drill assembly. The failure investigation was particularly challenging as the fracture surfaces were completely damaged during and subsequent to the failure process. However, careful examination of the component and its assembly revealed many clues that pointed to the root causes of failure. It was determined that the shaft was subjected to impact, fatigue, bending and torsional loads simultaneously at elevated temperatures. The basic failure mode was identified as a combination of torsional fatigue and rotating bending fatigue failure that originated on the inside diameter of the shaft. The root causes were determined to be operational overload in combination with rough <b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> on the bore surface and higher than necessary operating torque required to overcome the dry adhesive friction in the system. The preventative measures recommended were many-fold including improving surface finish on the bore diameter, reducing dry sliding friction, decreasing the overall level of dynamic loads by appropriate design changes and adding a surface strengthening heat treatmen...|$|E

30|$|The working {{conditions}} of the shearer walk gear are harsh, thus the shearer walk gear {{is one of the}} weakest parts in the shearer. In order to improve its work life, the electro-slag remelted steel material 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WE was used to make the shearer walk gear. The electro-slag remelting greatly reduces the harmful content of non-metallic materials (these ingredients are the causes of quenching crack and fatigue crack), increases the purity of materials, and maximizes material performance. As the gear modulus was large and there was no standard hob, the gear tooth was machined twice, the first machining cut using NC wire cutting, leaving 2 – 3  mm allowance. The second machining was precisely machined to its place using a processing center. In particular, in the last processes, the amount of feed and cutting speed should be strictly controlled to avoid obvious cutting marks (<b>machining</b> <b>marks</b> are the stress concentration source of gear’s tooth; currently fracturing of the shearer walk gear is often caused by these marks).
