In 1988, laparoscopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> resection of ovaries on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, slightly modified from Gjönnaess's operation, caused a reduction in LH pulsation and pituitary responsiveness in the treatment of PCOS. In 1989, ovarian drilling was conducted with argon, carbon dioxide (CO2) or potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser vaporization causing spontaneous ovulation in 71 percent of those treated. The procedure has been modified and popularized in the treatment of patients with CC-resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fight is}} perhaps best remembered for its memorable round 7. At the {{beginning}} of the round, Holyfield was the aggressor, throwing several jabs as Foreman stood back, seemingly waiting for an opportunity to land a powerful right hand. Seconds later, Holyfield missed with a left hook, which led to Foreman countering with a big right hook to Holyfield's head. Foreman would then become the aggressor and continue his attack on Holyfield, landing several punches within the round's first minute. As the second minute of the round began, Holyfield rebounded and proceeded to land a 15-second, <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> combination that staggered Foreman. Though Holyfield's barrage of punches seemed to tire Foreman, he nevertheless was able to survive the remainder of the round without going down. This round was ultimately named [...] "Round of the Year" [...] by The Ring magazine. Though Foreman was able to stay competitive throughout the fight, Holyfield ultimately won the fight via unanimous decision, winning all three judges scorecards by scores of 116-111, 117-110 and 115-112.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the diagnostic and}} therapeutic efficacy of using cold knife conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 186 cases with CIN diagnosed and treated in our hospital; compared the histologic diagnoses from cervical conization and from colposcopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies, and then evaluated their postoperative hiistologic findings and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Of the 186 cases, there was a correlation in histologic findings between cervical conization and colposcopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies in 138 cases (74. 2 %), {{and there was no}} correlation in the other 48 cases (25. 8 %). Incomplete excision was performed in 8 cases (4. 3 %), but the failure rate was only 1. 1 %; the cure rate was 98. 9 %. Five cases with early invasive cancer were found. Eleven patients underwent subsequent hysterectomy. The main complications associated with conization were hemorrhage and cervical stenosis. Bleeding occurred in 8 (4. 3 %) of the patients, and cervical stenosis occurred in 3 (1. 6 %). CONCLUSION Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed more accurately using conization than by colposcopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies. Conization can also {{play an important role in}} the treatment for CIN. If properly performed, the procedure has a low risk of complications. It can provide an accurate histologic representation of the disease process, and be curative in most cases...|$|E

40|$|Laparoscopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> resections {{were applied}} {{on the surface}} of the ovaries in 38 {{infertile}} patients who did not have spontaneous ovulation, and the effects on the clinical aspects of ovulation and gestation, and endocrinological state were examined. The patients were categorized into three groups to determine the indication of this treatment as follows. Group A (n= 9) : ovulated under administration of 100 mg/day clomiphene. Group B (n= 22) : ovulated under administration of 200 mg/day clomiphene, failed to ovulate under administra-tion of 100 mg/day. Group C (n= 7) : failed to ovulate even under administration of 200 mg/day. The dose of clomiphene to induce ovulation was reduced in 8 (89 %) in group A, 19 (86 %) in Group B and 6 (86 %) patients in group C. Although no patients became pregnant in group A, 17 (77 %) in Group B and 5 (71 %) in Group C became pregnant after this treatment. Irre-spective of the good clinical outcome, no endocrinological improvements was found in the results of LH-RH test and serum testosterone leves. These findings suggest that this treat-ment is effective on the patients with severe anovulation, and that this effect is not based on the endocrinological improvement but ont the local mechanical factors...|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic {{diarrhea}} is {{a common}} problem in pa-tients with symptoms related to gastro-intestinal tract. Some of these patients present with chronic non-bloody, watery diar-rhea and no specific clinical, laboratory, or endoscopic find-ings. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the value of histological findings in patients with chronic diarrhea who have normal or non-specific endoscopic findings. We also determined the frequency and distribution of histo-logical changes related to different anatomical sites in the colon. Methods: This study was performed in Kerman city on 90 patients with chronic watery diarrhea whose diseases had not been exactly diagnosed after extensive clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic studies. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, erythro-cyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, stool examination, thyroid and liver function tests, and serologic study for celiac disease were all normal in this group of patients. Colonoscopy was performed and mucosal biopsies were taken from recto-sigmoid, descending, and transverse colon. Results: The histologic findings were as follows: 39 (43. 3 %) patients showed normal histology, 25 (27. 8 %) patients showed microscopic colitis, not otherwise specified form. Ten (11. 1 %) patients had classic lymphocytic colitis, and 15 (16. 7 %) patients had paucicellular lymphocytic colitis. One (1. 1 %) patient showed focal active colitis. None of them had collagenous colitis. Conclusion: Diagnostic histological findings were seen in 28. 9 % of biopsy samples in patients with chronic diarrhea and normal or near normal endoscopic findings. We recommend <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy sampling in such patients from different sites of the colon to avoid missing some cases of microscopic colitis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) {{is a broad}} {{term that}} {{describes}} the presence of gas in the bowel walls. The colon is affected in 36 % of cases. Eosinophilic colitis (EC) is a rare form of colitis that is characterized mainly by eosinophilia in blood and affected tissues. Although eosinophilic colitis responds well to conservative treatment, yet the association of PI could be an indication of emergent surgery. Case Presentation A 48 -year-old female patient {{with a history of}} recurrent attacks of abdominal pain and distention that did not respond to conservative treatment, was hospitalized and investigated thoroughly. The result of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan indicated the presence of pneumatosis coli. Based on the findings of the CT scan, colonoscopy was done revealing hyperemic and hypertrophied mucosa at the hepatic flexure, from which <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies were taken for histopathological assessment. The pathological examination of these biopsies detected a diffuse active colitis of moderate severity with excess eosinophils (10 - 15 /HPF), which is consistent with the diagnosis of EC. The patient improved dramatically on fluid therapy and antibiotics with complete resolution of pneumatosis coli in the follow up CT scan. However, the patient developed a severe relapse of symptoms once oral intake was resumed and this time the conservative treatment failed to improve the condition. Surgery was indicated and laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis and covering ileostomy was done. The patient was free of symptoms after the operation and her postoperative course was uneventful with no complications encountered. Conclusions Eosinophilic colitis usually has a good prognosis, however its association with pneumatosis coli could reflect a serious damage to the colonic mucosa. Although eosinophilic colitis responds well to medical treatment, yet in certain cases where clinical signs are evident and pneumatosis coli is present, surgical intervention is the treatment of choice...|$|E

The identification of innate and adaptive immune cells, that can complement the established prognostic effect of CD 8 in MMR-proficient colorectal cancers patients, representing 85 % of all cases, {{has not been}} performed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Colorectal cancers from a test (n= 1197) and external validation (n= 209) cohort of MMR-proficient colorectal cancers were mounted onto single and <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical quantification (score 0 - 3) was performed for CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, CD 68, CD 163, FoxP 3, GranzymeB, iNOS, mast cell tryptase, MUM 1, PD 1 and TIA- 1 tumor-infiltrating (TILs) reactive cells. Coexpression experiments on fresh colorectal cancer specimens using specific cell population markers were performed. In the test group, higher numbers of CD 3 + (p< 0. 001), CD 4 + (p= 0. 029), CD 8 + (p< 0. 001), CD 45 RO+ (p= 0. 048), FoxP 3 + (p< 0. 001), GranzymeB+ (p< 0. 001), iNOS+ (p= 0. 035), MUM 1 + (p= 0. 014), PD 1 + (p= 0. 034) and TIA- 1 + TILs (p< 0. 001) were linked to favourable outcome. Adjusting for age, gender, TNM stage and post-operative therapy, higher CD 8 + (p< 0. 001; HR (95 %CI) : 0. 66 (0. 64 - 0. 68)) and TIA- 1 + (p< 0. 001; HR (95 %CI) : 0. 56 (0. 5 - 0. 6)) were independent prognostic factors. Moreover, among patients with CD 8 + infiltrates, TIA- 1 further stratified 355 (35. 6 %) patients into prognostic subgroups (p< 0. 001; HR (95 %CI) : 0. 89 (95 %CI: 0. 8 - 0. 9)). Results were confirmed on the validation cohort (p= 0. 006). TIA- 1 + cells were mostly CD 8 + (57 %), but also stained for TCRγδ (22 %), CD 66 b (13 %) and only rarely for CD 4 +, macrophage and NK cell markers. CONCLUSIONS: TIA- 1 adds prognostic information to TNM stage and adjuvant therapy in MMR-proficient colorectal cancer patients. The prognostic effect of CD 8 + TILs is confounded {{by the presence of}} TIA- 1 + which translates into improved risk stratification for approximately 35 % of all patients with MMR-proficient colorectal cancers...|$|E
