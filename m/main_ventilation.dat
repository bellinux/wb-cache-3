5000|$|Ventprom is a Russian machine {{building}} plant located in Artyomovsky, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. The factory produces ventilation equipment, such as <b>main</b> mine <b>ventilation</b> fans, {{for a number}} of large mining companies, including Lukoil, SUAL Group and others. The full name of the company is Joint Stock Company Artyomovsky Machine Engineering Plant VENTPROM (АО «Артемовский машиностроительный завод «ВЕНТПРОМ»). It is a private company. The name ВЕНТПРОМ means [...] "fan industry".|$|R
50|$|After the war the Soviet {{government}} {{decided that the}} factory should remain in Artyomovsky. It was further expanded to produce underground mining equipment, mostly <b>main</b> mine <b>ventilation</b> fans. In the end of 50-s - beginning of 60-s the plant had its first serious renovation followed by technical upgrading with new shops, including machine assembly, mechanical, repairmen, and tool shop being open. The plant soon obtained its own engineering design department. A few years later {{the first and the}} only in USSR wind tunnel test station was implemented at the plant's premises. At that time the plant's main product range was expanded from <b>main</b> mine <b>ventilation</b> fans to ventilation equipment for subways and transport tunnels, pulp and paper industry, mining conveyors, locks and joints for drilling rigs, welding electrodes and dust collectors. In the following decade Ventprom developed a new range of axial flow fans for metro, PTO-16M, PTO-18 PTO-24 VOMD-2.4, which are currently used in subway ventilation systems in Russia and abroad. At the end of 80-s, prior to the collapse of USSR, Ventpom's annual fan production peaked at 1,200 pieces, boasting of export to over 30 countries. A new line of gas exhaust fans, local ventilation fans, new single-stage blowers for metros were developed at that time.|$|R

50|$|One {{critical}} maintenance {{issue is}} the <b>main</b> <b>ventilation</b> drain (these are below the vents {{at the back of}} the hood/bonnet and below windshield). If this drain becomes clogged such as from leaves or snow it can overflow, flooding the passenger compartment. When it overflows in can short out wiring in the car. There is an air and water vent on the right (passenger side) near the base of the windshield, under the hood, which among other features as a drain with a reed valve to allow water to drain out.|$|E
30|$|The <b>main</b> {{concern for}} <b>ventilation</b> is IAQ when rooms {{are not in}} use or only few people are in a room. It is {{especially}} essential for older buildings.

500|$|The {{findings}} of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel, but particularly the ceiling, was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising wax and soot (amorphous carbon). Above the windows (the <b>main</b> source of <b>ventilation),</b> the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city, being [...] "much dirtier than the ceiling proper".|$|R
50|$|Hackerspaces can {{run into}} {{difficulties}} with building codes or other planning regulations, {{which may not}} be designed to handle their scope of activities. For example, a new hackerspace in Nashua, New Hampshire was shut down by the city after an inspection in 2011. The <b>main</b> issues involved <b>ventilation</b> of heat and toxic fumes; the space was reopened after improvements were made to the building.|$|R
50|$|Flow-through {{ventilation}} is the <b>main</b> <b>ventilation</b> circuit for the mine. Air {{enters the}} mine from surface via a shaft, ventilation raise or adit. The air is distributed through the mine via internal ventilation raises and ramps, and flows {{are controlled by}} regulators and permanently mounted ventilation fans. An auxiliary ventilation system takes air from the flow-through system and distributes it to the mine workings via temporarily mounted ventilation fans, venturies and disposable fabric or steel ducting. Auxiliary fan and duct systems may be either forcing systems, where fresh air is pushed into mine headings, or exhausting systems that draw out contaminated air.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel is 629 m {{long and}} made up of six precast {{concrete}} sections (length: 344 ft; height: 24 ft; width: 78 ft). The sections were floated into position by barge and then sunk into a shallow trench that had been dug into the loose sand and silt of the river bed. The trench and tunnel sections were then covered over with a protective layer of rock—500 lb stones filled 50 ft out on each side, plus a bed of 1,500 lb stone on top. A structure located {{at each end of}} the tunnel houses the <b>main</b> <b>ventilation</b> and pumping equipment. Concrete retaining walls make up the approaches, which extend out about 400 m from the ventilation buildings. At its lowest point the roadway is about 22 m below sea level, making it the lowest section of roadway in Canada. The Fraser River flows into the Strait of Georgia about 5 km downstream from the tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|Another unusual {{feature is}} the slanted {{overhang}} of the frontal part of the chassis which has {{the form of a}} pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. The major dimensions of the tank are a length of 6.32 m, a width of 2.05 m and a height of 2.3 m. The design is of the early so-called [...] "box tank" [...] type, in which the crew, propulsion system and all manner of equipment are not clearly separated. As a result, there is no real fighting compartment. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door {{in the back of the}} tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a 1.5 m high space between the roof and the tank's floor. They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver's seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the suspension elements, used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: if the mechanic wanted to assist the right machine gun, he had to lie on his belly to load it. Part of each Schneider tank team were also three embedded riflemen who functioned as a sort of outside crew, during battle directly accompanying the vehicle. All-around protection was provided by 11.4 mm steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5 mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof had 5.5 mm armour. The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.The 60 hp Schneider gasoline engine and its radiator are located in the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1 km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2 km/h, the second of 3.95 km/h, the third of 6.75 km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75 kg/cm².As the traverse of the main gun was limited, it had first to be pointed in the general direction of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a sightline parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had a too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to resort to lifting his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The <b>main</b> <b>ventilation</b> is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The top roof is the highest element of the vehicle. With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.The vehicles were delivered by the factory painted in the standard grey colour used by the Artillery Arm and other branches of the army and that was often called [...] "artillery grey". It was a rather light pearl grey shade. At first, by the Section Camouflage in the field a specially designed complex striped flame pattern was added consisting of narrow vertical red brown, dark green and yellow ochre patches, delineated in black. This was intended to break the contours of the vehicles. To some observers, it made them seem strikingly colourful. The original grey paint was perhaps only partly covered, including it in the ensemble; an alternative interpretation of the lightest patches seen in black-and-white photographs is that it represents a light green hue. Later, when the appliqué armour was added a much simpler scheme was used where the same hues were shown in large irregular areas, again demarcated in black. In the first combat actions, it became clear that German machine gunners concentrated their fire on the vision slits. To confuse them, in the summer of 1917 a cross-hatched scheme of narrow vertical and horizontal dark grey stripes was applied on top of the original patches. The stripes continued over the side machine gun ball mounts but a round area remained untouched to suggest a false position. The individual Schneider CA tanks had serial numbers ranging from 61001 to 61399. The first tactical markings consisted of simple numbers, to distinguish the individual tanks within a training unit. Early 1917 the combat units used small inconspicuous playing-card symbols, each symbol indicating one of four batteries within a groupe. These were sprayed in white on the tank side, often combined with an individual tank number, depending on the style each groupe preferred. The tank number could also be indicated on the tank spur, by horizontal stripes.|$|E

30|$|We {{installed}} a gPhone- 90 in the refuge {{area of the}} 100 -m-deep sub-stage (sub-stage is a horizontal tunnel between the <b>Main</b> and <b>Ventilation</b> shafts) in July 2010. Because the floor was made of uneven concrete, we laid a stainless steel plate of 1.2 -mm thickness under the Meter box. The Longlevel tilt change of approximately 1000 analog-digital units (AD units) occurred, which far exceeded the standard 500 AD units (Micro-g LaCoste, 2008). Here, the Long direction is perpendicular to a sub-stage tunnel, approximately NW-SE. The number of AD units multiplied by a user-defined coefficient became the radian-unit tilt. Here, the user-defined coefficient means a calibration factor, which was uniquely determined by collecting {{a certain number of}} calibration data (the relationship between gravity and tilt) with a least-squares method (Micro-g LaCoste, 2008). As the tilt change steadily increased, the influence on gravity records was also monotonous.|$|R
30|$|As {{the diesel}} exhaust {{continued}} to be ejected from the engine tailpipe, it continued to spread out in all directions at the intersection due to the weak <b>main</b> <b>ventilation</b> flow.

30|$|The {{exhaust flow}} {{occupied}} {{most of the}} roof region inside the face and gradually spread out at the intersection where the face entry met the straight main entry. At this place, the still hot exhaust clung to the roof and wedged the main airflow out of the ceiling region. There was heat exchange between the exhaust flow and the cold ventilation flow, during which the exhaust lost heat and became heavier and then mixed with the surrounding main airflow; at the same time, the ventilation flow close to the exhaust gained the heat and moved upward and blocked the further dilution of the exhaust gas from the <b>main</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Overall, the low speed of the main airflow was {{not strong enough to}} sweep the exhaust at the intersection.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that human skin {{is a source}} of bacterial dispersal and {{the most common cause of}} infection in sensitive indoor surgical environments such as operating rooms (ORs). Airborne particles carrying microorganisms are dispersed from the whole body, but with different release rates.

Whether the release position influences particle distribution in the surgical area has not been well known. In this paper, two different particle launch positions, one from the head and neck and one from the perineum region and feet, were compared. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique was employed to solve the governing equations for airflow and particle distribution.
