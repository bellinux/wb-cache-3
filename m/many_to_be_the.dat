5|$|Considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held {{and where the}} Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver were {{critically}} acclaimed upon release {{and they are}} considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best games in the entire series, {{as well as some}} of the fifth generation console gaming's most significant titles. They continued the enormous success of their predecessors as Pokémon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of Pokémon Red and Blue and went on to jointly sell millions of copies worldwide. By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units.|$|E

5|$|The Saint-Gaudens {{double eagle}} is a twenty-dollar gold coin, or double eagle, {{produced}} by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933. The coin is named after its designer, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It is considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most beautiful of U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche. By the time he retired {{at the end of}} the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme was at his best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than he had been at two and three.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Nadal {{have the}} most {{head-to-head}} meetings in Open Era history with 50 meetings, which Djokovic leads 26–24. Nadal leads on grass 2–1 and clay 15–7, while Djokovic leads on hard courts 18–7. They have met 13 times in Grand Slam tournaments with Nadal leading 9–4, and 4–3 in finals. The rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the 2000s decade by ATPworldtour.com and is widely {{considered to be the}} greatest rivalry {{in the history of the}} sport. Djokovic is the first player to have at least ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively, which he did twice. He is also only the second player to have defeated Nadal in more than one Grand Slam tournament final (the other being Federer) and the first to beat Nadal in a final on a surface other than grass. Their 2012 Australian Open encounter is considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> greatest match ever played and their 2013 French Open semifinal is considered the best clay court match ever played.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's first {{policy toward}} Scotland was {{to oppose the}} French {{presence}} there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put Mary, Queen of Scots, who was considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> heir to the English crown, on the throne. Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 {{to take up the}} reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy {{was considered to be}} 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E
5|$|The same year, Krichell went to Hartford, Connecticut to sign shortstop Leo Durocher for a $7,500 bonus ($ in 2010). When {{the deal}} was concluded, Barrow sent Krichell to Salt Lake City to watch young second baseman Tony Lazzeri, who played for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League and hit 60 home runs and {{achieved}} over 200 RBIs the previous season. The Bees were asking for $50,000 ($ in 2010), but several scouts placed his value ten times lower. The Chicago Cubs were given the option to sign him for a discounted rate, but declined because he had epilepsy. Krichell saw promise in the player and convinced Barrow to buy him. Around the same time, he helped acquire shortstop Mark Koenig from the Minneapolis Millers. These Krichell signings formed part of the 1927 New York Yankees team, considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> greatest team ever assembled. Four of the starters in this squad were signed by Krichell, including three-quarters of its infield and Mike Gazella, its main backup, who signed for $500 in 1923 ($ in 2010). The Yankees took just four games to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates and win the 1927 World Series.|$|E
50|$|His {{single most}} famous role {{was that of}} Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust in 1956/57, which is still {{considered}} by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> best interpretation of the role ever given.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach {{in order to reduce the}} behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} surrounding Roy Oswalt's nomination because {{he only had}} a 7–5 record {{at the time of}} nominations making him the only pitcher without eight wins nominated. However, he is considered by <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> victim of lack of run support, questionable relief pitching and an average defense. This respect was shown by the players who had voted him to sixth place among National League starting pitchers making him the first alternate in case of injury to any of the five elected All-star starting pitchers. On the final day of All-Star Final Vote voting, it was announced that Oswalt (who was running third in the All-Star Final Vote) would replace John Smoltz who withdrew from All-Star game participation due to injury.|$|E
