500|$|Cathleen Medwick {{gave the}} novel a highly {{positive}} review in O, the Oprah Magazine:"Love {{may not be}} the first thing that comes to <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> consider the war-ravaged landscape of Afghanistan. But that is the emotion—subterranean, powerful, beautiful, illicit, and infinitely patient—that suffuses the pages of Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. As in his best-selling first novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseini movingly examines the connections between unlikely friends, the fissures that open up between parents and children, the intransigence of quiet hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|Trademarks and {{characteristics}} that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't really matter {{if something is}} hard to play or not. The thing is, {{what does it do}} to your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> listen to it? Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and [...] "robotic" [...] death metal vocals.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the poem}} is not good in spite of but {{especially}} because of its moral confusions, which ought to be clear in your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are feeling its power. I think it horrible and wonderful; I regard it as like Aztec or Benin sculpture, or to come nearer home the novels of Kafka, and am rather suspicious of any critic who claims not to feel anything so obvious.|$|E
5000|$|Cyndi Lauper {{commented on}} Madonna's {{controversial}} {{speech at the}} Washington march, saying, “Anger is not better than clarity and humanity. That is what opens people's <b>minds.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> want to change people's mind, you have to share your real story.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what does}} that mean? It means that you can never know {{ultimate}} reality. Your brains are empty <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are born. Appearances, or phenomena, are all the content your minds can receive from your five senses. Then noumena, which are not in your <b>minds</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are born, {{have no way of}} getting in--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good.--Rifle got long arm. He talk so, Ingin <b>mind</b> him. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> t'ink red-skin come ag'in your fort, cap'in, now {{you got him}} done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{nice of you}} to say so!" [...] she {{answered}} brightly. [...] "But then perhaps you'll change your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know what I have been doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why did {{you tell}} her? She could not but have spoken her <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> told her. There must have been much between you when this was talked of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{something}} in your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ask me a question like this!" [...] she said. [...] "What should I know about it at all? What makes you ask me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{that puts}} me in <b>mind,</b> Stanley. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> reach the Grand Canyon, {{send me a}} piece of rock; I {{want to see how}} the Canyon looks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And did {{you have}} all that in your <b>mind,</b> papa, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came down here, and was that what you and Mr. Dawson wanted to talk about?" [...] said the {{astonished}} Rose.|$|R
60|$|One {{evening in}} {{she comes to}} the Savoy. My wife put me up to getting that job, and a good job it is, <b>mind</b> <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know your way about. I'd never have had the cheek to try for it, if it hadn't been for the missis. She's a clever one--she is. I did a good day's work when I married her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hastings reflectively, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} that it is your duty to put ideas into her <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can't be quite certain that she has entertained them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must find}} my way to more. I must know what Germany offers you. I must know what is {{at the back of}} your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> repeat this offer in Tokio." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can go to}} your {{hospital}} if you like--or back to your lodging--if {{you wish}} to," [...] said Lilly. [...] "You can make up your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see how {{you are in the}} morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ay, will there! Well I know it. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> how <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{were but}} a bairn {{you used to}} say, “Wait till I’m a man, and you’ll never have a reason for {{greeting}} again?”’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here {{has been}} little Mrs. Ferrari, my dear, in a dreadful state of <b>mind,</b> inquiring <b>when</b> <b>you</b> would be back. Her husband has left Lord Montbarry, without a word of warning--and nobody knows what has become of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|To this King Angus made reply: [...] "I {{had hoped}} that now we were come to Ireland you had changed your purpose in that matter. Are you yet of the same <b>mind</b> as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first spake to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{be cleared}} from your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{have read the}} letter. Lanterns for one." [...] The reddleman struck a light, kindled an inch of tallow-candle which he had brought, and {{sheltered}} it with his cap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, young philosopher, pile up your berries in {{that green}} platter while I repair the basket. Bear this in <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> work in bark: make your handle {{the way of}} the grain, and choose a strip both smooth and broad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "T'ank ee, Nadgel," [...] said Moses; [...] "here--feel {{behind you}} an' you'll find grub for {{yourself}} an' some to pass forid to massa. <b>Mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> slip down for {{go to sleep}} dat you don't dig your heels into massa's skull.

6000|$|Apart {{from these}} differences, and taking {{their point of}} view, I [...] {{think they ought to}} {{endeavour}} to fight the election with you; and [...] in the new state of affairs which will be presented after the [...] dissolution, try and see what effect may be produced upon your [...] mind, and on other <b>minds,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{have to look at the}} matter [...] cominus and not eminus, as actual, and not as hypothetical. I [...] gave Chamberlain a brief hint of these speculations when [...] endeavouring to work upon him; otherwise I have not mentioned them [...] to any one.|$|R
5000|$|... "Just {{because you}} have more or less money, {{it does not mean}} you will give more or less. Giving has a state of <b>mind</b> and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have {{understood}} that part, you will give irrespective of how much money you have." [...] in the Economist Intelligence Unit ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you so much, Lady de Lannoy. I {{felt that}} you would not <b>mind,</b> {{especially}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know why we came. Indeed I had no choice. Pearl insisted on it; and when Pearl is urgent--we who love her have all to give way. This is Pearl!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See," [...] he {{returned}} gaily, [...] "what a sympathy {{there must be}} between us! I have had nothing else, poor Rick excepted--it's a large exception--in my <b>mind.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> came in, I was full of it. When shall we give Bleak House its mistress, little woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} talk {{of these things}} with you," [...] she cried. [...] "It was not for this that you sought me out, eh? Tell me at once?

6000|$|... "And I {{should like}} {{to have you with}} me, Stephen. Nothing would give me greater pleasure. If you are still of that <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> return from Devonshire we can again talk the matter over, and as our wishes are both the same way we can have no {{difficulty}} in coming to an agreement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy {{served the}} young fellow right, sir," [...] growled Fred Bayham in his deepest voice. [...] "Come along, young man. Stand up straight, {{and keep a}} civil tongue in your head next time, <b>mind</b> <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> dine with gentlemen. It's easy to see," [...] says Fred, looking round with a knowing air, [...] "that this young man hasn't got the usages of society--he's not been {{accustomed}} to it:" [...] and he led the dandy out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Hubert," [...] said he, [...] "I bear in <b>mind</b> the day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> overbore the Frenchman at Caen. Will you not be our {{champion}} now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the two men}} {{remaining}} in the sitting-room drew nearer to each other, and the opera-singer broke the silence by saying, 'How could you insult me {{in the way you}} did, calling me a fellow, and accusing me of poisoning her <b>mind</b> toward <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> knew very well I was as ignorant of your relation to her as an unborn babe?' ...|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she promised, [...] "I will help. We {{will leave}} it at that. Some day you shall talk to me again, if you like. In the meantime, {{remember}} we are both free. You have not known many women, and you may change your <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have been longer in London. Perhaps {{it will be better}} for you if you do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said {{it belonged}} to the Marny family," [...] {{continued}} the ex-ambassador. [...] "Juliette Marny is in England. I might meet her.

[...] "It was a thought that flashed through my <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> spoke--nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|The lawyer said: [...] "That {{seems to}} dispose of the {{question}} of the working-man in society. But how about your <b>minds?</b> <b>When</b> do <b>you</b> cultivate your <b>minds?</b> <b>When</b> do the ladies of Altruria cultivate their minds, if they have to do their own work, as I suppose they do? Or is it only the men who work, if they happen to be the husbands and fathers of the upper classes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{excuse me}} if I see my way {{straight}} {{through to the}} end. I daresay you would rather realize it gradually, inevitable as it is," [...] added Conolly, looking down with some pity at his drooping figure.
