5|$|As of January 2008, Mervyn King, the Bank of England's then Governor, was {{the only}} MPC member to have taken part in every meeting since 1997. As a result, after the MPC meeting in July 2013, the first after King retired, no single member had {{attended}} every <b>meeting.</b> <b>As</b> of 2016, Kate Barker is the only external member to date to have been appointed for three terms, each lasting three years.|$|E

Smallpeice initially refused to commit to the position, instead taking a three-month cruise from Hong Kong to London (with P).|$|E
5|$|Following the loss, seniors on the {{football}} team held a players-only meeting in an effort to rally the team. Players later recalled that <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> the turning point in the team's season. The next week, Virginia Tech earned its first win of the season, a 49–27 victory over East Carolina in Lane Stadium. The Hokies followed that by traveling to Boston College for a 19–0 win, their first shutout since 2006.|$|E

5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single <b>meeting,</b> <b>as</b> the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} the first <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> {{opposing}} head coaches between Nick Saban and his former assistant coach from both LSU and the Miami Dolphins, Will Muschamp, the Crimson Tide defeated the Florida Gators, 38–10 at The Swamp. After receiving the opening kickoff, Florida scored their only touchdown of the game on their first offensive play from scrimmage. The Gators took an early 7–0 lead when John Brantley threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Andre Debose. Alabama responded on the following drive with Jeremy Shelley connecting on a 32-yard field goal to cut the Florida lead to 7–3. The Gators responded with {{what turned out to be}} their final points of the game when Caleb Sturgis connected on a 21-yard field goal. Alabama's Marquis Maze then returned the ensuing kickoff 70-yards to the Florida 29-yard line and the Crimson Tide tied the game at 10–10 seven plays later on a five-yard Trent Richardson touchdown run.|$|E

5|$|James had a {{controversial}} religious policy; {{his attempt to}} grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received. Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view {{in a letter to}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf. She was further dismayed when James refused to help when the Catholic King of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William was having an affair with Elizabeth Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his {{adjutant}} Lieutenant Haeften {{return to}} Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer is in {{bed with}} a young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he {{declares}} his love for her, she realizes he is late for a <b>meeting.</b> <b>As</b> he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of dollars in cash he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off the con, drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was set up}} in 1894 at {{a meeting}} in January at the temperance hall in Hardman Street. A society had been {{proposed}} a month earlier by Emily Hornby at a public meeting and after a unanimous vote, was founded by Edith Allan Bright, Lydia Allen Booth and Nessie Stewart-Brown and initially had twenty four members. The society set up headquarters at 6 Lord Street. Millicent Fawcett, leader of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, attended the first <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> a guest speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was made despite that no political parties in Oslo supported constructing a ski flying hill and that neither the municipality nor the state were willing to issue grants. There were also concerns from environmental groups as Rødkleiva lies within a protected area. Two days after the convention decision, Vikersundbakken applied to host a World Cup event in 2007. At a public meeting in August, politicians from all parties confirmed {{that they would not}} support Rødkleiva and City Council Chair Erling Lae declared the <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> a funeral for the project. Yet the federation established a committee, led by Seeberg, to explore ways the venue could be financed and built. In December 2006, Steinar Johannessen stated that he and the federation had given up having a ski jumping hill at Rødkleiva.|$|E
5|$|The first {{religious}} {{establishment in}} the region was erected by pioneers from Tennessee in 1847. By 1860, two Methodist Episcopal churches had been built nearby. In 1880, seven churches, which were predominantly Methodist, had been established in Delta County. In 1889, seven Baptist churches that had been established {{in the region}} held a <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> the Delta County Baptist Association. During the early 1980s, there were 17 churches in Delta County, two of which were located in Cooper. In 1931, there were 13 Baptist churches located in and around Cooper. During the mid-1960s, there were 32 churches in the region, representing seven Christian communions. However, by 1982, five of those churches had closed.|$|E

5|$|The rally {{began in}} late afternoon. Vizzini {{had agreed to}} permit the <b>meeting</b> <b>as</b> long as land problems, the large estates, or the Mafia were not addressed. Both {{speakers}} who preceded Li Causi, among which was Pantaleone, followed Vizzini’s commands. Li Causi did not. He denounced the unjust exploitation by the Mafia, and when Li Causi started {{to talk about how}} the peasants were being deceived by ‘a powerful leaseholder’ – a thinly disguised reference to Vizzini – the Mafia boss hurled: It’s a lie. Pandemonium broke out. The rally ended in a shoot-out which left 14 people wounded including Li Causi and Pantaleone. Six months later Vizzini acquired the lease for the Miccichè estate.|$|E
