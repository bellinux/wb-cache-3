40|$|The {{onset of}} {{agriculture}} about 12, 000 years ago {{has had a}} major influence on the biodiversity of plants and animals. Unfortunately, the rapid changes in agricultural practices that has occurred in recent times has negatively affected many farmland species. One such species is the grass snake (Natrix natrix), which has been reported to decline in many parts of Europe, including Sweden. The grass snake is unique, not only in that it is the most northerly distributed oviparous reptile in the world, but also because of its habit of using anthropogenic heat sources such as <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> and composts as nesting-sites. Unfortunately changes in manure management and abandonment of farmlands have resulted in a decline and fragmentation of these environments. This may pose a threat for the northernmost populations of the grass snake, because natural nests in these areas may not provide sufficient heat for the eggs to hatch. The eggs and embryos of reptiles are highly sensitive to incubation temperatures, which can influence not only hatching success but also many phenotypic traits in the hatchlings. In this thesis I used a series of laboratory and field experiments to investigate the importance of anthropogenic heat sources for the reproductive ecology of cold-climate populations of grass snakes.  More specifically, I aimed to investigate thermal regimes of nests and how they influence embryonic development and offspring traits associated with survival and fitness. The results showed that <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> and composts are significantly warmer than potential natural nests and that natural nests do not provide sufficient heat to sustain embryonic development. Further, <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> were warmer and more constant in temperature than composts, resulting in higher hatching success and earlier hatching in <b>manure</b> <b>heaps.</b> The higher thermal variability in composts increased the frequency of abnormalities that are likely to negatively affect survival and fitness. In conclusion, this thesis shows that the use of anthropogenic heat sources has enabled grass snakes to expand their range farther north than any other oviparous reptile and that the thermal dichotomy in the primary nesting environments used by grass snakes contribute to important life-history variation in this species. These findings have important implications for conservation of reptile populations in general and grass snakes in particular. ...|$|R

6000|$|When he {{returned}} from his military service Jean-Pierre Bacadou found the old people very much aged. He remarked with pain {{that the work of}} the farm was not satisfactorily done. The father had not the energy of old days. The hands did not feel over them the eye of the master. Jean-Pierre noted with sorrow that the heap of manure in the courtyard before the only entrance to the house was not so large as it should have been. The fences were out of repair, and the cattle suffered from neglect. At home the mother was practically bedridden, and the girls chattered loudly in the big kitchen, unrebuked, from morning to night. He said to himself: [...] "We must change all this." [...] He talked the matter over with his father one evening when the rays of the setting sun entering the yard between the outhouses ruled the heavy shadows with luminous streaks. Over the <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> floated a mist, opal-tinted and odorous, and the marauding hens would stop in their scratching to examine with a sudden glance of their round eye the two men, both lean and tall, talking in hoarse tones.

60|$|It {{was quite}} {{otherwise}} with the unobtrusive small deer of life--the snails, and beetles, and flies, and earthworms--and {{especially with the}} winged things: birds, bats, and butterflies. In the very earliest days of my islands' existence, indeed, a few stray feathered fowls of the air were driven ashore here by violent storms, {{at a time when}} vegetation had not yet begun to clothe the naked pumice and volcanic rock; but these, of course, perished for want of food, as did also a few later arrivals, who came under stress of weather at the period when only ferns, lichens, and mosses had as yet obtained a foothold on the young archipelago. Sea-birds, of course, soon found out our rocks; but as they live off fish only, they contributed little more than rich beds of guano to the permanent colonising of the islands. As well as I can remember, the land-snails were the earliest truly terrestrial casuals that managed to pick up a stray livelihood in these first colonial days of the archipelago. They came oftenest in the egg, sometimes clinging to water-logged leaves cast up by storms, sometimes hidden in the bark of floating driftwood, and sometimes swimming free on the open ocean. In one case, as I recall to myself well, a swallow, driven off from the Portuguese coast, a little before the Glacial period had begun to whiten the distant mountains of central and northern Europe, fell exhausted at last upon the shore of Terceira. There were no insects then for the poor bird to feed upon, so it died of starvation and weariness before the day was out; but a little earth that clung in a pellet to one of its feet contained the egg of a land-shell, while the prickly seed of a common Spanish plant was entangled among the winged feathers by its hooked awns. The egg hatched out, and became the parent of a large brood of minute snails, which, outliving the cold spell of the Ice Age, had developed into a very distinct type in the long period that intervened before the advent of man in the islands; while the seed sprang up on the natural <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> afforded by the swallow's decaying body, and clinging to the valleys during the Glacial Age on the hill-tops, gave birth in due season {{to one of the most}} markedly indigenous of our Terceira plants.|$|E
60|$|The {{smuggling}} trade flourished greatly at that period, {{and there}} were receivers and distributors of smuggled wine, spirits, and other commodities in every town and in very many villages throughout the county {{in spite of its}} distance from the sea-coast. One of his memories is of a blind man of the village, or town as it was then, who was used as an assistant in this business. He had lost his sight in childhood, one eye having been destroyed by a ferret which got into his cradle; then, when he was about six years old he was running across the room one day with a fork it his hand when he stumbled, and falling on the floor had the other eye pierced by the prongs. But in spite of his blindness he became a good worker, and could make a fence, reap, trim hedges, feed the animals, and drive a horse as well as any man. His father had a small farm and was a carrier as well, a quiet, sober, industrious man who was never suspected by his neighbours of being a smuggler, for he never left his house and work, but from time to time he had little consignments of rum and brandy in casks received on a dark night and carefully stowed away in his <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> and in a pit under the floor of his pigsty. Then the blind son would drive his old mother in the carrier's cart to Bath and call at a dozen or twenty private houses, leaving parcels which had been already ordered and paid for--a gallon of brandy at one, two or four gallons of rum at another, and so on, until all was got rid of, and on the following day they would return with goods to Hindon. This quiet little business went on satisfactorily for some years, during which the officers of the excise had stared a thousand times with their eagle's eyes at the quaint old woman in her poke bonnet and shawl, driven by a blind man with a vacant face, and had suspected nothing, when a little mistake was made and a jar of brandy delivered at a wrong address. The recipient was an honest gentleman, and in his anxiety to find the rightful owner of the brandy made extensive inquiries in his neighbourhood, and eventually the excisemen got wind of the affair, and on the very next visit of the old woman and her son to Bath they were captured. After an examination before a magistrate the son was discharged on account of his blindness, but the cart and horses, as well as the smuggled spirits, were confiscated, and the poor blind man had to make his way on foot to Hindon.|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and compare the most significant sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soils within a typical mixed livestock farm in Scotland. The farm area can be considered as representative of agricultural soils in this region where outdoor grazing forms an important part of the animal husbandry. A high temporal resolution dynamic chamber method was used to measure N 2 O fluxes from the featureless, general areas of the arable and pasture fields (general) and from those areas where large nitrogen additions are highly likely, such as animal feeding areas, <b>manure</b> <b>heaps,</b> animal barns (features). Individual N 2 O flux measurements varied by four orders of magnitude, with values ranging from − 5. 5 to 80, 000 μg N 2 O-N m− 2 h− 1. The log-normal distribution of the fluxes required the use of more complex statistics to quantify uncertainty, including a Bayesian approach which provided a robust and transparent method for “upscaling” i. e. translating small-scale observations to larger scales, with appropriate propagation of uncertainty. Mean N 2 O fluxes associated with the features were typically one to four orders of magnitude larger than those measured on the general areas of the arable and pasture fields. During warmer months, when widespread grazing takes place across the farm, the smaller N 2 O fluxes of the largest area source – the general field (99. 7 % of total area) – dominated the overall N 2 O emissions. The contribution from the features should still be considered important, given that up to 91 % of the fluxes may come from only 0. 3 % of the area under certain conditions, especially in the colder winter months when <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> and animal barns continue to produce emissions while soils reach temperatures unfavourable for microbial activity (< 5 °C) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impacts of}} leachates from a swine carcass burial site and a cow <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> on the geochemical and microbiological properties of agricultural water samples, including leachate, groundwater from monitoring wells and background wells, and stream water. The leachate from the livestock burial site showed extremely high electrical conductivity, turbidity, and major ion concentrations, but low redox potential and dissolved oxygen levels. The groundwater in the monitoring wells adjacent to both sites showed severe contamination from the leachate, {{as indicated by the}} increases in EC, turbidity, Cl-, and SO 42 -. Bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes and Archaea from the phylum Euryarchaeota were the major phyla in both the leachates and <b>manure</b> <b>heap.</b> However, the class- or genus-level components of these phyla differed markedly between the leachate and <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> samples. The relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased from 35 % to 0. 3 ~ 13. 9 % in the monitoring wells and background wells at both sites. The Firmicutes in these wells was unlikely to have originated from the transportation of leachate to the surrounding environment because Firmicutes genera differed drastically between the leachate and monitoring wells. Meanwhile, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) from the livestock carcass burial site were detected in the monitoring wells close to the leachate. This was likely because the release of carcass decomposition products, such as organic acids, to adjacent areas improved the suitability of the local environments for SRB, which were not abundant in the leachate.

Digestion by cattle, and storage within a <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> for 6 months or longer, further reduced seed germination.

40|$|Separation of slurry {{produces}} a solid fraction that {{is stored in}} manure heaps before {{being used as a}} fertiliser in crop production. Considerable amounts of ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases may be emitted during storage, which has deleterious environmental effects. The emission levels can be expected to depend on oxygenation level inside the bulk of the stored manure and therefore on storage conditions. An experiment was thus set up to study gaseous emissions during storage of the solid fraction, and the effects of the oxygenation of manure heaps on emissions of NH 3 and various greenhouse gases. Emissions of NH 3 and the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from an uncovered and covered heap of solids separated from pig slurry were compared, and related to the oxygenation level inside the <b>manure</b> <b>heap.</b> Approximately 15 % of the initial nitrogen content was lost when separated solids were stored uncovered.

Of the initial carbon content, 28 % was lost during uncovered storage; the majority of this was emitted as CO 2 (25 %), while 1. 3 % was emitted as CH 4. Oxygenation level inside the heap was found to influence the production and emission of greenhouse gases. Covering the heap with an airtight material delayed aeration of the bulk of the stored manure, which reduced the internal heat production, degradation of organic matter, and emission of NH 3 and greenhouse gases.

Egypt was heavily dependent on the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate the land and in years of low inundation severe famine could occur with breakdowns in social order resulting, notably between 930-1070 AD and 1180-1350 AD. Instances of cannibalism are recorded during these periods but it is unknown if this happened during the pharaonic era of Ancient Egypt. Beatrix Midant-Reynes describes human sacrifice as having occurred at Abydos in the early dynastic period (c. 3150-2850 BCE), while Jan Assmann asserts there is no clear evidence of human sacrifice ever happening in Ancient Egypt.|$|R
