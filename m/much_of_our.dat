5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled {{at the very end}} of the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant lacunae and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{information}} about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th-century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 – c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's trumpeters at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal of My Life inside the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, {{on the state of}} the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{art historians}} focus their {{study on the}} {{development}} of art in the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. The Parthenon is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.|$|E

25|$|If so, {{then we must}} plan our eugenic policy {{along some}} such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, {{allegedly}} less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest {{the removal of the}} last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{information}} on laeti {{is contained in}} the Notitia Dignitatum, a document drawn up {{at the turn of}} the 4th/5th centuries. The document is a list of official posts in the Roman Empire, both civil and military. It must be treated with caution, as many sections are missing or contain gaps, so the Notitia does not account for all posts and commands in existence at the time of compilation. Furthermore, the lists for the two halves of the Empire are separated by as much as 30 years, corresponding to ca. 395 for the Eastern section and ca. 425 for the West. Therefore, not all posts mentioned were in existence at the same time, and not all posts that were in existence are shown.|$|E

500|$|Editor Ralph Rosenblum's first {{assembly}} of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. [...] "I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions," [...] Brickman recalled. [...] "It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled." [...] Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as [...] "the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life {{and in the process}} satirizing <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of Take the Money and Run". Brickman found it [...] "nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise." [...] He suggested a more linear narrative.|$|E
500|$|According to Franklin, the {{selective}} fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced {{to attract and}} hold people's attention {{by focusing on the}} unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there [...] "and the world is structured to believe in them." [...] She argues that images from afar have taken over <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. [...] "And somewhere, someone will have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, but if we are badly off we must blame you for causing us to give up so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lands to our enemies." ...|$|E

500|$|The Fountains {{theme of}} fear of death is [...] "a {{movement}} from darkness into light, from black to white" [...] that traces the journey of a man scared of death and moving toward it. The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman {{emphasized the importance of}} the Fall in the film: [...] "The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. We {{live in a world of}} duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about." [...] Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, [...] "If they had drank from the Tree of Life [...] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholar Andrea Loewenstein {{published}} the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes {{that they were}} [...] "exceptionally good pulp" [...] that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 {{had a tendency to}} reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. [...] "Since <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> past is so bitter, ... pretend away our most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states [...] "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, [...] "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is [...] "surprisingly... passionate, tender, and erotic".|$|E
500|$|At the Norman Conquest in 1066, {{the wealth}} of Glastonbury made it a prime prize. The new Norman abbot, Turstin, added to the church, unusually {{building}} {{to the east of}} the older Saxon church and away from the ancient cemetery, thus shifting the sanctified site. This was later changed by Herlewin, the next abbot, who built a larger church. Not all the new Normans were suitable heads of religious communities. In 1077, Thurstin was dismissed after his armed retainers killed monks by the High Altar. In 1086, when the Domesday Book was commissioned, Glastonbury Abbey was the richest monastery in the country. About 1125, the abbot Henry of Blois commissioned a history of Glastonbury from the esteemed historian William of Malmesbury, who was a guest of the monks. His work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church" [...] was compiled sometime between 1129 and 1139 as part of a campaign to establish the abbey's primacy against Westminster. It is the source for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of the abbey's early history but is far below William's generally excellent standards: his acceptance of the monks' forged charters and unsubstantiated early legends is apparent and even his list of the community's abbots cannot be reconciled with 10th-century originals subsequently discovered. These problems and the discrepancies between [...] "On the Antiquity" [...] and his own later histories has led many scholars to assume that William's original text was more careful and its accounts of [...] "Phagan" [...] and [...] "Deruvian", along with various passages about Arthur, were later additions meant to bolster the monks' case.|$|E

500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille [...] "a nearly {{flawless}} {{piece of}} popular art, {{as well as}} one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film"; echoing the character Anton Ego in the film, he ended his review with a simple [...] "thank you" [...] to the creators of the film. Wally Hammond of Time Out gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon." [...] Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> world but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag." [...] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients – abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication – to produce a warm and irresistible concoction." ...|$|E
