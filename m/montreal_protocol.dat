40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the current Warsaw System should be modified, mainly because the {{compensation}} limit is too low. The most trenchant problem has been to maintain the concept of uniformity while different economic conditions have become increasingly {{the order of the day}} and to cope with the increasing disparity between industrialized and developing nations. Overview of the problems of the current system is made, using the KAL flight 007 case. This thesis explores the relationship between passengers and air carriers, which should be interpreted as a common interest. It also examines the term "unlimited" which, frequently, leads to confusion. Even though the purpose of "willful misconduct" is to provide higher compensation for the passenger, it would be better to interpret it as "no-limit" so as not to confuse it with unlimited liability (full-compensation). The present thesis next explores unlimited liability (full-compensation) as being unrealistic in practice in the international community. The rationale of <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> No. 3 and No. 4 and their opponents' opinions are also examined. In conclusion, we will propose that the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> No. 3 and No. 4 are an acceptable solution to modernize the Warsaw System...|$|R

40|$|Over {{than sixty}} years ago was {{concluded}} the Warsaw Convention {{in order to provide}} a basis for the unification of the international private air law. The treaty, not only eliminated the problems of conflicts of laws and jurisdictions, but also set a regime of liability based on presumed fault which is still applied, today, in most international air transportations. But since the late sixties, the system has been more and more criticized and is now in crisis. The present situation has arisen because the treaty, drawn up during the infancy of the aviation industry, has, thus, afforded the carriers a certain level of protection in by setting maxima to the amount of compensation which consumers can recover in case of damage during the air transportation. These limits are now insufficient with regard to the average standard of living, especially in the Western countries. Five texts have amended the 1929 Convention so as to adapt the limits to the socio-economic requirements. The last ones, known as <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols,</b> have been signed in 1975 and, besides the raising of the maxima, have set a new regime of strict liability. But they have not been yet brought into force. The question of their ratification is in several countries related to the acceptance of a limited liability in case of injuries to passengers. This paper will first expose the respective mechanisms of application of the current liability system for air transport of passengers and air transport of cargo; then it will analyze the debate concerning the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> Nos 3 & 4 and the future prospects for the "Warsaw Regime"...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocol,</b> {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E

40|$|I Recent Issues of Regulation of International Carriage by Air Summary The {{purpose of}} my thesis is the {{analysis}} of regulation of international carriage by air where currently co-exist two regimes based on different international conventions. The Warsaw Convention was the first instrument that unified body of rules governing the international carriage by air, especially the most important areas: the arrangement of documents of carriage and the carrier's liability. Its most significant feature is the limited liability for sustained damages in case of death, wounding or any other bodily injury of passengers, in addition based on fault. It has been considered as deeply protective to air carriers. The only character in favor of passengers is the shifted burden of proof so that the airlines are presumed liable unless they can meet the necessary measures standards. Huge discontent with this regulation led to entering into arrangements that modified the Warsaw Convention. Non-uniformity of this regime has been the cause of adoption of new Montreal Convention which incorporates most of relevant norms contained in arrangements which modified the Warsaw Convention. Thus the Montreal convention contains some provisions of the Guatemala Protocol, the Guadalajara Convention and <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> III and IV. The new [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background. Stratospheric ozone {{is being}} {{depleted}} and ambient ultraviolet (UV) irradlance is probably increasing.

Methods. The evidence that these changes may have harmful effects on health has been reviewed. Results. The direct harmful effects are skin cancer, ocular damage and, possibly, immune suppression with an Increase in infectious disease. Indirect, harmful effects resulting from climate change, changes in atmospheric chemistry, and changes in food supply may also occur. Beneficial effects are also possible but have largely escaped attention. Quantification of these effects is either uncertain or impossible at present and the outcomes for health in 50 years time can only be guessed at. Conclusions. To understand better the health consequence of stratospheric ozone depletion, we need to know the quantitative relationship between ambient UV radiation and skin cancer, whether or not UV radiation really causes cataract and other ocular effects and what the quantitative relationships are, whether effects of UV radiation on immune function produce detectable health consequences, whether there are important beneficial effects of increasing UV radiation and, ultimately, what the balance of all these effects might be on health on a global scale. Effects of increasing ambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the incidence and severity of infection (Table 1) {{may turn out to be}} the most important direct harmful effects on health of stratospheric ozone depletion...|$|R

Potential substitutes include pure and mixtures of hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs) which have the potential for matching thermodynamic properties of current working fluids while meeting several criteria for ODP, GWP, flammability, toxicity and production cost.

40|$|Halons {{have long}} been the fire suppressants of choice for {{applications}} requiring high performance. However, halons {{are linked to the}} stratospheric ozone depletion problem. The most common halon, 1301 or CF{sub 3 }Br, has an ozone depletion potential (ODP) 11 times higher than the most common chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerant. This has led to a ban on halon production under the Clean Air Act legislation in the US following the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> on ozone depleting substances. Halon replacements are being actively sought for new fire suppression systems and to retrofit existing systems as the current supply of halons is exhausted. One promising replacement is CF{sub 3 }I. This compound has been shown to have fire suppression performance similar to that achieved for halon 1301, but with a very low ODP. Unlike halon 1301, CF{sub 3 }I rapidly photolyzes in the troposphere, and thus has a tropospheric lifetime of less than two days. However, CF{sub 3 }I is not the perfect replacement; it has performed poorly in cardiac sensitization studies and is approved only for total flooding applications in unoccupied spaces and streaming applications. In this study, they seek to build a model for the suppression of hydrogen fires by CF{sub 3 }I. From a fundamental viewpoint, the hydrogen combustion mechanism is appealing because it is the simplest and best characterized of all combustion mechanisms, and an important sub-mechanism of all hydrocarbon combustion mechanisms. Thus, a high-performance hydrogen fire suppressant would almost certainly be an excellent suppressant for most other common fires. One-dimensional, laminar flame calculations are used to determine the major fire suppression mechanisms of CF{sub 3 }I. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: first, the model is described in detail; second, the experimental method and results are presented and finally, the authors compare the model and experimental results and discuss the major reaction pathways and suppression mechanisms of CF{sub 3 }I in hydrogen flames...|$|R
40|$|Currently, NASA uses Dichloropentafluoropropane (HCFC- 225), a Class II ozone {{depleting}} substance (ODs), {{to clean}} contaminated oxygen systems. Starting in 20 15, the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> and Clean Air Act prohibit {{the production and}} importation of all hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), except for limited use in refrigeration applications. Thus, a new non-ozone depleting solvent needs to be developed for use in cleaning. Optimally, such a solvent should also be environmentally benign or green to avoid needing to replace the new solvent with yet another solvent in the future due to other environmental concerns. Work {{for the first year}} consisted of two parts. The first part was developing a method of testing the cleaning efficiency of potential solvents. Stainless steel coupons were contaminated with a known weight of various contaminants and contaminant combinations and then immersed in solvent for ten minutes. The coupons were then removed and dried in an oven until all solvent had evaporated. Once dry, the coupons were weighed and the mass of the non-volatile residue (NVR) left on the coupon was determined. The cleaning efficiency of the solvents is reported as percent cleaning, with 100 % cleaning being zero NVR left on the test coupon. The second half of the first goal was to use the develop method to perform baseline testing on current solvents. The second part of the work was to begin exploring alternative cleaning solvents. A variety of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were tested. Preliminary testing was also performed with ionic liquids and aqueous surfactant solutions.

40|$|Application {{of surface}} wave plasma {{technology}} for effective abatement of environmentally harmful gases such as perfluorocompounds and chlorofluorocarbons is investigated. Perfluorocompounds (PFCs) are gases {{that contribute to}} forced global warming and have been favored for wafer etch and chamber clean applications in the semiconductor industry. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are ozone depleting gases that were used as refrigerants for commercial and domestic condensers and air conditioners, but current reserves still pose threats to environmental sustainability. Increased average global temperatures and further destruction {{of the ozone layer}} have prompted proposal of international initiatives such as the <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocols</b> and the Kyoto Agreement to curtail emissions of such fugitive gases into the environment. These have increased the need for effective abatement technologies to control such emissions and include surface wave plasma abatement, the subject of this dissertation. Surface wave plasmas are considered high frequency non-equilibrium traveling wave discharges in contrast to the more frequently used standing wave discharges. The use of surface wave plasmas have the advantages of a variety of discharge vessel shapes, reproducibility of application, numerous operating conditions and large plasma volumes which ultimately produce low, molecular weight byproducts that are associated with high effective electron temperatures but low heavy particle temperatures. For these reasons, surface wave plasma abatement technology was developed for the destruction and removal of PFCs and CFCs. Results include final destruction and removal efficiencies (DREs) for octafluorocyclobutane greater than 99. 8 %, dichlorodifluoromethane greater than 99. 995 % and trichlorofluoromethane greater than 99. 999 % using moderate applied microwave powers of less than 2000 watts with the production of low molecular weight byproducts, such as CO 2, CO, HF and HCl, that prevent environmentally harmful process emissions from entering the atmosphere.
