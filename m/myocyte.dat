Also, (as noted above), hyperkalemia causes an overall membrane depolarization that inactivates many sodium channels.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} the developmental transition from slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) to cardiac TnI (cTnI) isoform expression in cardiac <b>myocytes</b> remains unclear. We show here the effects of adenovirus-mediated ssTnI gene transfer on myofilament structure and function in adult cardiac <b>myocytes</b> in primary culture. Gene transfer resulted in the rapid, uniform, and nearly complete replacement of endogenous cTnI with the ssTnI isoform with no detected changes in sarcomeric ultrastructure, or in the isoforms and stoichiometry of other myofilament proteins compared with control <b>myocytes</b> over 7 days in primary culture. In functional studies on permeabilized single cardiac <b>myocytes,</b> the threshold for Ca 2 +-activated contraction was significantly lowered in adult cardiac <b>myocytes</b> expressing ssTnI relative to control values. The tension–Ca 2 + relationship was unchanged from controls in primary cultures of cardiac <b>myocytes</b> treated with adenovirus containing the adult cardiac troponin T (TnT) or cTnI cDNAs. These results indicate that changes in Ca 2 + activation of tension in ssTnI-expressing cardiac <b>myocytes</b> were isoform-specific, and not due to nonspecific functional changes resulting from overexpression of a myofilament protein. Further, Ca 2 +-activated tension development was enhanced in cardiac <b>myocytes</b> expressing ssTnI compared with control values under conditions mimicking the acidosis found during myocardial ischemia. These results show that ssTnI enhances contractile sensitivity to Ca 2 + activation under physiological and acidic pH conditions in adult rat cardiac <b>myocytes,</b> and demonstrate the utility of adenovirus vectors for rapid and efficient genetic modification of the cardiac myofilament for structure/function studies in cardiac <b>myocytes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cryopreserved cardiac <b>myocytes</b> are {{expected}} to be useful for the development of new drug against heart disease. However, the appropriate cryopreservation process for cardiac <b>myocytes</b> has not been established yet. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the cryopreservation of cardiac <b>myocytes</b> by three measurements: 1) the total viability (including cardiac <b>myocytes)</b> just after thawing with trypan blue staining, 2) the observation of morphology of cardiac <b>myocytes</b> for 7 days culture by real-time phase contrast microscopy and immunofluorescent staining, and 3) the variation of their beating rates for 7 days after thawing. The total viabilities of cryopreserved cells with 3 v/v% to 20 v/v% DMSO concentration were higher than those without DMSO. Thawed cells contracted regularly and spontaneously during culture, as did the non-cryopreserved cells. The immunofluorescence observation indicated that the thawed cardiac <b>myocytes</b> expressed α-actinin. Therefore, cardiac <b>myocytes</b> could be survived by the cryopreservation with DMSO concentrations between 3 v/v% and 20 v/v%, which had the normal contraction rates during culture for 7 days...|$|R

Cardiac <b>myocytes</b> {{were separated by}} isopycnic centrifugation in 88. 6 to 92. 4 % purity from other heart cells with different densities, and by velocity or rate-zonal sedimentation, in 92. 8 to 97. 4 % purity from heart cells with different diameters. A previously described computer integration of the differential sedimentation equation {{was used to determine}} the centrifugal force, duration of centrifugation and gradient design, which would permit the separation of cardiac <b>myocytes</b> from other heart cells by velocity sedimentation. The <b>myocytes</b> continued to contract rhythmically after being recovered from the density gradients. Velocity sedimentation was superior to isopycnic sedimentation for the separation of cardiac <b>myocytes</b> from heart cell suspensions because it gave the most highly purified <b>myocytes,</b> resulted in recovery of the largest proportion of <b>myocytes</b> in purified fractions from the gradient and required lower centrifugal forces for shorter periods of time.
