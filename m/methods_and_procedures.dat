500|$|In a 1 April 2011 {{article in}} the Washington Post {{reflecting}} on the Commission's work, Goldstone wrote that the report {{would have been different}} if he had been aware of information that has become known since its issuance. While expressing regret that Israel's failure to co-operate with the Commission had hindered its ability to gather exculpatory facts, he approved Israel's subsequent internal investigations into incidents described in the report as well as their establishment of policies to better protect civilians in future conflicts. He contrasted the Israeli reaction with the failure of Hamas to investigate or modify their <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures.</b> Goldstone said he had hoped that the Commission's inquiry [...] "would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted". In addition, {{according to a report in}} Haaretz, Goldstone told associates in early 2011 that [...] "he has been in great distress and under duress" [...] ever since publication of his report.|$|E
