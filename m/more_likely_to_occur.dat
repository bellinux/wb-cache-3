5|$|The lake effect snowfalls are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in late fall, early winter, {{and during}} spring {{due to the}} higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to}} the lake effect.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} occurs in several habitats, ranging from coastal salt marshes to {{mountain}} streams and clearings. It is semiaquatic, spending {{much time in}} the water, and usually occurs in wetland habitats. It prefers areas where the ground is covered with grasses and sedges, which protect it from predators. In southern Illinois, marsh rice rats are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in wetlands with more herbaceous cover, visual obstruction, and nearby grasslands. The species also occurs in drier uplands, which serve as sinks for young, dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide. Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers; studies on islands off Virginia's Delmarva Peninsula show that they readily cross 300-m (1000ft) channels between islands.|$|E
5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} for DPB susceptibility {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, that is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> among a common ethnicity or trait) common {{to people of}} East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 {{is associated with the}} disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, {{and noted}} that barium, a lighter element, was among the {{products}} produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this {{would result in the}} release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.|$|E

50|$|Waddington {{called the}} effect {{he had seen}} genetic assimilation. His {{explanation}} {{was that it was}} caused by a process he called canalization.

As a particular pathway becomes entrenched or canalized, it becomes <b>more</b> stable, <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> {{even in the face of}} environmental changes. Major perturbations such as ether or heat shock eject the developmental pathway from the canal, exploring other parts of the epigenetic landscape.

40|$|The {{likelihood}} of extreme daily changes in London Interbank Offer rates are estimated using the peaks-over-threshold method developed from extreme value theory.

When the series are transformed to logarithmic daily changes, extreme value analysis proceeds smoothly and yields useful information about the relative frequency or magnitudes of extreme events.
