25|$|In 2013, in {{a lawsuit}} against our church, a woman accused <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> three others of molesting her twenty-five years earlier. She didn’t {{remember}} the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories. She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse. Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened. But that didn’t spare us from a witch hunt. In the initial months, the accused were labeled child sex offenders {{and the story of}} the abuse, truth be damned, was aggressively promoted in news, radio and social media.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and,</b> in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia. California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having {{to return to the}} orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James [...] "Jim" [...] Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently {{dropped out of high school}} and became a housewife; she later stated that the [...] "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom." [...] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine. He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain there for most of the next two years. After Dougherty's deployment, Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the Radioplane Munitions Factory in Van Nuys, both as part of the war effort and to earn her own income.|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

500|$|There is {{controversy}} over authorship of Frankenstein, as both Shelley {{and her husband}} collaborated on the story. The extent to which Percy Shelley contributed to the novel is unknown. Since Frankenstein was published anonymously in 1818, readers and critics argued over its origins and {{the contributions of the}} two Shelleys to the book. [...] There are differences in the 1818, 1823, and 1831 editions, and Mary Shelley wrote, [...] "I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world." [...] She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percy's work [...] "as far as I can recollect." [...] James Rieger concluded Percy's [...] "assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator", while Anne K. Mellor later argued Percy only [...] "made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text." [...] Charles E. Robinson, editor of a facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts, concluded that Percy's contributions to the book [...] "were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress." ...|$|E
