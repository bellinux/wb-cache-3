The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse work flexibility of organic suckler sheep farms using the criterion 'room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time'. A survey about work organisation was conducted on 14 organic sheep farms in the central region of France to quantify work durations and tasks carried out by different categories of workers in order to calculate the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time. Statistical analysis was performed to analyse variability in room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> A cluster analysis conducted on four variables describing room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time over the year classified the farms into three groups. The results show that the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time per person displayed a broad variability according to the farms (396 to 1, 199 h per year). The amount of routine work per person of the basic group was one factor explaining the differences. Results show different ways to obtain room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time and its temporal distribution over the year, among organic suckler sheep farms. Three repartitions were identified. Group 1 was characterised by a low room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in winter, corresponding to the period of lambing in the sheep barn. The high routine workload was carried out self-sufficiently by the basic group. Group 2 had a high room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> over the year. The farmers delegated a part of the routine work during holidays. Group 3 had a low room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> over the year. These farms had lambings throughout the year due to several different lambing periods. Their low room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> was also explained by a farmer's dual jobholding or by diversification of farm activities (slaughter, direct sales). The paper concludes identifying potential labour solutions to increase the flexibility of work organisation such as simplification of flock management or delegation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize and to analyze the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time in dairy production systems (DPS). Two interviews were conducted in twenty DPS in the Northern region of Paraná, Brazil, with the following objectives: to know the management and practices involving the herd, the land area and the commercialization; and to qualify and evaluate the work organization. In order to build the variables, the repertory grid method was used, and for the typology, the graphic methodology of Bert in adapted to small samples was used. The results showed that the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time of the DPS, quantified in hours available per year, varied between the farmers and was related to routine work and seasonal work durations, as well as the autonomy of farmers to perform both works. The routine work was related to the number of cows, but was also explained by the herd management, by the transport equipment for the feed and by the workforce composition. Four types of work organization were identified between sampled DPS, based on room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time and how they were built. Knowing the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> time and its variables, it is possible to guide the farmers toad just their dairy production system in order to have more time available for other activities or to develop the dairy production system...|$|R

Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of interviews and document data I conclude that ETA responded rationally to a contradiction of its room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> Three main factors made it difficult for the Basque radical nationalist to uphold their ideological paradigm. (1) Loss of legitimacy in the Basque population. (2) Increased coordination by Spanish and French authorities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the knowledge of the school counselor and their room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> regarding cyberbullying among students. We have used a qualitative method, which consists of eight semi-structured interviews with six middle school student counselors and two high school student counselors, in a middle-sized municipality in Sweden. Our study showed that the school counselors have limited knowledge about cyberbullying due to the fast development of the internet, and limited time in their work. The limited knowledge affects the school counselor’s way of work, and how they use their room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> on cyberbullying. All the school counselors in this study make no difference in the way they work to identify traditional bullying versus cyberbullying. Today, bullying occurs in two arenas, the physical room and the virtual room. Due to the fact that bullying can occur any time of the day, the limits for responsibility of the school counselors and when the parent’s responsibility comes in, is unclear. This study shows that the school counselors have too much on their desk, which entails that they have limited knowledge on how to handle the problem of cyberbullying. The result of the study shows that the school counselors have various knowledge and they use their room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in different ways...|$|R
