50|$|This variant {{can be seen}} on {{the cover}} of a Hohner {{demonstration}} record for the Pianet. It has an upper case profile with a taper towards the front. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys with a lock fitted centrally. The keys are injection moulded plastic. It stands on two shaped panel legs joined by a <b>modesty</b> <b>panel.</b> There is a piano-like volume pedal fixed on a timber extension from the <b>modesty</b> <b>panel.</b> The optional amplifier unit available for the N model is mounted underneath the keyboard between the legs. Vibrato effect is standard.|$|E
50|$|A <b>modesty</b> <b>panel</b> {{is a thin}} {{board of}} wood or metal that is {{attached}} to the front of a desk, drafting table, electronic organ, or similar item. It is intended to shield legs, ankles, or feet from view in a variety of circumstances. The panel provides privacy for the person seated at the desk or organ, as it covers {{the upper part of the}} legs. This privacy role is particularly useful in cases where the desk or organ is positioned in front of a class or hall. The <b>modesty</b> <b>panel</b> provides structural support for the four legs of the desk or organ, and it may also be used as a place for affixing electric cabling, computer cabling, or electrical extension boxes.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{criticism}} of the cars raced in 2012 for being [...] "ugly" [...] because of a visible step {{in the design of}} the nose, the 2013 technical regulations allowed teams to use a [...] "modesty panel", or a small piece of carbon fibre designed to cover the nose of the car for aesthetic purposes. However, the E21 was launched without a <b>modesty</b> <b>panel,</b> as the team felt that it offered no aerodynamic benefit, and that the aesthetic qualities it offered were not worth the added weight, however slight the weight gain might be.|$|E
50|$|Unlike many digital pianos, {{which are}} {{designed}} for semi-permanent installation in a private home, and which have design elements which make regular transportation difficult (e.g., permanently mounted legs, <b>modesty</b> <b>panel,</b> internal power amplifier and speakers and a fixed sustain pedal), which would require a van and movers to relocate, a stage piano generally has a portable, detachable stand, no internal amp or speakers (an output jack is provided so the instrument can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier), and a detachable sustain pedal plugged into a jack. This enables a performer to remove all the detachable parts and {{makes it easier to}} transport the instrument to gigs and rehearsals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} form of the {{computer}} desk is a variant of the ergonomic desk, which has an adjustable [...] and sufficient desktop space for handwriting. Provisions for a monitor shelf and holes for routing cables are integrated in the design, making it easier to connect the computer components together. The typical armoire desk provides space for a keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer and speakers. Cubicle desk designs for business and government workplaces include a range of shelves, trays and cable-routing holes for computer systems. In some computer desks, the cabling is affixed to the <b>modesty</b> <b>panel</b> {{at the back of the}} desk, to create a neater appearance.|$|E
5000|$|With {{computers}} more prevalent, [...] "computer paper" [...] {{became an}} office supply. The {{beginning of this}} paper boom {{gave birth to the}} dream of the [...] "paperless office", in which all information would only appear on computer monitors. However, the ease of printing personal documents and the lack of comfort with reading text on computer monitors led to a great deal of document printing. The need for paperwork space vied with the increased desk space taken up by computer monitors, CPUs, printers, scanners, and other peripherals. The need for more space led some desk companies to attach some accessory items to the <b>modesty</b> <b>panel</b> {{at the back of the}} desk, such as outlet strips and cable management, in an attempt to clear the desktop of electrical clutter.|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} most common KX, {{designed}} to be the direct successor to the K6, the KX100 is a four-sided rectangular box with a flat roof. Aside from the back panel, which is formed of stainless steel panels, the three other sides of the box are made of glass, with two large window panels set above and beneath a slim, black plastic <b>modesty</b> <b>panel,</b> also with a black plastic trim around the windows. The same three sides of the booth stop short of the ground to provide ventilation, another improvement on the non-ventilated K6, and for litter accumulation. Initial deliveries had cylindrical legs, for leveling on site, a flat-sheet roof with upturned edges and a multi-panel back. A slightly updated model known as the Mk2 soon followed, without the adjustable legs and with a single sheet back panel and the more familiar 'biscuit tin lid' roof.|$|E
50|$|Upright pianos, grand pianos, stage pianos, harpsichords, pipe organs, Hammond {{organs and}} many post-1980s {{electronic}} keyboards have {{some type of}} rack or stand to hold sheet music and/or scores. On some grand pianos, the music stand can be removed, for example, if the performer is playing a piano solo work or a piano concerto from memory. On some electronic or electric keyboards, the stand can be removed, to facilitate transportation of the instrument to rehearsals and gigs. If the music stands on electronic and electric keyboards were permanently affixed, they would make the instrument harder to load into a van or car, and the stand would be vulnerable to damage. On some digital pianos designed for use in a private home or studio, the music rack is permanently installed, but most users of digital pianos do not transport them to rehearsals and gigs, because these instruments often have a number of design features that are not conducive to regular transport (e.g., fixed keyboard legs and a <b>modesty</b> <b>panel</b> and fixed pedals for sustain and sostenuto). Most keyboardists who are regularly transporting electronic keyboards to rehearsals and gigs use stage pianos or MIDI controller keyboards along with a sound module; on these instruments, all of the accessories (music rack, keyboard stand, sustain pedal) can be disconnected. By enabling the keyboard to be broken down into separate components, it makes the instrument more transportable in a regular car, even including small vehicles. In contrast, a high-end digital piano with a fixed music rack, stand and pedals would need a van and several helpers to transport it.|$|E
40|$|Cerise {{cocktail}} dress; straight {{skirt with}} metal zip to centre back. Bodice is boned and has three rows of inverted pleats across the bust and five across the waist. Skirt has vent to centre back seam with <b>modesty</b> <b>panel</b> inside. Shoulder straps {{have been added}} at a later date. Fully lined; probably home sewn. - from the The Betty Smithers Design Collection at Staffordshire University. ...|$|E
