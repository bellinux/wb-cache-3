25|$|Tensions between Fatah and Hamas {{intensified}} after Hamas won {{the elections}} of 2006 {{and the international community}} increased the pressure on the Palestinian Authority. As a result of the Hamas led government's refusal to commit to nonviolence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements, Israel, the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>Quartet</b> (United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union), several Western states, and the Arab states imposed sanctions suspending all foreign aid.|$|E

Within days, the US recognized Abbas' government and ended a 15-month {{economic and political}} boycott of the Palestinian Authority {{in a bid to}} bolster President Abbas and the new Fatah-led government. The European Union similarly announced plans to resume direct aid to the Palestinians, while Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said it would release to Abbas Palestinian tax revenues that Israel had withheld since Hamas took control of the Palestinian Parliament. The <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>Quartet</b> reiterated their continued support to Abbas and resume of normal relations with the Fatah-led PA. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged international support for Abbas's efforts [...] "to restore law and order". Israel and Egypt began a blockade of the Gaza Strip.|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2008 {{article in}} Vanity Fair magazine, the {{journalist}} David Rose published confidential documents, apparently originating from the US State Department, which would {{prove that the}} United States collaborated with the Palestinian Authority and Israel to attempt the violent overthrow of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and that Hamas pre-empted the coup. The documents suggest that a government with Hamas should {{meet the demands of}} the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>Quartet,</b> otherwise President Mahmoud Abbas should declare a state of emergency, which effectively would dissolve the current unity government, or the government should collapse by other means. Rose quotes former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief Middle East adviser David Wurmser, accusing the Bush administration of “engaging in a dirty war in an effort to provide a corrupt dictatorship [...] with victory.” He believes that Hamas had no intention of taking Gaza until Fatah forced its hand. “It looks to me that what happened wasn’t so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen” ...|$|E

The Quartet Plan calls for direct, bilateral negotiations {{as part of a}} comprehensive resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 1397, 1515, 1850, and the Madrid principles. The Quartet has reiterated that the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967; resolves all permanent status issues as previously defined by the parties; and fulfils the aspirations of both parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.|$|R
50|$|The {{two parties}} engaged in direct {{negotiation}} are the Israeli government, currently led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), currently headed by Mahmoud Abbas.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} responsibility for omissions of the <b>Quartet</b> on the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> The <b>Quartet</b> was created {{to assist in the}} peace process between Israel and Palestine. Its core document is the Roadmap, but in recent years it has {{failed to live up to}} its expectations and arguably this constituted a breach of obligations to prevent. The ensuing questions of attribution of conduct and allocation of responsibility are highly complex, as this paper’s analysis has demonstrated. The members of the Quartet, the US, the UN, the EU and Russia, have created an entity that is not an international organisation with separate legal personality, so it cannot be held responsible. Holding the individual members responsible, which would be the obvious alternative, is highly problematic due to the requirement of individualised conduct for attribution, the diversity of the obligations binding on the members of the Quartet and the difficulty in distinguishing each contribution to the Quartet’s omissions...|$|R
40|$|The Israeli-Palestinian {{conflict}} {{is an ongoing}} dispute between the State of Israel and the Palestinians. It also forms part of the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. Essentially, it is a dispute between two national identities with claims over the same area of land. Many {{attempts have been made}} to broker a two state solution, which would entail the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. At present, the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians, according to many major polls, agree that a two state solution is the best way to end the conflict. [1][2][3] Most Palestinians view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as constituting the area of their future state, which is a view also accepted by most Israelis. [4] A handful of academics advocate a one-state solution, whereby all of Israel, the Gaza Strip, and West Bank would become a bi-national state with equal rights for all. [5][6] However, there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments. [7] There are various domestic and international actors involved in the conflict. The direct negotiating parties are the Israeli government, currently led by Ehud Olmert, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), currently headed by Mahmoud Abbas. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the <b>Quartet</b> on the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> (the <b>Quartet)</b> represented by a special envoy, currently Tony Blair, that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The Arab League is another important actor, which has proposed an alternative peace plan. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has historically been a key participant. Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by conflict between the two major factions: Fatah, the largest party, and Hamas, an Islamist militan...|$|R
