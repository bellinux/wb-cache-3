The advantage of using a sensor array over using a single sensor {{lies in the fact that}} an array adds new dimensions to the observation, helping to estimate more parameters and improve the estimation performance.For example an array of radio antenna elements used for beamforming can increase antenna gain in the direction of the signal while decreasing the gain in other directions, i.e., increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by amplifying the signal coherently. Another example of sensor array application is to estimate the direction of arrival of impinging electromagnetic waves. The related processing method is called array signal processing.

40|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> of {{equipment}} {{critical to the}} operation of a plant has become common practice in most industries, both for the detection and progress tracking of faults. Tracking the progression of faults {{is a measure of}} the rate of degradation which is often used as an indicator for assessing the remaining lifetime of the machine. The estimation of remaining lifetime without a dedicated strategy will however result in unreliable results. Knowledge of the remaining lifetime of a machine can aid the maintenance department in ordering appropriate replacement parts, plan a machine shutdown or machine replacement. Current techniques are generally concerned with the statistical distribution of failure, which is not always available and may be open to error. A strategy for predicting the remaining lifetime of gearboxes is presented in this paper, based on the wear conditions of components detected by <b>machine</b> <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring.</b> While this strategy can be used to estimate machine lifetimes from new condition, this unique approach also allows the estimate to be updated using <b>machine</b> <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> data.

Usage of these new components enables machine to work quieter, increase its reliability, and lengthen working life. Machine vibration analysis belongs to important methods used for rotating <b>machine</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Rotating <b>machine</b> vibrations are often processed by Fourier spectrum especially Power Spectrum Density (PSD) analysis. Power Spectrum Density of vibrations measured on rotating machine contains a lot of peaks at many different frequencies. Recognition of peaks produced by an analyzed part of the machine is necessary for machine monitoring. This could be accomplished by theoretical estimation of frequencies characteristic for the analyzed part, e. g. tooth frequency for gear transmission. These theoretical estimations are unknown for new designs of a selected part or even these estimations are often uncertain.

To increase the efficiency, reliability {{and safety of}} <b>machines,</b> <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> of bearings is significant during the operation. However, due {{to the influence of}} high background noise and bearing component slippages, incipient faults are difficult to detect. With the continuous research on the bearing system, the modulation effects have been well known and the demodulation based on optimal frequency bands is approved as a promising method in <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring.</b> For the purpose of enhancing the performance of demodulation analysis, a robust method, ensemble average autocorrelation based stochastic subspace identification (SSI), is introduced to determine the optimal frequency bands. Furthermore, considering that both the average and autocorrelation functions can reduce noise, auto-correlated envelope ensemble average (AEEA) is proposed to suppress noise and highlight the localised fault signature. In order to examine the performance of this method, the slippage of bearing signals is modelled as a Markov process in the simulation study. Based on the analysis results of simulated bearing fault signals with white noise and slippage and an experimental signal from a planetary gearbox test bench, the proposed method is robust to determine the optimal frequency bands, suppress noise and extract the fault characteristics...|$|R
