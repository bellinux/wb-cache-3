25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the <b>maximum</b> <b>stress</b> occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
25|$|Bone is {{constantly}} being created and replaced {{in a process}} known as remodeling. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of signals, and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth.. Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of <b>maximum</b> <b>stress</b> (Wolff's law). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's piezoelectric properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.|$|E

500|$|On 19 October 1954, the Cohen Committee was {{established}} to examine {{the causes of the}} Comet crashes. [...] Chaired by Lord Cohen, the committee tasked an investigation team led by Sir Arnold Hall, Director of the RAE at Farnborough, to perform a more detailed investigation. [...] Hall's team began considering fatigue as the most likely cause of both accidents, and initiated further research into measurable strain on the aircraft's skin. With the recovery of large sections of G-ALYP from the Elba crash and BOAC's donation of an identical airframe, G-ALYU, for further examination, an extensive [...] "water torture" [...] test eventually provided conclusive results. This time, the entire fuselage was tested in a dedicated water tank that was built specifically at Farnborough to accommodate its full length. Stress around the window corners was found to be much higher than expected and stresses on the skin were generally more than previously expected or tested. The windows' square shape caused stress concentration by generating levels of stress two or three times greater than across the rest of the fuselage. In 2012 a finite element analysis was carried out to find the stress values in a digital model of the Comet's cabin window loaded to a pressure differential of 8.25 psi. In this model the <b>maximum</b> <b>stress</b> level at the margin of one of the outer row of rivet holes near the corner of the window was almost five times greater than in the areas of skin remote from the windows.|$|E

Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In brittle materials like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to tensile loading, [...] unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength {{of materials}}, such as the bending flexural test, the biaxial flexural strength test and the weibull approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication.

This 'Allowable Displacement Stress Range' value was calculated using equation (1 a) found on page 16 of the above mentioned reference. Each of the lines that comprise the End Cap Calorimeter (BC) piping were modeled on ANSYS and the appropriate constraints were applied. This was done using the Piping Stress Analysis Module of ANSYS. The bending stresses and displacements due to the thermal contraction that occurs in cooling the piping from 300 K to 77 K were calculated by ANSYS. The seven lines involved and their <b>maximum</b> bending <b>stresses</b> are as follows: (1) Rupture Disc - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 8335 psi; (2) Argon Relief - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 12, 619 psi; (3) Gaseous Argon Supply - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 5399 psi; (4) Liquid Nitrogen Cooldown Supply - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 7049 psi; (5) Liquid Nitrogen Operating Supply - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 5774 psi; (6) Nitrogen Exhaust - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 1826 psi; and (7) Argon/Nitrogen Vent - <b>Maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> is 48, 364 psi. The <b>maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> values and their positions are indicated on the attached diagrams. The dashed line indicates the original position of the piping, and the solid line shows {{the position of the}} displaced piping. Also attached are copies of the programs used to model the piping configurations. The original analysis was done by J. Wendlandt, but later changes and additions required that the programs be modified and re-run. The <b>maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> found in each line of the annular piping fell sufficiently below the allowed maximum of 25, 500 psi. The <b>maximum</b> bending <b>stress</b> for the Argon/Nitrogen Vent line was 48, 364 psi, which is greater than the value of 25, 500 psi allowed by the code.

While fabrication of the EC vessel is underway, modifications will be made to the Argon/Nitrogen Vent line in order that its stress values remain within that allowed by the code.
