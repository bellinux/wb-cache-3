James Montgomery from MTV News elaborated on the network's decision that Cyrus [...] " [...] her independence and [...] the pop-culture landscape", adding that [...] "she schooled—and shocked—us all in 2013, and did so on her own terms." [...] In early December 2013, Cyrus was listed in the top ten finalists for Time Person of the Year, the only enterteiner in the list, though she lost to Pope Francis; she was also listed on Barbara Walters' [...] "Most Fascinating People of the Year". Billboard staff called Cyrus the [...] "Most Talked About Pop Star" [...] of 2013, and also recognized the controversial evolution of her career as the [...] "Top Music Moment" [...] of the year, elaborating {{that she was a}} [...] "maelstrom that expanded and grazed nearly every aspect of pop culture in 2013." [...] Cyrus was also the most-searched person of the year on Google, with Leah Chernikoff of Elle writing that [...] "most folks, even famous ones, only strike Internet gold like that once in a lifetime (or <b>maybe</b> <b>once</b> a year), but Cyrus hit it again—and again—in 2013." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gould also {{recorded}} works by Brahms, Mozart, {{and many other}} prominent piano composers, though he was outspoken in his criticism of some of them. He was extremely critical of Frédéric Chopin. In a radio interview, {{when asked if he}} didn't find himself wanting to play Chopin, he replied: [...] "No, I don't. I play it in a weak moment – <b>maybe</b> <b>once</b> a year or twice a year for myself. But it doesn't convince me." [...] Although Gould recorded all of Mozart's sonatas and admitted enjoying the [...] "actual playing" [...] of them, he claimed to dislike Mozart's later works, to the extent of arguing (perhaps facetiously) that Mozart died too late rather than too early. He was fond of many lesser-known composers, such as Orlando Gibbons, whose Anthems he had heard as a teenager, and for whose music he felt a [...] "spiritual attachment". He recorded a number of Gibbons's keyboard works and called him his favourite composer, despite his better-known admiration for the technical mastery of Bach. He made recordings of piano music by Jean Sibelius (the Sonatines and Kyllikki), Georges Bizet (the Variations Chromatiques de Concert and the Premier nocturne), Richard Strauss (the Piano Sonata, the Five Pieces, and Enoch Arden with Claude Rains), and Paul Hindemith (the three piano sonatas and the sonatas for brass and piano). He also made recordings of the complete piano works Lieder by Arnold Schoenberg. Gould was the first pianist to record any of Liszt's piano transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies (beginning with the Fifth Symphony, in 1967).|$|E
