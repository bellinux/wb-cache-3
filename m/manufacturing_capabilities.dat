5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Oswald Lutz and {{his chief of}} staff, Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian. Guderian became the more {{influential}} of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps (panzerkorps) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, {{which was to be}} armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, armed with a 150-millimeter (5.9in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100tonnes and was completely impractical given the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the day.|$|E

It not only takes advantage of common manufacturing requirements and efficiency, but also allow for customization into unique combinations. Unique orders may be managed like a manufacturing project. However, many manufacturers do not adequately enhance <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capability</b> leading to a poor project manufacturing performance. Thus, {{the primary purpose of}} this study was to assess the relationships between <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capability</b> and <b>manufacturing</b> project performance.

25|$|During the Civil War, Selma {{was one of}} the South's main {{military}} manufacturing centers, producing tons {{of supplies}} and munitions, and building Confederate warships such as the ironclad Tennessee. The Selma iron works and foundry was considered the second-most important source of weaponry for the South, after the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia. This strategic concentration of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> eventually made Selma a target of Union raids into Alabama late in the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Union busting in the United States dates {{at least}} to the 19th century, when a rapid {{expansion}} in factories and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> caused a migration of workers from agricultural work to the mining, manufacturing and transportation industries. Conditions were often unsafe, women worked for lower wages than men, and child labor was rampant. Because employers and governments did little to address these issues, labor movements in the industrialized world were formed to seek better wages, hours, and working conditions. The clashes between labor and management were often adversarial and were deeply affected by wars, economic conditions, government policies, and court proceedings.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear. Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.|$|E

In 1985, Orbital procured its first contract for providing up to four Transfer Orbital Stage (TOS) vehicles to NASA. In 1987, the seeds for the ORBCOMM constellation were planted when Orbital began investigating a system using Low Earth orbit satellites to collect data from remote locations. In 1988, Orbital acquired Space Data Corporation in Arizona- one of the world's leading suppliers of suborbital rockets- thereby broadening its rocket business and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> This {{was followed by the}} opening of a new facility in Chandler, Arizona in 1989 to house the company's expanding rocket business.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, only a {{few months}} later, the enigmatic Howard Hughes first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner {{prototype}} for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He became a believer, imagining TWA and National delivering passengers from New York City to vacation spots in Florida in half the time of the competition. He became desperate to buy 30 Jetliners, but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started looking at US companies to build it for them; Convair proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its Orenda turbojet and CF-100 jet fighter programs.|$|E

The subsequent report by the New York Times started a flurry of calls from pharmaceutical companies, interested in the commercial possibilities of nystatin. The pharmaceutical industry had the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities</b> and ability to test the compound on humans. However, to license the substance, control the purity, and protect the financial interests of the developers, Gilbert Dalldorf, the division director of the laboratory in which Hazen and Brown worked, assigned patent royalties to the Research Corporation of New York, a nonprofit foundation created {{for the advancement of}} science. The production license was awarded to E. R. Squibb & Sons, who developed a safe method of mass production and produced the first sale of the tablets, named mycostatin, for human use in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the war, Belgium {{had been}} {{regarded}} as the foremost European country for the manufacture of armaments. Its Sillon industriel, or industrial valley, {{was one of the}} first fully industrialized and mechanized regions in Europe. The Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was among the oldest armament manufacturers on the Continent, known for its manufacture of mortars, artillery shells, and land mines. Graham Spicer, an official in the Ministry of Munitions who had worked in Belgium before the war and knew its armaments <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities,</b> suggested that perhaps the Belgians might be able to help. An approach was made, and the result was that 1000 skilled Belgian armaments workers volunteered help train other volunteers. As the result of another suggestion (possibly from Spicer as well) most of these volunteers were drawn from the pool of soldiers who had been badly wounded at the front and declared unfit to return there; they were not so unfit they could not do a job of work, but were not capable of resuming life at the Front.|$|E
25|$|China {{is one of}} Israel's closest {{economic}} {{allies in}} East Asia where both countries have placed considerable importance on maintaining a strategic and supportive economic relationship. The economic synergy has served the two respective countries greatly where Israel's global technological prowess combined with China's global economic influence, industrial <b>manufacturing</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and marketing expertise made cooperation {{between the two nations}} inevitable. China including Hong Kong is Israel's second top export destination after the United States and has been the top market for Israeli exports in East Asia. China is also Israel’s third largest trading partner and export market after the United States and the European Union with China being Israel's largest export market in East Asia. Israel has sought China's enormous global influence on world affairs, large consumer market, broad industrial manufacturing scale, and burgeoning economic dynamism while China has sought Israel as a powerhouse of advanced technological wizardry and a wellspring of entrepreneurial acumen leveraging each other's complementary capabilities and resources. China has sought Israel's technology to increase its international economic competitiveness and risk management. With the advice and experience of Jewish entrepreneurs, innovators, and inventors from the high-technology sectors, China has utilized Israel's indispensable economic and technological contributions to foster its long term economic development. China has also expressed desire for Israel’s advanced technologies, particularly in fields related to agriculture, telecommunications, and defense. The scientific and technological advancements made by Israel had led many Chinese politicians to respect the country's ingenuity and creative inventiveness because they know of the contributions that as Israeli agricultural, drip irrigation, and solar energy technologies are seen as crucial to China’s economic development. Throughout Israel's early economic history, many Israeli startup companies were acquired by major U.S. and Western European corporations. Since the 2010s, China and Israel enhanced bilateral economic ties with China connecting both Chinese and Israeli businessmen and investors to invest in each other's economies respectively. Chinese economic cooperation with Israel has saw substantial Chinese investment of more than $15 billion USD in the Israeli economy, spawning seed capital in Israeli startup companies, as well as the acquisition of Israeli companies by major Chinese corporations that incorporate Israel's know how to help the invigorate the development of the modern Chinese economy more efficiently. China now ranks second after the United States in collaboration with Israeli high-tech firms that are backed by Israel’s Office of the Chief Scientist. Major Chinese firms such as Fosun, ChemChina, Brightfood, Horizons Ventures and China Everbright have invested significant amounts of financial capital and resources across numerous Israeli industries. Chinese businessmen and major Chinese corporations hold Israel's business, economic and entrepreneurial acumen and technological expertise with high esteem and have sought to integrate Israel's know-how with China's marketing proficiency, industrial manufacturing capacity and aptitude for large consumer market scaling.|$|E
