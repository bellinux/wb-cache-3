25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to <b>microcrack</b> generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{toughness}} contributed from transformation toughness {{is quite}} analogous to that from crack toughening, and the equations involved {{will be quite}} similar. Key parameters include the stress, which induces the transformation, the transformational strain, and the composition within one rc of the crack. This distance is dependent upon the fracture toughness of the matrix along with the inducing stress. Furthermore, the phenomena within transformation toughening also parallel those within <b>microcrack</b> toughening. The grain-size effect of <b>microcrack</b> toughness is quite analogous to the particle-size effect prevalent within transformation toughening. This causes the stress required to initiate martensitic transformation to decrease with increasing tetragonal particle size due to  the fact that larger particles result in a lower constraint from the cubic matrix on the transformation. For particularly large particle sizes, the transformation can spontaneously occur while cooling, yet again similar to the spontaneous crack formation in <b>microcrack</b> toughness. However, toughness can also become too low if particle size is too small resulting in a decreased rc due to higher stresses since rc ~ stress−2 during cooling.  Therefore, transformational toughness contains an optimum particle size similar to the optimal grain size present for <b>microcrack</b> toughening.|$|E

To isolate the mechanical effects of induced <b>microcracking,</b> heat-cured specimens were subjected to varied prescribed damage induced by freeze-thaw or alkali–silica reaction prior to the onset of delayed ettringite formation. It was found that inducement of pre-formed <b>microcracks</b> led to an earlier onset of expansion due to delayed ettringite formation. Initially, <b>microcracks</b> enhanced ultimate expansion until a certain relatively high extent of <b>microcracking</b> was reached.

50|$|In 1956, the <b>microcrack</b> theory {{became the}} first to explain the {{toughening}} effect of a dispersed rubber phase in a polymer.

By incorporating alumina in YSZ TBC, oxidation and corrosion resistance can be improved, as well as hardness and bond strength without {{significant change in the}} elastic modulus or toughness. One challenge with alumina is applying the coating through plasma spraying, which tends to create a variety of unstable phases, such as γ-alumina.

50|$|This {{process has}} been {{demonstrated}} with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and Grubbs' catalyst (benzylidene-bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium). Both DCPD and Grubbs' catalyst are imbedded in an epoxy resin. The monomer on its own is relatively unreactive and polymerization does not take place. When a <b>microcrack</b> reaches both the capsule containing DCPD and the catalyst, the monomer is released from the core-shell microcapsule and comes in contact with exposed catalyst, upon which the monomer undergoes ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The metathesis reaction of the monomer involves the severance of the two double bonds in favor of new bonds. The presence of the catalyst allows for the energy barrier (energy of activation) to be lowered, and the polymerization reaction can proceed at room temperature. The resulting polymer allows the epoxy composite material to regain 67% of its former strength.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bone microdamage {{caused by}} routine {{activity}} {{plays an important}} role in triggering targeted and nontargeted bone remodeling. Targeted remodeling occurs near localized areas of microdamage[1 - 4]. We hypothesize that bone remodeling may be directly and positively influenced by inducing <b>microcracks</b> in hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. A study by Case et al. showed <b>microcracking</b> in HA discs having> 98 % theoretical density[5]. These <b>microcracks</b> occurred without the application of external stress, likely as a result of thermal expansion anisotropy (TEA). TEA generates <b>microcracks</b> only when the specimen grain size exceeds a critical value (GCR). Due to conflicting data in the literature on the thermal expansion along the crystallographic axes of HA, it is difficult to estimate GCR precisely for HA, but GCR likely ranges from a few tenths of microns to several microns[6]. As the grain size of a polycrystalline specimen increases above the critical grain size, the number of <b>microcracks</b> also increases but the number density of <b>microcracks</b> is difficult to control. Therefore, in this study we used Vickers microindentation to induce controlled <b>microcracks</b> in> 99 % dense HA discs.
