5|$|There were 31 {{compensatory}} selections {{distributed among}} 16 teams during rounds three through seven, with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills receiving 4 picks each. The University of Miami was the college with the <b>most</b> <b>players</b> {{selected in the}} first round, with Dan Morgan, Damione Lewis, Santana Moss and Reggie Wayne all picked at that stage.

5|$|Bruce Copeland, sportswriter for the Rock Island Argus, {{compiled}} the All-Pro {{list for}} 1920. He used the games played in Rock Island, other newspapers, {{and his own}} memory to determine the first-, second-, and third-team All-Pro list. Pro-Football-Reference.com uses this list as the official All-Pro list of 1920. Twenty of the players were from Illinois and thirteen were from Ohio. The Rock Island Independents had the <b>most</b> <b>players</b> on the list (9), and Racine Cardinals had the least (1).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But <b>most</b> <b>players</b> prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
5|$|Netball Australia {{also runs}} a {{modified}} game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds. The goal height and ball size {{are the same}} as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position. Netta was created to develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game. <b>Most</b> <b>players</b> under 11 play this version at netball clubs.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Juventus are {{the club}} that has contributed the <b>most</b> <b>players</b> to the Italy {{national}} team in history, {{being the only}} Italian club that has contributed players to every Italy national team since the 2nd FIFA World Cup. Juventus have contributed numerous players to Italy's World Cup campaigns, these successful periods principally have coincided with two golden ages of the Turin club's history, referred as Quinquennio d'Oro (The Golden Quinquennium), from 1931 until 1935, and Ciclo Leggendario (The Legendary Cycle), from 1972 to 1986.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller thought that the game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper thought that the campaign was too short for <b>most</b> <b>players.</b> Shoemaker thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Persona 4 was {{designed}} by Shigenori Soejima who aimed to create an ambiguous character who could appeal to <b>most</b> <b>players</b> by way of reflecting several feelings towards them and through his mannerisms. For the anime, director Seiji Kishi expressed difficulties in giving the character emotions without damaging what the original staff created. Nevertheless, Yu's characterization in the anime has been a subject of praise due to his portrayal as a mostly silent teenager whose few lines {{are related to the}} plot and in some cases, a source of comedy.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 NFL Draft, USC {{tied for}} the <b>most</b> <b>players</b> drafted from any {{university}} into the NFL that year with nine.

5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight {{earlier in the season}} with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, <b>most</b> <b>players</b> and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} two seasons of the 1970s, Nea Salamina {{finished}} {{in the middle of}} the table; the next two seasons threatened relegation, which was avoided. The club's low point was 14 August 1974, when the occupation of Famagusta by Turkish troops led to Nea Salamina becoming a refugee club. Fans and players scattered to unoccupied areas of Cyprus and abroad. In October, board members met at the offices of Aris Limassol, deciding to revive the club. Since <b>most</b> <b>players</b> were in Larnaca, it was decided to make Larnaca the club's temporary home. Its offices were housed temporarily at the offices of Alki Larnaca F.C. and in January 1975 acquired a rented building. Expenses were paid with contributions from members and friends of the club. Two youth academies were founded, in Larnaca and Limassol.|$|E
5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised {{the content and}} activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for <b>most</b> <b>players.</b> However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing new to the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.|$|E

5|$|Many Soviet {{citizens}} {{believed that}} the outcome may {{have been different if}} Anatoli Firsov and Vitaly Davydov had not sat out the series to protest a coaching change. In response, some offer that Canada was without Bobby Orr due to his knee injury as well as Bobby Hull (due to his departure from the NHL to the newly formed WHA league). These were arguably the best Canadian players at the time (along with Phil Esposito), so neither team had all of its greatest talent on the ice. The Soviet team also had the obvious advantage of playing year-round. Meanwhile, the Canadian team was picked and prepared in only a few months and <b>most</b> <b>players</b> were out-of-shape. At the time, NHL players did not regularly train during the summer months, using the period for a holiday or other activities.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Royals had {{the most}} picks of any team, with 74; {{following}} the Royals, the Toronto Blue Jays made 71, and the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets made 61 apiece. The total number of players drafted, 1,263, broke a record for the <b>most</b> <b>players</b> ever selected in a draft. The previous record of 1,162 was set during the 1967 draft. The California Angels drafted the fewest future MLB players, with only four of their draftees appearing in an MLB game, while the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers both drafted 13 future MLB players, {{the most of any}} team.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed <b>most</b> <b>players</b> would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
