5|$|For their season, the Bulldogs {{were ranked}} 8th {{in the final}} pre-NCAA tournament Coaches' Poll and 11th in the {{corresponding}} AP Poll.

5|$|In 2014, McLeod {{appeared}} in seven games, starting six. The year {{started off with}} a friendly against the United States on January 31, where McLeod conceded one goal. In March of the same year, she started in two matches during the Cyprus Cup. The last four matches {{of the year for}} McLeod were international friendlies, including another <b>match</b> <b>up</b> against the United States on May 8, which ended in a 1–1 draw. On November 24, 2014, McLeod made her 100th appearance for the senior team and recorded a shutout in a friendly match against Sweden at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Next, Tatanka {{defeated}} The Berzerker by pinfall. This {{match was}} originally scheduled {{as part of}} the pay-per-view. Due to time constraints it was cut from the PPV lineup in post-production. The match, however, later aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship <b>match.</b> <b>Up</b> next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 2013, Michigan (#1 AP/#2 Coaches) {{appeared}} on ESPN's College GameDay against Indiana (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) who hosted {{the game at}} Assembly Hall. Michigan lost 81–73, but the television broadcast of the game on ESPN set a Big Ten record for viewership with 4.035 million viewers. Morgan only played two minutes behind replacement starter Horford. Michigan then defeated Ohio State (#10 AP/#10 Coaches) in overtime in the rematch at home on February 5. Starting center Morgan only played 4 minutes. Coach Beilein noted that Morgan's absence affected the team's ability to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> defensively and substitute as it desired.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons lost Super Bowl XXXIII by a {{score of}} 34–19, which earned the Broncos their second {{consecutive}} Super Bowl victory. The game was anticipated as a <b>match</b> <b>up</b> between the Vikings and the Broncos, and the Falcons' presence in the game was noted as an anticlimax. The night before the game, safety Eugene Robinson was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Although Robinson played in the game, the distraction contributed to a poor performance by the Falcons team, who managed only six points in six drives deep into Denver territory and surrendered a season-high point total.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the details of the various scenes.|$|E

5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> well against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E
5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Virginia Tech {{received}} its first bid to a Bowl Coalition game. The Bowl Coalition, predecessor {{to the modern}} Bowl Championship Series, was intended to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the two best teams in the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta, and Rose Bowls, with the two highest-ranked teams playing in a National Championship Game. Following the 1995-1996 college football season, Virginia Tech was selected {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl {{as a result of this}} coalition. The No. 13 Hokies, who finished 9–2 during the regular season and were named Big East Conference champions, played against the No. 9 University of Texas, who finished 10–1–1 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions.|$|E
5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head <b>match</b> <b>up</b> against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E

5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1994-1995 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl was snubbed by the newly formed Bowl Alliance, a group of football conferences, bowl games, and television networks created to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the No. 1 and No. 2 college football teams at the conclusion of each season. Though the Gator Bowl offered to pay $115 million for the right to become a Bowl Alliance game, the Orange Bowl was selected in place of the Gator Bowl. This event had repercussions at the end of the season, when the bowl was passed over by high-ranked teams that elected to accept bids to bowls in the new Bowl Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Australian Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2009 Australian Open. It was contested between the world's top two players {{for much of}} the previous four years, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer then world number's 1 and 2 respectively. It was their seventh (out of nine) Grand Slam tournament final meeting and it was the same final <b>match</b> <b>up</b> as had been previously at both the 2008 Wimbledon Men's Singles final and 2008 French Men's Singles final, both of which Nadal won.

5|$|The team beat every {{opponent}} by {{at least}} 10 points and easily reached the NCAA tournament finals, where they met unbeaten Notre Dame, making it the first ever <b>match</b> <b>up</b> of two undefeated teams in the championship game. UConn defeated 79–58 Notre Dame (hindered {{by the loss of}} one of their stars, Natalie Achonwa, who had torn her ACL in the Elite Eight), to finish the season 40–0, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting the new record for Championship with nine. Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor.|$|E
5|$|They {{retained}} the League title the following year, winning the championship {{by a single}} point from Fleet Town following a 1–1 draw at Fleet {{on the last day}} of the season—this match was played in front of 623 people, a record attendance for a Wessex League <b>match</b> <b>up</b> to that date. The Lions gained another treble by also winning the League Cup and Russell Cotes Cup. The club won the North Hants Senior Cup again in 2002–03, and reached the semi-finals of both the Hampshire Senior Cup and the Russell Cotes Cup. Another Wessex League attendance record was set towards the end of the season when 702 people saw Andover's 6–1 win over Eastleigh.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly <b>match</b> <b>up),</b> and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
