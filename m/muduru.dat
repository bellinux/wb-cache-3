50|$|At the kaza level, the {{elections}} were held {{every two years}} by an electoral commission. This commission {{was made up of}} the kaza <b>müdürü,</b> the kadi, the mufti, the imam, kaza scribes, and religious leaders of non-Muslim residents. The commission was charged with compiling a list of suitable candidates, 30 years of age or older who paid a sum of 150 piastres in direct yearly taxes and who were preferably literate. This list was then submitted to the “Council of Elders,” where about one-third of the candidates would be voted out. The list then passed for review to the kaymakam of the sanjak, where another third of the candidates would be eliminated. The remaining one-third of candidates made up the list of possible members.|$|E
50|$|Between 1878 and 1918 {{the areas}} {{surrounding}} the island were controlled by Austria-Hungary {{to the north}} and Serbia to the south, but the island was under Ottoman sovereignty. The Ottoman Government continued to appoint and send a nahiye <b>müdürü</b> (administrative head of a unit smaller than a district and bigger than a village) and a kadı (judge) regularly. The island's inhabitants (officially citizens of the Ottoman Empire) enjoyed exemption from taxes and customs and were not subject to conscription. The islanders also had the right to vote during the Ottoman general elections of 1908. On May 12, 1913, taking advantage of the Balkan Wars, the island was occupied by the forces of Austria-Hungary. It thus became known as Újorsova in the Krassó-Szörény County. This {{was one of the last}} unilateral territorial expansions of Austria-Hungary before the outbreak of the First World War; the seizure was never officially recognized by the Ottoman government.|$|E

Yani öğretmenler birer muvaffakiyetsizleştirici olarak yetiştiriliyorlar. Fakat öğretmenlerden biri muvaffakiyetsizleştirici olmayı, yani muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştirilmeyi reddediyor, bu konuda ileri geri konuşuyor. Bütün öğretmenleri kolayca muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriverebileceğini sanan okul <b>müdürü</b> bu duruma sinirleniyor, ve söz konusu öğretmeni makamına çağırıp ona diyor ki: [...] "Muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine laflar ediyormuşsunuz ha?"We {{are in a}} {{teachers}} {{training school}} that has evil purposes.

50|$|Oktay Engin {{continued}} his studies at Istanbul University's Faculty of Law. His school in Thessaloniki refused {{to share his}} transcript, but with only a certificate showing he had completed the first year, the university senate allowed Engin to continue from the second. After graduation, he started an internship in Cyprus. However, he was summoned by Orhan Öztırak, the minister of internal affairs, to monitor Greek radio stations. Next he placed first in a government exam {{that led to his}} to becoming the governor (kaymakam) of the most important district, Çankaya. One year later, the chief of the police force, Hayrettin Nakipoğlu, invited him to be the chair of the Political Affairs Branch (Siyasi İşler Şube <b>Müdürü).</b> Under normal conditions, reaching such a position would require 15-20 years of work, starting from his position as a district governor. He remained in the police force thereafter, working his way up to the chief of the security department, and the deputy chief of the entire police force. Finally, in 1991 he was promoted to the governorship of Nevşehir Province. Engin rejects all allegations of culpability —indeed, of even being a spy or an acquaintance of General Yirmibeşoğlu.|$|E
