50|$|The inaugural 2010 {{challenge}} took participants along a <b>mandatory</b> <b>route</b> on {{back roads}} across the United States and Canada. The route scrossed numerous mountain ranges, 33 Indian reservations, 25 national forests, eight deserts and six national parks. Challenge routes travel secondary roads with directions revealed at {{a series of}} specific checkpoints. The event guidelines prohibit speeding and require contenders to sleep outside throughout the entire course.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{employs a}} phenomenographic methodology {{to explore the}} variation in the views {{of a group of}} lecturers to the plagiarism detection system, Turnitin. The system was being considered as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>route</b> for all written assignments {{at the time of the}} research and the purpose of the enquiry was to uncover some of the ways in which Turnitin was viewed, experienced and had meaning to those expected to use it. Semi-structured interviews were use to gather data, and the results of the analysis highlighted the focus of these lecturers as being largely student centered. The lecturers largely appeared to be advocates of the system; they did recognise that Widening Participation and internationalisation had altered the student demographic, and that some issues may arise with a new cohort perhaps less familiar with academic integrity. In addition there was some concern over the way that management viewed the system, and the dangers of it being used for quantitative monitoring rather than qualitative feedback. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the most}} revolutionary {{securities}} law development since the New Deal, the SEC {{is poised to}} jettison rules requiring companies to apply recognized US accounting standards by inviting use of {{a new set of}} international ones created by a private London-based organization. This radical shift follows decades of gradual movement towards international standards that has gained momentum since 2005 when all listed companies in the European Union were required to use them. For the US, the SEC could give companies the option to use either or establish a medium-term plan to move US companies to international standards within a decade. Analysis of the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s vision for this quest reveals that it contains contradictions, paradoxes and ironies that suggest quixotic thinking. A contradiction: the SEC touts its vision as promoting comparability, yet proposes injecting choice and competition into accounting standards that would reduce it. A paradox: the SEC celebrates a single set of global standards while advocating changes that would create a double set within the US and overlooks factors that justify skepticism {{about the possibility of a}} single set of written standards translating into uniform application. An irony: the SEC acknowledges that pursuing global standards is very complex while its Chairman says the SEC has declared a war on complexity in accounting. A more realistic vision of the quest appreciates that, under either an optional or <b>mandatory</b> <b>route,</b> the shift amounts to a leap of faith posing both large costs for the US and potentially large gains for it and the world. This realistic appraisal lowers expectations about actual comparability; highlights serious risks that competing standards would impair comparability; recognizes needs the SEC has scantly examined to render elaborate infrastructural changes; and, above all, faces the realization that the abrupt shift is less about the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s historical mandate to protect investors than about a newly undertaken mission to expand global capitalism...|$|E
25|$|Until 2005, many {{motorways}} and dual carriageways in Ireland did {{not have}} crash barriers in the central reservation, the policy being to use a wider median instead. Crash barriers are now <b>mandatory</b> for such <b>routes,</b> and wire cabling or full crash barriers (depending {{on whether or not}} the route is a motorway, and median width) have been fitted to existing routes.|$|R
50|$|For events {{governed by}} IAAF rules, it is <b>mandatory</b> that the <b>route</b> be marked {{so that all}} {{competitors}} can see the distance covered in kilometres. The rules make {{no mention of the}} use of miles. The IAAF will only recognise world records that are established at events that are run under IAAF rules. For major events, it is customary to publish competitors' timings at the midway mark and also at 5 km splits; marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognised by the IAAF (such as 20 km, 30 km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon, and completes the marathon course.|$|R
40|$|The Report of Lord Donaldson's Inquiry {{into the}} Prevention of Pollution from Merchant Shipping, of May 1994, {{discussed}} here, is a document {{of the first}} rank of importance for all those interested in shipping safety and the prevention of ship-source pollution. The UK Government is called upon to take a lead internationally, regionally and nationally in these interrelated fields, and its first published response, issued in February 1995, {{and many of its}} initiatives, examined here, suggest that it has, for once, heeded the cries of a major inquiry. In doing so, however, as is explained, it must constantly take into account major developments in the European Community. While finally, many new ideas and approaches are embraced or are being further considered by the Government, it is argued here that the whole process, by keeping strictly within the bounds of existing international law and by emphasising voluntarism (indeed, restricting strict enforcement actions to mere measures of last resort), it is somewhat behind international trends, manifested in the acceptance of the principle of <b>mandatory</b> ships' <b>routeing</b> and ship reporting systems and in the current debate on development of the Particularly Sensitive Sea Area concept. ...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{electrical}} vehicles {{suited for}} daily use will have limited traction battery capacity. Thus reliable range estimation is a <b>mandatory</b> feature for <b>route</b> planning. Energy consumption and CO 2 -emission based on the actual standard test cycles (NEFZ, CADC) is much too optimistic, especially for rural operation in mountainous regions. In this contribution we present a Simulink-based electric vehicle model that considers all relevant route characteristics (altitude, speed limit, pavement and weather conditions). The model is applied and validated by different electric compact cars and roadsters with real mountainous test cycles. Based on intensive parameter studies with this model, a simplified analytical model for range estimation, CO 2 -emissions and costs (including an optional fuel based range extender) is derived. A case study shows the possible benefit of a low-power range extender for compact electric vehicles. E_car_mod. mdl...|$|R
40|$|The pig {{represents}} a preferred {{model for the}} analysis of intestinal immunology. However, the barrier of the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) covering porcine Peyer's patches (PP) has not yet been characterized in detail. This study aimed to perform this characterization in order to pave the way toward an understanding of the functional contribution of epithelial barrier properties in gut immunology. Porcine tissue specimens were taken from the distal small intestine in order to obtain electrophysiological data of PP FAE and neighboring villous epithelium (VE), employing the Ussing chamber technique. Transepithelial resistance (TER) and paracellular fluorescein flux were measured, and tissues were morphometrically compared. In selfsame tissues, expression and localization of major tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin- 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, - 5, and - 8) were analyzed. PP FAE specimens showed a higher TER and a lower apparent permeability for sodium fluorescein than VE. Immunoblotting revealed an expression of all claudins within both epithelia, with markedly stronger expression of the sealing TJ protein claudin- 4 in PP FAE compared with the neighboring VE. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression and localization of all claudins in both PP FAE and VE, with stronger claudin- 4 abundance in PP FAE. The results are in accordance with the physiological function of the FAE, which strongly regulates and limits antigen uptake determining a <b>mandatory</b> transcellular <b>route</b> for antigen presentation, highlighting the importance of this structure for the first steps of the intestinal immune response. Thus, this study provides detailed insights into the specific barrier properties of the porcine FAE covering intestinal PP, at the interface of intestinal immunology and barriology...|$|R
