In addition, this paper presents a remote control supervisory system designed to improve the entire transmitter-facilities processes which includes applications for sensing, managing, controlling and <b>measuring</b> <b>transmitter</b> site parameters and performance from a networked computer or a dial up computer. The need for detailed monitoring {{of the performance of}} transmitter site equipment including monitoring of electrical systems as well as monitoring of communication systems is becoming critical as these sites are becoming larger and more sophisticated.

The proposed systems have been installed and continuously operated on live FM transmitter facilities at six locations in Malaysia. The proposed hybrid power system can be also integrated into the current electric power network of Malaysia as a backup or as a main source of power for the entire transmitter facility. The supervision and control signals of the proposed power hybrid system can be easily included and integrated with the other existed FM transmitter supervisory and control signals.

We <b>measured</b> <b>transmitter</b> molecules released from vesicles in NGF-differentiated PC 12 cells using carbon-fiber amperometry, and relative diameters of individual vesicles using electron microscopy. Both amperometry and electron micrograph data were analyzed by statistical and machine learning methods for Gaussian mixture models. An electron microscopy size correction algorithm was used to predict and correct for observation bias of vesicle size due to tangential slices through some vesicles. Expectation maximization algorithms were used to perform maximum likelihood estimation for the Gaussian parameters of different populations of vesicles, and were shown {{to be better than}} histogram and cumulative distribution function methods for analyzing mixed populations. The Bayesian information criterion was used to determine the most likely number of vesicle subpools observed in the amperometric and electron microscopy data. From this analysis, we show that there are three major subpools, not two, of vesicles stored and released from PC 12 cells. The three subpools of vesicles include small clear vesicles and two subpools of dense core vesicles, a small and a large dense core vesicle subpool. Using PC 12 cells stably transfected with short-hairpin RNA targeted to synaptotagmin I, an exocytotic Ca 2 + sensor, we show that the presence and release of the small dense core vesicle subpool is dependent on synaptotagmin I.

40|$|Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) {{facilitates}} {{the formation of}} long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus but whether this involves release from pre- vs. post- synaptic pools is unclear. We therefore tested if BDNF is essential for LTP in dorsal striatum, a structure in which the neurotrophin is present only in afferent terminals. Whole cell recordings were collected from medium spiny neurons in striatal slices prepared from adult mice. High frequency stimulation (HFS) of neocortical afferents produced a rapid and stable NMDA receptor-dependent potentiation. The ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptor-mediated components of the EPSPs was substantially increased after inducing potentiation, suggesting that potentiation involved post-synaptic changes.

Infusion of the BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc blocked the formation of potentiation, beginning with the second minute post-HFS, without reducing responses to HFS.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of ageing on urothelial-afferent signalling in the mouse bladder. Three-month-old control and 24 -month-old aged male mice were used. In vivo natural voiding behaviour, sensory nerve activity, urothelial cell function, muscle contractility, transmitter release and gene and protein expression were measured to identify how all three components of the bladder (neural, contractile and urothelial) are affected by ageing.

The {{incidence of}} polyneuronal innervation estimated with curare in normal muscles during the winter (19 %) was significantly higher than the incidence in summer (9 %). After formamide treatment, large end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) and miniature e. p. p. s (m. e. p. p. s) could be recorded in Ringer solution containing physiological levels of Ca 2 +. For both normal and reinnervated muscles, higher levels of polyneuronal innervation could be recorded in normal Ringer solution after formamide treatment compared with levels measured {{in the presence of}} curare.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of digital {{predistortion}} suitable for wideband high crest factor applications such as those encountered in DAB, DVB-T and WCDMA transmitters. The proposed method is advantageous for four main reasons. Firstly, it utilizes a reliable frequency domain <b>measure</b> of <b>transmitter</b> output nonlinearity, specifically the Weighted Adjacent Channel Power (WACP), as the objective for predistortion filter parameter estimation. This is in direct contrast to traditional approaches which utilize a time domain measure obtained via a full feedback path and potentially corrupted by gain and phase compensation error as well as ADC distortion. Secondly, the method models predistortion filter parameter estimation as a generic nonlinear mathematical optimization problem. This model assumes a non-convex objective function and therefore utilizes both global and local optimization algorithms to achieve true global convergence. This is once again in direct contrast to traditional approaches which model predistortion filter parameter estimation as a linear regression problem. Such a model incorrectly assumes a convex error surface and therefore restricts itself to inadequate local optimization algorithms which unfortunately cannot guarantee true global convergence. Thirdly, the method's predistortion filter is a pruned Volterra Series with memory which utilizes a hybrid pruning strategy {{in order to keep}} high order kernels to a practically manageable size, suitable for optimization parameter estimation. Predistortion filter memory ultimately makes the method highly suited to wideband applications. Finally, predistortion filter parameter estimation does not require known test signals to be injected into the transmitter and therefore the technique is on-air adaptive. This means any transmitter using this method of digital predistortion will be both on-air and optimally linearized for its entire operational life. Preliminary results obtained from actual hardware are presented...|$|R

Contractions of the mouse vas deferens were evoked by electrical stimulation at 1 – 50 [*]Hz. The contractions were entirely nerve-mediated, since they were abolished by tetrodotoxin, and were used as an indirect <b>measure</b> of <b>transmitter</b> release.

Contractions evoked by stimulation frequencies less than 10 [*]Hz were abolished, and those evoked by 20 and by 50 [*]Hz stimulation were decreased in amplitude by 51. 3 ± 13. 9 % and 9. 3 ± 2. 6 %, respectively. The N-, P- and Q-type channel blocker, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, inhibited contractions in a concentration-dependent manner and caused greater maximum inhibition than ω-conotoxin GVIA, suggesting an action on P- and/or Q-type channels, in addition to N-type. The P-type channel blocker, ω-agatoxin IVA, alone did not have a significant effect at concentrations up to 300 [*]nM, but inhibited contractions in the presence of ω-conotoxin GVIA. Subsequent addition of ω-conotoxin MVIIC abolished the remaining contractions. Identical results were obtained when the three toxins were tested cumulatively on the purinergic and noradrenergic components of the contraction in the presence of 0. 3 [*]μM prazosin and following desensitization to 10 [*]μM α,β-methylene adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (α,β-MeATP), respectively. The results suggest that N-, P- and Q-type channels are involved in the release of noradrenaline and ATP from sympathetic neurones in the mouse vas deferens...|$|R
