500|$|A {{turning point}} came on 2 November. Air {{pollution}} in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By {{the end of}} the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, [...] "I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!" [...] The barman, and the owner of the pub who served him, later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the steroid ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate,</b> which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.|$|E

50|$|Ketobemidone (trade names Cliradon, Ketogan, Ketodur, Cymidon, Ketorax, and others) is a {{powerful}} opioid analgesic. Its effectiveness against pain {{is in the same}} range as morphine, and it also has some NMDA-antagonist properties imparted by its metabolite norketobemidone. This makes it useful for some types of pain that don't respond well to other opioids. The most commonly cited equalisation ratio for analgesic doses is 25 mg of oral ketobemidone hydrobromide to 60 mg of <b>morphine</b> hydrochloride or <b>sulphate</b> and about 8 mg of ketobemidone by injection and 10 mg of morphine.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Post-operative {{analgesic}} {{consumption is}} often used as a surrogate measure for pain; analyses of mean data assume a Gaussian distribution and use parametric statistics to assess statistical differences, often in small samples. We used a large individual patient dataset to examine the distribution of analgesic consumption, the validity of such analyses and alternative dichotomous outcomes. METHODS: Analysis of individual patient data from 913 patients over 48 post-operative hours in five randomised trials. Patients had either epidural injection of placebo or <b>morphine</b> (as <b>sulphate</b> and extended release epidural morphine) and use of patient-controlled analgesia. Post-operative fentanyl consumption was calculated over 0 - 24, 24 - 48 and 0 - 48 h. RESULTS: The distribution of analgesic consumption for all patients over the periods 0 - 24, 24 - 48 and 0 - 48 h was exponential. Most patients used less than 750 μg fentanyl over 48 h; 34 % used over 1000 μg fentanyl (100 mg morphine), 13 % over 2000 μg and 5 % over 3000 μg. Mean, median and mode were very different; 20 % of patients consumed almost 60 % of post-operative analgesic, and standard deviations were generally larger than means. A useful dichotomous outcome was less than 750 μg fentanyl consumed over 48 h, a level associated with very good or excellent patient pain rating. Use of very good or excellent patient pain rating differentiated between different doses of epidural morphine. CONCLUSION: Because of a highly skewed distribution, post-operative analgesic consumption is an uncertain method of measuring analgesic efficacy of an intervention designed to limit pain during and after surgery...|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is <b>morphine</b> pectinate, nitrate, <b>sulphate,</b> and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|R

50|$|The {{extraction}} of opium takes {{place during the}} months of February and March. Farmers still use the traditional method where they lance each poppy capsule manually with a special blade like tool, {{a process known as}} lancing. The lancing is done in late afternoon or evenings. The opium latex which oozes out and congeals in the night is scraped and collected manually the next morning. Each poppy capsule is given three to four lancings. All such opium collected is required to be necessarily tendered to the government, at specially set up opium collection centres, in early April. Opium is checked for quality and consistency and weighed at the centres. Prices are paid which are fixed by the Government in slab rates, depending on {{the quality and quantity of}} opium tendered. 90% of payment is made to the cultivators, directly in their bank account through e-payment method. Final payment is made after laboratory testing at opium factory after confirming that no adulterants have been found.

40|$|A thermal {{threshold}} measurer (TTM) apparatus {{was developed and}} tested in 12 dry, nonpregnant, culled cows {{with the purpose of}} measuring the thermal nociceptive threshold and of finding the response to <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> dosages. The cows received a cumulative dose (from 0. 00 to 0. 40 mg/kg BW) of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> through a catheter in the jugular vein. The interval between doses was 20 min, and a nociceptive test was performed 15 min after each injection. The TTM device consisted of a 60 W halogen bulb mounted in a 15 cm PVC tube, with a 0. 6 s response time probe attached to its end, connected to a thermocouple. The probe measured the response temperature on the skin over the middle phalanges on the dorsum of the forefoot. The radiating heat stimulus from the bulb was instantaneously terminated with the foot-lift response of the tested animal. The nociceptive response to the 0. 00 mg/kg dose was considered the baseline and subsequent measurements were expressed in difference from it. Data were evaluated in a regression analysis using the GLM procedure. A significant elevation (P < 0. 0001) in the nociceptive threshold of the cows with cumulative dosing of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> was noticed.

40|$|Introduction: The {{presence}} of opioid receptors in pathologically changed skin justifies undertaking trials of pain treatment with morphine preparations designed for topical application. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate the effect of selected substances neutralizing carboxyl groups of polyacrylic acid (sodium and potassium hydroxide, trietanoloamine, borax) on physicochemical parameters of the produced hydrogels with Carbopol 980 and Carbopol Ultrez 10 and on pharmaceutical availability of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Material and methods: There were prepared variant hydrogels with <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> on the base of Carbopol 980 and Carbopol Ultrez 10. Extensometric method was used to test spreadability of the preparations, gravimetric method to determine the rate of volatile components loss, while viscosity parameters were determined with cone-plate digital rheometer. Potentiometric method was applied to measure pH of the produced hydrogels. The test for <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> pharmaceutical availability was performed with spectrophotometric method. Results: No basic differences were observed in the spreadability, the kinetics of water loss or in the measured pH values of model hydrogels produced with different cross-linking bases. Higher pharmaceutical availability of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> was demonstrated from hydrogels with Carbopol Ultrez 10 having lower viscosity. The lowest pharmaceutical availability was obtained independently of the applied Carbopol for hydrogels in the prescription of which trietanoloamine was used.

Caesarean sections were performed at the end of the gestation period; foetuses (n= 27 - 63) and their placentas were examined externally; the number of foetuses and their resorption sites were also recorded. Results showed that 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 mg/ml of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> causes significant increase in the percentage of teratogenicity (except in week 3) (p< 0. 05). Although 0. 1 mg/ml of morphine did not have any effect on the diameter and weight of the placenta and the number of foetuses, 0. 2 and 0. 3 mg/ml of morphine caused a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in the weight and diameter of placentas, the number of the embryos, their body weight and crown-rump length of fetuses. The foetal weight of all four groups decreased significantly (p< 0. 05).

Ketamine on its own cannot be advocated, but combined with morphine it allows a single infusion rate {{to be used for}} all patients, decreasing the need for nursing and medical involvement...|$|E
40|$|Postoperative pain {{may be a}} {{significant}} reason for delayed discharge from hospital, increased morbidity and reduced patient satisfaction with ambulatory hernia surgery. This study compared two postoperative oral analgesic protocols after day case inguinal hernia repair; 30 mg <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (MST) and 10 mg metoclopramide every 8 h for 48 h or 75 mg diclofenac twice daily for 48 h. The pain reported in the MST group was significantly greater on both the day of operation and the first postoperative day (P < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). A significantly higher proportion of patients taking MST complained of nausea {{on the day of}} operation and on the 1 st postoperative day (P < 0. 05, chi 2). The time taken to walk, dress and leave home alone were achieved in {{a significant}}ly shorter duration in patients taking diclofenac. We conclude that diclofenac provides effective analgesia, has a more acceptable side-effect profile than <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> and is the treatment of choice after ambulatory hernia surgery...|$|E
40|$|Persistent severe {{cancer pain}} {{should be treated}} with opioid drugs, principally morphine. It can be {{administered}} orally, rectally and parenterally. Morphine is metabolised in the liver mainly to glucuronides, of which morphine- 6 -glucuronide is a powerful analgesic. Oral morphine should be administered regularly and in individualized doses. The use of morphine is frequently accompanied by adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting and sedation. Management of these is critical for successful pain treatment. Although alternatives are available none has any clear advantage over morphine in cancer pain, and should be reserved for special situations. Oral morphine is successful in more than 90 % of cancer pain patients. Slow release <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> tablets (MS Contin) are often the best choice. For the few patients who need parenteral medication, continuous subcutaneous <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> infusion is generally the most suitable. Some pains are morphine resistant, especially those due to nerve injury. In these cases pain is best treated with tricyclic antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{doses of}} {{morphine}} administered subcutaneously to man and animals {{have been found}} to produce no significant cardiovascular changes except bradycardia (8, 10). Conificting reports regarding the circulatory adjustments in response to intravenous thiobarbiturates such as pentothal sodium in normal animals and man appear in the literature (4, 6, 7). However, it is generally agreed that pentothal sodium reduces the blood pressure in arterial hypertension. The investigation herein reported was undertaken to secure further experimental data on the hemodynamic effects of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> and pentothal sodium given intravenously to normal man. METHODS. Volunteer normal convalescent patients from the Third (N. Y. U.) Medical Division of Bellevue Hospital were studied at least two hours post prandial after 30 to 60 minutes of bed rest. <b>Morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (0. 01 gm. in 5 cc. normal saline) was injected rapidly into the cubital vein following control observations in six subjects. Pentothal sodium (5 per cent aqueous solution) was given intravenously on three occasions to tin...|$|E
40|$|The antinociceptive {{actions of}} {{morphine}} incorporated into an injectable chitosan-based gel were investigated in rats. Subcutaneous administration of 4. 8 mg/kg <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> in a gel composed of N,O-carboxymethylchitosan (NOCC) and chitosan resulted in significant antinociception within 10 min that was maximal at 60 min and persisted for 6 h. In contrast, the same dose of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> injected in sterile saline produced maximal responses at 30 min but only persisted for 2 h. NOCC/chitosan gel was easily injectable using a 22 guage needle and appears stable in long-term storage. No local or systemic adverse effects other than morphine-induced sedation were observed {{either at the}} time of injection or during the subsequent 48 h. We conclude that gels composed of chitosan and chitosan derivatives are effective matrices for sustained-release formulations of opioid analgesics capable of providing long-lasting antinociception.

40|$|Sustained-release oral <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (MST) 20 mg was {{administered}} to 11 healthy volunteers. Mean peak plasma morphine concentration was 14. 8 ng ml, and occurred at a mean time of 142. 5 min after ingestion. Analgesia flttr^n^d by an ischaemic forearm pain test increased to a maximum 40 min after the calculated peak plasma concentration of morphine had been achieved, and remained greater than control values as plasma morphine concentration decayed. However, {{there was not a}} «ignjfimnr correlation between analgesia and plasma morphine concentration. This may result from delay in brain penetration by morphine. The mean systemic availability of morphine in the first 7 h after administration of MST was 18. 3 %. Sustained-release oral <b>morphine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (MST Continus: Napp Laboratories), has become popular as an analgesic for the relief of chronic pain. It has also been found to be effective in relieving acute pain after cholecystectomy or hysterectomy (Fell, Chmielewski and Smith, 1982). Only two limited studies have been published o...|$|E
