40|$|Breast cancer (BC) is {{the most}} common female cancer type and the leading cause of female cancer {{mortality}} in Russia and in majority countries of the world. Along with {{the most common type of}} BC – ductal carcinoma, there are a lot of histological types, distinguished by structure features, which lead to a variable clinical and instrumental semiotics. Thes e histological types of BC in the group marked out special types of BC, including medullary carcinoma. The concept of <b>medullary</b> <b>cancer</b> includes typical medullary BC, atypical medullary BC and invasive ductal BC with evidence of medullary morphology. Base d on the current literature data, the authors discuss the main epidemiological, clinical and morphological diagnostic features of medullary BC. The authors pay special influence pathological picture, forming the characteristic diagnostic features of <b>medullary</b> <b>cancer</b> detected using X-ray mammography and ultrasound of the breast – the basic techniques of BC and other breast diseases detection. I n 2003 – 2013 diagnosed 19 medullary BC cases in women aged 18 – 56 years, with 18 of them were recorded in patients aged 34 – 56 years. The authors describe in detail the features of clinical, mammographic and ultrasound semiotics of medullary BC. Article is focused on the main X-ray and ultrasound characteristics, such as mass shape and margin features, as well as its internal structure, and also the results of power Doppler. One of the main features of this article is description of ultrasound elastography pattern of medullary BC, which could be find in only a small number of scientific articles. T ypica l medullary BC, atypical <b>medullary</b> <b>cancer</b> and ductal carcinoma with medullary signs have different prognosis. This problem leads to necessity find reliable distinguishing features in mammograpic and ultrasound semiotics. It is seems important to reveal sites with indistinct margin. We have found the indistinct margin detection is not statistically significant for the differential diagnosis of typical forms of medullary BC from atypical forms and invasive ductal BC with evidence of medullary structure. Th e authors conclude that the mammographic and ultrasound semiotics of medullary BC makes accurate differential diagnosis with benign breast pathology by X-ray mammography as well as breast ultrasound impossible. There are no statistically significant differences in the results of the mammography and breast ultrasound in different histological types of medullary BC. So these diagnostic features are not reliable for the differential diagnosis. However, the application of a comprehensive usage of mammography and breast ultrasound using modern technology of ultrasound diagnosis allows to suspect BC. </p...|$|E

The authors review relevant medical literature published {{on the influence of}} these new techniques in the treatment of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> Searches were last updated in October 2007. RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have been demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> The number and type of recognized RET genetic mutations have grown over the last years, especially after the introduction of genetic screening in the work-up of all patients with <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene is highly effective. Cervical endoscopic procedures have been recently described and applied for positive RET carriers: a video-assisted thyroidectomy with central compartment dissection (level 6) has proved feasible, safe and effective for these patients.

40|$|Familial thyroid cancer {{can arise}} from {{follicular}} cells (familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer, FNMTC) or from parafollicular cells (multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, MEN 2).

40|$|Thyroid nodule {{prevalence}} {{is about}} 1. 8 % in healthy children; however, malignancy frequency {{is higher than}} in adults. Approximately 26. 4 % of thyroid nodules generate thyroid cancer in childhood. Coexisting thyroid disease, history of irradiation of the neck, post-pubertal age, female sex, and thyroid malignancy in the family are risk factors for developing nodules. After evaluation of the medical history and detailed physical examination, the second step is assessment of thyroid function and measurement of calcitonin level. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value in the upper range seems to be correlated with cancer. Calcitonin levels must be evaluated, especially if <b>medullary</b> <b>cancer</b> is suspected. Ultrasonography (USG) is the first-line imaging tool in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. It gives information about the nodule size, echogenicity and location.

Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient of African descent presenting with a right sided abdominal mass and hematuria may assist in an early diagnosis.

30|$|The thyroid cancer {{recurrence}} rate {{is reported}} to range from 7  % to 14  % [31, 32]. Recurrence is usually detected within the first decade after initial disease diagnosis.

Patients with DTC are usually treated with total thyroidectomy and RAI ablation. Patients should have baseline neck US evaluation at 6 – 12 months after the RAI ablation and then periodically, depending on the patient’s risk for recurrent disease and thyroglobulin (Tg) status. After the first post-operative RAI ablation, further RAI imaging is not necessary if the patient has normal neck US, undetectable Tg level under TSH stimulation, and negative antithyroglobulin (TgAb). Annual neck US with or without FNA, along with measurement of serum Tg and serum TgAb, is usually sufficient for post-treatment surveillance in those patients. Moreover, annual US is appropriate in patients with <b>medullary</b> <b>cancer</b> and normal calcitonin levels [2, 16, 33].|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONAmyloid goiter (AG) is {{characterized}} by enlargement of the thyroid gland {{as a result of}} extensive amyloid deposition in a bilateral and diffuse manner. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 58 -year-old male patient was diagnosed of Crohn's Disease (CD). He was admitted to our clinic with complaint of respiratory distress and rapid growth swelling in the neck. Ultrasound examination revealed huge multinodular goiter on both sides of thyroid gland. We performed bilateral total thyroidectomy. Pathological evaluation revealed AG. DISCUSSIONAmyloid leads to degeneration in tissues, thereby disrupts the function of the relevant organs. It is important to distinguish AG from other reasons of goiter, particularly thyroid <b>medullary</b> <b>cancer</b> that can cause amyloid deposition in thyroid gland. Secondary amyloidosis frequently involves thyroid gland at microscopic level, but rarely causes goiter. An analysis of current literature revealed that only few cases of AG occurred secondary to CD. Herein we presented a case of AG who has rapidly growing goiter that associated with CD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin {{has been}} well {{established}} as an important marker of sepsis and systemic infection. The authors evaluated the diagnostic and predictive value of calcitonin and its prohormone procalcitonin in <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> METHODS: The authors systematically explored the ability of calcitonin and procalcitonin to identify <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> and predict the endpoints local recurrence and distant metastases, {{as well as the}} progression-free survival. Patients with C-cell hyperplasia; patients after thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, goiter, or Graves disease; and healthy subjects served as controls. The study was performed in accordance with the Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies of the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: Sixty-nine <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> patients and 96 controls were included (median observed interval: 10. 9 years [range, 1. 4 - 47. 5 years]; 981. 8 patient-years). The 1 -year, 5 -year, 10 -year, and 20 -year recurrence rates were 9 %, 34 %, 45 %, and 56 %, respectively. Calcitonin had a higher diagnostic accuracy for detecting <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> than procalcitonin (area under the curve [AUC], 0. 94; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 0. 90 - 0. 99 vs AUC, 0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 83 - 0. 95 [P =. 038]). The procalcitonin:calcitonin ratio predicted disease progression (AUC, 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 51 - 0. 75 [P =. 036]) and progression-free survival (hazards ratio, 1. 49; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 2. 04 [P =. 013]).
