500|$|Darwin became {{engrossed in}} meticulous {{microscopic}} examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar {{so that the}} insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, [...] "I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess." [...] In September, he [...] "dissected with the greatest interest" [...] and wrote, [...] "The contrivances for insect fertilisation in Orchids are multiform & truly wonderful & beautiful." [...] By October, he had [...] "a large mass of notes with many new facts", but set them aside [...] "convinced that I ought to work on Variation & not amuse <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> interludes".|$|E

I need to feed <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] Terry was optimistic about the club's prospects for the future, saying, [...] "It is the start of something... we've got a great squad, with some great young players, and hungry and experienced players too. It's a great mix." [...] Although praising the atmosphere at Wembley, Terry ruled out returning to the England team, for whom he had not played since 2012. Despite losing, Pochettino expressed pride in his team's performance.|$|E

I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power.

500|$|Once back in Saint Petersburg in May 1865, Rimsky-Korsakov's onshore duties {{consisted}} {{of a couple of}} hours of clerical duty each day, but he recalled that his desire to compose [...] "had been stifled... I did not concern <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> music at all." [...] He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him [...] "to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it". At Balakirev's suggestion, he wrote a trio to the scherzo of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev's direction in Saint Petersburg. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer Anatoly Lyadov).|$|E

500|$|The 2008 {{launch of}} {{clothing}} line [...] "FAKE" [...] (Fleury's Artistic Kustom Enterprises) {{led him to}} approach the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League {{in the hope of}} convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys. The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt. He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a single in a pinch-hit appearance against the Yuma Scorpions. He started the second game at left field and struck out twice before he was replaced. [...] "I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> the things I've done, the things I've accomplished. This was just another one of those days," [...] Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers.|$|E
500|$|Etty {{landed in}} Dieppe, {{and made his}} way to Paris via Rouen. Although he {{admitted}} to finding France a beautiful country, he was unhappy throughout his stay there, suffering from severe homesickness; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that [...] "I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris, or I think I shall not feel resolution to stop a year. If I don't, I shall content <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> seeing what I think worth while; and then return." [...] He travelled onwards via Geneva, but found Switzerland frustrating; although he had brought his own tea-making equipment with him, in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea. Travelling through the Simplon Pass to Piedmont revived his spirits somewhat; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating, and in late September arrived in Florence.|$|E
500|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen played as an {{offensive}} guard under Ward, {{and was one}} of the players who remained on the team when 40 of his teammates walked off in protest. Long after the events, Friedgen said [...] "he was a tough coach...If he had addressed some of the players' concerns, I don't know that so many would have left...One of the things I learned from him was to surround <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> good assistants, and I don't know if he necessarily did that." [...] Kehoe, who had been one of Ward's track coaches in college, said, [...] "I think Bob's problem was that he expected his players to play and hustle the same way he had, and times had changed." [...] After Maryland, Ward took a job as an assistant coach with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League in 1969, and later coached for the Montreal Alouettes, from 1970 to 1971, and the Toronto Argonauts from 1975 to 1976. He remained in Canada for the remainder of his coaching career.|$|E

500|$|Following Olivier's {{success in}} Shakespearean stage productions, {{he made his}} first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as Orlando in As You Like It, {{directed}} by Paul Czinner, [...] "a charming if lightweight production", according to Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute's (BFI's) Screenonline. The following year Olivier appeared alongside Vivien Leigh in the historical drama Fire Over England. He had first met Leigh briefly at the Savoy Grill and then again when she visited him during the run of Romeo and Juliet, probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that [...] "I couldn't help <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something different. This wasn't just out of lust. This was love that I really didn't ask for but was drawn into." [...] While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress Ann Todd, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor Henry Ainley, according to the biographer Michael Munn.|$|E
500|$|George {{preferred}} {{to stay at}} home pursuing his hobbies of stamp collecting and game shooting, and lived a life that later biographers would consider dull because of its conventionality. He was not an intellectual: on returning from one evening at the opera he wrote, [...] "Went to Covent Garden and saw Fidelio and damned dull it was." [...] Nonetheless, he was earnestly devoted to Britain and its Commonwealth. He explained, [...] "it has always been my dream to identify <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> the great idea of Empire." [...] He appeared hard-working and became widely admired by the people of Britain and the Empire, as well as [...] "the Establishment". In the words of historian David Cannadine, George V and Queen Mary were an [...] "inseparably devoted couple" [...] who upheld [...] "character" [...] and [...] "family values". George established a standard of conduct for British royalty that reflected the values and virtues of the upper middle-class rather than upper-class lifestyles or vices. He was by temperament a traditionalist who never fully appreciated or approved the revolutionary changes under way in British society. Nevertheless, he invariably wielded his influence as a force of neutrality and moderation, seeing his role as mediator rather than final decision maker.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E

Bill Bradley for the New York Times Book Review wrote of Red and Me [...] "Bill Russell is a private, complex man, but {{on the subject of}} his love of Red Auerbach and his Celtic teammates, he’s loud and clear." [...] In the book itself Russell wrote [...] "Whenever I leave the Celtics locker room, even Heaven wouldn't be good enough because anywhere else is a step down... With Red [...] and Walter Brown, I was the freest athlete on the planet. I could always be <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> them and they were always there for me."

I feel like we're in Avatar somewhere, running through the woods, minus the blue paint." [...] Later one of her outfits was described as an [...] "Avatar-esque bodysuit". Rowland said [...] "I had to pull out my dancing shoes for this video!" [...] The video features [...] "Kelly Rowland facing off against herself. The two Kellys start {{what appears to be a}} voguing competition on the dancefloor, then are flanked by respective dance teams." [...] Guetta makes an appearance at the end of the clip he [...] "undergoes a 'Transformers'-like metamorphosis, turning into a mixer." [...] Paper magazine described Rowland's look in the video as [...] "superhero-esque". Joanna Goh from MSN China said that in the clip [...] " [...] sports a new femme fatale image a la the bodysuits and masculine imaging".|$|E

IGN also called the game incomparable and peerless. GameSpot later called the game [...] "a towering achievement in the history of role-playing games." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer felt though the game was worthy being called the best game of the year and as good as games such as Fallout, , and Betrayal at Krondor, [...] "I won't trap <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> the 'best RPG ever' phrase." [...] He also felt the game's story was somewhere between Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale in terms of depth. Eurogamer lavished much praise upon the game, and noted that [...] "the story and quests are captivating, the gameplay tried and tested, and the overall feel is professional and entertaining." [...] In a 2007 Gamasutra article on the [...] "Platinum and Modern Ages" [...] of computer role-playing games (CRPGs), Matt Barton noted contemporary reviewers' universal praise for the game, and said, [...] "I consider it the finest CRPG ever designed."
