25|$|Inland {{from the}} coast {{there is a great}} deal of housing development: some of this has little infrastructure, while most is more expensive, {{especially}} in areas such as Kozyatağı and İçerenköy. These districts house many of İstanbul's upper-middle class residents. These neighbourhoods are mainly built around wide avenues and tree-lined streets, with four to six-storey apartment buildings that have sizable gardens and car-parking around them. Especially in Kozyatağı, there are old Ottoman houses nearly in every houses' garden (Each house or apartment has a big garden with parking lots and arbours while these gardens used to be the old house's).

60|$|He crept {{back to his}} room, {{collected}} and packed his few belongings, placed the money due for his lodgings on a table, {{and made his way}} out by a back door into the yard. A mob of poultry surged expectantly towards him; shaking off their interested attentions he hurried along under cover of cowstall, piggery, and hayricks till he reached the lane {{at the back of the}} farm. A few minutes' walk, which only the burden of his portmanteaux restrained from developing into an undisguised run, brought him to a main road, where the early carrier soon overtook him and sped him onward to the neighbouring town. At a bend of the road he caught a last glimpse of the farm; the old gabled roofs and thatched barns, the straggling orchard, and the <b>medlar</b> <b>tree,</b> with its wooden seat, stood out with an almost spectral clearness in the early morning light, and over it all brooded that air of magic possession which Crefton had once mistaken for peace.|$|E
60|$|Crefton Lockyer {{sat at his}} ease, an ease alike of {{body and}} soul, in the little patch of ground, half-orchard and half-garden, that abutted on the {{farmyard}} at Mowsle Barton. After the stress and noise of long years of city life, the repose and peace of the hill-begirt homestead struck on his senses with an almost dramatic intensity. Time and space seemed to lose their meaning and their abruptness; the minutes slid away into hours, and the meadows and fallows sloped away into middle distance, softly and imperceptibly. Wild weeds of the hedgerow straggled into the flower-garden, and wallflowers and garden bushes made counter-raids into farmyard and lane. Sleepy-looking hens and solemn preoccupied ducks were equally at home in yard, orchard, or roadway; nothing seemed to belong definitely to anywhere; even the gates were not necessarily to be found on their hinges. And over the whole scene brooded {{the sense of a}} peace that had almost a quality of magic in it. In the afternoon you felt that it had always been afternoon, and must always remain afternoon; in the twilight you knew that it could never have been anything else but twilight. Crefton Lockyer sat at his ease in the rustic seat beneath an old <b>medlar</b> <b>tree,</b> and decided that here was the life-anchorage that his mind had so fondly pictured and that latterly his tired and jarred senses had so often pined for. He would make a permanent lodging-place among these simple friendly people, gradually increasing the modest comforts with which he would like to surround himself, but falling in as much as possible with their manner of living.|$|E
6000|$|Passing {{out through}} the farm garden {{on his way to}} the lanes beyond, where he hoped to {{recapture}} the comfortable sense of peacefulness that was so lacking around house and hearth--especially hearth--Crefton came across the old mother, sitting mumbling to herself in the seat beneath the <b>medlar</b> <b>tree.</b> [...] "Let un sink as swims, let un sink as swims," [...] she was, repeating over and over again, as a child repeats a half-learned lesson. And now and then she would break off into a shrill laugh, with a note of malice in it that was not pleasant to hear. Crefton was glad when he found himself out of earshot, in the quiet and seclusion of the deep overgrown lanes that seemed to lead away to nowhere; one, narrower and deeper than the rest, attracted his footsteps, and he was almost annoyed when he found that it really did act as a miniature roadway to a human dwelling. A forlorn-looking cottage with a scrap of ill-tended cabbage garden and a few aged apple trees stood at an angle where a swift flowing stream widened out for a space into a decent sized pond before hurrying away again through the willows that had checked its course. Crefton leaned against a tree-trunk and looked across the swirling eddies of the pond at the humble little homestead opposite him; the only sign of life came from a small procession of dingy-looking ducks that marched in single file down to the water's edge. There is always something rather taking in the way a duck changes itself in an instant from a slow, clumsy waddler of the earth to a graceful, buoyant swimmer of the waters, and Crefton waited with a certain arrested attention to watch the leader of the file launch itself on to the surface of the pond. He was aware at the same time of a curious warning instinct that something strange and unpleasant was about to happen. The duck flung itself confidently forward into the water, and rolled immediately under the surface. Its head appeared for a moment and went under again, leaving a train of bubbles in its wake, while wings and legs churned the water in a helpless swirl of flapping and kicking. The bird was obviously drowning. Crefton thought at first that it had caught itself in some weeds, or was being attacked from below by a pike or water-rat. But no blood floated to the surface, and the wildly bobbing body made the circuit of the pond current without hindrance from any entanglement. A second duck had by this time launched itself into the pond, and a second struggling body rolled and twisted under the surface. There was something peculiarly piteous in the sight of the gasping beaks that showed now and again above the water, as though in terrified protest at this treachery of a trusted and familiar element. Crefton gazed with something like horror as a third duck poised itself on the bank and splashed in, to share the fate of the other two. He felt almost relieved when the remainder of the flock, taking tardy alarm from the commotion of the slowly drowning bodies, drew themselves up with tense outstretched necks, and sidled away from the scene of danger, quacking a deep note of disquietude as they went. At the same moment Crefton became aware that he was not the only human witness of the scene; a bent and withered old woman, whom he recognized at once as Martha Pillamon, of sinister reputation, had limped down the cottage path to the water's edge, and was gazing fixedly at the gruesome whirligig of dying birds that went in horrible procession round the pool. Presently her voice rang out in a shrill note of quavering rage: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process is as rooted in tradition as the finished product, {{and can take}} years to complete.

The branch is left alone until late fall, during which the wood heals and expands the design on its surface. The craftsman must then return to where he found the tree and cut the branch down.

Once this has happened, the wood is stained using a secret method, and then fitted with the various metal bands and fittings.

Thus, while Gandolfo (between 1880 and 1885) was painting The expelled woman (L’Espulsa), The last coin (L’Ultima moneta), The woman usurer (L’Usuraia), Forced Music (Musica Forzata), Proletarians (I proletari), On the way (Per Via) and The blind woman (La cieca), the literary world produced Rapisardi's Job (Giobbe), Verga's The House by the <b>Medlar</b> <b>Tree</b> (I Malavoglia) and Capuana's Giacinta.

Following this misfortune, the family finds themselves with a triple misfortune: the debt caused by the lupins which were bought on credit, the Providence to repair, and the loss of Bastianazzo, an important and loved member of the family.

Turkey's {{southern}} city of Antalya on the Mediterranean coast is a port city where different civilizations live from the Hellenistic period to the present day. Antalya Kaleiçi, which {{is the core of}} today's historic, accommodates the remaining cultural heritage from Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman periods to the present day. The limits of today's Kaleiçi are determined by the city walls, built for defense. The walls, which started construction in the Hellenistic period, had some additions and repairs on Roman, Seljuk and Ottoman periods. Housing tissue of Kaleiçi is dated 19. - 20. century.   The subject of the thesis, Ömer Lütfü Lülü House, is the example of Kaleiçi 19. century civil architecture heritage. Ömer Lütfü Lülü House is in Antalya city, the town of Muratpaşa, Kaleiçi, Kılınçarslan Quarter, 115 block, 10 layout.

He was famous timber merchant. Timber which is used on building construction was transfered from Antalya to Egypt by Ömer Lütfü Lülü.   Ömer Lütfü Lülü House plan typology does not fix to Antalya Houses' plan typology because Ömer Lütfü Lülü was not from Antalya and  he has political position. Therefore, the house's plan typology similar with 19. - 2. century İstanbul House plan typology. The house is situated at the nortwest corner of the garden at the point of junction of Mermerli banyo Street and Kaledibi Street. Two facade of the building looks the street, other two facade looks the garden. There is 3 meters elevation difference between  north and south facade because, topography of the land  where the house is situated is sloping. Gardens were cretated in two plane by terracing.
