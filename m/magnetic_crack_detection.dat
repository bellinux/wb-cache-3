40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{new methods}} for automatic <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> in pavements. <b>Cracks</b> in pavements {{can be used}} as an early indication for the need of reparation. Automatic <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> is preferable compared to manual inventory; the repeatability can be better, the inventory can be done at a higher speed and can be done without interruption of the traffic. The automatic and semi-automatic <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> systems that exist today use Image Analysis methods. There are today powerful methods available in the area of Computer Vision. These methods work in higher dimensions with greater complexity and generate measures of local signal properties, while Image Analyses methods for <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> use morphological operations on binary images. Methods for digitalizing video data on VHS-cassettes and stitching images from nearby frames have been developed. Four methods for <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> have been evaluated, and two of them have been used to form a <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> and classification program implemented in the calculation program Matlab. One image set was used during the implementation and another image set was used for validation. The <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> system did perform correct detection on 99. 2 percent when analysing the images which were used during implementation. The result of the <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> on the validation data was not very good. When the program is being used on data from other pavements than the one used during implementation, information about the surface texture is required to calibrate the <b>crack</b> <b>detection...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports the}} recent {{development}} of a surface fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> technique based {{on the use of}} surface-mount piezoelectric paint sensor. Polymer-based piezoelectric paints that can be directly deposited onto the surface of host structures are being utilized to make the sensor for surface <b>crack</b> <b>detection.</b> Because of its electromechanical coupling properties, voltage signals can be generated by the piezoelectric paint sensor when subjected to mechanical strain in its film plane. Results from recent development of the piezoelectric paint-based surface <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> technique indicate that piezoelectric paint sensors with a special electrode design can potentially provide an effective method to detect fatigue cracks occurring in structural surfaces. A simple damage index is defined to determine the occurrence of surface cracks in a pre-specified region. However, complex sensor electrode patterns may be necessary in some cases to improve the spatial resolution of surface <b>crack</b> <b>detection.</b> Experiments conducted to validate this surface <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> technique are also described in this study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{production}} of silicon solar cells <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> systems can help to sort out damaged wafers and reduce wafer breakage before they enter {{the production}} line. In order to be cost effective, the <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> system needs to minimize false detections as much as possible. False <b>detections</b> in <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> systems occur when bad wafers are not detected or when good wafers are falsely detected as bad. The first error leads {{to an increase in}} cell breakage, the second error raises cell costs because non-damaged wafers are sorted out prior to cell processing. In this work a model has been developed to calculate the maximum allowable error rates of <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> systems in order to achieve a cost per wafer benefit. Therefore a breakage rate dependent throughput calculation, based on manufacturing data, has been implemented. A sensitivity analysis shows that avoiding a high sorting out rate is crucial to favor the implementation of a <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Pavement <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> is an {{important}} procedure in road maintenanceand traffic safety. Traditionally, the road inventory was performed by field inspection, now it is replaced by the evaluation of mobile mapping system images.

The automatisation of <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> is highly necessarybecause it could decrease workload, and therefore, maintenance costs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a highly accurate and efficient method for <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> using percolation-based image processing. The <b>detection</b> of <b>cracks</b> in concrete surfaces during the maintenance and diagnosis of concrete structures {{is important to}} ensure the safety of these structures. Recently, the image-based <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> method has attracted considerable attention due to its low cost and objectivity. However, there are several problems in the practical application of image processing for <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> since real concrete surface images have noises such as concrete blebs, stains, and shadings of several sizes. In order to resolve these problems, our proposed method focuses on the number of pixels in a crack and the connectivity of the pixels.

40|$|Pavement {{condition}} {{assessment is}} an important process in road maintenance and monitoring. However, current pavement condition assessment methods are time consuming and usually implemented manually. Pavement distress is {{becoming one of the}} biggest problems in road network systems. An efficient and effective detection method is needed to identify these pavement problems on the road. Additionally, <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> is much more complicated than other infrastructure element <b>detection.</b> Current <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> methods are complex and inefficient. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create an efficient and effective <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> model to identify cracks based on pavement images. This study uses a <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> model with four components: image collection, image segmentation, pixel selection and statistical analysis. Image collection is a process of using a photogrammetry method to collect the data for the <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> model. Then, the pavement image is transformed into a binary image during the image segmentation phase. Subsequently, the pixels in the binary image are selected in order to convert the photogrammetry data into statistical data. Finally, the statistical data will be analyzed using linear regression in order to determine whether the linear regression line represents an actual center line for the crack. This crack model is performed in a MATLAB prototype. The results indicate that this <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> model can identify the center line of a crack accurately. Future work is suggested on controlling the data is piece of the linear regression algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of cracks in {{any type of}} structure is undesirable as they often lead to fracture {{or failure of the}} structure. Marine propeller shaft is a key component in marine propulsion systems; moreover due to the strenuous working conditions, to which it is subjected during its marine operation, it is prone to develop crack(s). The presently available <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> methods, either require disassembly of the shaft substructure for visual inspection or require external excitation of the relevant portion of the shaft for subsequent dynamic analyses; consequently these methods are quite complex and time consuming. In this study a simpler <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> method is proposed for <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> in rotating marine propeller shafts. The <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> method is based on simple strain and displacement measurements at identified locations and hence easy to execute. The study was carried out using Finite Element Analysis through ABAQUS, a well-known commercial finite element package. The analysis was carried out both for the existence of single bending crack and single circumferential crack, on the body of the rotating shaft component, and the proposed method was able to identify both types of cracks at quite early stages of their growth and development. It was found that if measured at the proper locations, the percentage changes and slopes of percentage changes for these parameters (strain and displacement) changed more rapidly than frequencies, due to the {{presence of}} a crack. Only two measurements were required to get such identification which could be directly related to crack location and size. Based on the computed and analyzed numerical results, a simple but effective <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> method has been proposed which would eliminate the complexities present in the currently available <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> methods for such structures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTerrestrial laser {{scanning}} {{has become one}} of the standard technologies for object acquisition in surveying engineering. The high spatial resolution of imaging and the excellent capability of measuring the 3 D space by {{laser scanning}} bear a great potential if combined for both data acquisition and data compilation. Automatic <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> from concrete surface images is very effective for nondestructive testing. The crack information can be used to decide the appropriate rehabilitation method to fix the cracked structures and prevent any catastrophic failure. In practice, cracks on concrete surfaces are traced manually for diagnosis. On the other hand, automatic <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> is highly desirable for efficient and objective crack assessment. The current paper submits a method for automatic concrete <b>cracks</b> <b>detection</b> and mapping from the data that was obtained during laser scanning survey. The method of <b>cracks</b> <b>detection</b> and mapping is achieved by three steps, namely the step of shading correction in the original image, step of <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> and finally step of crack mapping and processing steps. The detected crack is defined in a pixel coordinate system. To remap the crack into the referred coordinate system, a reverse engineering is used. This is achieved by a hybrid concept of terrestrial laser-scanner point clouds and the corresponding camera image, i. e. a conversion from the pixel coordinate system to the terrestrial laser-scanner or global coordinate system.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} defect detection on complex textural surfaces. In general, whether the texture to be inspected is regular or random, in image terms it is characterized by local variations in pixel grey level values. These normal variations render the problem of texture defect detection extremely difficult as defects are often manifested by grey level changes and their detection requires more than mere pixel comparisons. In the thesis, classical techniques on texture representation are studied and various existing texture defect detection algorithms are reviewed. Three novel algorithms {{have been developed to}} tackle the problem of defect detection on random or regular textures. The first two are devoted to the problem of <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> and the third algorithm is devoted to the problem of detecting regional defects. For texture <b>crack</b> <b>detection,</b> a cojoint spatial and spatial frequency representation, that is, wigner distribution is proposed to model the inspected texture surface. A detailed analysis of the wigner distribution, its properties and the effect of windowing on its <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> performance are carried out. Two postprocessing methods, ie, probabilistic relaxation labelling and linear filtering are incorporated into the <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm to refine the results. The potential of the Wigner model has also been explored by modifying the <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm so as to detect other types of defects. For real world applications, an efficient <b>crack</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm based on a new distribution is proposed. The algorithm is shown to produce comparable results but in much shorter time. For regional defect detection, a hybrid chromato-structural approach to colour texture representation is proposed where combined colour texture information is extracted from various chromatic classes associated with the inspected surface. In the approach, a unified defect detection framework which combines a new colour clustering scheme, morphological smoothing and blob analysis are used to capture the relevant combined colour texture information. With this framework, good defect detection results are obtained and presented in this thesis...|$|R
