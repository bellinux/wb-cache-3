Neutrons can be slowed to thermal energies through collisions with a neutron <b>moderator</b> <b>material,</b> {{the easiest to}} use being the hydrogen atoms found in water.

This leads to the concept of reactor-grade enriched uranium, with the amount of U-235 increased from just less than 1% to between 3 and 5% depending on the reactor design. This is in contrast to [...] weapons-grade enrichment, which increases to the U-235 to at least 20%, and more commonly, over 90%.|$|E

40|$|An exact {{solution}} to the monoenergetic Boltzmann equation is obtained for {{the case of a}} plane isotropic burst of neutrons introduced at the interface separating two adjacent, dissimilar, semi-infinite media. The method of solution used is to remove the time dependence by a Laplace transformation, solve the transformed equation by the normal mode expansion method, and then invert to recover the time dependence. The general result is expressed as a sum of definite, multiple integrals, one of which contains the uncollided wave of neutrons originating at the source plane. It is possible to obtain a simplified form for the solution at the interface, and certain numerical calculations are made there. The interface flux in two adjacent moderators is calculated and plotted as a function of time for several <b>moderator</b> <b>materials.</b> For each case it is found that the flux decay curve has an asymptotic slope given accurately by diffusion theory. Furthermore, the interface current is observed to change directions when the scattering and absorption cross sections of the two <b>moderator</b> <b>materials</b> are related in a certain manner. More specifically, the reflection process in two adjacent moderators appears to depend initially on the scattering properties and for long times on the absorption properties of the media. This analysis contains both the single infinite and semi-infinite medium problems as special cases. The results in these two special cases provide a check on the accuracy of the general solution since they agree with solutions of these problems obtained by separate analyses. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{resonance}} self-shielding method using a pointwise energy solution {{has been}} developed to overcome the drawbacks of the equivalence theory. The equivalence theory uses a crude resonance scattering source approximation, and assumes a spatially constant scattering source distribution inside a fuel pellet. These two assumptions cause a significant error, in that they overestimate the multi-group effective cross sections, especially for 238 U. The new resonance self-shielding method solves pointwise energy slowing-down equations with a sub-divided fuel rod. The method adopts a shadowing effect correction factor and fictitious <b>moderator</b> <b>material</b> to model a realistic pointwise energy solution. The slowing-down solution is used to generate the multi-group cross section.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{representation of}} the scattering of neutrons by the materials used to build cold sources at neutron scattering facilities {{is important for the}} initial design and optimization of a cold source, and for the analysis of experimental results obtained using the cold source. In practice, this requires a good {{representation of the}} physics of scattering from the material, a method to convert this into observable quantities (such as scattering cross sections), and a method to use the results in a neutron transport code (such as the MCNP Monte Carlo code). At Los Alamos, the authors have been developing these capabilities over the last ten years. The final set of cold-moderator evaluations, together with evaluations for conventional <b>moderator</b> <b>materials,</b> was released in 1994. These materials have been processed into MCNP data files using the NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System. Over the course of this work, they were able to develop a new module for NJOY called LEAPR based on the LEAP + ADDELT code from the UK as modified by D. J. Picton for cold-moderator calculations. Much of the physics for methane came from Picton`s work. The liquid hydrogen work was originally based on a code using the Young-Koppel approach that went through a number of hands in Europe (including Rolf Neef and Guy Robert). It was generalized and extended for LEAPR, and depends strongly on work by Keinert and Sax of the University of Stuttgart. Thus, their collection of cold-moderator scattering kernels is truly an international effort, and they are glad to be able to return the enhanced evaluations and processing techniques to the international community.

40|$|It {{would be}} {{advantageous}} to irradiate americium targets up to very large burn-ups, {{so as to}} throw them away to waste without any further reprocessing. Former studies considered the recycling of americium in conventional LWRs.

In fast reactors, americium targets could be placed in special assemblies filled with a neutron <b>moderator</b> <b>material</b> which enhances Am incineration.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the neutron {{time-of-flight}} spectra of a target-moderator-reflector-system of a spallation neutron source was investigated. With these results questions concerning nuclear technology and radiation protection issues {{both for the}} design of a target-moderator-reflector-system of a high intensive spallation neutron source and the operation of foreseen experiments could be answered. With the JESSICA-experiment (Juelich Experimental Spallation Target Set-up In COSY Area) installed at the Juelich proton accelerator COSY the neutron time-of-flight spectra were measured. In accompanying Monte Carlo simulations the neutron generation, the particle transport, and the interaction of neutrons with <b>moderator</b> <b>materials</b> over a broad energy range - from 1. 334 GeV incident energy of the protons down to the meV range of the cold neutrons - was simulated. Both the experimental and theoretical results allow to optimise the efficiency of moderators and increasing the safety regarding radiation protection. As <b>moderator</b> <b>materials</b> water and polyethylene at T= 300 K and ice at 70 K and 20 K were used. For the first time the neutron time-of-flight spectra of methane-hydrate at 20 K was measured. By applying a methane-hydrate moderator the expected advantages due to the spectral characteristic of the thermal and cold neutrons was observed. The time response of the wavelength dependent neutrons was determined by investigating the decay time and pulse width with an accuracy of about 10 %. The gathered data of the JESSICA experiment were used to validate neutron transport- and scattering cross sections for Monte Carlo systems. Whereas for water and polyethylene experimental results and simulations are in a good agreement, for the cold ice moderator systems at 70 K and 20 K spectral differences were observed. The relevance of the experiment for radiation safety issues of a high power spallation neutron source will be discussed. (orig.)

Early nuclear reactors did not use isotopically enriched uranium, and in consequence they were required to use large quantities of highly purified graphite as neutron moderation materials.

Typically, reactors also require inclusion of extremely chemically pure neutron <b>moderator</b> <b>materials</b> such as deuterium (in heavy water), helium, beryllium, or carbon, the latter usually as graphite.
