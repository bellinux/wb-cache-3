40|$|A few {{advanced}} bus-clamping {{pulse width}} modulation (ABCPWM) methods have been proposed recently for a three-phase inverter. With these methods, each phase is clamped, switched at nominal frequency, and switched at twice the nominal frequency in {{different regions of the}} fundamental cycle. This study proposes a generalised ABCPWM scheme, encompassing the few ABCPWM schemes that have been proposed and many more ABCPWM schemes that have not been reported yet. Furthermore, analytical closed-form expression is derived for the harmonic distortion factor corresponding to the generalised ABCPWM. This factor is independent of load parameters. The analytical expression derived here brings out the dependence of root-mean-square (RMS) current ripple on modulation index, and can be used to evaluate the RMS current ripple corresponding to any ABCPWM scheme. The analytical closed-form expression is validated experimentally in terms of <b>measured</b> <b>weighted</b> total harmonic distortion (THD) in line voltage (V-WTHD) and measured THD in line current (I-THD) on a 6 kW induction motor drive...|$|E

Methods: Forty-nine patients answered the NEI-VFQ- 25 questionnaire. High- and low-contrast distance acuity (VA), near VA, and visual fields (VF) were <b>measured.</b> <b>Weighted</b> VA (WVA) and low-contrast (10 %) VA (WLCVA), binocular VF areas, and central scotoma were calculated. Adjusted mean subscale scores were calculated and associations analyzed. Results: Subscale scores for general, far, and near vision, social functioning, and color vision were lowest while general health, ocular pain, {{and mental health}} were highest in the BD phenotype. The correlations were substantial and similar for WVA, WLCVA, and near vision. The degree of measured VF impairment had few associations with the different adjusted subscale scores.

40|$|Combined ultrafast 90 °+ 90 ° kV-MV-CBCT within single breath-hold of 15 s {{has high}} {{clinical}} potential for accelerating imaging for lung cancer patients treated with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH). For clinical feasibility of kV-MV-CBCT, dose exposure {{has to be}} small compared to prescribed dose. In this study, kV-MV dose output is evaluated and compared to clinically-established kV-CBCT. Accurate dose calibration was performed for kV and MV energy; beam quality was determined. For direct comparison of MV and kV dose output, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was considered. CT dose index (CTDI) was determined and measurements in various representative locations of an inhomogeneous thorax phantom were performed to simulate the patient situation. A measured dose of 20. 5 mGE (Gray-equivalent) in the target region was comparable to kV-CBCT (31. 2 mGy for widely-used, and 9. 1 mGy for latest available preset), whereas kV-MV spared healthy tissue and reduced dose to 6. 6 mGE (30 %) due to asymmetric dose distribution. The <b>measured</b> <b>weighted</b> CTDI of 12 mGE for kV-MV lay in between both clinical presets. Dosimetric properties were in agreement with established imaging techniques, whereas exposure to healthy tissue was reduced.

40|$|Currently, in the {{photovoltaic}} industry, {{wet chemical}} etching technologies are used for saw damage removal and surface texturing. Alternative to {{wet chemical etching}} is plasma etching. However, as for example, the linear microwave plasma technique, developed by Roth&Rau, has not been implemented in the photovoltaic industry for etching, because of the very low etch rate (< 1 m/min) and {{the high cost of}} ownership related to the etching process. In this study, different front surface textured crystalline silicon wafers obtained by means of the linear microwave plasma technique and the expanding thermal plasma technique are investigated in terms of weighted reflection by using reflectometry (250 - 1200 nm) to study the optical properties of the textures in detail. In addition, atomic force microscopy is used to measure the surface topography to determine statistical roughness parameters, as presented in this paper. Effective light trapping can be obtained by multiple reflection s as well as by a graded layer, which leads to a diffuse front surface, or a combination of both. A graded layer can be described as a smooth transition with increasing refractive index from air to silicon with typical thickness of (200 ± 50) nm. We have found that the average plane tilt angle correlates to the <b>measured</b> <b>weighted</b> reflection. Moreover, we can determine from the aspect ratio whether the light trapping is effective by multiple reflections. From the roughness exponent, which is a measure for the micro roughness, we can determine whether the light trapping is effective by a graded layer...|$|E

A monthly index of arthropod availability (in mm³) was estimated in each site through capture rates in pit-fall traps. Fallen fruits were collected along trails in the study sites (mass of fruit gave an index of fruit availability) and small mammals were sampled in grids with 120 traps which covered the lowland (5. 2 ha) and in the slope forests (3. 6 ha). The abundance and mass of small mammals were standardized for the size of each sampled area (in g. ha- 1). To sample snakes we established 20 pit-fall traps in each area and performed monthly transects in four consecutive days (totaling 1000 m long) along trails in the study sites. Snakes found were <b>measured,</b> <b>weighted</b> marked and released. Abundance and total mass of snakes were standardized {{by the size of}} each area.

40|$|The aim {{of study}} {{is to find out}} how {{measuring}} the absorbed dose depends on the different axial scanning technologies and how they affect the measured value using standard dose test method with CT dose head and body phantoms. Computed tomography one of the most pressing tasks is to dose reduction. Parameters associated with received radiation doses and depend on the hardware technical support are: slice thickness, the distance between slice, interlayer, examination region, exposure factor and gantry tilt. Image quality and radiation dose affect patient received dose in examination. Computed tomography manufacturers given base CT Dose Index (CTDI) values are highly dependent on scanning parameters and characteristics of the scanner. Therefore image quality and radiation dose affect patient received dose in examination and it may not always be assessed quantitatively, when measured with CT dose test phantoms. However, to achieve this objective requires more and more new approaches for the determination of the dose rate CT, and in assessing the information provided by different manufacturers, firstly, of the CT dose index (CTDI), that can compare with the standard methods and the assessment of the patient dose. To determinate CT dose index in CT dose phantom there are nothing says about the limits of the scan length of the phantoms, not exceed the permissible uncertainty related to possible scatter of the phantom side the edge.

40|$|The SO 2 {{camera is}} a novel device for the remote sensing of {{volcanic}} emissions using solar radiation scattered in the atmosphere as a light source for the measurements. The method is based on measuring the ultra-violet absorption of SO 2 in a narrow wavelength window around 310 nm by employing a band-pass interference filter and a 2 dimensional UV-sensitive CCD detector. The effect of aerosol scattering can in part be compensated by additionally measuring the incident radiation around 325 nm, where the absorption of SO 2 is about 30 times weaker, thus rendering the method applicable to optically thin plumes. For plumes with high aerosol optical densities, collocation of an additional moderate resolution spectrometer is desirable to enable a correction of radiative transfer effects. The ability to deliver spatially resolved images of volcanic SO 2 distributions at a frame rate {{on the order of}} 1 Hz makes the SO 2 camera a very promising technique for volcanic monitoring and for studying the dynamics of volcanic plumes in the atmosphere. This study gives a theoretical basis for the pertinent aspects of working with SO 2 camera systems, including the measurement principle, instrument design, data evaluation and technical applicability. Several issues are identified that influence camera calibration and performance. For one, changes in the solar zenith angle lead to a variable light path length in the stratospheric ozone layer and therefore change the spectral distribution of scattered solar radiation incident at the Earth's surface. The varying spectral illumination causes a shift in the calibration of the SO 2 camera's results. Secondly, the lack of spectral resolution inherent in the measurement technique leads to a non-linear relationship between <b>measured</b> <b>weighted</b> average optical density and the SO 2 column density. Thirdly, {{as is the case with}} all remote sensing techniques that use scattered solar radiation as a light source, the radiative transfer between the sun and the instrument is variable, with both "radiative dilution" as well as multiple scattering occurring. These effects can lead to both, over or underestimation of the SO 2 column density by more than an order of magnitude. As the accurate assessment of volcanic emissions depends on our ability to correct for these issues, recommendations for correcting the individual effects during data analysis are given. Aside from the above mentioned intrinsic effects, the particular technical design of the SO 2 camera can also greatly influence its performance, depending on the setup chosen. A general description of an instrument setup is given, and the advantages and disadvantages of certain specific instrument designs are discussed. Finally, several measurement examples are shown and possibilities to combine SO 2 camera measurements with other remote sensing techniques are explored...|$|E
40|$|Background and Importance: There {{has been}} much debate {{recently}} over rapidly growing drug expenditures. Cancer medicines, in particular, have driven new brand spending over recent years, and US oncological expenditures have risen faster than for many other disease areas, {{in part because of}} rapidly growing drug prices, as well as increased rates of use. Objective: In the face of ongoing debates on how to reasonably control growth in pharmaceutical spending, while also providing patients with the best possible care, this thesis sets out to help address the question of whether growing pharmaceutical expenditures are providing value-for-money to patients and society. Novelty and Empirical Contributions: This thesis is based in part on a systematic review with narrative synthesis of English-language HTA appraisals of the comparative clinical risks and benefits of new cancer medicines, {{as well as on the}} novel use of methods to generate comparative evidence on their use and cost. Adapting established methods, these data are then used to examine existing questions over whether growing expenditures are worth the cost to patients and society. This thesis makes five major contributions to the literature on value-based spending on cancer medicines: 1) approximately one in three newly licensed cancer medicines provide no known overall survival benefit, while one in five provide no known overall survival, quality of life, or safety benefit; 2) novel use of methodologies to model treatment course and duration reveals that cancer drug use and costs vary greatly between individual medicines, and across Australia, France, the UK, and the US; 3) the monetized value of survival gains attributable to cancer drug innovation, net of growth in cancer drug spending, varies across individual medicines, and, at a country-level, remains unambiguously positive in Australia, France, and the UK, but negative in the US; 4) spending on new cancer medicines is often only weakly associated with their clinical benefits; and 5) the strength of this association nevertheless varies across countries, with the UK demonstrating the strongest evidence of value-based spending on new cancer medicines. Clinical and Policy Implications: Findings from this thesis provide a resource for valuebased clinical decision-making by patients and physicians. Moreover, growing expenditures on cancer medicines may only weakly be associated with meaningful clinical benefits, though the extent to which this is true differs across countries. These findings highlight the important role that health policy can have in encouraging valuebased cancer drug spending. In particular, it is argued that managed access schemes promoting access and evidence development, as well as the use of value-based spending policies, can help expedite access to new treatments, incentivize the development of clinically meaningful medicines, and rationalize growing cancer drug expenditures. Future Research Directions: The comparative clinical risks and benefits from new cancer medicines using real-world data, and how they compare with trial-based results; how evidence on the comparative impact from new treatments is <b>measured,</b> <b>weighted,</b> and rewarded in decision-making by regulators and payers; and how it is effectively linked through policy and regulation to cancer drug spending...|$|E

Astropecten marginatus is a sea star widely distributed in Northern and Eastern South America, found on sandy and muddy bottoms, in shallow and deep waters. To describe {{some of its}} ecological characteristics, we calculated it spatial-temporal distribution, population parameters (based on size and weight) and diet in the Orinoco Delta ecoregion (Venezuela). The ecoregion was divided in three sections: Golfo de Paria, Boca de Serpiente and Plataforma Deltana. Samples for the rainy and dry seasons came from megabenthos surveys of the "Línea Base Ambiental Plataforma Deltana (LBAPD) " and "Corocoro Fase I (CFI) " projects. The collected sea stars were <b>measured,</b> <b>weighted</b> and dissected by the oral side to extract their stomach and identify the preys consumed. A total of 570 sea stars were collected in LBAPD project and 306 in CFI one. The highest densities were found {{during the dry season}} in almost all sections. In LBAPD project the highest density was in "Plataforma Deltana" section (0. 007 ± 0. 022 ind/m² in dry season and 0. 014 ± 0. 06 ind/m² in rainy season) and in the CFI project the densities in "Golfo de Paria" section were 0. 705 ± 0. 829 ind/m² in rainy season and 1. 027 ± 1. 107 ind/m² in dry season. The most frequent size range was 3. 1 - 4. 6 cm. The highest biomass was found in "Golfo de Paria" section (7. 581 ± 0. 018 mg/m² in dry season and 0. 005 ± 6. 542 x 10 - 06 mg/m² in rainy season for 2004 - 2005 and 3. 979 ± 4. 024 mg/m² in dry season; and 3. 117 ± 3. 137 mg/m² in rainy season for 2006). A linear relationship was found between the sea star size and its weight but no relationship was observed between its size and the depth where it was collected. Mollusks are dominant in the sea star diet (47. 4 % in abundance).
