In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape <b>machine</b> <b>roll</b> and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E

They have to hit you right in the heart." [...] —Wade taking about his experience on writing songs for Who We Are. [...] "First Time" [...] is a power pop song that contains alternative rock and pop punk influences. It was described as a [...] "radio-friendly number with hooks aplenty" [...] by Alex Lai of Contactmusic.com. John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout described the song as [...] "an upbeat love song", and further described it as [...] "sort of a 'Hanging by a Moment' meets 'Spin' with more of a distinct romantic angle like 'You and Me.'" [...] Billboard described the song as a [...] "melodic ember-turner, balancing polished instrumentation and a crystal-clear hook against lead Jason Wade's sandy vocals." [...] Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "a very quick paced song with a catchy rhythm that can compete with 'Hanging by a Moment' but just can't quite beat it." [...] Steve Morley of UMC.org described the song as a [...] "propulsive pop-rocker" [...] that he said [...] "moved beyond typical love song clichés." [...] The song is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major, and Wade's vocal range spans from the low-note of E4 to the high-note of B5. The song has a basic chord progression of A2-Bsus-Cm7-B/D-E5.|$|E

Deliberations were illustrated by computational example of surfaced roll made from steel 13 CrMo 4. The temperature field and structural components fraction was calcualated in section of regenerated area of material decline (along the roll axis). Considering critical temperatures, heat-affected zones have been determined: A 1 and A 3 – austenitic transformation, and solidus - fusion line. Accepted technological parameters of rebuilding gave results that reproduce geometry of padding weld heat-affected zones confirmed experimentally...|$|E
