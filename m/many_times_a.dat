The solutions involved (such as filling growing defects with fluids) has inspired scientists to make novel bioinspired (or biomimicry) materials.|$|E
25|$|Pulsars are {{sources of}} {{powerful}} electromagnetic radiation, emitted in short and extremely regular pulses <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> second. They {{were a great}} mystery when discovered in 1967, and the team who identified the first one considered {{the possibility that it}} could be a signal from an advanced civilization. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. They now are understood to be rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose powerful magnetic field concentrates their radiation emissions into narrow beams.|$|E
25|$|Tuonela was {{the land}} of dead. It was an {{underground}} home or city for all the dead people, not only the good or the bad ones. It was a dark and lifeless place, where everybody slept forever. Still a brave shaman could travel to Tuonela in trance {{to ask for the}} forefathers' guidance. To travel to Tuonela, the soul had to cross the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a proper reason, then a boat would come to take them over. <b>Many</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> shaman's soul had to trick the guards of Tuonela into believing that they were actually dead.|$|E

25|$|Stone tools, {{particularly}} projectile points (arrowheads) and scrapers, are {{the primary}} evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Paleoindian bands probably moved their camps <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year. Their camps were typically small ones, consisting of 20–50 people. Band organization was egalitarian, so there were no formal leaders and no social ranking or classes. Scientific evidence links indigenous Americans to Asian peoples, specifically eastern Siberian populations.

In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, <b>many</b> <b>times.</b> <b>A</b> century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E
500|$|Once {{it enters}} Spring Valley (where {{it is known}} locally first as South Main Street, then as North Main Street after it crosses its very busy {{intersection}} with NY59), NY45 continues northward through the downtown business district. Traffic here tends to pile up <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. After NY45's intersection at Hillcrest with CR74 (the location of several small shopping centers), traffic tends to ease up. North of there, NY45 provides {{a link to the}} Hassidic Jewish community of New Square, although it never enters the village limits. At CR80, NY45 enters New Hempstead. Again the road becomes relatively quiet, but it begins to parallel the Palisades Interstate Parkway, until its intersection at exit12 in Pomona. NY45 quickly leaves Pomona and enters Mount Ivy. This is where NY45 comes to its northern terminus at US202. This area of US202 is in downtown Mount Ivy, and exit13 of the Palisades is just [...] west of NY45's northern terminus.|$|E

500|$|The first {{mention of}} Bishop Henry in {{historical}} sources is from 1298, {{when he is}} mentioned along with king Eric in a document from a provincial synod of Uppsala in Telge. The first mention of Henry of Uppsala being {{the patron saint of}} Turku cathedral is from 14 August 1320, when he is mentioned as the second patron of the cathedral after Virgin Mary. So when he is later addressed by Pope Boniface IX as the patronus of the Cathedral of Turku along with the Virgin Mary, it is actually from the year 1391. Boniface also called him a [...] "saint". In 1291 a longish document by the cathedral chapter makes no reference to Henry even though it mentions the cathedral and election of the new bishop <b>many</b> <b>times.</b> <b>A</b> papal letter by Pope Nicholas IV from 1292 has the Virgin Mary as the sole patrona in Turku. The legend itself is first referred to in a letter by Archbishop of Uppsala in 1298. Eric and Henry are mentioned together as martyrs who needed to be prayed to {{for the sake of the}} situation in Karelia, thus associating their alleged crusade to Finland with the new expeditions against Novgorod. The war between Novgorod and Sweden for the control of Karelia had started in 1293. The first certain appearance of Henry's image in the seal of the Bishop of Turku is from 1299.|$|E

Also in the classroom, when it is suggested some poor people would rather die than go to a poorhouse, Cartman says, [...] "Well then perhaps they should – and decrease the surplus population!" [...] The line is lifted word-for-word from the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, prompting Mr. Garrison to respond, [...] "Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day." [...] Kyle incorrectly tells Stan that Sally Struthers appeared on Full House, an American sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s; she actually starred in the 1970s series All in the Family. When Dr. Mephisto asks Chef to look into his microscope, Chef says he sees [...] "an extreme close-up of Vanessa Redgrave's private parts", a reference to the Academy Award-winning English actress. At the end of the episode, Stan said it is important to remember the images of starving children on television are [...] "just as real as you or I". Kyle says by that logic, MacGyver is a real person too, a reference to the secret agent protagonist from the 1980s television series of the same name.|$|E

2500|$|Though enamel is {{described}} as tough, it has a similar brittleness to glass, [...] making it, unlike other natural crack-resistant laminate structures such as shell and nacre, potentially vulnerable to fracture. In spite of this it can withstand bite forces as high as 1,000 N <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day during chewing. This resistance {{is due in part}} to the microstructure of enamel which contains processes, enamel tufts, that stabilize the growth of such fractures at the dentinoenamel junction. The configuration of the tooth also acts to reduce the tensile stresses that cause fractures during biting.|$|E
