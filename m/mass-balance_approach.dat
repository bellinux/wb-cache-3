During the first 2 years after the eruption the lake transformed from hot and ultraacidic caused by dissolution of magmatic gases, to a warm and less acidic lake due to a rapid “magmatic-tohydrothermal transition” — input of hydrothermal fluids and oxidation of H 2 S to sulfate.

40|$|It is {{theoretically}} {{possible to}} engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in which isobutanol is the predominant catabolic product and high-yielding isobutanol-producing strains are already reported by industry. Conversely, isobutanol yields of engineered S. cerevisiae strains {{reported in the}} scientific literature typically remain far below 10 % of the theoretical maximum. This study explores possible reasons for these suboptimal yields by a <b>mass-balancing</b> <b>approach.</b> A cytosolically located, cofactor-balanced isobutanol pathway, consisting of a mosaic of bacterial enzymes whose in vivo functionality was confirmed by complementation of null mutations in branched-chain amino acid metabolism, was expressed in S. cerevisiae. Product formation by the engineered strain was analysed in shake flasks and bioreactors. In aerobic cultures, the pathway intermediate isobutyraldehyde was oxidized to isobutyrate rather than reduced to isobutanol. Moreover, significant concentrations of the pathway intermediates 2, 3 -dihydroxyisovalerate and ?-ketoisovalerate, as well as diacetyl and acetoin, accumulated extracellularly. While the engineered strain could not grow anaerobically, micro-aerobic cultivation resulted in isobutanol formation at a yield of 0. 018 ± 0. 003 mol/mol glucose. Simultaneously, 2, 3 -butanediol was produced at a yield of 0. 649 ± 0. 067 mol/mol glucose. These results identify massive accumulation of pathway intermediates, as well as overflow metabolites derived from acetolactate, as an important, previously underestimated contributor to the suboptimal yields of ‘academic’ isobutanol strains. The observed patterns of by-product formation {{is consistent with the}} notion that in vivo activity of the iron–sulphur-cluster-requiring enzyme dihydroxyacid dehydratase is a key bottleneck in the present and previously described ‘academic’ isobutanol-producing yeast strains.

The comparison of the four <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approaches</b> shows that, if uncertainties are ignored, (1) they yield similar results concerning the mobile vs immobile behaviour of many components; (2) they yield similar mass-change values on bulk rock and on individual chemical elements (bulk-rock mass-change values differ by a maximum of ca. 15 % between graphical and statistical treatments of the metacarbonate xenolith evolution). The main difference concerns the uncertainties on mass changes (for bulk rocks and individual elements), which are much larger with the graphical than with the statistical approaches when uncertainties on chemical elements are taken into account, as they should be. The main advantage of the graphical methods is their rapid implementation and the clarity of the diagrams. Their main disadvantages are that uncertainties on each chemical element and bulk compositions are not taken into account and the difficulty in choosing an accurate immobility field to precisely define errors. Graphical methods need to be completed by a statistical treatment that gives absolute mass transfer results. The statistical approaches have the advantage of taking into account the chemical heterogeneities of the compared populations, in conjunction to a precise data treatment. The statistical treatment is an important and necessary step to decipher and to be pertinent in interpreting mobility/immobility of chemical elements, and, thus, in the absolute quantification of mass and volume changes...|$|R

It is shown that this flexibility can affect both wing-aileron and aileron-tab flutter, but each is affected differently. In wing-aileron flutter, mass-balance arm flexibility gives rise to ternary flutter and has a powerful stabilizing effect when the <b>mass-balance</b> natural frequency <b>approaches</b> the flutter frequency. In aileron-tab flutter, the mass-balance flexibility serves to produce an aileron overtone mode equivalent in effect to a rigidly mass-balmlced aileron mode of the same frequency.

Producing fish in ponds fertilized by manure could help to diversify family-scale agricultural production in this region. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) could improve understanding of the contribution of fish-pond systems to regional sustainable development. The study analyzed four farms that integrated fish farming with other agricultural production, and in which fish ponds were fertilized either by pig manure and/or crop by-products, in two regions of the western highlands of Cameroon (5 - 7 °N, 9 - 11 °E), Alou and Fokoué.

Size-resolved concentrations of total and biological particles in indoor air were quantified in a classroom under occupied and vacant conditions. Per-occupant emission rates were estimated through a <b>mass-balance</b> modeling <b>approach,</b> and the microbial diversity of indoor and outdoor air during occupancy was determined via rDNA gene sequence analysis. Significant increases of total particle mass and bacterial genome concentrations were observed during the occupied period compared to the vacant case. These increases varied in magnitude with the particle size and ranged from 3 to 68 times for total mass, 12 - 2700 times for bacterial genomes, and 1. 5 - 5. 2 times for fungal genomes. Emission rates per person-hour because of occupancy were 31 mg, 37 × 10 6 genome copies, and 7. 3 × 10 6 genome copies for total particle mass, bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Of the bacterial emissions, ~ 18 % are from taxa that are closely associated with the human skin microbiome.

Parallel study of silica cycling revealed that tidal marshes act as biogenic Si recycling surfaces, importing biogenic Si while exporting dissolved Si. Export of dissolved Si is greatest during summer and spring, when dissolved Si concentrations in inundating waters are depleted by diatoms. Tidal marshes thus buffer estuarine dissolved Si in times of limitation. We can conclude that the studied marsh had an increasing effect on the Si:N ratio in flooding waters.

40|$|Various {{complementary}} {{techniques were}} used to investigate the stormflow generating processes in a small headwater catchment in northeastern Puerto Rico. Over 100 samples were taken of soil matrix water, macropore flow, streamflow and precipitation, mainly during two storms of contrasting magnitude, {{for the analysis of}} calcium, magnesium, silicon, potassium, sodium and chloride. These were combined with hydrometric information on streamflow, return flow, precipitation, throughfall and soil moisture to distinguish water following different flow paths. Geo-electric sounding was used to survey the subsurface structure of the catchment, revealing a weathering front that coincided with the elevation of the stream channel instead of running parallel to surface topography. The hydrometric data were used in combination with soil physical data, a one-dimensional soil water model (VAMPS) and a three-component chemical mass-balance mixing model to describe the stormflow response of the catchment. It is inferred that most stormflow travelled through macropores in the top 20 cm of the soil profile. During a large event, saturation overland flow also accounted for a considerable portion of the stormflow, although {{it was not possible to}} quantify the associated volume fully. Although the <b>mass-balance</b> mixing model <b>approach</b> gave valuable information about the various flow paths within the catchment, it was not possible to distill the full picture from the model alone; additional hydrometric and soil physical evidence was needed to aid in the interpretation of the model results. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{combined}} mass-balance {{and stable}} isotope approach {{was set up}} to identify and quantify dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources in a DOC-rich (9 mg L- 1) eutrophic reservoir located in Western France and used for drinking water supply (so-called Rophemel reservoir). The <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> consisted in measuring the flux of allochthonous DOC on a daily basis, and in comparing it with the effective (measured) DOC concentration of the reservoir. The isotopic approach consisted, for its part, in measuring the carbon isotope ratios (d 13 C values) of both allochthonous and autochthonous DOC sources, and comparing these values with the d 13 C values of the reservoir DOC. Results from both approaches were consistent pointing out for a DOC of 100 % allochthonous origin. In particular, the d 13 C values of the DOC recovered in the reservoir (- 28. 5 ± 0. 2 ‰; n = 22) during the algal bloom season (May-September) showed no trace of an autochthonous contribution (d 13 C in algae = - 30. 1 ± 0. 3 ‰; n = 2) being indistinguishable from the d 13 C values of allochthonous DOC from inflowing rivers (- 28. 6 ± 0. 1 ‰; n = 8). These results demonstrate that eutrophication is not responsible for the high DOC concentrations observed in the Rophemel reservoir and that limiting eutrophication of this reservoir will not reduce the potential formation of disinfection by-products during water treatment.

Estimation of KEN has been constrained by various uncertainties including potential microbial immobilisation. We developed a <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> to quantify changes in microbial N storage during nutrient-amended incubation, in which microbial uptake is determined as the residual in a ‘mass-balance’ based on soil-water N before and after amended incubation. The approach was applied to three sandy soils of southwestern Australia, to determine microbial N immobilisation during 5 -day incubation in response to supply of 2. 323 mg C g− 1, 100 μg N g− 1 and 20 μg P g− 1. The net N immobilisation {{was estimated to be}} 95 – 114 μg N g− 1 in the three soils, equivalent to 82. 7 – 85. 1 % of soil-water N following the amendment. Such estimation for microbial uptake does not depend on fumigation and KEN conversion, but for comparison purposes we estimated ‘nominal’ KEN values (0. 11 – 0. 14) for the three soils, which were comparable to previously reported KEN from soils receiving C and N amendment. The accuracy of our approach depends on the mass-balance equation and the integrated measurement errors of the multiple N pools, and was assessed practically through recoveries of added-N when microbial uptake can be minimised. Near-satisfactory recoveries were achieved under such conditions. Our <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> provides information not only about changes in the microbial biomass nitrogen storage, but also major N-pools and their fluxes in regulating soil N concentrations under substrate and nutrient amended conditions...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of carbon pathways in New Zealand streams {{was carried out}} using a multi-faceted, experimental approach. A series of research projects, presented as individual papers, was conducted with special emphasis on consumer processing. Breakdown of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortiodes) enclosed in coarse-mesh (3 mm) and fine-mesh (0. 2 mm) bags was studied in two physically contrasting streams. Weight losses were most rapid in coarse-mesh bags held in Middle Bush Stream, a relatively stable stream with a large shredder population. The rate of leaf breakdown in coarsemesh bags in Craigieburn Cutting Stream {{was similar to that}} In fine-mesh bags buried in both streams. Leaves in bags buried in the beds of both streams lost weight more slowly than their surface counterparts and had slightly lower protein levels and respiration rates. Larvae of the caddisfly, Zelandopsyche ingens, were primarily responsible for the rapid disappearance of beech leaves In Middle Bush Stream. Cage experiments demonstrated that larvae grew and survived equally well in both streams and the absence of Z. ingens from the Craigieburn Cutting Stream benthos was attributed to the inability of the stream to retain coarse particulate organic matter inputs. Retention appears to be the key to shredder distribution and abundance and hence is a major factor controlling litter breakdown. The development, structure and utilisation of stone surface organic layers was investigated at two field sites in dark and natural lighting conditions. In the dark at the forest site an organic layer consisting of slime, fine particles, bacteria and fungi developed and attained maximum biomass (0. 08 mg. cm- 2) in about two months. In the dark at the spring site where water was low in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOC level < 0. 5 g. m- 3) no organic layer developed whereas under conditions of natural lighting at both sites, layers were dominated by diatoms and/or filamentous algae. Laboratory experiments demonstrated the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a prerequisite for layer formation. Uptake by micro-organisms accounted for most of the reduction in levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recorded in recirculating stream channels. Radiotracer experiments (14 C and 144 Ce) showed that several common stream invertebrates could feed on "heterotrophic layers" (assimilation efficiencies 18 to 74 %) and suggested that the non-autotrophic components of stone surface organic layers are likely to playa significant role in carbon transfer to the benthos, particularly in small, shaded streams. Utilisation of allochthonous and autochthonous inputs by benthic invertebrates was investigated using stable carbon isotope analysis. The faunas of small, forested streams depended primarily on allochthonous sources of carbon whereas variable utilisation of allochthonous and autochthonous materials was shown by species from a grassland stream. Relatively depleted 13 C values obtained for the mayfly Deleatidium taken from forested sites suggest that its larvae assimilate algae selectively. A shift to greater dependence on autochthonous energy sources was shown by invertebrates from small recently clear-cut catchments (1 - 4 years) in response to canopy removal and flushing of forest-derived organic materials. Although only of a preliminary nature, my results suggest that stable carbon isotope analysis is a useful technique for providing insights into trophic linkages within stream communities. Finally, the influence of physical factors and forest type on the distribution of benthic invertebrate faunas in 43 New Zealand streams was investigated using a systematised survey technique. Several common taxa were numerically dominant at most sites regardless of forest type and both distribution of shredders and faunal diversity were related to stream stability. Implications of these findings for forest-stream management are discussed. In general, New Zealand stream ecosystems are viewed as being strongly dominated by physical factors which determine and limit the framework within. which biological communities can function.

Furthermore, elemental losses can be combined with dissolution rates to estimate the duration of chemical weathering. Knowledge of the duration of aqueous alteration will provide insight into the climate history of Mars as well as indicate the potential for microbial habitability. The Wishstone-Watchtower materials in Gusev Crater are suitable candidates for Ti-normalized mass-balance analysis because mixing relationships of these two materials indicate that Watchtower materials may be derived from Wishstone-like materials. The objectives of this work are to (1) employ Ti-normalized mass-balance to assess gains and losses from the Wishstone-Watchtower sequence and (2) to combine losses with laboratory dissolution rates to estimate alteration times of the Watchtower material...|$|E
40|$|Chemical and isotopic {{anomalies}} in mantle-derived rocks {{have been}} explained by invoking {{the presence of}} recycled oceanic crust (i. e., material of crustal origin that is incorporated into the mantle at subduction zones) in their mantle sources. Differences between the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the ingoing slab material {{and those of the}} inferred slab-derived mantle reservoirs have been attributed to processes within the subduction zone that alter the composition of the ingoing slab. However, there have been few studies that have specifically examined the composition of residual slab material {{to determine the effects of}} subduction zone processing. I used a <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> to calculate residual slab compositions at nine intraoceanic subduction zones. I calculated residual slab trace element ratios and modern isotopic characteristics of ancient subducted slabs in order to examine the feasibility of mantle evolution models that posit a major role for subducted slabs. Using my calculated residual slab compositions, I was unable to reproduce the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the mantle that have been attributed to the incorporation of recycled crustal material. Modifications to my model to account for variations in mantle wedge composition and in crustal addition rates do not significantly alter these conclusions. My results therefore indicate that subduction zone processing alone is probably insufficient to produce the chemical and isotopic characteristics of inferred mantle reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{tobacco smoke}} (ETS) is {{estimated}} to be a major contributor to indoor PM concentration and human exposures to fine particulate matter of 2. 5 microns or smaller (PM 2. 5). The Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation for Particulate Matter (SHEDS-PM) model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates distributions of outdoor and indoor PM 2. 5 exposure for a specified population based on ambient concentrations and indoor emissions sources. Because indoor exposures to ETS can be high, especially in indoor residential microenvironments, a critical assessment was conducted of the methodology and data used in SHEDS-PM for estimation of indoor exposure to ETS. For the residential microenvironment, SHEDS uses a <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> which is comparable to best practices. The default inputs in SHEDS-PM were reviewed and more recent and extensive data sources were identified. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine which inputs should be prioritized for updating. Data regarding the cigarette emission rate was found to be the most important. SHEDS-PM does not currently account for in-vehicle ETS exposure; however, in-vehicle ETS-related PM 2. 5 levels can exceed those in residential microenvironments by a factor of 10 or more. Therefore, a mass-balance based methodology for estimating in-vehicle ETS PM 2. 5 concentration is evaluated. Recommendations are made regarding updating of input data and algorithms related to ETS exposure in the SHEDS-PM model...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Northwest Laboratory and Battelle Ocean Sciences {{performed}} {{a study to}} determine the effect of cooking on polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in the fillets of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). Broiling, pan frying, and deep frying in oil were tested on fillets from 21 fish collected from New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1991. The evaluation involved estimating the change in PCB concentrations using a <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> that factored the change in fillet weight resulting from cooking with the changes in PCB concentration expressed on a precooked wet-weight basis. Deep frying in oil resulted in a 47 % reduction in total PCB levels in fillet tissue. Additionally, deep frying caused a 40 % reduction in fillet mass. Pan frying and broiling resulted in statistically in insignificant increases in total PCB levels of 15 % and 17 %, respectively. Fillet mass reductions resulting from pan frying and broiling were 7 % and 15 %, respectively. The effects of cooking on 18 individual congeners generally paralleled the results observed for total PCB. All 18 congeners were significantly reduced by deep frying. Congener Cl{sub 2 }(08) also was significantly reduced by either pan frying. Congeners Cl{sub 5 }(105) and Cl{sub 5 }(118) showed apparent significant increases in concentrations following pan frying. Congeners Cl{sub 5 }(105), Cl{sub 5 }(118), and C 1 {sub 6 }(138) showed significant increases in concentration following broiling...|$|E
40|$|Speleothems are an {{important}} archive of paleoenvironmental information but {{a thorough understanding of}} processes are necessary for their interpretation. In order to better understand speleothem records from the climatically-sensitive southwest region of WA, we have conducted a detailed eight-year monitoring study at Golgotha Cave, southwest WA. Oxygen isotopic data demonstrated that the majority of water moved through the porous Quaternary calcarenite as matrix-flow with an inferred transit time of < 1 year. A zone of high-flow dripwater is fed by high-magnitude rainfall events (Treble et al., 2013). Prior calcite precipitation (PCP) signals of increased Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in dripwater are attributed to stalactite deposition. This signal is enhanced at low-flow sites and minimised at the high-flow site as degassing and subsequent stalactite deposition are a function of drip interval. Long-term rising trends found in most solutes are attributed via a <b>mass-balance</b> <b>approach</b> to increasing forest bioproductivity, consistent with an increase in forest understorey following a low-intensity burn in 2006. A fundamental message from this study is that individual speleothem records from within Golgotha Cave will differ, e. g. speleothem δ 18 O at our high-flow site is biased to recording high-magnitude rainfall events, whilst PCP will be the main driver of speleothem Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca at low-flow sites. Forest biomass appears to be modulating transpiration-sensitive ions and these may serve as an indicator of fire history...|$|E
