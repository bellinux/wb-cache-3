5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Seacology {{launched}} its largest-ever project, a $3.4 million initiative to protect all of Sri Lanka's remaining mangrove forests and restore many degraded ones. Through Sri Lanka-based NGO Sudeesa (also {{known as the}} Small Fishers Federation of Lanka), Seacology is funding a significant expansion of that organization's existing microloan and job-training programs. In exchange, the beneficiaries of these programs <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> assist in protecting their local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women in these communities alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that {{has contributed to the}} forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E

The decision to liquidate is made by a board resolution, but instigated by the director(s). 75 percent of the company's shareholders <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> liquidate for liquidation proceedings to advance. If a limited company’s liabilities outweigh its assets, or the company cannot pay its bills when they fall due, the company becomes insolvent.|$|E

25|$|The land {{over which}} {{railways}} pass may have many owners—private, rail operator, or governmental—and, {{depending on the}} terms under which it was originally acquired, the type of operating rights may also vary. Without rail banking, on closure, some parts of a railway's route might otherwise revert to the former owner. The owner could reuse them for any purpose, or modify the ground conditions, potentially prejudicing the line's future reuse if required. However, the landowner <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> keep the infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels intact.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, an {{easement}} {{in gross}} benefits an individual or a legal entity, rather than a dominant estate. The easement can be for a personal use (for example, an easement to use a boat ramp) or a commercial use (for example, an easement to a railroad company to build and maintain a rail line across property). Historically, an {{easement in gross}} was neither assignable nor inheritable, but commercial easements are now freely transferable to a third party. They are divisible but must be exclusive (the original owner no longer uses it and exclusive to easement holder) and all holders of the easement <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> divide. If subdivided, each subdivided parcel enjoys the easement.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2012, the President of South Korea, Lee Myung-Bak, {{visited the}} Liancourt Rocks, {{which made him}} the first South Korean {{president}} to do so. Japan temporarily withdrew its ambassador to South Korea, Masatoshi Muto, and Minister for Foreign Affairs Kōichirō Gemba summoned the South Korean ambassador to file a complaint and threatened to lodge a case with the International Court of Justice, (ICJ) which was rejected by South Korea. It could do so because both countries {{party to a dispute}} <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> such ICJ cases. It was the first time for Japan to make such a move in 47 years, since Japan and South Korea officially re-established relations in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Once a bill is {{approved}} by one house, it {{is sent to}} the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> identical versions of the bill. If the second house amends the bill, then {{the differences between the two}} versions must be reconciled in a conference committee, an ad hoc committee that includes both senators and representatives sometimes by using a reconciliation process to limit budget bills. Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as pay-as-you-go or paygo which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits. If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.|$|E

Porter Airlines and Ports Toronto had hoped that the government would not follow through on its promise, and asked for the Government of Canada to wait until studies were complete. Pratt & Whitney noted that the CS100 would have been quieter compared to the existing turboprop aircraft currently used at the airport. On December 8, Ports Toronto announced it would not complete the expansion proposal reports for Council, ending work after any current technical studies were complete.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{law also}} allows for organ {{donation}} from deceased individuals. In 2013 organs were taken from 36 deceased individuals. Everyone who applies for a driver's licence in New Zealand indicates {{whether or not they}} wish to be a donor if they die in circumstances that would allow for donation. The question is required to be answered for the application to be processed, meaning that the individual must answer yes or no, and does not have the option of leaving it unanswered. However, the answer given on the drivers license does not constitute informed consent, because at the time of drivers license application not all individuals are equipped to make an informed decision regarding whether to be a donor, and it is therefore not the deciding factor in whether donation is carried out or not. It is there to simply give indication of the person's wishes. Family <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> the procedure for donation to take place.|$|E
500|$|The process differs {{greatly from}} that of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Hollywood version allows only celebrities of the silver screen, television, radio, live theatre and singers/musicians, while Canada's Walk allows people of more diverse occupations, as listed above. While most celebrities on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are American or have {{achieved}} their fame in the United States, Canada's Walk of Fame is exclusive to Canadians. For someone to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they must be nominated by a sponsor who <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> field the approximately $25,000 cost of installing a star. From there, the names are submitted to a nominating committee of five people, who pick 10–15 names to award stars to annually.

500|$|The {{journey from}} {{deciding}} {{to burn the}} money to deciding how to burn the money to actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed To The Wall to the Tate Gallery as the [...] "1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation." [...] The condition was that the gallery <b>must</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, {{the money would be}} burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, [...] "the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF 'guerrilla communication' style, [...] "posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed To The Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt." ...|$|E
