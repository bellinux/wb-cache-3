5|$|Following its {{tour in the}} Mediterranean, No.78 Wing was reorganised at Williamtown. On 16March 1955, {{the wing}} {{headquarters}} was re-formed, and Nos.76 and 378 Squadrons were disbanded. No.75 Squadron remained with the wing, augmented on 21March by Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons. On 1April, No.478 Squadron absorbed the <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> of No.77 Squadron. Nos.75 and 77 Squadrons initially operated Meteors from Williamtown and No.3 Squadron was based at RAAF Station Canberra, where it flew P-51D Mustangs. By November 1956 the wing had re-equipped with CAC Sabres {{and all of its}} units were stationed at Williamtown.|$|E
5|$|In Januaryâ€“February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian {{and other}} foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-Qantas Boeing 707s, handing them over to No.33 Flight (later No.33 Squadron) {{at the beginning of}} 1981. No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles on John Paul II's 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's Entombed Warriors. In February 1987, the unit again joined No.36 Squadron, along with No.33 Squadron, as part of a re-formed No.86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group). The following year, No.37 Squadron achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours on the Hercules. The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C-130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines. In December 1990 and January 1991, a detachment of C-130s from Nos.36 and 37Squadrons flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War. No.37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace in January 1993, and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May. No.486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998, having transferred its C-130 <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions</b> to Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons. No.37 Squadron began re-equipping with new-model C-130J Hercules in September 1999. Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C-130s supporting INTERFET forces in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000, under Operation Warden. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001, the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C-130J. Five C-130s of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons participated in relief efforts following the Bali bombings in October 2002.|$|E

40|$|The <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> is an {{important}} part of any organization that possesses tangible assets. Whether it is machinery, buildings, equipment, or others, maintenance of these assets are vital to enable them to deliver as intended. In this thesis the focus is on maintenance of industrial production machinery and equipment. The literature on the topic of industrial maintenance is extensive, and there are lots of different frameworks and strategies proposed to enhance the performance of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> In this thesis the model of the Maintenance Loop, developed by the Norwegian Oil Directorate in the late 90 s, are used to assess the performance of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> at Benteler Automotive Farsund. The model divide the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> into 11 elements. For these 11 elements, the current status, problems and challenges, and finally, improvement potentials and future goals were identified. The results show that a thorough review of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> like the one performed in this thesis will reveal much information and several minor improvement potentials not visible by the naked eye. From the results of this thesis it can also be seen clearly how important it is to have a properly <b>functioning</b> Computerized <b>Maintenance</b> Management System (CMMS) at hand, and how important good communication is to be able to work efficiently...|$|R

25|$|After {{the closure}} of the main works, part of the {{workshop}} was used for the building of Isetta microcars between 1957 and 1964 and some of the land remained in railway use, associated with the stabling of electric multiple unit trains and other <b>maintenance</b> <b>functions.</b> Much of the land later became a large open car park, and was used for a popular market every Sunday morning. Some land on the eastern side was given over to an assortment of retail units including a number of car dealers with temporary structures being the predominant building type, and a strip below the yard was used for retail premises; behind these remained the stone and brick columns over which the yard had been extended when space was at a premium. Much of the land which was not suitable for use either by lock-up traders or for car parking or still in use by British Rail was left derelict. The final traces of the locomotive works vanished with the demolition of the elevated 1930s Southern Railway signal box in the mid-1980s, the signal box having used part of the main locomotive erecting-shop wall as support.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and competitiveness of manufacturing companies {{is dependent on}} the reliability, availability and productivity of their production facilities. To ensure the plant achieves the desired performance, maintenance managers need a good track of performance on maintenance process and maintenance results. This can be attained through development and implementation of a rigorously defined performance measurement framework and indicators that are able to measure important elements of <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> performance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that performance indicators are not defined in isolation, but should be the result of a careful analysis of the interaction of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> with other organisational functions, most evidently with the production function. In this paper, a conceptual framework that provide guidelines for choosing <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> performance indicators is proposed. It seeks to align maintenance objectives with manufacturing and corporate objectives, and provides a link between the maintenance objectives, maintenance process/efforts and maintenance results. Based on this conceptual framework, performance indicators of the maintenance process and maintenance results are identified for each category. Maintenance Performance measurement Indicators...|$|R

40|$|Thermoelectric {{power plants}} {{consist of a}} set of {{critical}} equipment that require high levels of availability and reliability. Due to this, maintenance of these physical assets is gaining momentum in industry. Maintenance is considered as an activity that contributes to improving the availability, efficiency and productivity of each piece of equipment. Several techniques have been used to achieve greater efficiencies in maintenance, among which we can find the lean maintenance philosophy. Despite the wide diffusion of lean maintenance, there is no structured method that supports the prescription of lean tools applied to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> This paper presents the experience gathered in two lean maintenance projects in thermoelectric power plants. The application of lean techniques was based on using a previously developed multicriterial decision making process that uses the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to carry out a diagnosis and prescription tasks. That methodology allowed the prescription of the appropriated lean techniques to resolve the main deficiencies in <b>maintenance</b> <b>function.</b> The results of applying such lean tools show that important results can be obtained, making the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> in thermoelectric power plants more efficient and lean...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} the {{management}} process of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> of companies depending {{on the degree of}} organization maturity concerning maintenance. Maintenance management makes use of some tools and techniques to improve efficiency and minimize the impacts of unplanned stoppages, such as Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The identification of the degree of maturity on maintenance, leads us to a better planning of actions to implement the more appropriate management strategy and to propose suitable computerized tools, performance indicators, technical analysis and management tools and techniques, providing a set of potential improvements necessary for the successful evolution of the maintenance process and the resulting progress in the maintenance maturity level. Understanding the aspects which define the degree of maturity of an organization may not be an easy task. In this paper, a study of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> of some companies was carried out in order to define their maturity levels regarding maintenance. A maturity model is also proposed for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>function</b> through the definition of dimensions and levels.
