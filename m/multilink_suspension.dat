50|$|The 1999 Cougar {{shared the}} Ford CDW27 world-car {{platform}} {{introduced by the}} Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique. The first front-wheel drive Cougar, it was designed with fully independent <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is costly}} and complex. It is also {{difficult}} to tune the geometry without a full 3D {{computer aided design}} analysis. Compliance under load can have an important effect and must be checked using a multibody simulation software.|$|E
50|$|The F10/F11/F07 is {{the sixth}} {{generation}} 5 Series, produced from 2010-2016. The platform {{is based on}} the F01 7 Series; improvements include a front dual ball joint short-long arm suspension (replacing the MacPherson strut suspensions BMW previously used), and a rear <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Other updates for 2014 {{include an}} {{independent}} <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> {{as found in}} European counterparts, and electronic power steering (1.8 TSI models only.) ...|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, {{although}} not {{equipped with an}} engine, the Di√†logos is said to feature an active differential and adjustable drive-torque distribution to both axles as well as advanced <b>multilink</b> <b>suspensions.</b> For example, the front suspension uses a virtual steering axis, with the said axis passing {{through the center of}} the front wheels thus claimed to result in potholes or uneven surfaces not causing the wheel to vibrate or turn. The rear suspension too uses a virtual pitch center such that, when riding over an obstacle, the wheel moves back to reduce interference transmitted to the body.|$|R
50|$|All models {{now come}} {{standard}} with ABS (Anti-Lock Brake Systems), VSA (Vehicle Stability Assistance) and EBD (Electronic Brake Distribution). Further improvements include a new <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> to further reduce road feel on particularly battered roads and highways.|$|R
50|$|Available in 3-door {{hatchback}} (model code E81), 5-door hatchback (E87), coupe (E82) and 2-door convertible (E88) body styles, the 1 Series {{features a}} rear-wheel drive chassis, 50:50 weight balance, longitudinally-mounted engine and aluminum <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> {{as well as}} a range of petrol and diesel engines. The 1 Series accounted for nearly one-fifth of the total BMW sales in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The Q45 was {{no longer}} {{exported}} to the USA after 2006, being unintentionally replaced by a newly redesigned M35 and M45. While the M45 has a shorter length than the Q45, it boasts more interior room, greater performance, a superior rear <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> and front double wishbone, and much friendlier ergonomics, so it succeeded the Q45 as Infiniti's flagship.|$|E
50|$|While being 177 mm shorter on {{the outside}} than the last {{flagship}} Q45 at 5069 mm, the M boasts more interior space, greater performance, a superior rear <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> and front double wishbone, and friendlier ergonomics due to its 30 mm longer wheelbase. The Q45 was no longer imported from Japan after the 2006 model year, making the M45 the flagship car of the Infiniti marque.|$|E
50|$|The chassis with MacPherson strut {{front and}} <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> was {{common to all}} S13 and RS13 models. The European 200SX {{initially}} had 257mm front brakes and rear disc service brakes with drum parking brakes in the rotor hubs. Later models had larger 280mm front brakes.|$|R
50|$|The E51 Elgrand uses {{either the}} 2.5l or 3.5l V6 VQ-series engine {{combined}} with a five-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic shift for better response. Additional transmission controls include Power and Snow settings, as well as 4x4 power options. It employs a <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> with ventilated disc brakes all around.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} revised bodywork, {{mechanically}} the 993 also featured an all-new <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely {{derived from the}} stillborn Porsche 989's rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.|$|R
5000|$|The Dart uses {{a similar}} {{suspension}} system {{to that of}} the Alfa Romeo Giulietta: in front it has independent MacPherson struts, coil springs, twin-tube dampers, stabilizer bar and in the rear it has independent <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension.</b> According to Dart chief engineer the suspension is slightly softened compared with the Alfa, [...] "We've taken a little edge off it," [...] "It's a blast to toss around." ...|$|E
5000|$|All E36 saloons, coupes, and estates {{employed}} the [...] "Z-axle" [...] <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> {{in the rear}} which had been proven in the Z1. The hatchback body style (known as the [...] "E36/5" [...] or [...] "BMW Compact") used a rear semi-trailing arm suspension based on the older E30 (also found in the Z3 and M Coupe), instead of the [...] "Z-Axle" [...] Multilink employed in all other E36's. This was done {{in order to save}} space due to its truncated rear end.|$|E
50|$|A {{semi-trailing}} {{arm suspension}} is a supple {{independent rear suspension}} system for automobiles where each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground. Trailing-arm and <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> designs are much more commonly used for the rear wheels of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room. Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front suspension and trailing-arm rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The Cadenza {{uses the}} new {{front-wheel-drive}} Type-N platform with MacPherson front <b>suspension</b> and a <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> Cadenza {{will be offered}} with three gasoline engines ranging from 165 horsepower to 290 horsepower for the 3.5-liter Lambda, included the new 2.4-liter Theta II with gasoline direct injection (GDI) and 201 horsepower. A hybrid K7 700h is available in Korea, with a 159 hp four cylinder and a 35 kW electric motor.|$|R
50|$|Later {{versions}} had a <b>multilink</b> independent rear <b>suspension,</b> {{and were}} front-wheel drive or 4WD. The most popular version was the 2.3 diesel engine version {{and it was}} unusual in that it had eight seats instead of the expected seven.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{unveiled}} at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. The GranTurismo has a drag coefficient of 0.33. The standard version has a 4.2 litre (...) V8 engine designed {{in conjunction with}} Ferrari with [...] and automatic ZF gearbox six-speed transmission. The 2+2 body has been derived from the Maserati Quattroporte V, with double-wishbone front <b>suspensions</b> and a <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The car is a GT (Grand Tourer) that emphasizes comfort in harmony with speed and driver-enjoyment.|$|R
5000|$|This {{generation}} of Cougar had {{a far more}} contemporary package, with modern DOHC 24-valve six-cylinder Duratec engines, a fully independent <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension,</b> and front-wheel drive. This {{was also the first}} hatchback Cougar, and the first to have its own body, unshared by any Ford (except its European twin Ford Cougar). The body design used a philosophy Ford dubbed [...] "New Edge" [...] design: a combination of organic upper body lines with sharp, concave creases in the lower areas. The Cougar's body, and the New Edge idea in general, was introduced as a concept called the Mercury MC2 in 1997, and was considered a bigger version of the European Ford Puma.|$|E
5000|$|Torque steer is the {{tendency}} for some front-wheel-drive cars to pull {{to the left or}} right under hard acceleration. It {{is a result of the}} offset between the point about which the wheel steers (it is aligned with the points where the wheel is connected to the steering mechanisms) and the centroid of its contact patch. The tractive force acts through the centroid of the contact patch, and the offset of the steering point means that a turning moment about the axis of steering is generated. In an ideal situation, the left and right wheels would generate equal and opposite moments, canceling each other out; however, in reality, this is less likely to happen. Torque steer can be addressed by using a longitudinal layout, equal length drive shafts, half shafts, a <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> or centre-point steering geometry.|$|E
50|$|The S13 {{was known}} for sharp {{steering}} and handling (thanks to front MacPherson struts and a rear <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension)</b> and relatively light weight (2700 lb) but was regarded in the automotive press as being underpowered. The engine, while durable and relatively torquey, was a heavy iron-block truck unit that produced meager power for its relatively large size. It was only modestly improved by the change to the DOHC version in 1991. Furthermore, despite the modest power output and relatively low vehicle weight, gas mileage was mediocre. These engines are the primary difference between the North American 240SX and the world-market Silvia/180SX/200SX. The KA24DE did not come turbocharged while the SR20DET did. The U.S. version {{was regarded as a}} highly capable sports car that only needed a better engine. Other differences include a standard limited slip differential on overseas and Canadian models, available digital climate control in Japan, and manual seat belts standard in Japan and Canada vs. automatic restraint seatbelts in America.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{approach}} is usually use {{as the way}} to develop or modify suspension system to obtain maximum ride comfort and handling characteristic. This {{approach is}} a time consuming process, costly, and may not guarantee the optimum solution. In this paper, a half-car body of actual suspension system based on PROTON WRM 44 P 0 - 34 was model using multi-dynamic software, MSC/ADAMS-Car. There were total of 10 components for each front McPherson strut and rear <b>Multilink</b> <b>suspensions</b> that consist of different joint types and degree of freedom. The model were develop by defining the location of hard-point or coordinate before specific all the component characteristic and joint type. The complete suspension model is simulated using vertical-parallel and vertical-oppose movement test on MSC/ADAMS Car, same with the actual experimental parameter setup. The kinematic and compliance (K&C) of simulation is compared with the experimental data to verify the suspension model. It is expected that simulated and experimental produce the identical data pattern with very minimal percentage error. Further investigation {{can be done to}} improve or optimize the performance of the suspension system once the model is verified...|$|R
5000|$|Front axle = MacPherson struts, {{wishbones}} Rear axle = <b>Multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> with uniball joints Dampers/springs = ZF Sachs dampers with H&R springs, one-way adjustable Anti-roll bars = Adjustable H&R anti-roll bars, {{front and}} rear Steering = Electro-mechanically assisted {{rack and pinion steering}} Braking system = Ventilated 4-piston fixed-calliper disc brakes, front (√Ü 356 mm), single-piston sliding-calliper disc brakes, rear(√Ü 282 mm), racing ABS Wheels = ATS light alloy rims, size 9 x 18 inches Tyres = Dunlop 240/640/18 (slick and rain tyres) ...|$|R
50|$|Aluminum {{is used in}} the body, hood, {{trunk lid}} and is also used in the doors {{internally}} to reduce weight. The front suspension uses a double wishbone setup, also to reduce unsprung weight, and to improve vehicle handling. This type of suspension was previously used on the Cedric/Gloria until 1983, when that platform began to use MacPherson struts for the front suspension, but still uses the <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> which was introduced on the Cedric/Gloria in 1979. The Fuga uses aluminum alloy extensively in both the front and rear suspension components.|$|R
50|$|Developed in Turin, Italy, the Compact {{platform}} {{was designed}} to adapt to future cars of both the Fiat and Chrysler group. Fiat engineers used the C-platform (used by Fiat Stilo, Bravo and Lancia Delta) {{as a starting point}} and developed a new high-performance platform that uses only a central part of the floor from the old C-platform. The frame composition is 84% high-strength steel (as opposed to the old C-platform, 65% of which was high-strength steel) and 4% aluminum. The front suspension uses MacPherson aluminum Evo struts and is 4 kg lighter than the previous steel struts (used in Fiat Bravo). The rear suspension uses an independent <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> and each of them consists of two lateral links with an aluminum longitudinal arm that mounts the hub and spring. Using aluminium rather than steel, which has a higher density, enabled a total combined weight-savings in the suspension bits of 14 kilograms. The framework for the rear seats and the magnesium alloy cross member reduced weight by 35% in comparison to earlier cars.|$|E
50|$|The LC {{interior}} is {{split into two}} zones ‚Äî the driver side has access to functionality, while the passenger side is shielded and much simpler. The center of the interior experience is the steering wheel, which has a varying circumference to accommodate for different driving styles. In order to allow for easier grip and improve the feel, the paddle shifters are made from magnesium alloy. The 8-inch Thin Film Transistor LCD circular dial embedded in the instrument panel is a direct descendent of the LFA design ‚Äî it moves side-to-side as the driver moves through the various menus and settings, and the appearance will change depending on the selected drive mode. Also borrowed from the LFA is the Drive Mode Select control, which is placed {{to the side of}} the instrument panel.The LC is the first car to be developed on the new Lexus front-engine/rear-wheel drive platform, dubbed the Global Architecture - Luxury (GA-L) platform. The GA-L platform will serve as the starting point for all future rear-wheel drive Lexus vehicles of the future, and it‚Äôs meant to provide lower overall mass, improved front/rear weight distribution (54/46 front/rear balance for the gas model, 52/48 for the hybrid), and a low center of gravity. The platform design allowed engineers to push the wheels out further towards the corners of the vehicle, reducing the height of the hood while still accommodating the new <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension.</b> The engine position is also lowered 10 mm and pushed 50 mm closer to the center of the vehicle ‚Äî this centers the weight of the engine and brings it closer to the drive, mitigating the load shifting from side to side. Run-flat tires are also used to avoid the need for a spare, and the vehicle battery has been relocated to the trunk to help with the overall balance.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} (or [...] "2G") Eagle Talon {{was introduced in}} 1995 simultaneously with its Mitsubishi Eclipse counterpart, while the Plymouth Laser model was eliminated. Mechanically, the new Talon and Eclipse models were almost identical with the engines in the turbocharged versions receiving a modest increase in output thanks to a redesigned intake and exhaust, higher 8.5:1 (vs. 7.8:1) compression pistons, and new turbocharger. The new T25 turbocharger, provided by Garrett, had boost increased to 12 psi of peak boost and was smaller than the previous Mitsubishi built 14b turbo that was on 1G models. The T25 did spool up faster than the previous turbocharger {{in order to increase}} the turbo response or reduce turbo lag. The other important change concerned the suspension. While the 1G had MacPherson struts in the front, the 2G had double-wishbone in the front and <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> in the rear. The double wishbone suspension gave the 2G a much better roll-camber curve in the front, allowing for much better handling.From an aesthetic standpoint, the differences between the Eagle Talon car and its Mitsubishi equivalent were somewhat more substantial than exhibited in the first generation models. These differences were most obvious {{at the rear of the}} car. For example, the rear fascia of the Talon featured a bumper cap with a dip in the middle to allow for a high-mounted rear license plate; rear light clusters incorporating amber turn signals (the Eclipse used red turn signals); reverse lights as part of the main rear tail light clusters (the Eclipse's reverse lights were mounted separately and lower around the mid-mounted license plate); and a sickle-shaped rear spoiler for the TSi and TSi AWD version mounted at the base of the rear window that was painted black regardless of body color (the Eclipse used a body colored, conventional [...] "basket handle" [...] spoiler mounted on the rear deck). Other differences included the air intake beneath the front bumper, which did not have a body-colored splitter (minor difference), and the absence of side skirts. Also, the hard-top Talon featured a black roof while the Eclipse had a body colored top.|$|E
50|$|The B5 {{platform}} {{employs a}} longitudinal engine placement, which {{differs from the}} Volkswagen Group A platform which have been traditionally transversely mounted. This platform (also known as PL45) was introduced with the first-generation Audi A4 and the 1996 Volkswagen Passat. B5 platform cars can be equipped with a <b>multilink</b> front <b>suspension</b> and a Torsen centre differential for quattro or 4motion branded four-wheel drive systems. A long-wheelbase derivative of this platform - originally designed for the Chinese market and {{being used in the}} 1999 Volkswagen Passat Lingyu, but ultimately being used for its rebadged version under the ≈†koda brand, the 2002 ≈†koda Superb - is referred to as PL45+.|$|R
50|$|The independent, {{multiple}} {{arm rear}} suspension comprises quadrilateral geometry with an upper triangle, double lower arms, coil springs and anti-roll bar secured to a light alloy subframe which is, in turn, mounted onto the car's body. The design of this geometry, {{and the fine}} tuning of the bushes, is such that during initial stages of a turn, the centrifugal forces create a small 'rear wheel steer' effect {{in the opposite direction}} to the way the front wheels are being pointed. Then, as the centrifugal forces build up through the corner, the rear wheels start steering {{in the same direction as}} the front wheels. The result is a more positive 'attack' into the first stages of cornering and increased stability in the later stages. This <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> was designed by Gianclaudio Travaglio.|$|R
5000|$|The 2003-2004 Pilots {{featured}} the J35A4 motor, an aluminum-alloy 3.5L V6 producing 240 HP and 242 lb-ft of torque. The 2005 Pilot received a new engine, the J35A6, which featured drive-by-wire throttle and produced 255 HP and 250 lb-ft of torque. Refreshed 2006-2008 Pilots came {{with either the}} J35Z1 (FWD) or the J35A9 (4WD). Both engines are rated at 244 HP and 240 lb-ft of torque. Refreshed FWD models feature Honda's Variable Cylinder Management system, which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy. All Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pilot has front struts with a coil-spring, <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension</b> for a flat rear load floor. Front track is 66.3 in and 66.5 in at the rear. The Pilot has a 4500 lb boat/3500 lb trailer towing capability with the optional dealer installed towing package.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> {{analysis}} aimed {{to improve the}} performances in terms of car handling or comfort, by acting on {{the components of the}} suspension itself. In particular the analysis focuses on the effects produced on the suspension characteristic curves by some modifications in rods length. The technique can be adopted in the design phase of a <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> to obtain a desired characteristic, in terms of camber or steering, by optimizing the proper length of each single rod...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of kinematic points of rear <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> using 3 D optical scanners TRITOP and ATOS and developing a measurement methodology of similar types of suspension with these scanners.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between the <b>multilink</b> <b>suspension</b> system of an open-wheeled race car and the vehicle's aerodynamic performance are modeled and optimized. The closed-kinematic loops associated with the suspension mechanisms are modeled {{as a set of}} nonlinear equations that are derived using a first principle kinematic analysis. For the purpose of optimal control calculations, the solutions to these equations are approximated by multivariate polynomials in the normal tire forces. It is shown that the car's suspension motion can {{have a significant impact on}} the aerodynamic performance of the vehicle. Optimal control calculations are used to illustrate the impact of aero-suspension interactions and adjustments on the lap-time performance of the car...|$|E
5000|$|Both {{cars were}} {{designed}} by Enrico Fumia at Pininfarina. The GTV was planned to re-establish the sporty coupe tradition of Alfa Romeo for the 1990s. The design dates back to initial renderings of September 1987 and first clay models to complete 1:1 scale model in July 1988. After Vittorio Ghidella (Fiat CEO) accepted the design, Alfa Romeo Centro Stile under Walter de Silva {{was responsible for the}} completion of the detail work and also for the design of the interiors, as Pininfarina's proposal was not accepted. The Spider and GTV were based on the then-current Fiat Group compact car platform, called [...] "Tipo Due" [...] (or Type 2), in this case a heavily modified version with an all new <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The front suspension and drivetrain was based on the 1992 Alfa Romeo 155 saloon. Chief engineer at that time was Bruno Cena. Drag coefficient was 0.33 for the GTV and 0.38 for the Spider.|$|R
5000|$|The SRT4 {{hatchback}} {{competed with}} the Volkswagen GTI and the Mazdaspeed3. It featured a 2.4 L DOHC 16V turbocharged I4 with dual {{variable valve timing}} (DVVT). The engine produces [...] at 6,400 rpm, and 265 lb.ft Nm of torque at 5,600 rpm using the TD04HL4S-20 turbo. Edmunds.com tested a Caliber SRT4 on a chassis dynamometer and obtained [...] and 261 lb.ft Nm of torque at the wheels. Edmunds called the manufacturer's rating conservative; putting more power to the road than cars costing twice as much. This engine is mated to a Getrag six-speed manual transmission, and utilizes a front-wheel drive drivetrain. The Caliber SRT4 utilizes a MacPherson strut front <b>suspension,</b> and a <b>multilink</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The SRT4 came with large 13.4 in vented front disc brakes (from the Dodge Charger Police Pack version) with dual-piston calipers and 11.9 in rear single-piston disc brakes. It also featured four-wheel ABS, with electronic assistance. The wheels are 19 in, five-spoke, SRT-stamped, painted aluminum and equipped with Goodyear RSA 225/45R19 tires. Package options included polished aluminum wheels, Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires, SIRIUS satellite radio with Kicker SRT livin' loud audio, EVIC with performance pages, security alarm, and optional paint colors.|$|R
40|$|Many {{automobile}} manufacturers are switching to Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems for their better performance and cost advantages over traditional Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) systems. EPS compared to HPS offer lower energy consumption, lower total weight, and package flexibility {{at no cost}} penalty. Furthermore, since EPS systems can provide assistance to drivers independent of the vehicle driving conditions, new technologies can be implemented to improve the steering feel and safety, simultaneously. In this thesis, a neuromusculoskeletal driver and a high-fidelity vehicle model are developed in MapleSim to provide realistic simulations to study the driver-vehicle interactions and EPS systems. The vehicle model consists of MacPherson and <b>multilink</b> <b>suspensions</b> at front and rear equipped with a column-type EPS system. The driver model is a fully neuromusculoskeletal model of a driver arm holding the steering wheel, controlled by the driver's central nervous system. A hierarchical approach is used to capture {{the complexity of the}} neuromuscular dynamics and the central nervous system in the coordination of the driver's upper extremity activities. The proposed motor control framework has three layers: the first layer, or the path-planning layer, plans a desired vehicle trajectory and the required steering angles to perform the desired trajectory, the second layer (or the force distribution controller) actuates the musculoskeletal arm, and the final layer is added to ensure the precision control and disturbance rejection of the motor control units. The overall goal of this thesis is to study vehicle-driver interactions and to design a model-based EPS controller that considers the driver's characteristics. To design such an EPS controller, the high-fidelity driver-vehicle model is simplified to reduce the computational burden associated with the multibody and biomechanical systems. Then, four driver types are introduced based on the physical characteristics of drivers such as age and gender, and the corresponding parameters are incorporated in the model. Last but not least, a new model-based EPS controller is developed to provide appropriate assistance to each of the predefined driver types. To do this, the characteristic curves are tuned using a systematic optimization procedure to provide appropriate assistance to drivers with different physical strength, {{in order to have a}} similar road and steering feel. In this thesis, it is recommended that muscle fatigue be used as a measure of steering feel. Then, based on the tuned EPS characteristic curves, an observer-based optimal disturbance rejection controller, consisting of a linear quadratic regulator controller and a Kalman filter observer augmented with a shaping filter, is developed to deliver the assistance while attenuating external disturbances. The results show that it is possible to develop a model-based EPS controller that is optimized for a given driver population...|$|R
