50|$|The {{uprising}} {{seemed to}} draw an ambivalent {{reaction from the}} Iraqi population, which {{for the most part}} neither joined nor resisted the rebels. Many Iraqi security forces melted away, wishing to avoid confrontation. In a sign of <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army's</b> unpopularity in Najaf, however, which follows more traditionalist clerics, a small covert movement sprung up to launch attacks on the militants. The uprising did receive a good deal of support from Shiite radicals in Baghdad, however, who were galvanized by the simultaneous siege of the city of Fallujah.|$|R

They were slaughtered as they stood. Hicks Pasha and a band of officers rode right into the midst of the Mahdists, and died fighting there. There were, I heard, two or three Kaffirs with him, besides many Egyptian officers. The black troops fought splendidly, but the Egyptians made a poor stand; but it came to the same in the end.

25|$|Qais al-Khazali {{split from}} Muqtada al-Sadr's <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> after the Shi'a {{uprising}} in 2004 {{to create his}} own Khazali network. When the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> signed a cease-fire {{with the government and}} the Americans and the fighting stopped, Qais al-Khazali continued fighting, and during the battle Khazali was already issuing his own orders to militiamen without Muqtada al-Sadr's approval. The group's leadership (which includes Qais Khazali, Abd al-Hadi al-Darraji (a politician in Muqtada al-Sadr's Sadr Movement) and Akram al-Kaabi), however, reconciled with al-Sadr in mid-2005. In July 2006, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq was founded and became one of the Special Groups which operated more independently {{from the rest of the}} <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army.</b> It became a completely independent organisation after the Mahdi Army's disbanding after the 2008 Shi'a uprising. In November 2008 when Sadr created the Promised Day Brigade to succeed the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army,</b> he asked AAH (and other Special Groups) to join, but they declined.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> {{occasionally}} shelled the Green Zone, {{the central}} seat of Coalition power in Iraq, with mortars and rockets from the district.

The NCO was Sergeant Ironside (Mainwaring), a vulgar, foul-mouthed bully who kept yelling abuse at the men. There was also a young merry joking Cockney, Private Green (Walker). As they traveled through the desert, they met an old fakir (Godfrey), who warned them that when the sun sets, they would all be dead. When Ironside gave him [...] "a mouthful of coarse abuse", the fakir was outraged and said something to them in Arabic. Jones didn't understand it at the time, but later he learned [...] "it was a curse upon us all".|$|R
25|$|In October 2003, 3rd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery formed Fox Battery, {{a hybrid}} mechanized/motorized battery {{composed}} of 2nd Brigade (Black Jack) fire supporters. The first platoon consisted of six M7A2 Bradley Fire Support Vehicles taken from Task Force 1-5 Cavalry and Task Force 2-12 Cavalry. The second platoon's composition was six M707 Striker HMMWVs {{belonging to the}} COLT platoon of D/9 Cavalry. The battery's existence proved to be vital during the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army's</b> uprisings in April 2004 with the mechanized platoon filling the gaps in Black Jack's armor shortage. The second platoon ran counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and main supply route (MSR) security during that time. Fire supporters from F/3-82 Field Artillery were called upon in August 2004 to go with Task Force 1-5 Cavalry (Black Knights) to retake {{the southern city of}} Najaf, {{with the rest of the}} battery relieving Task Force 1-5 Cavalry in Area of Operations Black Knight. In November 2004, Fox Battery soldiers were sent with Task Force 1-5 Cavalry and Task Force 2-12 Cavalry to provide outer cordon for operations in Fallujah. The battery then accompanied 3-82 Field Artillery to Forward Operating Base Kalsu in December 2004 to run heavy counter-insurgency operations prior to the January 2005 elections. The COLT platoon is credited for smashing an insurgent operation to kill voters on Election Day, without firing a shot. Fox Battery was deactivated in May 2005, with the entire battery receiving the Combat Action Badge for their efforts.|$|R
25|$|On March 25, an Iraqi {{military}} {{assault was}} launched against {{the port city}} of Basra, which was held by a number of militia groups, but primarily by the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army.</b> This led to the collapse of the cease-fire and the continuation of the fighting in Sadr City. Beginning early in the morning of March 25, <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> militia launched a number of rocket and mortar attacks from Sadr City at US forward operating bases throughout Baghdad, as well as the Green Zone.|$|E
25|$|On May 11, a {{cease-fire}} {{went into effect}} and on May 12 a 14-point agreement was signed between the Iraqi government and representatives of Muqtada al-Sadr, granting Iraqi military forces permission by the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> to enter the district to establish security checkpoints and to hunt for rogue militiamen. Under the agreement, the U.S. military would not enter areas of Sadr City north of al-Quds street, but the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> promised to stop rocket attacks on U.S. military bases and the Green Zone.|$|E

Two days' journey on foot will take us to the village where we sent our camels with the plunder and came on here to fight, believing, like fools, that the Mahdi was going to eat them up. We have seen what came of that, and they say that there are crowds more of them on the way. I am ready to fight; you have all seen me fight over and over again, and all men know that Sheik El Bakhat is no coward; but to fight against men who fire without {{stopping}} is more than I care for. They are Kaffirs, but they have done me no harm, and I have no vengeance to repay them. Fortunately we did not arrive till an hour after the fighting was over, or our bones might be bleaching out there in the desert with those of hundreds of others. It is the Mahdi's quarrel and not mine. Let him fight if he wants to, I have no objection. Why should I throw away my life in his service when even the slave we have captured is not to be my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|Two months, {{which have}} passed since the {{decision}} of the government [...] (Feb. 5), have thrown light, more or less, upon the several points [...] brought into view on the 19th February. 1. We have now no [...] sufficient reason to assume that any of the population of Khartoum [...] felt themselves bound to Gordon, or to have suffered on his [...] account; or even that any large numbers of men in arms perished in [...] the betrayal of the town, or took his part after the enemy were [...] admitted into it. 2. We have had no tidings of anarchy at [...] Khartoum, and we do not know that it is governed worse, or that [...] the population is suffering more, than it would be under a Turkish [...] or Egyptian ruler. 3. It is not believed that the possession of [...] Khartoum is of any great value as regards the slave trade. 4. Or, [...] after the failure of Gordon with respect to the garrisons, that [...] the possession of Khartoum would, without further and formidable [...] extensions of plan, avail for the purpose of relieving them. But [...] further, what knowledge have we that these garrisons are unable to [...] relieve themselves? There seems some {{reason to believe that the}} [...] army of Hicks, when the action ceased, fraternised with the [...] <b>Mahdi’s</b> <b>army,</b> and that the same thing happened at Khartoum. Is [...] there ground to suppose that they are hateful unless as [...] representatives of Egyptian power? and ought they not to be [...] released from any obligation to present themselves in that [...] capacity? ...|$|R
60|$|But {{although}} Gordon {{had been}} rapturously {{received by the}} inhabitants of Khartoum, the tribes of the Soudan had not rallied, as it was hoped they would do, {{in opposition to the}} <b>Mahdi,</b> whose <b>armies</b> had gradually advanced and had besieged the city. General Gordon with the troops there had made expeditions up the river in the steamers, and brought in provisions for the besieged town; he had fought several battles with the Mahdists, in which he had not always been successful, and it was known that unless help arrived the city must finally surrender. Many letters had been received from him asking urgently for aid, but weeks and months passed, and the government who had sent him out were unable to make up their minds to incur the cost necessary for the despatch of so distant an expedition.|$|R
25|$|By late November the {{operation}} ended with southern portions of Baghdad still remaining in al-Qaeda {{hands and the}} whole of Sadr City still under <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> control.|$|E

50|$|El Obeid, {{the city}} whose siege Hicks had {{intended}} to relieve, had already fallen {{by the time the}} expedition left Khartoum, but Hicks continued anyway, although not confident of his chances of success. Upon his approach,the <b>Mahdi</b> assembled an <b>army</b> of about 40,000 men and drilled them rigorously in the art of war, equipping them with the arms and ammunition captured in previous battles. On 3 and 4 November 1883, when Hicks' forces actually offered battle, the Mahdist army was a credible military force, which utterly annihilated Hicks' army—only about 500 Egyptians survived—at the Battle of El Obeid.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1870s, European {{initiatives}} {{against the}} slave trade caused an economic crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of Mahdist forces. Muhammad Ahmed Al Mahdi was a religious leader, who proclaimed himself the Mahdi—the prophesied redeemer of Islam who will appear at end times—in 1881, and declared a Jihad against Ottoman rulers. He declared all [...] "Turks" [...] infidels and called for their execution. The <b>Mahdi</b> raised an <b>army</b> and led a successful religious war to topple the Ottoman-Egyptian occupation of Sudan. Victory created an Islamic state, one that quickly reinstituted slavery. In the West he is most famous for defeating and later killing British general Charles George Gordon, {{in the fall of}} Khartoum.|$|R
60|$|The {{convenient}} {{situation of}} Kassala--almost equally distant from Omdurman, Berber, Suakin, Massowa, and Rosaires--and the fertility {{of the surrounding}} region raise it to {{the dignity of the}} most important place in the Eastern Soudan. The soil is rich; the climate, except in the rainy season, not unhealthy. A cool night breeze relieves the heat of the day, and the presence of abundant water at the depth of a few feet below the surface supplies the deficiency of a river. In the year 1883 the population is said to have numbered more than 60,000. The Egyptians considered the town of sufficient value to require a garrison of 3,900 soldiers. A cotton mill adequately fitted with machinery and a factory chimney gave promise of the future development of manufacture. A regular revenue attested the existence of trade. But disasters fell in heavy succession on the Eastern Soudan and blighted the prosperity of its mud metropolis. In 1885, after a long siege and a stubborn resistance, Kassala was taken by the Dervishes. The garrison were massacred, enslaved, or incorporated in the <b>Mahdi's</b> <b>army.</b> The town was plundered and the trade destroyed. For nearly ten years an Arab force occupied the ruins and a camp outside them. Kassala became a frontier post of the Dervish Empire. Its population perished or fled to the Italian territory. This situation might have remained unaltered until after the battle of Omdurman if the Dervishes had been content with the possession of Kassala. But in 1893 the Emir in command of the garrison, being anxious to distinguish himself, disobeyed the Khalifa's instructions to remain on the defensive and attacked the Europeans at Agordat. The Arab force of about 8,000 men were confronted by 2,300 Italian troops, protected by strong entrenchments, under Colonel Arimondi. After a fierce but hopeless attack the Dervishes were repulsed with a loss of 3,000 men, among whom was their rash leader. The engagement was, however, as disastrous to Italy as to the Khalifa. The fatal African policy of Signor Crispi received a decided impetus, and in the next year, agreeably to their aspirations in Abyssinia, the Italians under General Baratieri advanced from Agordat and captured Kassala. The occupation was provisionally recognised by Egypt without prejudice to her sovereign rights, and 900 Italian regulars and irregulars established themselves in a well-built fort. The severe defeat at Adowa in 1896, the disgrace of Baratieri, the destruction of his army, and the fall of the Crispi Cabinet rudely dispelled the African ambitions of Italy. Kassala became an encumbrance. Nor was that all. The Dervishes, encouraged by the victory of the Abyssinians, invested the fort, and the garrison were compelled to fight hard to hold what their countrymen were anxious to abandon. In these circumstances the Italian Government offered, at a convenient opportunity, to retrocede Kassala to Egypt. The offer was accepted, and an arrangement made. The advance of the Khedivial forces into the Dongola province relieved, as has been described, the pressure of the Dervish attacks. The Arabs occupied various small posts along the Atbara and in the neighbourhood of the town, and contented themselves with raiding. The Italians remained entirely on the defensive, waiting patiently for the moment when the fort could be handed over to the Egyptian troops.|$|R
25|$|In late 2006 Baghdad {{was more}} than 80 percent {{under the control of}} insurgent forces and so an intense sectarian turf war broke out between Sunni and Shia insurgents, {{including}} the <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the {{fighting}} started on April 4, militiamen ambushed a 1st Cavalry Division patrol and Iraqi police were expelled from three police stations in Sadr City. Members {{of the newly}} arrived 1st Cavalry Division were sent out to retake them. Eight US troops were killed and 51 more wounded in the bloody battle. US forces subsequently regained control of the police stations after running firefights with Mahdi rebels that killed 35 <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> militiamen; over 500 were reported killed by the Iraqi Ministry of Health. <b>Mahdi</b> <b>Army</b> members still maintained control over many of the slum areas of Sadr City.|$|E

5000|$|On 4 September 1884, Gordon's {{fortunes}} took a {{turn for}} the worse when the most able of his subordinates Mohammed Aly together with about 1, 000 of Gordon's best troops were killed in an ambush, while conducting a raid. Gordon wrote in his diary that Mohammed Aly had captured [...] "a lad of 12 or 14 years of age, and the little chap spoke out boldly, and said he believed Mohamed Ahmed was the Mahdi and that we were dogs. He was shot! Before I heard of our defeat I heard of this, and I thought, 'THAT will not pass unavenged'." [...] On 9 September 1884, an armored streamer, the Abbas on its way to Cairo was captured by the Ansar for the first time and all aboard were killed. Amongst the dead were Gordon's unofficial spokesman, the passionate wordsmith and Times journalist Frank Powers, Gordon's Chief of Staff Colonel Stewart and the French consul in Khartoum Herbin, all of whom Gordon was sending to Cairo to plead for relief. Gordon received a letter from the Mahdi taunting him over the murders of his friends Powers and Stewart, warning that he would be next if he did not surrender. Bitterly Gordon wrote in his diary: [...] "It is impossible to have any more words with Mohammed Achmed, only lead." [...] Amongst the papers captured on the Abbas was the cipher key Gordon used to code his messages in and out of Khartoum, which meant he could no longer read the messages he received, leading him to write in his diary: [...] "I think cipher-messages are in some countries, like this, a mistake". During this period, Gordon was lionized by the British press, which portrayed him as a latter-day Christian [...] "knight", a [...] "crusader" [...] and a [...] "saint", a man of pure good, heroically battling the Mahdi, who was depicted as a man of pure evil. The Pall Mall Gazette in a front page leader wrote that Gordon stood [...] "out in clear relief against the Eastern sky. Alone in a black continent, dauntless and unfaltering, he discharges his great trust, holding the capital of the Sudan against the beleaguering hordes". The defenses Gordon had built with lines of earthwork, mines, and barbed wire presented the Ansar with much difficulty and their attempts to storm Khartoum failed, but the Ansar made good use of their Krupp artillery to gradually batter down the defenses. To counter Gordon's armored streamers, the Mahdi built a series of forts along the Nile equipped with Krupp guns that over time proceeded to make it almost impossible for Gordon's navy to operate.By the end of 1884, both the garrison and the population of Khartoum were starving to death; there were no horses, donkeys, cats, or dogs left in Khartoum as the people had eaten all of them. Gordon told the civilians of Khartoum that anyone who wished to leave, even to join the <b>Mahdi's</b> <b>army</b> were free to do so. About half of the population took up his offer to promptly leave the city. A note written by Gordon and dated December 14 was sent out by a messenger from Khartoum who reached Wolseley's army on 30 December 1884. The note read [...] "Khartoum all right. Can hold out for years. C.G. Gordon", but the messenger (who knew very little English) had memorised another, darker message from Gordon, namely: [...] "We want you to come quickly". In the same month, Gordon received a letter from the Mahdi offering safe passage out of Khartoum: [...] "We have written to you to go back to your country...I repeat to you the words of Allah, Do not destroy yourself. Allah Himself is merciful to you". Gordon and the Mahdi never met, but the two men, both charismatic and intensely religious soldiers who saw themselves as fighting for God had developed a grudging mutual respect. However, Faught wrote that there was a fundamental difference between Gordon and the Mahdi In that Gordon never tried to convert the Muslims of the Sudan to Christianity whereas the Mahdi was an [...] "Islamic extremist" [...] who believed he would establish a worldwide caliphate, looking forward to the day when he would [...] "see the world bow before him".|$|R
50|$|Bennett {{served as}} a war {{correspondent}} during the Cretan insurrection in 1897. He was registered with the Turks, but was captured by the Greeks, threatened with execution, and only released on his recognition by a Greek officer who happened to have known him at Oxford. In 1898, he joined the British expedition to Khartoum led by General Kitchener, again as a war correspondent. He witnessed the Battle of Omdurman, in which an Anglo-Egyptian army of 25,000 defeated some 50,000 Ansar (or Dervish) followers of the Khalifa to the <b>Mahdi.</b> The Dervish <b>army</b> suffered around 23,000 casualties compared to only 330 from the British-led force. He wrote an article shortly afterwards for the Contemporary Review in which he complained of British atrocities against wounded Dervishes after the battle, which provoked a hostile reaction from patriotic readers in Britain. He exchanged views on this and other matters with Winston Churchill (also present at the battle and who he met on route), and the subsequent books of both authors {{on the subject of}} the battle acknowledged the other. In 1899 he joined the Voluntary Ambulance Corps in South Africa at the outset of the Boer War, and wrote a book about his experiences. In 1911, Bennett was accredited as a correspondent for the Manchester Guardian to cover the Italo-Turkish War in what is now Libya. He was attached to the Turkish Army, and during this time he got to know Kemal Atatürk. Bennett later worked as a press censor for the Turkish Army in Thrace during the Balkan War, and was made a Pasha in reward.|$|R
