Meanwhile, {{few of them}} integrate explorative spatial data analysis and spatial regression model into migration analysis. Based on aggregated registered floating population data from 2005 to 2008, the phenomena that population floating to Yiwu City in Zhejiang Province is analyzed at the provincial and county levels. The spatial layout of Yiwu's pull forces is proved as a V-shaped pattern excluding Sichuan Province based on map visualization method. Using the migration ratio in 2007 as an explanatory variable, two models are compared using ordinary least square, spatial error model and spatial lag model methods for county-level data in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. The model with <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> provides an improved fitting over the model without <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> according to the model fitting results. The floating population flocking into Yiwu City from Jiangxi is determined mostly by <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> while the determinant factors are <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> and distance to Yiwu City for Anhui. The distance-decay effect is true for migration flow from Anhui to Yiwu City while the distance rule is not confirmed in Jiangxi with the best fitting model. The correlation between per capita net income of rural labor forces and migration ratio is not significant in Jiangxi and significant but at the 0. 1 level only in Anhui. Further analysis shows that the distance, income and man-land ratio are important factors to explain population floating at earlier stage.

This paper assesses the functional form of the impact of migration on trade flows in a quasi-experimental setting. We provide evidence that the relationship is not log-linear. In particular, at small levels of <b>migration</b> (<b>stocks)</b> the elasticity of trade to migration is quite high, and it declines to zero at about 4, 000 immigrants. If <b>migration</b> <b>stocks</b> exceed such a level, the evidence suggests that trade will not increase anymore.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{registered}} individual {{floating population}} data from 2005 to 2008 of Yiwu, the phenomena that population floating to Yiwu City from 34 province and 91 counties in Jiangxi provinces is analyzed. The study aims at analyzing the “pull” forces of Yiwu City and developing migration models for understanding determinants factors of population migration/floating into Yiwu City {{from other areas}} in China. The spatial layout of Yiwu's pull forces is proved as a V-shaped pattern consisting of the two axes by using explorative spatial data analysis and map visualization method. The migration models with (model 3) or without (model 2) <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> are presented and estimated using standard linear regression model, spatial error model as well as spatial lag model at the county scale in Jiangxi province. Based on the likelihood statistics, the AIC and the Moran's I statistics of residuals, the model with <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> provides an improved fit over the model without <b>migration</b> <b>stock.</b> The correlation between migration ratio and man land ratio is significant at the 0. 5 level according to estimates of model 3 and spatial version of model 2. All the three estimates of model 2 and the OLS results of model 3 confirm the distance-decay effect while results from the spatial version of model 3 failed to support the distance rule in population floating. Contrary {{to the previous studies}} at the provincial level, the correlation between per capital net income of rural labor forces and migration ratio is not significant according to the three versions of the two models due to the small disparities of income within the counties in Jiangxi. Examination of specification tests in spatial version of model 3 indicates that there is less significant spatial error dependence in the spatial lag models than spatial lag dependence in the error models, further suggesting a preference for the lag model. Model 2 does not suggest any preference for choosing spatial error model and spatial lag model...|$|E

Second, net migration rates tend to cease over time despite persisting income differences.

In equilibrium a positive relation exists between the stock of migrants and the income differential, while the net migration flow becomes zero. Consequently, existing empirical migration models, estimating net migration flows instead of stocks, may be misspecified.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{determinants}} of international migration to Germany, 1967 - 2000. The empirical literature on macro-economic migration functions usually explains migration flows {{by a set of}} explanatory variables such as the income differential, employment rates, and <b>migrations</b> <b>stocks</b> as in Hatton (1995), for example. Since macroeconomic variables are widely acknowledged as nonstationary, the standard model in the migration literature can only meet the requirements of modern non-stationary time-series econometrics if migrations flows and the explanatory variables are integrated of the same order and if these variables form a cointegrated set. In order to prove whether the standard specification is compatible with our data, we use the univariate Augmented Dickey-Fuller test as well as its panel data version, developed in Im, Pesaran, and Shin (2003), to test for unit roots in the time series. The tests demonstrate that migration rates are stationary, while the remaining explanatory variables follow I(1) processes. Consequently, we suggest an alternative specification of the long-run migration function with <b>migration</b> <b>stocks</b> as the dependent variable. For this specification, we find that all variables are I(1) processes, and that the null of no cointegration can be decisively rejected by applying the panel cointegration test of Pedroni (1999). The parameter inference in the cointegrating regressions is conducted using the method of canonical cointegrating regressions of Park (1992). Our empirical findings generally agree with predictions of migration theory. Migration, unit roots, panel cointegration...|$|R

The presented results are more likely to reflect a pure aspiration effect, i.e., that migration changes the goal setting of households having full information, than a simple change in information available to households for two reasons: First, 91.6 % of the households in the sample have a television, and about one-third of the households have a computer, i.e., people have the means to access information. Second, and more importantly, if migration were only an information channel, previous migration waves would have made pure information available before 2011. Since the estimations control for the <b>migration</b> <b>stock</b> in 2004, the access to information, e.g., about available education premia abroad, would have already been supplied by these migrant networks.|$|E
