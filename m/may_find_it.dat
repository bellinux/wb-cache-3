5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy lorises {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> {{difficult}} {{to distinguish between the}} pygmy slow loris and the Sunda slow loris, as both have similarly reddish fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy lorises may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E

25|$|Inhibitory control, often {{conceptualized}} {{as an executive}} function, {{is the ability to}} inhibit or hold back a prepotent response. It is theorized that impulsive behavior reflects a deficit in this ability to inhibit a response; impulsive people <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> more difficult to inhibit action whereas non-impulsive people <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> easier to do so. There is evidence that, in normal adults, commonly used behavioral measures of inhibitory control correlate with standard self-report measures of impulsivity.|$|E
