40|$|Exogenous prostaglandins (PGs) {{have been}} {{reported}} to suppress or to promote the function of the primate corpus luteum in vitro and in vivo, but the role of endogenous ovarian prostaglandins in regulating luteal function during the menstrual cycle is unknown. Infusion (via osmotic pump) of the prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor sodium <b>meclofenamate</b> into the corpus luteum, but not via the jugular vein, during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle resulted in a decline in progesterone levels and premature menses in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). These results suggest that <b>meclofenamate</b> suppresses the production of an obligatory luteotropic prostaglandin or other metabolite of arachidonic acid. We were unable to confirm that ovarian prostaglandin synthesis was diminished during treatment, since we could not consistently measure a gradient in PGE or PGF₂(α) across the ovary.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} the drug release mechanisms from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) hydrophilic matrices. A hypothesis was developed from {{interpretation of a}} previous study that drug surface activity {{has an influence on}} drug liberation. The validity of the hypothesis was tested by studying the interactions between HPMC and the two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac Na and <b>meclofenamate</b> Na, using tensiometry, rheology, NMR, neutron scattering and turbimetry. <b>Meclofenamate</b> Na was found to interact with HPMC, resulting in detectable changes in drug diffusion coefficients and polymer structure in solution. There were increases in HPMC solution solubility and changes in viscoelasticity, which suggested drug solubilisation of the methoxyl-rich regions of the polymer chains. Diclofenac Na did not show evidence of an interaction and exhibited changes consistent with a 'salting out' of the polymer. A confocal microscopy technique was used to image the drug effects on early gel layer development. The presence of drugs affected gel layer development, depending on the level of drug in the matrix and the concentration of sodium chloride in the hydration medium. Diclofenac Na matrices became increasingly susceptible to disintegration, while <b>meclofenamate</b> Na matrices exhibited resistance to the effects of sodium chloride. The influence of incorporated diluents on the gel layer was also investigated and it was found that lactose had a disruptive effect, whereas microcrystalline cellulose was relatively benign. When co-formulating drugs and diluents in the matrix, lactose acted to antagonise the effect of <b>meclofenamate,</b> but acted synergistically with diclofenac to reduce gel layer integrity and accelerate matrix disintegration. In contrast, MCC was found to have a relatively neutral effect on drug-mediated effects. HPMC particle swelling and coalescence are critical processes in gel layer formation extending drug release. Drug surface activity and capability of interacting with HPMC appears to influence particle swelling processes, affecting gel layer formation and provides a mechanistic explanation for the differing release profiles of diclofenac and <b>meclofenamate</b> Na.

The present papillary and cortical micropuncture studies were designed to examine the effect of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors on segmental chloride transport during hydropenia (with and without <b>meclofenamate)</b> and 10 % volume expansion (with and without both <b>meclofenamate</b> and indomethacin). Both inhibitors significantly decreased the urinary excretion rate of prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 α. Clearance studies on the intact right kidney demonstrated no effect of either agent on glomerular filtration rate, but a significant reduction in chloride excretion during hydropenia and volume expansion was observed. To assess the specific site(s) of enhanced chloride reabsorption, absolute and fractional chloride delivery was measured in the late proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and the early and late distal tubules. In addition, the fraction of filtered chloride remaining at the base and tip of the papillary collecting duct was compared to that fraction remaining at the superficial late distal tubule. During hydropenia, <b>meclofenamate</b> had no effect on fractional chloride delivery out of the superficial late distal tubule or the juxtamedullary thin descending limb of Henle, but significantly reduced the fraction of chloride delivered {{to the base of the}} papillary collecting duct. During volume expansion, neither <b>meclofenamate</b> nor indomethacin had an effect on absolute chloride delivery out of the proximal tubule or the thin descending limb of Henle. However, absolute chloride delivery to the early distal tubule was significantly reduced, and was associated with a decrease in fractional chloride reabsorption in this segment. Furthermore, the fraction of chloride delivered to the base of the collecting duct was significantly reduced. Fractional reabsorption along the terminal 1 mm of the collecting duct was not altered by either <b>meclofenamate</b> or indomethacin. These results suggest that inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis result in an increase in chloride reabsorption in the superficial loop of Henle, and in segments between the superficial late distal tubule and the base of the collecting duct.

The results support the previous suggestions that PGE 2 may participate in the central cardiovascular and thermoregulatory contro!. The results also suggest that indomethacin and sodium <b>meclofenamate</b> antagonize the effects of exogenous prostaglandins. Since sodium <b>meclofenamate,</b> unlike indomethacin, affected preferentially the hypertensive response to centrally administered PGE 2, there may be differences in the sites and/or modes of action between these drugs...|$|E

Administration of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, sodium <b>meclofenamate</b> (0. 8 - 10 mg/kg I. V. or 0. 6 - 2. 6 mg/kg intracerebrally) or acetylsalicylic acid (6. 7 mg/kg I. V.) caused prolonged episodes of fetal breathing during low and high voltage electrocortical activity, with a large increase in breath amplitude. Blood gas values, heart rate, blood pressure, electrocortical activity and eye movements were not altered. In fetuses whose brain stems had been sectioned in the upper pons or the inferior colliculus, sodium <b>meclofenamate</b> induced prolonged deep breathing. Intravenous prostaglandin E 2 abolished the continuous breathing induced by <b>meclofenamate,</b> but not breathing movements enhanced by hypercapnia or hypoxia. It is concluded that the central chemoreceptors respond to acidosis in near-term lamb fetuses qualitatively as in adult animals. Secondly, the results suggest that prostaglandin E 2 and the inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis also act centrally in the lower pons or medulla to modulate fetal breathing...|$|E
40|$|Rings of canine basilar arteries {{with and}} without {{endothelium}} were suspended for isometric tension recording in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. Increased extracellular concentrations of potassium (3 - 20 mM) caused rhythmic activity in rings with endothelium. This activity was reduced by {{the removal of the}} endothelium and by exposure to indomethacin, <b>meclofenamate,</b> diltiazem, or ouabain; it was not affected by tetrodotoxin, bretylium tosylate, phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, methiothepin, and cimetidine. Prostaglandin F(2 α) and E 2 caused concentration-dependent increases in the frequency and the amplitude of this rhythmic activity and reversed the inhibitory effect of indomethacin and <b>meclofenamate.</b> Prostacyclin abolished the activity. These results suggest that increasing the concentration of extracellular potassium causes rhythmic activity in canine basilar arteries because of the production and/or release by the endothelium of products of cyclooxygenase such as prostaglandin F(2 α) and E 2. These may initiate the contraction while prostacyclin triggers the relaxation phase of rhythmic activity, possibly by activating Na+, K+-ATPase of the vascular smooth muscle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Prostacyclin (PGI 2) induced a dose-dependent {{decrease}} {{in blood pressure}} with slight increases in heart rate and body temperature, when administered at the doses of 0. 1 - 100 ~g into the lateral cerebral ventricle (i. c. v.) of the urethane-anaesthetised rat. When the same doses were administered intravenously, both the blood pressure and heart rate decreased. Central pretreatment wib~ sodiurn <b>meclofenamate</b> (1 mg/rat i. c. v.) antagonised the central hypotensive effect of PGI 2 but i. c. v. pretreatrnent of the rats with indomethacin (1 mg/rat) failed to affect the PGI 2 -induced hypotension. Central pretreatment with two histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists, cimetidine (500 ~g/rat i. c. v.) or metiamide (488 ~g/rat i. c. v.), antagonised the blood pressure lowering effect of 0. 1 ~g dose of PGI 2 but failed to affect the hypotension induced by higher PGI 2 doses. Therefore the main central hypotensive effect of PGI 2 seems not {{to be associated with}} the stimulation of histamine H 2 -receptors in the brain. The hypotensive effect of i. c. v. administered PGI 2 appears to be due to an action upon the central nervous system rather than to a leakage into the peripheral circulation. This assurnption is supported by the fact that sodiurn <b>meclofenamate</b> i. c. v. antagonised the effect of PGI 2. In addition, the chronotropic response to i. c. v. PGI 2 was opposite to that induced by intravenous administration. The results also suggest that there may be differences in the mode of action between sodiurn <b>meclofenamate</b> and indomethacin...|$|E
40|$|Many {{pharmaceutical}} agents require formulation {{in order}} to facilitate their efficacious delivery. However, the interaction between the active species and the formulation additives has the potential to significantly influence the pharmocokinetics of the active. In this study, the solution interactions between hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with two non-steroidal anti-inflammatories – the sodium salts of diclofenac and <b>meclofenamate</b> – were investigated using tensiometric, rheological, NMR, neutron scattering and turbidimetric techniques. The two drugs behaved very differently—meclofenamate addition to HPMC solutions led to substantial increases in viscosity, a depression of the gel point and a marked reduction in the self-diffusion coefficient of the drug, whereas diclofenac did not induce these changes. Collectively, these observations are evidence of <b>meclofenamate</b> forming self-assembled aggregates on the HPMC, a phenomenon not observed with diclofenac Na. Any process that leads to aggregation on a nonionic polymer will not be strongly favoured when the aggregating species is charged. Thus, it is hypothesised that the distinction between the two drugs arises {{as a consequence of the}} tautomerism present in <b>meclofenamate</b> that builds electron density on the carbonyl group that is further stabilised by hydrogen bonding to the HPMC. This mechanism is absent in the diclofenac case and thus no interaction is observed. These studies propose for the first time a molecular basis for the observed often-unexpected, concentration-dependant changes in HPMC solution properties when co-formulated with different NSAIDs, and underline the importance of characterising such fundamental interactions that have the potential to influence drug release in solid HPMC-based dosage forms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{has been}} {{identified}} in renal tissues under normal conditions, with its expression enhanced during sodium restriction. To evaluate the role of COX- 2 –derived metabolites in the regulation of renal function, we infused a selective inhibitor (nimesulide) in anesthetized dogs with normal or low sodium intake. The renal effects elicited by nimesulide and a non–isozyme-specific inhibitor (<b>meclofenamate)</b> were compared during normal sodium intake. In ex vivo assays, <b>meclofenamate,</b> but not nimesulide, prevented the platelet aggregation elicited by arachidonic acid. During normal sodium intake, nimesulide infusion (n 56) had no effects on arterial pressure or renal hemodynamics but did reduce urinary sodium excretion, urine flow rate, and fractional lithium excretion. In contrast, nimesulide administration increased arterial pressure and decreased renal blood flow, urine flow rate, and fractional lithium excretion during low sodium intake (n 56). COX- 2 inhibition reduced urinary prostaglandin E 2 excretion in both groups but did not modify plasma renin activity in dogs with low (8. 161. 1 ng angiotensin I z mL 21 z h 21) or normal (1. 860. 4 ng angiotensin I z mL 21 z h 21) sodium intake. <b>Meclofenamate</b> infusion in dogs with normal sodium intake (n 58) induced a greater renal hemodynamic effect than nimesulide infusion. These results suggest that COX- 2 –derived metabolites (1) {{are involved in the}} regulation of sodium excretion in dogs with normal sodium intake, (2) {{play an important role in}} the regulation of renal hemodynamic and excretory function in dogs with low sodium intake, and (3) are not involved in the maintenance of the high renin levels during a long-term decrease in sodium intake...|$|E
40|$|Isolated rat kidney glomeruli {{converted}} octatritiated {{arachidonic acid}} to several prostaglandins whose production was inhibited by <b>meclofenamate.</b> These were, {{in order of}} decreasing abundance, prostaglandin F 2 alpha, prostaglandin E 2, 6 -oxo-prostaglandin F 1 alpha, thromboxane B 2, and prostaglandin D 2. These products were identified by thin-layer chromatography, before and after treatment with potassium hydroxide or sodium borohydride. Prostaglandins F 2 alpha and E 2 were also determined by radioimmunoassay. The major product made by glomeruli was an unidentified substance(s), whose appearance was partially inhibited by <b>meclofenamate,</b> and {{was likely to be}} a hydroxylated fatty acid(s). The specific activity of glomerular fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase (EC 1. 14. 99. 1), based on radioimmunoassay for prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 alpha, was 10 - to 40 -fold higher than that of cortical tubular enzyme. These data demonstrate that glomeruli have the capability of synthesizing an array of end-products from arachidonic acid. These prostaglandins may exert important physiologic effects, because renin secretion and arteriolar resistance are regulated by the glomerulus and the afferent and efferent arterioles...|$|E

Sixty patients were recruited and treated at No's 1 and 2 Military Hospitals in Voortrekkerhoogte and Wynberg, Cape Town, respectively. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: <b>meclofenamate,</b> diclofenac and placebo. Patient assessments were performed on days 1, 3 and 7 of the 7 -day study period. These assessments included pain assessment (visual analogue scale), swelling measurement (thigh circumference measurement at the site of the muscle tear) and muscle performance test (Cybex isokinetic dynamometer and data reduction computer). All patients received physiotherapy treatment on all 7 days of the study. This comprised early rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE), and later, ultrasound and deep transverse friction massage. An intensive regime of strengthening and stretching exercises was used throughout the study, beginning with stretching and isometric exercises gradually moving onto isotonic exercises and aerobic exercise including swimming, running and cycling. No competitive sport was allowed during the study period. Statistical significance was determined using the analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) test with an acceptance level of p< 0. 05. No differences in pain, swelling or muscle performance were demonstrated between the three treatment groups. In terms of the pain and swelling assessments, the injuries did not appear to be very severe. Accordingly, the groups were divided into severe and non-severe sub-groups and statistical significance was determined using the ANOVA test with an acceptance level of p< 0. 05. A significant difference was found in the severe hamstring injury sub-group. In this group, pain reduction was greater in the placebo group than in the <b>meclofenamate</b> group on day 7. There were no other significant differences found in this sub-group analysis. Relatively few side effects were encountered, and those encountered were mild. No patients were withdrawn from the study as a result of these adverse events. Drowsiness and gastro-intestinal disturbance were the most common side effects reported. In conclusion, the study found that no benefit was gained from the use of <b>meclofenamate</b> or diclofenac in combination with physiotherapeutic modalities as compared to the use of physiotherapeutic modalities on their own. Thus, the widespread use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute muscle injuries may not be justified...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} evidence of an important interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins in the acute regulation of renal function. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine in conscious dogs whether the renal effects of the prolonged administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor are enhanced when NO synthesis is reduced. <b>Meclofenamate</b> infusion (5 mu g. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) during 4 consecutive days (n= 8) elicited a continuous decrease (P< 0. 05) in renal blood flow and plasma renin activity and a transitory decrease in sodium excretion. N-G-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) infusion (5 mu g. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) during 6 days (n= 8) produced a significant increase in arterial pressure and a transitory decrease (P< 0. 05) in both renal blood flow and plasma renin activity. The simultaneous inhibition of NO and prostaglandin synthesis (n= 7) led to an increase in arterial pressure and a decrease in renal blood flow similar to these observed during the administration of either L-NAME or <b>meclofenamate.</b> In contrast, this simultaneous inhibition produced a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, which was not observed in the previous groups, and also induced an increase in renal vascular resistance and a decrease in sodium excretion greater (P< 0, 05) than those found during the inhibition of either NO or prostaglandins. Only a transitory decrease in plasma renin activity was found during <b>meclofenamate</b> infusion in this group. The results of this study present new evidence that the renal vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic effects induced by the prolonged infusion of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor are significantly enhanced when NO synthesis is reduced. These results suggest that renal function may be more sensitive to the prolonged administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor in situations where NO production is reduced...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cyclooxygenase}} inhibition on vasomotion of proximal coronary arteries with endothelial damage GARY E. LANE, M. D., AND ALFRED A. BOVE, M. D., PH. D. ABSTRACT Vasomotion of the proximal {{branches of the}} left coronary artery was studied in an intact anesthetized canine preparation after injury to the endothelium of the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery (LAD) with a balloon angioplasty catheter. The dimensions of the left coronary artery were examined by quantitative angiography and LAD flow was measured by determining intracoronary 133 Xe washout. Thirty minutes after endothelial damage alone dimensions of the LAD remained unchanged. In five dogs continued observation {{for a total of}} 120 min revealed no significant change in dimensions of the LAD. In another group of five dogs, after the administration of 5 mg/kg indomethacin there was a progressive reduction in cross-sectional area of the LAD by 60. 90, and 105 min (37 %, 42 %, and 50 %, respectively, p <. 05). No significant change in the dimensions of the undamaged left circumflex artery was noted after the administration of indomethacin. The effect of another cyclooxygenase inhibitor (4 mg/kg <b>meclofenamate)</b> on endothelial damage to the LAD in an additional four dogs was also examined. Again significant reduction of the cross-sectional area of the LAD was seen at 60 and 120 min (40 % and 44 %, respectively, p <. 05). Heart rate and blood pressure were unchanged throughout the experiment in control and indomethacin-treated dogs. Mean blood pressure rose slightly after administration of <b>meclofenamate</b> (from 80 + 5 to 98 + 7 at 120 min, p <. 05). These data indicate that the combination of endothelial injury and cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin or <b>meclofenamate</b> results in proximal coronary artery vasoconstriction. This phenom-enon may have important implications regarding the complications of coronary angioplasty and in focal spasm of diseased coronary arteries...|$|E
