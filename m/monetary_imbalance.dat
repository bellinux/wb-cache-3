40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to analyze {{theoretically}} and empirically the short- run dynamics of Iranian reserve flows, black market exchange rate, and domestic rate of inflation. To achieve this purpose, a monetary approach was adopted to measure the simultaneous effect of an ex ante excess flow supply of money on the three variables. This study also attempts to test the hypothesis that in the long run growth in output and price level is associated with a balance of payments surplus, while growth in the domestically - determined portion of the money stock tends to be associated with deficits. The empirical findings for the longrun balance of payments shows that monetary authorities in Iran cannot control the change in the stock of international reserves through domestic credit creation or destruction; rather, the authorities have a substantial control over this variable through the money supply multiplier.

40|$|The Brandt Commission Report, {{published}} in 1980, broke ground in vital areas. It {{was the first}} international body to develop such concepts as interdependence, globalization, sustainable development, and alternative sources of development financing. It grappled with the difficult problem of global <b>monetary</b> <b>imbalances,</b> not in a vacuum, but rather, situated in the Commission’s stance that reforms in poverty, aid, debt, armaments expenditures, environment, technology, trade, and finance will not effectively meet their goals until they are supported by a totally-restructured monetary system. Virtually all sustainable development initiatives since then have missed that need for restructuring. The Brandt Report warrants this first treatment of a full political economic framing because the world continues to operate with those structural imbalances and faces a global economic crisis. Nations with current account deficits are required {{by the rules of}} the marketplace and international institutions to adjust their fiscal balances by paying off their loans. Yet nations with current account surpluses are not under similar obligation because there is no adjustment mechanism for recycling their trade surpluses and currency reserves. Compelling examples of this disequilibrium today are the current account imbalances between the surplus nations of China and other Asian states on the one hand, and deficit nations like the United States and United Kingdom on the other. A mitigating factor is the use of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, which allows the US to avoid adjusting its deficits on a timely basis. A major global financial adjustment is needed to eliminate the financial and monetary superbubble that has been forming {{as a result of these}} deep contradictions in the international system. The Brandt Report anticipated that unless these global imbalances were corrected through coordinated international action, there would be a series of sovereign debt crises, resulting in an emergency monetary readjustment. Brandt also demonstrated that any international stimulus program to merge the development needs of the global South, the underused capacity of the global North, and the needs of the entire world for a low-carbon environment, must be directly linked to the restructuring of the international monetary regime, including a new global currency and reserve system. A return to the principles and analyses spelled out in the Brandt Report is needed now to reform the global economic infrastructure. Brandt’s call for an international monetary conference to address these issues is even more pressing and salient today than it was 30 years ago...|$|R

40|$|It {{is hard to}} find {{a period}} in the post-war era in which inflation-adjusted {{interest}} rates have been so low for so long and monetary and credit aggregates have expanded so much without igniting inflation (the "Great Liquidity Expansion puzzle"). What lies behind these developments? How benign are they? This paper argues that financial liberalisation, the establishment of credible anti-inflation monetary policies and (real-side) globalisation have resulted in subtle but profound changes in the dynamics of the economy and in the challenges faced by policymakers. In the new environment which has gradually been taking shape, the main "structural" risk may not be so much run away inflation. Rather, it may be the damage caused by the unwinding of financial imbalances that occasionally build up over the longer expansion phases of the economy, typically spanning more than one higher-frequency business cycle. Depending on its intensity, the unwinding can lead to economic weakness, unwelcome disinflation and possibly financial strains. The analysis has implications for monetary and prudential policies. It calls for a firmer long-term focus, for greater symmetry in policy responses between upswings and downswings, with more attention being paid to actions during upswings, and for closer cooperation between monetary and prudential authorities. In recent years, the intellectual climate and policy frameworks have gradually evolved in a direction more consistent with this perspective. At the same time, obstacles to further progress remain. They are of an analytical, institutional and, above all, political economy nature. Removing them calls for further analytical and educational efforts. business fluctuations, globalisation, prudential and <b>monetary</b> policy, financial <b>imbalances,</b> <b>monetary</b> and financial stability, liquidity...|$|R

A number of regulatory reforms are suggested. It is also argued that central banks need to have more checks and balances.

To highlight the genuine uncertainty surrounding the lessons to be drawn, the paper examines recent experience through two intentionally polarised perspectives, viz. the "continuity" and "new-environment" views. These perspectives lead to somewhat different conclusions regarding the nature of the challenges central banks are likely to face in the current economic landscape and the policy responses that may be appropriate. While the continuity view stresses the reliability of traditional policy benchmarks, the newenvironment view suggests that it may be worth considering assigning greater weight to the build-up of financial imbalances when calibrating policy. Such an approach could be consistent with current policy frameworks, but it would point to a somewhat longer horizon for evaluating policy alternatives as well as greater attention to the balance of risks to the outlook. business fluctuations, <b>monetary</b> stability, financial <b>imbalances,</b> inflation, <b>monetary</b> policy, financial stability...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{sets up a}} small {{open economy}} general {{equilibrium}} model to study {{the dynamics of the}} adjustment of trade imbalances under different policies based on the Chinese economy. The policies that adjust domestic prices require a long period to achieve trade balance and induce fluctuations of output and inflation, regardless of whether capital markets are open or closed, while policies that adjust the exchange rate quickly result in diminished trade surpluses, and do not cause fluctuations of output and inflation. However, policies that adjust the exchange rate slowly also lead to fluctuations under a capital flow setting. Nominal frictions are important factors to these differences, because they slow down the price adjustment, but do not bother the exchange rate changes. From the perspective of welfare, fast exchange rate adjustment policies are better than price policies, and adjustment under capital flow is better than adjustment under capital control. The implications for China's trade surplus are analyzed. trade <b>imbalance,</b> <b>monetary</b> policy, capital flow, welfare,...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} global imbalances {{under the}} aspect of an asymmetric world monetary system. It identifies the US and Germany as center countries with rising / high current account deficits (US) and surpluses (Germany). These are matched by current account surpluses of countries stabilizing their exchange rates against the dollar (dollar periphery) and current account deficits of countries stabilizing their exchange rate against the euro (euro periphery). Meanwhile, the aggregate current account balance of the euro area has been by and large balanced. The paper finds that changes of world current account positions {{are affected by the}} macroeconomic policy decisions both in the centers and peripheries, albeit the centers – due to structural characteristics related to size – are argued to have a higher degree of freedom in macroeconomic policy making. In specific, expansionary monetary policy in the US as well as exchange rate stabilization and sterilization policies in the dollar periphery are found to have contributed to global current account imbalances. Given that the sample period for the analysis extends from 1981 - 2008, the results for Germany mostly capture the situation before the euro was created.

Through an in-depth review {{of the crisis in}} terms of the causes, consequences and policy responses, this paper identifies four key messages. Firstly, contrary to widely-held perceptions during the boom years before the crisis, the paper underscores that the global economy was by no means as stable as suggested, {{while at the same time}} the majority of the world’s poor had benefited insufficiently from stronger economic growth. Secondly, there were complex and interlinked factors behind the emergence of the crisis in 2007, namely loose <b>monetary</b> policy, global <b>imbalances,</b> misperception of risk and lax financial regulation. Thirdly, beyond the aggregate picture of economic collapse and rising unemployment, this paper stresses that the impact of the crisis is rather diverse, reflecting differences in initial conditions, transmission channels and vulnerabilities of economies, along with the role of government policy in mitigating the downturn. Fourthly, while the recovery phase has commenced, a number of risks remain that could derail improvements in economies and hinder efforts to ensure that the recovery is accompanied by job creation.

40|$|This report {{surveys the}} major aspects of {{financial}} crises and the restructuring and growth process of {{economies in the}} aftermath of crises, and discusses possible directions for future research in this area. The first part of the report reviews the existing literature. The first chapter gives an introduction to the recent global financial crisis starting in 2007 in the United States. Contributing factors include global financial <b>imbalances,</b> <b>monetary</b> and fiscal policy, and liberalization and deregulation of financial markets. The second chapter discusses lessons about financial crises from the interwar years. In particular, it relates events in asset and money markets to problems in the banking sector and the resulting credit crunch. The third chapter reviews the literature on a number of financial crises (banking, currency, twin crises and debt), and documents contributing factors and the typical recovery {{in the aftermath of}} a crisis. Chapter four discusses challenges from the financial crises for monetary policy. Partly as a response to earlier policy failures, monetary policy has also used non-conventional instruments to support the recovery of the financial sector. The second part outlines several directions for future research. These include the role played by the United States and China in adjusting financial imbalances, the importance of understanding the interrelation of financial frictions and business cycles, the evolution of endogenous political preferences and sectoral allocation, and the analysis of jointness and the role of expectations in predicting financial crises...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{discussion}} about the possible taxation of the financial sector has started in the European Union {{as a result of}} the financial crisis which has spread to the Europe from the United States in 2008. The EU Member States individually committed to support the financial sector for a total about EUR 4. 6 trillion (i. e. 39 % of EU- 27 GDP in 2009). Those public interventions have significant budgetary consequences (strongly felt in Greece, Spain or Italy) and imposed a heavy burden on the present and future generations. Therefore there is a strong consensus not only on the level of the European Union but also internationally, that financial sector should contribute to the public finance more fairly. Moreover, with respect to the fact, that the crises was the result of complex interaction of market failures, global <b>monetary</b> and financial <b>imbalances</b> and weak supervision, it has been argued, that taxes could be used as regulatory tools. However, the imposition of FTT on financial sector is very sensitive issue. Due to this fact it will not be implemented through the directive (requiring the unanimity of all EU Member States) but rather through enhanced cooperation (i. e. only by countries willing to do that – by EU- 11). The aim of the paper is to research, whether the revenues from the imposition of financial transaction tax through enhanced cooperation could be used as a new own resource of EU budget and whether it would enable to replace GNI contribution of EU- 11 as announced by the European Commission...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to examine the link between monetary policy and financial stability. We begin with a general discussion {{in the form of}} a literature review. No doubt, proper regulation and effective supervision are crucial to keeping the financial system stable. We claim that financial deregulation has undermined these conditions. Under such circumstances monetary policy may particularly easily create conditions which are propitious to the development of financial <b>imbalances.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy may be a reason for asset price booms (and bust) and financial distress even though goods and services prices remain stable. This suggests a need for activist policy targeted at financial stability which we discuss in the second part of the paper. It shows that policy oriented at contradicting asset price inflation has not been generally accepted. In particular, under “Greenspan’s doctrine ” any activist policy promoting financial stability as a goal independent from price stability has been refuted. This leads us to a closer look at the Fed’s monetary policy under Greenspan in the third part of the paper. We claim that this policy was successful in many respects but it failed to recognize the risks of financial instability and eventually it became pro-cyclical. In this sense the present financial and economic crisis is a part of Greenspan’s legacy. In the fourth part of the paper we analyze the Fed’s policy in face of the crisis under the current Chairman Ben Bernanke. This policy is based on very aggressive injection of liquidity on the scale never experienced before which creates risks for healthy financial foundation of the economy. The last part of the paper offers short conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis started. in 2008 {{with the collapse}} of Iceland's banking system. Subsequently, several European countries faced the implosion of financial institutions, high government debt and rapidly rising bond yield spreads in government securities. In this context, Greece {{is an example of a}} country whose government debt is a matter of grave concern since it has received the second bailout but still threatens to default. This is ironic since a developed economy like Greece is considered to aide developing economies. The main aim of this dissertation is to conduct an econometric analysis of the determinants of the Greek {{sovereign debt}} crisis while the secondary aim is an extensive literature review of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Regarding the former aim, the variables selected include the government deficit, current account balance, inflation, gross savings and general government debt of Greece. This annual data (from 1976 to 2010) was collected from the World Development Indicators, European Commission data base and the International Monetary Fund. The Vector Error Correction Model framework was used to estimate our model. Also, the Granger causality analysis helped to identify the direction of causation. Furthermore, the Variance Decomposition and the Generalized Impulse Response Function were employed to analyze the shocks of all our variables on each other. Finally, for the latter aim, we critically review the evolution, causes, consequences and cures of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and then formulate some suggestions on how to mitigate the effects of this crisis. The results of the econometric analysis show that there is a significant negative relationship between general government debt with government deficit and inflation. However, a significant positive relationship between general government debt and current account balance was found. There is an insignificant negative relationship between gross savings and general government debt. The past value of the general government debt and government deficit has the ability to determine the present value of inflation; and in turn, pass value of inflation, can predict the present value of current account balance and gross savings. Variation in most of our variables is highly explained by our variables itself, with the exception of current account balance where variation is explained mostly by general government debt. The response of general government debt to itself is positive. Gross government debt to government deficit and general government debt to current account balance is negative. General government debt to inflation is positive. A shock of gross government debt has an increasing negative effect on gross savings over the study period. Among the causes of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis is the rapid growth of government debt levels, trade <b>imbalances,</b> <b>monetary</b> policy inflexibility, and loss of confidence. Consequences of this crisis involve disrupted bond markets and the banking sector, depreciation of the Euro, reduced economic growth, loss of confidence, reduced remittances and tight fiscal measures. Some measures were taken and many are proposed as a cure for this crisis. This dissertation recommends that policies aimed at decreasing the level of general government debt should increase expenditure hence deficit in an income generating investment, increase inflation while decreasing current account balance.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1974. Bibliography: leaves 155 - 162. viii, 162 leaves illOn one hand, post-War {{writings}} on {{economic growth and}} the balance of payments have concentrated {{on the effects of}} growth on international payments accounts. On the other hand, literature on monetary growth theory, initiated by Tobin's (1965) seminal article, has been concerned with the role of money in the growth paths of real variables of a closed economy. In these models money is created costlessly through government budget deficits (outside money creation) and/or credit creations of the commercial banking system (inside money creation). In an open economy under a regime of fixed exchange rates, however, the balance of payments position can affect the money supply through a change in foreign reserve holdings which is {{an important component of the}} monetary base of the economy. Recognition of the monetary effect of the balance of payments may enable us to integrate the current two separate theories of monetary growth and international payments of an open economy in the growth context. In this dissertation, I formulate a feedback mechanism through which the balance of payments and economic growth interact with each other in a small open economy under a fixed exchange rate system. Such an integration is argued to bridge the gap that exists in the current literature on the two separate theories and thereby gives richer implications for the growth policy. Our open model of the synthesized monetary growth theory is an extension of the existing closed model to a small economy open to international trade and capital movements with the introduction of additional factors pertinent to a small open economy: (1) <b>monetary</b> effect of <b>imbalances</b> in international payments; (2) inflationary pressure in the commodity market resulting from trade imbalances; and (3) the role of international capital inflows in capital accumulation. In this framework, it is shown that capital mobility is crucial in the determination of the short-run stability and the effect of a change in the growth rate of foreign reserve holdings on the steady state capital intensity. Under perfect capital mobility, the loss of freedom to change the nominal rate of interest is the main source of short-run instability. In the open model of the synthesized monetary growth theory, compared with closed model, the degree of the "openness" of the economy is also crucial for the short-run stability. Under capital immobility monetary growth resulting from the foreign source of monetary assets has the same steady state effect on capital intensity as under a closed model; whereas under capital mobility the steady state effect of such monetary growth on capital intensity is ambiguous, depending, to a significant degree, on the real balance effect in domestic expenditures. On the basis of a general equilibrium model, we used portfolio adjustment theory of international payments in order to generalize and extend the Komiya-Mundellian analysis of the effect of economic growth on the balance of payments accounts. In sharp contrast to the results obtained from traditional Keynesian analysis, it is shown that economic growth, as a process of capital deepening over time, tends to improve both the overall and the trade balances in per capita real terms with deterioration on the capital account. The assumption on capital mobility is not crucial in the qualitative determination of this "impact" effect of economic growth on international payments accounts, but is significant only for the quantitative measurement of the intensities of the effect...|$|R
40|$|When {{addressing}} European matters we {{must remember}} that European construction is still a work in progress, with its peculiar architecture subject to a long-term evolutionary process. As normally happens with unfinished projects, the constituent, national, parts do not properly fit in the general design. This consistency gap persists, and may even widen as the system design itself evolves over time. Beyond the potential deficiencies of the projected architecture, its unfinished character may prove a serious threat when individual imbalances spill over into general fragilities. In other words, European construction is characterised by a largely unproven design, by its evolution over time, and by the ‘traverse’ problem coming from the adjustment of heterogeneous national conditions to the ‘acquis communautaire’. Structural socio-political and economic changes induced by the integration process take time, with different adjustment rates in different member countries; enforcement may become feeble and moral hazard a recurring danger for the decision process. The evolution of the architecture is far from being the result of unanimous national approaches, with the necessary compromises leaving room to the persistence of ample degrees of national discretion and specificities. In the past serious problems were often addressed through architectural reforms, sometimes leading, {{as in the case of}} Economic and Monetary Union, to the deepening of certain features of the unification process. The recent crisis could have led to a breakdown in European construction, especially in its later phase characterised by potential sovereign debt defaults. On the contrary, however, the response to the Lehman debacle was to reaffirm the acceleration in the convergence process sanctioned by the Lisbon Treaty. The lesson drawn from the crisis has been to re-draft the European institutional architecture, not just for the financial sphere. Common goals have been re-focused and the institutional set up redesigned, not secondarily aiming at more limited national discretion and increased enforcement of common rules. The reforms of the financial sector must then be analysed as part of the reshaping of the entire design. The EU design derives its strong peculiarities from the cohabitation of Member State sovereignty with the goal of a single market. Enhancement of harmonisation and convergence necessarily requires a complex political process, with Member States willing to pass on some parts of their sovereignty to collegial decisions, increasingly taken without veto powers. The wisdom of the EU decision process lies in seeking unanimity or large convergences wherever possible. Compromise solutions are, then, a necessary trait of the EU construction. In normal times it is easier for each Member State to be satisfied with the balance of its own benefits, although distribution within the Union may not be uniform. Analogously to the Minsky process, it is in normal times that the fragility of the construction may increase. Not driven by apparent threats, the enforcement mechanisms may significantly lag behind in the desirable advance towards harmonisation, thus leaving room for the accumulation of various sorts of imbalances. When a shock hits the Union or part of it, those fragilities may radically change the perceived national balances of costs and benefits and their distribution within the EU. Heightened national interest may produce serious damage to the whole EU edifice. The recent crisis represented such a shock, laying the cumulated fragilities bare. The entire EU construction rests, then, on keeping economic, <b>monetary</b> and financial <b>imbalances</b> within socially and politically acceptable limits and preparing smooth resolution procedures when they occur. The three institutional legs - the broad fiscal one under the umbrella of the European Semester, the ECB and the financial regulatory and supervisory authorities - represent the result of of compromises among national 'egoisms'. As the recent crisis has shown, the efficacy of enforcement, from which their credibility derives, rests on serious shocks not seriously disturbing this fragile equilibrium. It has also made clear how the increased interconnections between member countries have entailed further individual weaknesses throughout the whole area. Light touch supervision in some countries has directly or indirectly generated cross-border negative externalities, while economic negative and positive imbalances have contributed to weakening the edifice. The present paper has repeatedly argued in favour of attempts to increase convergence primarily homogenising procedures and strengthening enforcement. The EU financial regulatory and supervisory construction requires particularly strong measures to prevent the financial sector from generating such heavy negative externalities as to disrupt the delicate equilibriums on which the European monetary and fiscal constructions rest. Although the reforms in the institutional architecture are going in the right direction, doubts can be raised as to whether, following the international approach to financial re-regulation, the European financial systems will gain the extra resilience required by the peculiar European construction. The international agenda on financial reforms does not, in fact, imply radical changes to the previous architecture. It explicitly follows the same prudential approach, seeking to reinforce its mechanisms. The point is that the increases in capital requirements are widely judged insufficient and continue to be based on discredited methodologies; the financial institutions will continue to be too big to fail and to be resolved; since the non-banking sector will continue to be regulated with a light-touch approach, leaving connectedness and contagion untouched, the focus on banks will give way to new forms of regulatory arbitrage; the ample discretion attributed to supervisors, with the problem of their capture left unsolved, adds to their regulatory status and to regulatory uncertainty. Given the dependence of the European financial systems on banking, these reforms will certainly increase their regulatory costs, probably more than in other contexts characterised by a less systemic role of the banking sector. The European banking industry is already pressing for a softer approach, pointing out the disproportionate impact of stricter requirements on Europe's already sluggish growth. It is certainly impracticable for Europe to extra-toughen requirements for banks, as it is highly improbable that it will implement nonbank international standards with stricter rules. The financial sector will continue to pose serious threats in all countries. For Europe it might jeopardise its entire construction. For a full understanding of the European responses to the crisis, help to outline both the more salient characteristics of the European financial system (section 1) and the more recent stages in the process of regulatory harmonisation (section 2), delving into the management and resolution of crossborder crises, which is a particularly crucial problem for the European Union (EU) (section 3). A brief description of the crisis in Europe from the first phase of financial turmoil to the sovereign crises (section 4) brings light to bear on the policy and regulatory responses (sections 5, 6 and 7). An analysis of the process leading to the new overall design places those responses into the broader perspective of the consistency of the entire architecture (section 8). Some conclusions are finally offered on the relevance of the financial reforms for the viability of the entire European construction and on the dangers deriving from an approach to re-regulation that seems incapable of significantly reducing systemic fragilities...|$|R
