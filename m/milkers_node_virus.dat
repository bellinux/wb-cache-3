40|$|Eight {{stomatitis}} papulosa (SP), four orf and two <b>milker's</b> <b>nodes</b> (MN) <b>virus</b> isolates {{were compared}} by restriction enzyme analysis. Considerable genetic heterogeneity {{was found not}} only between isolates belonging to the three different taxonomic groups but also between {{members of the same}} group. This heterogeneity precludes classification of parapoxviruses simply by comparison of their DNA cleavage patterns. Restriction maps were therefore prepared for 12 parapoxvirus DNAs. Fragments from defined regions of the genome were then selected and used as probes for cross-hybridizations to all other parapoxvirus DNAs. DNA fragments derived from an internal region of the genome hybridized strongly to all parapoxvirus isolates examined. In contrast, cross-hybridization of the end region of the DNA molecule was observed only between members of the same virus group. Molecular hybridization as a means of classifying parapoxvirus isolates is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Replication of <b>milker's</b> <b>node</b> <b>virus</b> (MNV) DNA begins 4 to 8 h postinfection, {{continues}} to 30 to 36 h postinfection in the cytoplasm of infected, primary bovine embryonic kidney cells, and {{is accompanied by}} an inhibition of host nuclear DNA synthesis. Between 20 and 24 h postinfection, newly replicated genomes are incorporated into particles which cosediment with purified MNV. These biochemical measurements could be correlated {{with the development of}} MN virions as revealed by electron microscopic analysis of thin sections prepared from infected cells. Analysis of the DNA in purified MNV showed that the virions contained a double-stranded DNA molecule with a molecular weight of 85 x 10 (6) to 87 x 10 (6) and a guanine-plus-cytosine content of about 63 %. After denaturation and sedimentation analysis of MNV DNA in alkaline sucrose gradients, three major DNA species were resolved. These species appeared to represent intact, terminally cross-linked genomes (approximately 75 to 80 S); genomes bearing one nick (or with one cross-link removed) (60 to 65 S); and complementary, denatured DNA strands released from cross-linked genomes bearing two nicks (or with both cross-links removed) (52 to 55 S). Forty [35 S]methionine-labeled polypeptides, ranging from approximately 200, 000 daltons to 10, 000 to 15, 000 daltons, were detected by radioautography after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins present in detergent-solubilized MNV preparations. Treatment of MN virions with Nonidet P- 40, beta-mercaptoethanol, and sonication released 10 polypeptides, which were apparently located on the surface of virions. Further fractionation of these released polypeptides, followed by electron microscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicated that a 42, 000 - to 45, 000 -dalton polypeptide is a major component of the threadlike tubule structure present on the surface of MN virions...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. In a small {{percentage}} of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), there is no progression of disease and CD 4 + T-cell counts remain stable for many years. Studies of the histopathological, virologic, and immunologic characteristics of these persons may provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to HIV disease and the protective mechanisms that prevent progression to overt disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 15 subjects with long-term nonprogressive HIV infection and 18 subjects with progressive HIV disease. Nonprogressive infection was defined as seven or more years of documented HIV infection, with more than 600 CD 4 + T cells per cubic millimeter, no antiretroviral therapy, and no HIV-related disease. Lymph nodes from the subjects with nonprogressive infection had significantly fewer of the hyperplastic features, and none of the involuted features, characteristic of nodes from subjects with progressive disease. Plasma levels of HIV- 1 RNA and the viral burden in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were both significantly lower in the subjects with nonprogressive infection than in those with progressive disease (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 015, respectively). HIV could not be isolated from the plasma of the former, who also had significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than the latter. There was viral replication, however, in the subjects with nonprogressive infection, and virus was consistently cultured from mononuclear cells from the lymph nodes. In the lymph <b>nodes</b> <b>virus</b> "trapping" varied with the degree of formation of germinal centers, and few cells expressing virus were found by in situ hybridization. HIV-specific cytotoxic activity was detected in all seven subjects with nonprogressive infection who were tested. CONCLUSIONS. In persons who remain free of disease for many years despite HIV infection the viral load is low, but viral replication persists. Lymph-node architecture and immune function appear to remain intact...|$|R
40|$|African green monkeys can {{maintain}} long-term persistent infection with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVagm) without developing AIDS and thus provide an important model for understanding mechanisms of natural host resistance to disease. This study assessed the levels and anatomic distribution of SIVagm in healthy, naturally infected monkeys. Quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase PCR assays developed to measure SIVagm from two African green monkey subspecies demonstrated {{high levels of}} SIV RNA in plasma (> 6 × 106 RNA copies/ml) in sabaeus and vervet monkeys. Infectious virus was readily recovered from plasma and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and shown to be highly cytopathic in human cell lines and macrophages. SIVagm DNA levels were highest in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that the gut is a major site for SIVagm replication in vivo. Appreciable levels of virus were also found within the brain parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with lower levels detected in peripheral blood cells and lymph <b>nodes.</b> <b>Virus</b> isolates from the CSF and brain parenchyma readily infected macrophages in culture, whereas lymph node isolates were more restricted to growth in human T-cell lines. Comparison of env V 2 -C 4 sequences showed extensive amino acid diversity between SIVagm recovered from the central nervous system and that recovered from lymphoid tissues. Homology between brain and CSF viruses, macrophage tropism, and active replication suggest compartmentalization in the central nervous system without associated neuropathology in naturally infected monkeys. These studies provide evidence that the nonpathogenic nature of SIVagm in the natural host can be attributed neither to more effective host control over viral replication nor to differences in the tissue and cell tropism from those for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected humans or SIV-infected macaques...|$|R

In this paper, we investigated the effect of a stressor mimicking real-life situations more closely, being social defeat of male mice, on anti-viral immunity. A single social defeat was applied at 3 or 6 days after inoculation with pseudorabies virus, a herpes virus. It appeared that lymph <b>node</b> cellularity, <b>virus</b> specific IL- 2 and IFN-gamma production and lymphocyte proliferation were suppressed at 1 day after defeat, but these parameters restored to control values quickly thereafter. We conclude that the stress of a single social defeat evokes a transient immune suppression, which might have consequences if a pathogenic or lethal virus is involved. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

50|$|Although no {{specific}} treatment for acute infection with SuHV1 is available, vaccination can alleviate clinical signs in pigs of certain ages. Typically, mass vaccination of all pigs {{on the farm}} with a modified live virus vaccine is recommended. Intranasal vaccination of sows and neonatal piglets one to seven days old, followed by intramuscular (IM) vaccination of all other swine on the premises, helps reduce viral shedding and improve survival. The modified live virus replicates {{at the site of}} injection and in regional lymph <b>nodes.</b> Vaccine <b>virus</b> is shed in such low levels, mucous transmission to other animals is minimal. In gene-deleted vaccines, the thymidine kinase gene has also been deleted; thus, the virus cannot infect and replicate in neurons. Breeding herds are recommended to be vaccinated quarterly, and finisher pigs should be vaccinated after levels of maternal antibody decrease. Regular vaccination results in excellent control of the disease. Concurrent antibiotic therapy via feed and IM injection is recommended for controlling secondary bacterial pathogens.|$|R
5000|$|HIV, {{which causes}} AIDS, {{can bind to}} {{dendritic}} cells via various receptors expressed on the cell.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is black virus {{disinfection}} using mobile agents. The black virus is a faulty node that destroys any visiting agent without leaving a trace; moreover, once the black virus is triggered by an agent, it clones itself and spreads to neighbouring <b>nodes.</b> These <b>viruses</b> {{can only be}} destroyed if they move to nodes that have been occupied by agents. In this thesis, we consider the black virus disinfection problem in chordal rings. Initially, the system contains a single black virus that resides at an unknown location. We propose a solution that involves deploying a team of mobile agents to locate the original black virus and to prevent further damage once it has been triggered. Our protocol {{is divided into two}} phases: 1) searching the graph until the black virus is found and triggered and 2) sending agents to occupy the neighbouring nodes of the black virus in order to trigger and destroy all the black viruses at once. Our solutions are monotone, meaning that once a node has been explored it is protected from re-infection. In order to measure the efficiency of our protocol we consider the total number of agents required for disinfection, the overall number of black viruses and the number of moves required by the agents. We then analyze the cost of all our solutions, providing optimal bounds for some classes of chordal rings...|$|R

40|$|An {{infectious}} agent is described which belongs apparently {{to the class}} of filtrable viruses, but which, {{on the basis of}} the evidence at hand, is not to be identified with any virus previously described. The virus has multiple tropisms and is pathogenic for mice, ferrets, and monkeys of both M. rhesus and M. cynomolgos species. Intranasal infection of mice and ferrets causes extensive pneumonic lesions of fatal severity. Intracerebral inoculation of the virus produces in monkeys a lymphocytic choriomeningitis from which the animal recovers, while in mice a rapidly fatal choriomeningitis is produced. Fatal paralysis occurs in a moderate proportion of mice which receive the virus by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, while the remainder become immune to the intracerebral test but not to the intranasal test. Subcutaneous inoculation of mice, monkeys, ferrets, rabbits, and guinea pigs causes local granulomatous induration of the skin with enlargement of the regional lymph <b>nodes.</b> The <b>virus</b> was repeatedly recovered in 1936 from ferrets inoculated with throat washings of patients suffering from an epidemic disease clinically indistinguishable from epidemic influenza.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes {{stability}} {{conditions for}} a network of assets. The assets are connected to a communications network, thus constituting a two-layered (or two-tier) network. The effectiveness of the network, and even its stability, can be indirectly affected by malicious attacks targeting the communications. The particular case of virus propagation on the assets is considered. The network of assets is modeled as a discrete-time, jump, linear system whose transitions are governed by nonlinear discrete-time dynamics representing a class of virus diffusion. The state-space variables of the latter represent the probabilities of each <b>node</b> receiving the <b>virus</b> and being infected. The stability analysis is obtained {{by means of a}} stochastic Lyapunov function argument and yields a sufficient condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality (LMI). This LMI involves the asset state-space matrices and the positive limit set of the probabilistic model of the virus propagation dynamics, which exhibits the attraction property provided a sufficient condition is satisfied. The proposed condition involves the adjacency matrix of the communications network and the parameters characterizing virus propagation. An approximation to the sufficient condition is proposed so that convergence of the system trajectories could be monitored online. The analysis is extended to a class of jump systems, which are affinely excited by some disturbance, yielding an almost-sure boundedness of the trajectories. I...|$|R

We establish the fluid limit macroscopic dynamics of a multi-virus {{spread over a}} multipartite network {{as the number of}} nodes at each partite or island grows large. The virus spread follows a peer-to-peer random rule of infection in line with the Harris contact process. The model conforms to an SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) type, where a node is either infected or it is healthy and prone to be infected. The local (at node level) random infection model induces the emergence of structured dynamics at the macroscale. Namely, we prove that, as the multipartite network grows large, the normalized Markov jump vector process (Y̅^N(t)) = (Y̅_ 1 ^N(t), [...] ., Y̅_M^N(t)) collecting the fraction of infected nodes at each island i= 1, [...] .,M, converges weakly (with respect to the Skorokhod topology on the space of càdlàg sample paths) to the solution of an M-dimensional vector nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equation.

40|$|Aleutian disease virus (ADV) {{infection}} {{was analyzed}} in vivo and in vitro to compare virus replication in cell culture and in mink. Initial experiments compared cultures of Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells {{infected with the}} avirulent ADV-G strain or the highly virulent Utah I ADV. The number of ADV-infected cells was estimated by calculating the percentage of cells displaying ADV antigen by immunofluorescence (IFA), and several parameters of infection were determined. Infected cells contained large quantities of viral DNA (more than 10 (5) genomes per infected cell) as estimated by dot-blot DNA-DNA hybridization, {{and much of the}} viral DNA, when analyzed by Southern blot hybridization, was found to be of a 4. 8 -kilobase-pair duplex monomeric replicative form (DM DNA). Furthermore, the cultures contained 7 to 67 fluorescence-forming units (FFU) per infected cell, and the ADV genome per FFU ratio ranged between 2 X 10 (3) and 164 X 10 (3). Finally, the pattern of viral antigen detected by IFA was characteristically nuclear, although cytoplasmic fluorescence was often found in the same cells. Because no difference was noted between the two virus strains when cultures containing similar numbers of infected cells were compared, it seemed that both viruses behaved similarly in infected cell culture. These data were used as a basis for the analysis of infection of mink by virulent Utah I ADV. Ten days after infection, the highest levels of viral DNA were detected in spleen (373 genomes per cell), mesenteric lymph node (MLN; 750 genomes per cell), and liver (373 genomes per cell). In marked contrast to infected CRFK cells, the predominant species of ADV DNA in all tissues was single-stranded virion DNA; however, 4. 8 -kilobase-pair DM DNA was found in MLN and spleen. This observation suggested that MLN and spleen were sites of virus replication, but that the DNA found in liver reflected sequestration of virus produced elsewhere. A final set of experiments examined MLN taken from nine mink 10 days after Utah I ADV infection. All of the nodes contained ADV DNA (46 to 750 genomes per cell), and although single-stranded virion DNA was always the most abundant species, DM DNA was observed. All of the lymph <b>nodes</b> contained <b>virus</b> infectious for CRFK cells, but when the genome per FFU ratio was calculated, virus from the lymph nodes required almost 1, 000 times more genomes to produce an FFU than did virus prepared from infected cell cultures.

40|$|Information was {{sought on}} the {{temporal}} replication of Aleutian disease virus in 27 royal pastel mink. Groups of three were examined 8 to 126 days {{after they were}} inoculated subcutaneously with 10 (3) 50 % lethal doses of the Pullman strain. Much individual variation was noted in the onset of infection, occurrence of viremia, and extent of virus replication in the tissues. Thus, virus was detected in lymph nodes regional {{to the site of}} inoculation in only some mink during the first 14 days after inoculation. During this period, virus was often present as well in the mesenteric lymph node and spleen. First detected on day 10, viremia was present in all mink examined on day 28 but occurred irregularly thereafter, even when virus was widespread in the tissues. Except in five mink succumbing to the disease, the tissue distribution of virus after day 28 tended to be more limited, and the titers were generally lower than they had been earlier. Even though present in the lymph <b>nodes</b> and spleen, <b>virus</b> was often absent from the kidney, liver, and intestine after day 28. Specific antibody was detected on day 28 and was present in all mink thereafter, ostensibly without any adverse effect on virus replication. In most mink, the infection was considered subclinical, for it was usually not accompanied by a rise in serum gamma globulin or by morphologic evidence of the disease. The virologic findings in this study have a bearing on the relationship of subclinical infections to both horizontal and vertical transmission of the virus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMyxoma {{virus was}} {{introduced}} into the European rabbit population of Australia in 1950. Although the virus was initially highly lethal in rabbits, there was rapid selection for less virulent strains of virus and innately resistant rabbits. To investigate the basis of resistance to myxoma virus, we have compared the pathogensis of the virulent strain of myxoma virus originally released into Australia and an attenuated, naturally derived field strain of myxoma virus. This was done in laboratory rabbits, which have not been selected for resistance, and in wild rabbits that have developed significant resistance. Wild rabbits were able to recover from infection with virus that was always lethal in laboratory rabbits. Laboratory rabbits were able to control and recover from infection with attenuated virus. This virus caused a trivial disease in wild rabbits. There was little difference between laboratory and wild rabbits in titers of either virulent or attenuated virus in the skin at the inoculation site. However, resistant wild rabbits had a 10 - to 100 -fold lower titer of virulent virus within the lymph node draining the inoculation site and controlled virus replication in tissues distal to the draining lymph <b>node.</b> Replication of <b>virus</b> in lymphocytes or fibroblasts cultured from wild and laboratory rabbits demonstrated that resistance was not due to altered cellular permissivity for replication. Neutralizing antibodies were present in both susceptible and resistant rabbits, suggesting that these have no significant role in resistance. We hypothesise that resistance is due to an enhanced innate immune response that allows the rabbit to mount an effective cellular immune response...|$|R
40|$|Efferent {{lymphocytes}} {{collected from}} a cannulated lymphatic draining single lymph nodes were studied for their cytotoxic activity following the injection of live vaccinia virus subcutaneously into the drainage {{site of a}} lymph <b>node.</b> Injection of <b>virus</b> produced a 40 -fold increase in the lymphoblast output 7 days following virus injection. Cytotoxic lymphocytes were detectable in lymph shortly after the appearance of lymphoblasts at 80 h and also reached a maximum during the 7 th day. This {{was followed by a}} rapid decline of the cytotoxic cells although cytotoxic cells were detectable up to 2 weeks. The cytotoxic activity in lymph was found to be antigen specific, dependent on the effector/target cell ratio, and allogeneically restricted, indicating that it was most likely due to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). CTL precursors were found in large numbers in efferent lymph and appeared at approximately {{the same time as the}} mature CTL. Unlike CTL, the precursors became part of the recirculating lymphocyte pool and were detectable in efferent lymph for at least 2 months. Following a secondary challenge with vaccinia, lymphoblasts and CTL appeared at least 36 h earlier in the lymph. In summary, we have demonstrated that virus specific CTL are found in the efferent lymph collected from a single immunized lymph node in sheep. The kinetics of the CTL and CTL precursors indicate that these lymphocytes are one of the earliest antigen specific cells detectable in efferent lymph and suggests that these cells migrate rapidly from the lymph node into efferent lymph for dissemination throughout the host to sites of virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells {{efficient}} in capturing pathogens, and processing their antigenic determinants for presentation to antigen-specific T cells to induce robust immune responses. Their location at peripheral tissues and {{the expression of}} pattern-recognition receptors, among them DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule- 3 -grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), facilitates the capture of pathogens before spreading. However, some pathogens have developed strategies to escape the immune system. One {{of the most successful}} is HIV- 1, which targets DC-SIGN for transport to the lymph <b>node</b> where the <b>virus</b> infects CD 4 (+) T cells. Contact of HIV- 1 with DC-SIGN is thus the first event in the pathogenic cascade and, therefore, it is the primary target point for therapies aimed at HIV infection prevention. DC-SIGN recognizes specific glycans on HIV- 1 and this interaction can be blocked by competitive inhibition through glycans. Although the affinity of glycans is relatively low, multivalency may increase avidity and the strength to compete with HIV- 1 virions. We have designed multivalent dendrimeric compounds based on Lewis-type antigens that bind DC-SIGN with high selectivity and avidity and that effectively block gp 120 binding to DC-SIGN and, consequently, HIV transmission to CD 4 (+) T cells. Binding to DC-SIGN and gp 120 inhibition was higher on glycodendrimers with larger molecular diameter, indicating that the geometry of the compounds is an important factor determining their functionality. Our compounds elicited DC-SIGN internalization, a property of the receptor upon triggering, but did not affect the maturation status of DCs. Thus, Le(X) glycodendrimers could be incorporated into topic prophylactic approaches for the prevention of HIV- 1 transmissio...|$|R
40|$|Serotype-specific {{patterns}} of reovirus {{disease in the}} CNS of newborn mice segregate with the viral S 1 gene segment, which encodes attachment protein σ 1 and nonstructural protein σ 1 s. The importance of receptor recognition in target cell selection by reovirus implicates the σ 1 protein as the primary effector of disease outcome. However, the contribution of σ 1 s to reovirus disease is unknown. To define the function of σ 1 s in reovirus pathogenesis, we generated a σ 1 s-deficient virus by altering a single nucleotide to disrupt the σ 1 s translational start site. Viruses were recovered that contain nine gene segments from strain type 3 Dearing and either the wild-type or σ 1 s-null S 1 gene segment from strain type 1 Lang. Following peroral inoculation of newborn mice, both viruses replicated in the intestine, although the wild-type virus achieved higher yields than the σ 1 s-null virus. However, unlike the wild-type virus, the σ 1 s-deficient virus failed to disseminate to sites of secondary viral replication, including the brain, heart, and liver. Within the small intestine, both viruses were detected in Peyer's patches, but only the wild-type virus reached the mesenteric lymph <b>node.</b> Concordantly, wild-type <b>virus,</b> but not σ 1 s-deficient virus, was detected {{in the blood of}} infected animals. Wild-type and σ 1 s-null viruses produced equivalent titers following intracranial inoculation, indicating that σ 1 s is dispensable for viral growth in the murine CNS. These results suggest a key role for σ 1 s in virus spread from intestinal lymphatics to the bloodstream, thereby allowing the establishment of viremia and dissemination to sites of secondary replication within the infected host...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Splenic and nodal {{marginal}} zone lymphomas (MZL) are subtypes of marginal zone-derived neoplasms. Due {{to their}} rarity, {{little is known}} concerning their relation, pattern of dissemination, and treatment outcome. METHODS: The authors analyzed the clinicopathologic features and outcome of 43 patients (34 patients with splenic MZL and 9 patients with nodal MZL). All lesional tissues obtained at diagnosis were reviewed histologically. RESULTS: Among the patients with splenic MZL, 30 patients had Stage IV disease (based on the Ann Arbor staging system). Twenty-six patients presented with splenomegaly with or without limited involvement of abdominal lymph nodes, whereas 7 patients showed disease extension to superficial lymph <b>nodes.</b> Hepatitis C <b>virus</b> (HCV) serology was positive in 35 % of patients. Seventeen patients underwent splenectomy, 8 patients received chemotherapy, and 7 patients were followed without initial treatment. Interferon produced a lymphoma response in three of four HCV positive patients. Of 27 treated patients, 13 patients achieved a complete response, and 12 patients achieved a partial response. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 3. 3 years (5. 1 years for patients with disease confined to the abdomen and 2. 1 years for patients with disease extension to superficial lymph nodes). Among nine patients with nodal MZL, four patients had Stage IV disease. HCV serology was positive in two patients. Five patients responded to chemotherapy. The median EFS was 2. 8 years. The median overall survival was not reached for patients with both types of MZL. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of the current}} study demonstrated that splenic and nodal MZL are indolent lymphomas with different presenting features but common morphologic and biologic characteristics, including high HCV seroprevalence. Studies will be required to identify specific biologic markers and to define the best treatment...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{starts with}} increased migration of auto-reactive lymphocytes across the blood-brain barrier, resulting in persistent neurodegeneration. Clinical and epidemiological studies indicated upper respiratory viral infections {{are associated with}} clinical exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. However, so far there is no any direct evidence to support it. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice {{as the model for}} multiple sclerosis, we demonstrated that mice experienced with influenza virus infection were unable to recover from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with a long-term exacerbation. The exacerbated disease was due to more type I T cells, such as CD 45 highCD 4 +CD 44 high, CD 45 highCD 4 +CCR 5 +, CD 45 high IFNγ+CD 4 +, MOG 35 - 55 -specific IFNγ+CD 4 + and influenza virus-specific IFNγ+CD 4 + T cells, infiltrating central nervous system in mice with prior influenza virus infection. Influenza virus infection created a notable inflammatory environment in lung and mediastinal lymph <b>node</b> after influenza <b>virus</b> inoculation, suggesting the lung may constitute an inflammatory niche in which auto-aggressive T cells gain the capacity to enter CNS. Indeed, the early stage of EAE disease was accompanied by increased CCR 5 +CD 4 +, CXCR 3 +CD 4 + T cell and MOG 35 - 55 specific CD 4 + T cells localized in the lung in influenza virus-infected mice. CCL 5 /CCR 5 might mediate the infiltration of type I T cells into CNS during the disease development after influenza infection. Administration of CCR 5 antagonist could significantly attenuate the exacerbated disease. Our study provided the evidence that the prior influenza virus infection may promote the type I T cells infiltration into the CNS, and subsequently cause a long-term exacerbation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis...|$|R
