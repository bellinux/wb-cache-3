5000|$|An {{integrated}} circuit is defined as: A circuit {{in which all}} {{or some of the}} circuit elements are inseparably associated and electrically interconnected so that it is considered to be indivisible for the purposes of construction and commerce. [...] Circuits meeting this definition can be constructed using many different technologies, including thin-film transistors, thick film technologies, or hybrid {{integrated circuit}}s. However, in general usage integrated circuit has come to refer to the single-piece circuit construction originally known as a <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the Fresnel zoneplate antenna are numerous. It is normally cheap to manufacture and install, easy to transport and package and can achieve high gain. Owing to its flat nature, the wind loading force of a Fresnel zoneplate can {{be as little as}} 1/8 of that of conventional solid or wire-meshed reflectors of similar size. When used at millimetre wave frequencies, a Fresnel zone antenna can be an integrated with the millimetre-wave <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (MMIC) and thus becomes even more competitive than a printed antenna array.|$|E
50|$|Resistor-transistor logic (RTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} built using resistors as the input network and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as switching devices. RTL is the earliest class of transistorized digital logic circuit used; other classes include diode-transistor logic (DTL) and transistor-transistor logic (TTL). RTL circuits were first constructed with discrete components, but in 1961 it became the first digital logic family to be produced as a <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit.</b> RTL integrated circuits {{were used in the}} Apollo Guidance Computer, whose design was begun in 1961 and which first flew in 1966.|$|E

50|$|They are {{commonly}} used in speaker crossover design (due to the moderately large voltages and currents, {{and the lack of}} easy access to a power supply), filters in power distribution networks (due to the large voltages and currents), power supply bypassing (due to low cost, and in some cases, power requirements), as well as a variety of discrete and home brew circuits (for low-cost and simplicity). Passive filters are uncommon in <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design, where active devices are inexpensive compared to resistors and capacitors, and inductors are prohibitively expensive.

A single-stage amplifier and two three-stage amplifiers with similar topology are presented, and have been fabricated in Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NGC) 35 -nm InP high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) process. The circuits were fabricated using different indium channel compositions on different wafers, and comparison of the results based on the indium content will be presented. We have performed on-wafer S-parameter calibration and measurements using newly developed WR 2. 2 waveguide wafer probes from 325 - 508 GHz. We measured approximately 5 dB of gain for the single stage amplifier at 437 GHz, and approximately 10 dB of gain at 474 GHz for a three-stage amplifier, with over 9 dB of gain at 490 GHz.
