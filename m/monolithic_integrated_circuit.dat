5000|$|An {{integrated}} circuit is defined as: A circuit {{in which all}} {{or some of the}} circuit elements are inseparably associated and electrically interconnected so that it is considered to be indivisible for the purposes of construction and commerce. [...] Circuits meeting this definition can be constructed using many different technologies, including thin-film transistors, thick film technologies, or hybrid {{integrated circuit}}s. However, in general usage integrated circuit has come to refer to the single-piece circuit construction originally known as a <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the Fresnel zoneplate antenna are numerous. It is normally cheap to manufacture and install, easy to transport and package and can achieve high gain. Owing to its flat nature, the wind loading force of a Fresnel zoneplate can {{be as little as}} 1/8 of that of conventional solid or wire-meshed reflectors of similar size. When used at millimetre wave frequencies, a Fresnel zone antenna can be an integrated with the millimetre-wave <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (MMIC) and thus becomes even more competitive than a printed antenna array.|$|E
50|$|Resistor-transistor logic (RTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} built using resistors as the input network and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as switching devices. RTL is the earliest class of transistorized digital logic circuit used; other classes include diode-transistor logic (DTL) and transistor-transistor logic (TTL). RTL circuits were first constructed with discrete components, but in 1961 it became the first digital logic family to be produced as a <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit.</b> RTL integrated circuits {{were used in the}} Apollo Guidance Computer, whose design was begun in 1961 and which first flew in 1966.|$|E

5000|$|The {{common use}} of the term [...] "DC amplifier" [...] does not mean [...] "direct current amplifier", as this type can be used for both direct current and {{alternating}} current signals.

The amplification of DC (zero frequency) is possible only by this amplifier, hence it later becomes the building block for differential amplifier and operational amplifier.

50|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for generating ultra-fast (picosecond-range) electrical sampling apertures and pulses, requiring {{only a single}} transition of a control signal.

The combination of speed and reproducibility allows the integration {{of large numbers of}} virtually identical fast sampling apertures or pulse generators on a single IC, enabling single-shot capture of such a rapid sequence of samples that even a single cycle of a very fast, microwave frequency, electronic waveform may be precisely sampled at multiple points.|$|E

50|$|They are {{commonly}} used in speaker crossover design (due to the moderately large voltages and currents, {{and the lack of}} easy access to a power supply), filters in power distribution networks (due to the large voltages and currents), power supply bypassing (due to low cost, and in some cases, power requirements), as well as a variety of discrete and home brew circuits (for low-cost and simplicity). Passive filters are uncommon in <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design, where active devices are inexpensive compared to resistors and capacitors, and inductors are prohibitively expensive. Passive filters are still found, however, in hybrid integrated circuits. Indeed, it may be the desire to incorporate a passive filter that leads the designer to use the hybrid format.|$|E
5000|$|An {{integrated}} circuit or <b>monolithic</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (also {{referred to as}} an IC, a chip, or a microchip) {{is a set of}} electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or [...] "chip") of semiconductor material, normally silicon.

A single-stage amplifier and two three-stage amplifiers with similar topology are presented, and have been fabricated in Northrop Grumman Corporationâ€™s (NGC) 35 -nm InP high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) process. The circuits were fabricated using different indium channel compositions on different wafers, and comparison of the results based on the indium content will be presented.
