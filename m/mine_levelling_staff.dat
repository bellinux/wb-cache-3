There has been a complete test with the invar <b>levelling</b> <b>staff</b> and a code <b>levelling</b> <b>staff.</b> With the test we checked if {{it is possible to}} achieve accuracy specified by the manufacturer with standard deviation per km double levelling with two different <b>levelling</b> <b>staffs.</b> Accuracy determined by the ISO standard was used to assess the suitability of the chosen instrument for setting out of the bypass heights. The thesis presents the process of measurements and calculation of height of polygon points with reference to benchmark R 6 at the construction of the bypass. ...|$|R

40|$|Management Accounting Practices (MAP) are {{expected}} by every organization from managerial <b>level</b> <b>staff</b> as {{they play a}} major role in decision making process in the dynamic world. Even though many projects were approved by Eastern Provincial Council (EPC) some projects are suspended due to several reasons. Therefore, the study attempts to examine the level of MAP adopted by managerial <b>level</b> <b>staff</b> in EPC. In addition, it is to identify significant differences regarding MAP adopted by staff in projects of EPC in terms of age, gender, designation, experience and educational qualification. The research framework of the study consists of six dimensions, which are cost accounting, budgeting, working capital, balance scorecard, total quality management and qualitative techniques, are used to measure the level of MAP. The study was conducted among 67 (entire population) managerial <b>level</b> <b>staff</b> of projects of EPC. Structured questionnaire was administrated to collect the data from the respondents. The collected data were analyzed by using univariate analysis (mean and standard deviation) and chi-square. The study reveals that there is a moderate level of MAP adopted by the managerial <b>level</b> <b>staff</b> in projects of EPC...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the level}} is {{typically}} {{held at the}} surveyor's eye-height, {{it is common to}} use the face of a second surveyor of similar height as a target. If the second surveyor is not the same height, the approximate location of eye-height must be noted (i.e. chin, nose, top of head). Mounting a face-sized target at eye-height on a <b>level</b> <b>staff</b> may be more accurate. Because most Abney levels do not contain a telescope, direct reading from a <b>level</b> <b>staff</b> is only possible at short range, although it is possible to make special staffs that can be read at a distance without magnification.|$|R

40|$|Comparator {{is special}} device with which {{procedures}} are being done, which results define accuracy of construction and activity of levelling equipment. These procedures are called comparation or calibration {{and they are}} being done because, the equipment checked only so, can achive the required precision for the particular tasks of the precise geometric levelling. Tests can be done for precise <b>levelling</b> <b>staffs</b> with line or code graduation and for digital levelling systems, that consist of digital levels and code <b>levelling</b> <b>staffs.</b> In dissertation I first introduced procedure of geometric levelling and levelling equipment, where I described digital levels and code <b>levelling</b> <b>staffs</b> more in detail. I defined comparation and calibration then and explained urgency of these procedures. At description of comparators is particularly presented device, that is located on Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy in Ljubljana. Also calibration procedure and its results are explained in detail. At the end of dissertation did I also described method of controlling the quality of different comparators and of different calibration procedures...|$|R

In other words, for each <b>staffing</b> <b>level</b> or adjective class, there should be a management action that addresses the dispatch of suppression resources that constitutes an appropriate <b>level</b> of response. <b>Staffing</b> <b>levels,</b> or adjective class ratings, are ways of linking fire danger information to fire management decisions. The designations for the various class or <b>staffing</b> <b>levels</b> are numerical (I to IV), or adjective (Low to Extreme).|$|R
