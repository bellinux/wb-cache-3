Two basic goals exist in <b>moiré</b> pattern research. The {{first is the}} analysis of <b>moiré</b> patterns. The task is to analyze and characterize the distribution of <b>moiré</b> fringes in a <b>moiré</b> pattern. Most of the research in <b>moiré</b> pattern analysis deals with the interpretation of experimentally produced patterns of fringes and determination of displacements (or strains) at centerlines of appropriate <b>moiré</b> fringes. Another goal is <b>moiré</b> pattern synthesis when the generation of a certain predefined <b>moiré</b> pattern is required. The synthesis process involves production of such two images that the required <b>moiré</b> pattern emerges when those images are superimposed. <b>Moiré</b> synthesis and analysis are tightly linked and understanding one task gives insight into the other. 2 Visual cryptography and time average <b>moiré</b> Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted {{in such a way}} that the decryption can be performed by the human visual system, without the aid of computers.

The method uses a steep geometric grating of about 40 lines/mm on a mirror finished specimen surface to achieve high contrast <b>moire</b> fringes. A special four beam <b>moire</b> interferometry bench is designed for the low grating frequency used. An application to experimental fracture mechanics analysis is briefly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In {{graphic arts}} and prepress, the usual {{technology}} for printing full-color images involves the superimposition of halftone screens. These are regular rectangular dot patterns—often four of them, printed in cyan, yellow, magenta, and black. Some kind of <b>moiré</b> pattern is inevitable, but in favorable circumstances {{the pattern is}} [...] "tight"; that is, the spatial frequency of the <b>moiré</b> is so high {{that it is not}} noticeable. In the graphic arts, the term <b>moiré</b> means an excessively visible <b>moiré</b> pattern. Part of the prepress art consists of selecting screen angles and halftone frequencies which minimize <b>moiré.</b> The visibility of <b>moiré</b> is not entirely predictable. The same set of screens may produce good results with some images, but visible <b>moiré</b> with others.|$|R
50|$|More complex line <b>moiré</b> {{patterns}} are created if {{the lines are}} curved or not exactly parallel. <b>Moiré</b> patterns revealing complex shapes, or sequences of symbols embedded {{in one of the}} layers (in form of periodically repeated compressed shapes) are created with shape <b>moiré,</b> otherwise called band <b>moiré</b> patterns. One of the most important properties of shape <b>moiré</b> is its ability to magnify tiny shapes along either one or both axes, that is, stretching. A common 2D example of <b>moiré</b> magnification occurs when viewing a chain-link fence through a second chain-link fence of identical design. The fine structure of the design is visible even at great distances.|$|R
50|$|The <b>moiré</b> effect also occurs between {{overlapping}} transparent objects. For example, {{an invisible}} phase mask {{is made of}} a transparent polymer with a wavy thickness profile. As light shines through two overlaid masks of similar phase patterns, a broad <b>moiré</b> pattern occurs on a screen some distance away. This phase <b>moiré</b> effect and the classical <b>moiré</b> effect from opaque lines are two ends of a continuous spectrum in optics, which is called the universal <b>moiré</b> effect. The phase <b>moiré</b> effect {{is the basis for}} a type of broadband interferometer in x-ray and particle wave applications. It also provides a way to reveal hidden patterns in invisible layers.|$|R

A <b>moire</b> deflectometric measurement of aspheric surface using Digital Fourier Transform method is described in this paper. The experimental set-up of a <b>moire</b> deflectometer is of the form of a Kepler telescope for obtaining magnified images.

Traditional <b>Moiré</b> fringe subdivision method based on DFT algorithm has low frequency resolution relatively when extracting <b>Moiré</b> fringe fundamental frequency spectral line, which causes frequency and phase measurement errors of <b>Moiré</b> fringe fundamental frequency.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{powerful}} way of synthesizing <b>moiré</b> images {{that enables the}} creation of dynamically moving messages incorporating text, symbols, and color elements. <b>Moiré</b> images appear when superposing a base layer made of replicated base bands and a revealing layer made of a line grating comprising thin transparent lines. Each replicated base band contains the same image, e. g. text or color motifs. Since the base bands and the revealing line grating have similar periods, the revealed <b>moiré</b> image is the image located within each base band, enlarged along one dimension. By considering {{the formation of the}} <b>moiré</b> image as a line sampling process, we derive the linear transformation between the base layer and the <b>moiré</b> image. We obtain the geometric layout of the resulting <b>moiré</b> image, i. e. its orientation, size and displacement direction when moving the revealing layer on top of the base layer. Interesting <b>moiré</b> images can be synthesized by applying geometric transformations to both the base and the revealing layers. We propose a mathematical model describing the geometric transformation that a <b>moiré</b> image undergoes, when its base layer and its revealing layer are subject to different freely chosen non-linear geometric transformations. By knowing in advance the layout of a <b>moiré</b> image {{as a function of the}} layouts of the base layer and of the revealing layer, we are able to create <b>moiré</b> components running up and down at different speeds and orientations upon translation of the revealing layer. We also derive layer transformations which yield periodic <b>moiré</b> images despite the fact that both the base and the revealing layers are curved. By offering a new means of artistic expression, band <b>moiré</b> images can be used to create new designs and to synthesize visually appealing applications...|$|R
40|$|Undesired <b>moiré</b> {{patterns}} {{may appear}} in colour printing for various reasons. One {{of the most}} important reasons is interference between the superposed halftone screens of the different primary colours, due to an improper alignment of their frequencies or orientations. In this article we explain the superposition <b>moiré</b> phenomenon using a spectral model which is based on Fourier analysis. After examining the basic case of cosinusoidal grating superpositions we advance, step by step, through the cases of binary gratings, square grids and dot screens, and discuss the implications on <b>moirés</b> between halftone screens in colour separation. Then, based on these results, we focus on the <b>moiré</b> phenomenon from a different angle, the dynamic point of view: we introduce the <b>moiré</b> parameter space, and show how changes in the parameters of the superposed layers vary the <b>moiré</b> patterns in the superposition.

50|$|Superimposition of {{two-dimensional}} images containing correlated periodic grid structures {{may produce}} <b>moiré</b> patterns. Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line <b>moiré</b> patterns. The movement {{of one of}} the layers results in a faster movement of the line <b>moiré</b> superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as <b>moiré</b> speedup (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line <b>moiré</b> patterns, namely line Glass patterns (after Leon Glass, 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot <b>moiré,</b> appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may give rise to magnified shapes, called shape <b>moiré</b> patterns.|$|R

Mathematical {{model for}} <b>moiré</b> in {{screened}} two-color overprinting process was established, {{and the formation}} rules in multicolor overprinting processes were investigated by computer simulating experiments.

The visible <b>moiré</b> patterns would severely interfere the structure of printing images, however, {{it was impossible to}} entirely avoid these visual disturbances, and good measurements should be taken to control the <b>moiré</b> effects.

We {{observed that the}} apparent corrugations of the <b>moiré</b> patterns in scanning tunnelling microscopy images change {{as a function of}} tunnel junction bias. A simple geometric investigation of the atomic structure of the graphene layers generating <b>moiré</b> patterns revealed that different atomic arrangements due to different twist angles can result in similar geometric <b>moiré</b> periods such that, {{only a small fraction of}} the observed <b>moiré</b> periodicities may coincide with the real atomic periodicity generating the <b>moiré</b> system. Ab initio calculations showed that the band structure of <b>moiré</b> patterns exhibit the fingerprints of those of bilayer graphene system preserving the Dirac cone. Moreover, our calculations in view of the correct atomistic modelling of the <b>moiré</b> patterns showed that van Hove singularities in twisted bilayer graphene system with varying angles have different origins in their respective band structures. Consequently, our results shed light on the graphene like behaviour of the top most dislocated graphene layer on HOPG surfaces by showing that the layer does not act alone but the final graphene bilayer has electronic properties partially resembling graphene.
