Methane concentrations in bubbles varied of five orders of magnitude, from 1. 9 ppmv to 18 % v/v.

40|$|Background Landfilling is {{the most}} common way of {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) disposal in Iran. Many countries have targeted landfill methane recovery among greenhouse gas mitigation strategies, since methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Major questions remain with respect to actual methane production rates in field settings as well as the relative <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> that is recovered, emitted, oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria, laterally migrated, or temporarily stored within the landfill volume. Landfill gas (LFG) consists of 50 % - 60 vol% methane and 30 % - 40 vol% carbon dioxide as well as trace amounts of numerous chemical compounds such as aromatics, chlorinated organic compounds and sulfur compounds. Landfill methane outreach program (LMOP) is a voluntary assistance program which helps reduce methane emissions from landfills by encouraging the recovery and the beneficial use of LFG as an energy resource. Objectives In this study, the volume of LFG of Tehran by landfill methane outreach program (LMOP) software was calculated. In addition, the relationship between the time of gas collection system operation and the volume of LFG production was evaluated. Materials and Methods The LMOP software was used. The available information and some presumptions were used to operate the software. The composition of the solid waste collected from the landfill of Tehran had specific details. A large amount of it was organic materials, which was about 67. 8 %. These materials have a good potential to produce gas. In addition, LMOP Colombia model uses the first-order equations in all the analytical equations. Furthermore, it is assumed that the landfill operation time is 30 years and the process is considered in two conditions; first, the gas was recovered in 2000, and second, the process started in 2015. Results The modeling results showed that for the gas recovery starting in 2000 and 2015, the power generation would be 2, 354 and 830 MW, respectively. In fact, the 15 -year difference in gas extraction made a 200 % difference. Based on the results, from 2000 to 2100, 558 m 3 /hour of methane would be extracted, which would be equivalent to 2, 354 MW energy. Subsequently, the emission of 93, 721, 837 tons of CO 2 would be prohibited. Conclusions It was observed that 2. 8 times more energy was generated when the collecting system was initially installed. Moreover, if so, the equivalent CO 2 was reduced by 60, 695, 377 ton.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. [245]. In {{the case}} of {{producing}} large amounts of hydrogenous gas, currently there are no problems related to basic techniques of hydrogen production and distribution, but the main technological problem will consists of storing {{it in order to}} regulate the difference between permanent or increasing gas production and seasonally modulated gas consumption. The most efficient and most inexpensive method of storing large amounts of hydrogen is to inject them in geological formations like aquifers, depleted gas reservoirs, or salt caverns (Zittel and Wurster 1996). The cost is of order $ 3. 5 per 1 GJ (Taylor et al. 1986). Several underground storages of hydrogen (USH) or town gas exist in the word, as for instance, Teeside in the UK, in Texas, in Russia, Kiel in Germany, Lobodice in Czechoslovakia, Beynes - an ex-storage in France. During several tens of years the storage of hydrogen was considered as something deja-vu, to be similar to that of natural gas, which is amplified by the chemical inactivity of hydrogen and its very low solvability in groundwater [Bulatov 1979; Carden and Paterson 1979; Lindblom 1985; Paterson 1983]. Nevertheless, quite unusual behaviour of UHS was discovered by in situ monitoring of the gas composition extracted during the cycle "production" which followed the cycle "injection". These observations (Smigai et al. 1990; Buzek et al. 1994) revealed high variations of gas composition in time and space. In particular, a significant reduction in the H 2 and CO 2 contents and a simultaneous increase in CH 4 contents were observed in the Lobodice town gas storage facility (Smigai et al. 1990). Similar phenomena were recorded in Beynes. After several months of injection and storage, {{at the beginning of the}} cycle "production" the twofold increase of the methane contents in the reservoir gas and the twofold reduction of the CO 2 CO contents was observed. The contents of hydrogen decreased by 1. 4. The explanation to these observations has been done in (Buzek et al. 1994) in terms of the in situ methane generators by methanogenic bacteria which catalyse the reaction between hydrogen and CO 2 /CO, by producing methane and water. Further observations have revealed even more unusual effects within the storage facility, such as creating a spatial alternation of the areas saturated preferably by hydrogen or methane. This proved an in situ natural separation of chemical components in space. Thus, we are dealing with a natural reactor which partially destroys CO 2 and H 2 and doubles the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>methane.</b> It is clear that the problem is important for industry as it concerns both the energy sector and ecology. The resulting economical efficiency of such a process can be estimated only after the physical and mathematical modeling of all possible scenarios of the reservoir behaviour. The development of such a model represents the main objective of this paper. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

We demonstrate that if carbon and nitrogen were {{in the form of}} CO and N 2, respectively, in the early subnebula, these molecules were not subsequently converted into CH 4 and NH 3 during the evo-lution of the disk, contrary to the current scenario initially proposed by Prinn and Fegley (1981, Astrophys. J., 249, 308 – 317). However, if the early subnebula contained some CH 4 and NH 3, these gases were not subsequently converted into CO and N 2. We argue that Titan must have been formed from planetesimals migrating from the outer part of the subnebula to the present orbit of the satellite. These planetesimals were relics of those embedded in the feeding zone of Saturn prior to the completion of the planet and contained hydrates of NH 3 and clathrate hydrates of CH 4.

The locking chamber and the storage area are joined {{with each other and}} form T-junction. The locking chamber is opened at the methane filling and the discharge stages, and it is closed at the storage stage. Thanks to the locking chamber, methane molecules are stored in the nanocapsules under normal external conditions. Opening and closing of the locking chamber are carried out by the K@C 60 1 + endohedral complex displacement, which is done by the electric field action. The specific structure of the nanocapsule allows two aims to be reached: a high methane mass content and significant level of safety. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{overpressure}} on gas hydrate and free gas distribution in marine sediments is studied using a one-dimensional numerical model that couples sedimentation, fluid flow, and gas hydrate formation. Natural gas hydrate systems are often characterized by high sedimentation rates and/or low permeability sediments, {{which can lead}} to pore pressure higher than hydrostatic (overpressure). To quantify the relative importance of these two factors, we define a dimensionless sedimentation-compaction group, N, that compares the absolute permeability of the sediments to the sedimentation rate. Higher values of N sc mean higher permeability or low sedimentation rate which generally yield hydrostatic pore pressure. Conversely, lower values of N generally create pore pressure greater than hydrostatic. Simulation results show that sc decreasing N sc not only increases pore pressure above hydrostatic values, but also lowers the lithostatic stress gradient and gas hydrate saturation. This occurs because overpressure results in lower effective stress, causing higher porosity and lower bulk density of the sediment. This leads to higher sediment velocity through the gas hydrate stability zone, thereby reducing the <b>mass</b> accumulation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> and gas hydrate in the pore space. Effect of overpressure on depth of the gas hydrate stability zone is also studied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dissolved methane {{concentrations}} (DM) {{at twelve}} major lakes in Hokkaido, the northernmost island in Japan {{were observed in}} the open water season during 2006 ~ 2009 to estimate diffusive flux from lake surfaces to the atmosphere. An inverse relationship between lake size and DM was obtained in lakes in Hokkaido as was found for the European boreal lakes. All lake images larger than 0. 001 km 2 were obtained by image processing of map data and area and number distributions were analyzed in order to calculate <b>mass</b> fluxes <b>of</b> diffusive <b>methane.</b> Total area <b>of</b> all (1, 269) lakes in Hokkaido is 809 km 2. Regional diffusive flux <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> from lakes to the atmosphere in Hokkaido {{was estimated to be}} 0. 581 Gg CH 4 yr– 1. Average diffusive flux density (per lake area) was about 0. 718 g CH 4 m– 2 yr– 1. This is a similar value to that in European boreal lakes on no-permafrost inland areas. Extremely high flux was found in Lake Abashiri-ko, one of highly eutrophic, meromictic lakes...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{flows and}} {{chemical}} reactions in a jet diffusion flame are numerically investigated. A six-species and four-step kinetic mechanism is {{employed in the}} simulation of an axisymmetric methane-air flame without any kinematic approximations with respect to fluid flows. It is shown that the distributions <b>of</b> temperature and <b>mass</b> fractions <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> and oxygen agree quite well with Burke-Schumann solution from the macroscopic view. The layers of large heat release rates are located just outside of the classical flame surface defined by the stoichiometric mixture fraction. However, the layers are not uniform and the heat release rates vary in the layers with gradients of mixture fractions caused by velocity gradients. It is found by flame from the circumference owing to negative velocity gradients on the flame surface, for the heat release is largely provided by the oxidative reaction of hydrogen. Correspondingly, continuous burning requires discharge of the reaction products due to positive velocity gradients. Moreover, local elevation of pressure due to heat release qualitatively divides the flame field into fuel-and air-rich regions and also induces outgoing flow in the air-rich region. The lack of the influx which carries oxygen overtaking the outgoing flow due to pressure gradient causes local extinction or global quench...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} developed a chemical conversion {{model of the}} carbothermal processing of lunar regolith using methane to predict the rate of production of carbon monoxide. In this carbothermal process, gaseous methane is pyrolyzed as it flows over the hot surface of a molten zone of lunar regolith and is converted to carbon and hydrogen. Hydrogen is carried away by the exiting stream of gases and carbon is deposited on the melt surface. The deposited carbon mixes with the melt and reacts with the metal oxides in it to produce carbon monoxide that bubbles out of the melt. In our model, {{we assume that the}} flux of carbon deposited is equal to the product of the surface reaction rate constant gamma and the concentration <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> adjacent to the melt surface. Similarly, the rate of consumption of carbon per unit volume in the melt is equal to the product of the melt reaction rate constant k and the concentrations of carbon and metal oxide in the melt. In this paper, we describe our effort to determine gamma and k by comparison of the predictions from our model with test data obtained by ORBITEC (Orbital Technologies Corporation). The concentration <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> adjacent to the melt surface is a necessary input to the model. It is inferred from the test data by a <b>mass</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> adopting the usual assumptions of the continuously-stirred-tank-reactor model, whereby the average concentration of a given gaseous species equals its exit concentration. The reaction rates gamma and k have been determined by a non-linear least-squares fit to the test data for the production of carbon monoxide and the fraction <b>of</b> the incoming <b>methane</b> that is converted. The comparison of test data with our model predictions using the determined chemical kinetic rate constants provides a consistent interpretation of the process over the full range of temperatures, pressures, and methane flow rates used in the tests, thereby increasing our confidence to use the model for scale-up purposes...|$|R
40|$|The stable isotopic {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> (e. g., δD and δ^(13) C values) {{is often used}} as a tracer for its sources and sinks. Conventional δD and δ^(13) C measurements represent the average isotope ratios of all ten isotopologues <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> though they are effectively controlled by the relative abundances of the three most abundant species: (^ 12) CH_ 4, (^ 13) CH_ 4, and (^ 12) CH_ 3 D. The precise relative abundances of the other seven isotopologues remains largely unexplored because these species contain multiple rare isotopes and are thus rare themselves. These multiply substituted (or ‘clumped’) isotopologues each have their own distinctive chemical and physical properties, which could provide additional constraints on the geochemistry <b>of</b> <b>methane.</b> This work focuses on quantifying the abundances of two rare isotopologues, (^ 13) CH_ 3 D and (^ 12) CH_ 2 D_ 2, <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> {{in order to assess}} their utility as a window into methane’s geochemistry. Specifically, we seek to assess whether clumped isotope distributions might be useful to quantify the temperature at which methane formed and/or equilibrated. To this end, we report the first highly precise combined measurements of the relative abundances of (^ 13) CH_ 3 D and (^ 12) CH_ 2 D_ 2 at natural abundances (i. e., unlabeled) via the high-resolution magnetic-sector <b>mass</b> spectrometry <b>of</b> intact <b>methane.</b> We calibrate the use of these measurements as a geothermometer using both theory and experiment, and apply this geothermometer to representative natural samples. The method yields accurate average (i. e., bulk) isotopic ratios based on comparison with conventional techniques. We demonstrate the accuracy and precision of measurements of (^ 13) CH_ 3 D and (^ 12) CH_ 2 D_ 2 through analyses <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> driven to high temperature (> 200 °C) equilibrium in the laboratory. Application of this thermometer to natural samples yields apparent temperatures consistent with their known formation environments and appears to distinguish between biogenic and thermogenic methane...|$|R

40|$|Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) and Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) are {{investigated}} {{in a direct}} side-by-side comparison of the Sandia flames. The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each modelling approach given the same initial conditions and computational set-up. The predictions from both CMC and CSE are compared to detailed experimental data. In case of Sandia flame D, the CMC and CSE turbulent flow and mixing fields are similar near the nozzle exit, in agreement with the experimental data, with some differences farther downstream. The CMC and CSE conditional mass fractions for the major species are in good agreement with the experimental data downstream of the nozzle for lean mixtures. For fuel rich mixtures, an underprediction <b>of</b> the conditional <b>mass</b> fractions <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> and corresponding overestimation <b>of</b> the conditional <b>mass</b> fraction <b>of</b> water are observed at some axial locations. The CMC and CSE conditional <b>mass</b> fractions <b>of</b> the minor species and conditional temperature reproduce the general characteristics of the experimental profiles. However, major differences are observed for Sandia flame E. The discrepancies are attributed to the use of RANS and the boundary conditions set in CMC and some approximations made in the chemistry tables in CSE. Favre-averaged profiles are comparable in CMC and CSE. The computational time for each model is investigated and CSE appears to be faster. Further discussion on some of the strengths and weaknesses of each combustion model is also presented. Overall, both CMC and CSE are shown to produce results of comparable quality given the same numerical schemes, mesh, and boundary conditions. (C) 2017 The Combustion Institute.
