25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

Christus is known to have signed six extant works, sometimes with the text [...] "PETR XPI ME FECIT" [...] (Petr Xpi made <b>me).</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next century sketches of Christus' biography were constructed, as art historians – notably Panofsky – slowly disentangled his works from those of van Eyck.|$|E

500|$|... "Whale Whores" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{described the}} criticism of the save-the-whales conservationists as a [...] "delightfully savage ridicule". Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me laugh a few times while you beat <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head with information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Virus Alert" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Sparks, {{specifically}} {{their work in}} the mid-1970s, such as their album Kimono My House (1974). It details [...] "the evil that lurks in your email inbox." [...] "Close but No Cigar" [...] is a style parody of Cake that {{tells the story of}} a man who breaks up with his seemingly perfect girlfriends due to the most inconsequential of flaws. The song was inspired by an actual friend of Yankovic's who was never satisfied with any of his dates; Yankovic later explained that [...] "the song was inspired by [...] attitude, that nothing could ever be good enough." [...] The final original recorded, [...] "Pancreas", is a song mainly about the biological functions of the aforementioned organ. The song is an imitation of the musical stylings of Brian Wilson, specifically his work found on the 1966 album Pet Sounds, released by the Beach Boys, and their aborted follow-up album, Smile. Yankovic joked that the reason the song was written was because [...] "my pancreas has given so much to <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, I felt like I needed to give something back to it".|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hawke {{wrote that}} he had very few regrets over his time in office; {{although}} his bitterness towards Keating surfaced in his earlier memoirs, by 2008, Hawke claimed that he and Keating had long since buried their differences, and that they regularly dined together and considered each other friends. However, in 2010, {{the publication of the}} book Hawke: The Prime Minister, by Hawke's second wife, Blanche d'Alpuget, reignited conflict between the two. In an open letter to Hawke published in Australian newspapers, Keating bitterly accused Hawke and D'alpuget of spreading falsehoods about his role in Hawke's premiership. He declared that [...] "in hindsight, it is obvious yours and Blanche's expressions of friendship towards <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last few years have been completely insincere." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 22, 1963, the Johnsons were {{accompanying}} the Kennedys in Dallas when President Kennedy was assassinated; {{they were two}} cars behind the President in his motorcade.

2500|$|James Smith was an {{unemployed}} divorcé {{living in the}} Gorton area of Manchester. Described by acquaintances as [...] "house-proud and well-groomed", he was a teetotaller and non-smoker. His marriage had ended after ten years in 1980 due to his violence towards his wife. He had then commenced an affair between 19801982 with 20-year-old Tina Watson, whom he [...] "used as a punch-bag", even subjecting her to severe beatings while {{she was pregnant with}} his child. She said: [...] "At first it was now and again; just a little tap. But {{in the end it was}} every day. He would smack me in the face or hit <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head with an ashtray. He would kick me in the legs or between the legs." [...] Watson managed to escape from the relationship, during which Smith had also attempted to drown her while she was bathing. In 1982 Smith then began a relationship with 15-year-old Wendy Mottershead, who was also a victim of his violence. In one attack he held her head under water in the kitchen sink in an attempt to drown her.|$|E
2500|$|As {{literary}} critics grew increasingly scornful of Tate, his version still remained [...] "the {{starting point for}} performances on the English-speaking stage." [...] John Philip Kemble, in 1809, even dropped some of Garrick's earlier restorations of Shakespeare, and returned several passages to Tate. The play was suppressed for several {{years prior to the}} death of King George III in 1820, as its focus on a mad king suggested an unfortunate resemblance to the situation of the reigning monarch. But in 1823, Kemble's rival, Edmund Kean (who had previously acted Tate's Lear), [...] "stimulated by Hazlitt's remonstrances and Charles Lamb's essays," [...] became the first to restore the tragic ending, though much of Tate remained in the earlier acts. [...] "The London audience," [...] Kean told his wife, [...] "have no notion of what I can do till they see <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> dead body of Cordelia." [...] Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as [...] "deeply affecting", and with regret, he reverted to Tate.|$|E
