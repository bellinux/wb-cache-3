40|$|To reduce GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions, the Kyoto Protocol {{identifies}} {{a number}} of activities that {{are closely related to}} land use, included in the category called Agriculture, Forestry and Land Uses (AFOLU). While forests and agricultural systems result in CO 2 absorptions (live biomass, dead biomass and soil), every process undertaken for their management requires energy and resources, which can lead to a significant reduction of the environmental benefits. The study analyzes three tree plantations managed at different cultivation intensities in Italy, from an extensively <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> (a pure oak plantation) and a semi-intensively <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> (walnut and poplar plantation with nurse plants), to an intensively managed olive grove. Permanent and non-permanent biomass were accounted for {{in order to get the}} carbon stock of every plantation, estimated at the same age of 14 years old. The numerous processes operated for management of different cultivated species, e. g. planting, soil management, fertilization, phytosanitary treatments, pruning, harvesting, etc. were monitored and their impacts were quantified by applying the methodology known as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Removals (carbon sequestrations) were compared to emissions on a time scale, in order to assess the net CO 2 -eq balance. Impacting treatments and processes were identified and further analysis on the individual phases and materials were conducted. Olive trees showed an unexpected capacity to store CO 2 -eq, but this ability was evident only if annually harvested fruits and prunings were considered in the calculation. The plantation that demonstrated its ability to store most CO 2 -eq at the age of 14 was the semi-intensively <b>managed</b> <b>plantation,</b> showing a higher efficiency in the energy spent by man. The paper offers a contribution for an innovative environmental performance evaluation of different tree cultivation management systems, including the assessment of potential benefits in terms of sequestered CO 2 -eq for the studied tree plantations and possible avoided emissions thanks to sustainable agricultural practices...|$|E

40|$|Establishing {{large-scale}} plantations of teak {{could reduce}} the pressure on natural forests and sequester atmospheric carbon into durable wood. Understanding the growth dynamics of this species in plantations, outside its natural distribution area, is crucial for forest management. Stem discs of teak were collected in Ivory Coast at two sites, a non-managed plantation (Gagnoa) and a <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> (Seguie). All stem discs were processed using the standard dendrochronological methods in order to unravel the relationships between growth and climate. Results showed that growth is slower in Gagnoa compared to the Seguie plantation that is being thinned regularly. In Gagnoa, trees responded positively to April rainfall, i. e., during the early stage of tree-ring formation, and negatively to September-October rainfall, i. e., during the short dry period. In Sgu, trees responded positively to July rainfall, i. e., during latewood formation, under decreasing rainfall. At both sites, tree growth was influenced by sea-surface temperature anomalies during the summer in the Gulf of Guinea. Teak growth in Sauie could be additionally linked to El Nino events, specifically during three major episodes (1976 - 77, 1982 - 83 and 1997 - 98) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mallotus philippensis, a {{dioecious}} evergreen sub-dominant tree, grows {{as close}} associate of sal within mixed natural forests {{as well as}} <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> forests of north-eastern U. P. A com-parison of its male and female populations at two contrasting light regimes depicts that sex-ratio of Mallotus philippensis was always male-biased under low light and female-biased under high light re-gime irrespective {{of the kind of}} overstorey dominance. The structure of Mallotus population was of sta-ble type under low light regime with greater proportion of trees in communities facing low disturbance. The distribution of sexually mature individuals was apparently random but close observation sug-gested several male and female guilds. The distance between any two adjacent female guilds was, how-ever, greater than that between any two male guilds. The guilds of opposite sex were, however, farther than the guilds of same sex. Under low light regime, the size of male guilds {{in terms of the number}} of trees, was greater than the size of female guild as compared to that under fully exposed condition. The inter-guild distance for any two adjacent female guilds was greater than the same for any two male guilds. The result has been discussed in the light of ecological significance of sex-ratio and the associa-tion of species within forest vegetation of the region.

40|$|Losses {{of natural}} and {{semi-natural}} forests, mostly to agriculture, are a significant concern for biodiversity. Against this trend, the area of intensively <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> forests increases, and there is much debate about the implications for biodiversity. We provide {{a comprehensive review of}} the function of plantation forests as habitat compared with other land cover, examine the effects on biodiversity at the landscape scale, and synthesise context-specific effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity. Natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests but there is abundant evidence that plantation forests can provide valuable habitat, even for some threatened and endangered species, and may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity by various mechanisms. In landscapes where forest is the natural land cover, plantation forests may represent a low-contrast matrix, and afforestation of agricultural land can assist conservation by providing complementary forest habitat, buffering edge effects, and increasing connectivity. In contrast, conversion of natural forests and afforestation of natural non-forest land is detrimental. However, regional deforestation pressure for agricultural development may render plantation forestry a 'lesser evil' if forest managers protect indigenous vegetation remnants. We provide numerous context-specific examples and case studies to assist impact assessments of plantation forestry, and we offer a range of management recommendations. This paper also serves as an introduction and background paper to this special issue on the effects of plantation forests on biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|The {{intervening}} landscape between {{patches of}} forest (i. e., matrix) has enormous potential {{to mitigate the}} negative effects of forest fragmentation. However, to release this potential requires understanding of how individual species perceive matrix. Here we investigated use of matrix by pine martens (Martes martes) in a region with low forest cover (Scotland). We radiotracked 11 martens to determine their habitat preferences, then combined our data with those published from 5 additional Scottish landscapes to examine how home-range size (i. e., population density) and diet of martens varied with forest edge density (i. e., fragmentation). Our tracking showed that although mature forest was the most preferred habitat, certain matrix habitats (scrub and tussock grassland) also were consistently selected. These 2 habitats provided martens with fundamental resources that are of limited availability within intensively <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> forests: den sites and primary prey (Microtus agrestis). Our synthesis of data across landscapes indicated martens benefit from supplemental resources in matrix habitats; consumption of small mammals increased with fragmentation and coincided with an initial increase in marten population densities. However, population densities of martens decreased once fragmentation passed a threshold level. Our results demonstrate that habitat complementation at the landscape-scale is essential for some forest-associated species. Resource supplementation from matrix habitats may be particularly important in regions with a long history of low-forest cover or where forest cover is now dominated by afforested plantations, which may lack essential resources...|$|E

The experiment was con ducted at the field experimental Kaliwining Estate of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) during 2009 – 2011. Treatments were Robusta coffee clones and sunlight intensity. Experimental design was split plot design with three replications. Robusta clones used were BP 409, BP 534, BP 936 and BP 939, planted in 2002. The sunligt intensity treatments were 100 % (without shade tree), 50 — 60 % (Leucaena leucocephala shade), and 20 — 30 % (Hibiscus macrophyllus and Melia azedarach L. shades). Only red coffee cherries were harvested for flavor and caffeine analysis. Coffee cherries were washed, depulped and sundried until moisture content of less than 12 %. The green coffee bean samples were roasted at medium level (Agtron Scale at 65 #) for cupping test which involved five expert panelists by using ICCRI protocol. Caffeine content was determined by spectrophotometric method. The experiment result indicated that high sunlight intensity resulted in strong aroma of Robusta coffee, while good flavor coffee need medium light intensity. Cafein content had positive correlation with light intensity entering the coffee farm, whereas cafein content had no direct effect on Robusta coffee flavor.

40|$|Daily flight {{activity}} {{patterns of}} forest insects {{are influenced by}} temporal and meteorological conditions. Temperature and time of day are frequently cited as key drivers of activity; however, complex interactions between multiple contributing factors have also been proposed. Here, we report individual Bayesian network models to assess the probability of flight activity of three exotic insects, Hylurgus ligniperda, Hylastes ater, and Arhopalus ferus in a <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> forest context. Models were built from 7, 144 individual hours of insect sampling, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, photon flux density, and temporal data. Discretized meteorological and temporal variables were used to build naïve Bayes tree augmented networks. Calibration results suggested that the H. ater and A. ferus Bayesian network models had the best fit for low Type I and overall errors, and H. ligniperda had the best fit for low Type II errors. Maximum hourly temperature and time since sunrise had the largest influence on H. ligniperda flight activity predictions, whereas time of day and year had the greatest influence on H. ater and A. ferus activity. Type II model errors for the prediction of no flight activity is improved by increasing the model's predictive threshold. Improvements in model performance {{can be made by}} further sampling, increasing the sensitivity of the flight intercept traps, and replicating sampling in other regions.

40|$|Moths are a vital {{ecosystem}} component and {{are currently}} undergoing extensive and severe declines across multiple species, partly attributed to habitat alteration. Although most remaining forest cover in Europe consists of intensively <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> woodlands, no {{studies have examined}} the influence of management practices on moth communities within plantations. Here, we aimed to determine: (1) how species richness, abundance, diversity of macro and micro moths in commercial conifer plantations respond to management at multiple spatial scales; (2) what the impacts of forest management practices on moth diversity are, and (3) how priority Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species respond to management. BAP species were selected as they represent formerly widespread and common species, which have undergone substantial declines in the UK and Europe. We assessed moth communities in three conifer plantations in Northern England and Scotland by light trapping, combining local (e. g. age of planting) and landscape level (e. g. proximity to felled areas) characteristics to evaluate the impacts of forest management on moths. We found no relationship between local factors and moth richness, abundance and diversity but the amount of clear felling in the surrounding landscape had a strongly negative correlation. In contrast, the amount and proximity of broadleaf cover in the surrounding landscape positively influenced macro moth richness and abundance. For six BAP species, abundances were lower close to felled areas but increased with the size of adjacent broadleaf patches. We conclude that clear felling negatively affects moths, probably through alteration of habitats, the loss of larval host plants, and by limiting dispersal. A shift to continuous cover and maintaining broadleaf tree cover within plantations will greatly enhance their value for moth communities...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{afforestation}} {{and protective}} {{legislation in the}} latter half of the 20 th Century allowed the British pine marten Martes martes population to recover from near extinction. Although still largely confined to northern Scotland, the marten population is expanding its size and range by utlising coniferous plantation forests which have become increasingly available. However, little is known about the marten’s ecology in plantation forestry, and less about how they may adapt to changing silvicultural trends. This study investigated aspects of pine marten ecology within Morangie forest, a <b>managed</b> <b>plantation</b> in NE Scotland, with the ultimate aim of formulating management guidelines for modern plantation forests. During the course of the study 11 pine marten were radiotracked and their home ranges mapped to examine marten-habitat associations at several spatial scales. Compositional analysis of habitat based on dominant vegetation type showed that martens established their home ranges in areas dominated by mature forest, whilst showing relative avoidance for open heath moor and grazed pasture. Within home ranges, foraging martens utilised patches of graminoid vegetation, such as those typically associated with Microtus voles, in areas with little or no tree canopy cover. These findings provide unequivocal evidence that fine-scale patches of non-forested habitat provide crucial foraging resources for marten, and therefore ought to be provisioned for in forest management plans. To assist the implementation of these requirements in forest planning, a model was developed to predict the fine scale distribution of Microtus-rich foraging habitat for marten using GIS-based habitat variables that are routinely available to forest managers: topographic wetness index, stand tree height and stand basal area. Management recommendations of ways to improve wind-firm plantation forests as habitats for pine marten are provided.

In July 2006 two farms were chosen, one with one year under organic management (OM 1) and a second one under six years of certified organic management (OM 6). Each farm was divided in four quadrants, each one with a surface of 2, 500 m 2. In each quadrant was extracted one sample with six replicas of 188. 5 cm 3 each. Samples were processed in the laboratory using the Berlesse-Tullgren system for the extraction of mesofauna and the subsequent counting and identification of specimens. To compare the organic <b>managed</b> <b>plantation,</b> it was selected a farm under conventional management (CM) with similar climatic and edaphic conditions. On each parcel, taxa richness, abundance, alpha (α) diversity, dominance and beta (β) diversity were determined. Significant differences between diversity values were determined with Student's t test (α = 0. 05). It is concluded that taxa richness is similar in all plantations, independent of agricultural management, whereas abundance of each taxon individually is different between both types of management. There are significant differences in diversity between the organic plantations (OM 1 versus OM 6) and between the conventional (CM) versus organic plantations (P< 0. 05).

Previous work has demonstrated reduced N 2 O emissions in regenerating secondary stands compared to mature forests, yet the importance of species composition in regulating N 2 O production in young forests remains unclear. We measured N 2 O fluxes beneath four native tree species planted in replicated, 21 -yr-old monodominant stands in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica in comparison with nearby mature forest and abandoned pasture sites at two time points (wetter and drier seasons). We found that species differed eight-fold in their production of N 2 O, with slower growing, late-successional species (including one legume) promoting high N 2 O fluxes similar to mature forest, and faster growing, early successional species maintaining low N 2 O fluxes similar to abandoned pasture. Across all species, N 2 O flux was positively correlated with soil nitrate concentration in the wetter season and with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) in the drier season. However, the strongest predictor of N 2 O fluxes was fine-root growth rate, which was negatively correlated with N 2 O emissions at both time points. We suggest that tree-specific variation in growth habits creates differences in both N demand and soil water conditions that may exert significant control on N 2 O fluxes from tropical forests. With the advent of REDD+ and related strategies for fostering climate mitigation via tropical forest regrowth and plantations, we note that species-specific traits as they relate to N 2 O fluxes may be an important consideration in estimating overall climate benefits...|$|E
