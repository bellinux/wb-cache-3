5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after osmium).

Although only certain <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> {{has been}} widely used in solar thermal power and nuclear power system, its leakage was an {{important}} problem. In this paper, the high-temperature <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> leakage is simulated by considering the effects of phase change and flow dynamics. During the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> leakage process, the liquid <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> is cooled by the ground and air, so it will solidify, and then a thin solidification layer of <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> forms. The whole high-temperature <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> leakage process consists of three subprocesses: spreading process, stable solid front formation process and solidification process after leakage. According to the simulation result, the radius of the leakage opening mainly affects the radius of nitrate solidification layer, while the leakage temperature and the leakage velocity will influence both the radius and thickness of salt layer. Besides, different kinds of <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> are also considered, and the radius of <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> solidification layer with SYSU-N 1 is smaller than that with Solar Salt...|$|R

5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} <b>molten</b> <b>salts.</b> These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molten</b> <b>salts</b> will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
30|$|The <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> {{method is}} based on the {{application}} of a salt with a low melting point. In the <b>molten</b> <b>salt,</b> diffusion rates between reaction materials are much higher, and thus powders with a single phase can be obtained at a lower temperature. <b>Molten</b> <b>salt</b> method is an effective approach in the synthesis of highly pure LNMO.|$|R

25|$|Pyroprocessing is {{a generic}} term for {{high-temperature}} methods.

25|$|Inherently safe design (safety by passive {{components}} {{and the strong}} negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of some designs).

40|$|AbstractThe tower type <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> {{solar thermal}} power plant {{consists}} of a large heliostat field consisting of thousands of mirrors with capabilities to track the sun, positions itself in order to reflect the solar energy onto the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> central receiver (MSCR) atop a tower optimally located in the heliostat field. The receiver consists of tube banks arranged in panels with <b>molten</b> nitrate <b>salt</b> flowing within. The concentrated energy from the heliostat field heats the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> from 290 oC to 565 oC while it passes through the receiver. The hot <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> is stored in a tank and utilized to produce steam for power generation as per the demand. The <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> central receiver serves as the interface between the solar field and the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> heat transfer medium.

The state of the art for <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> central receiver technology offer new opportunities to optimize the design and control of the same. This paper discusses the advanced design features and control concepts of the ALSTOM <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> central receiver.

40|$|<b>Molten</b> <b>salt</b> {{is used as}} a {{reaction}} medium in a number of thermochemical and electrochemical processes including a new method named "hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) " for the production of Ti metal powder from TiO 2. A key enabling element of the HAMR process is based on the thermodynamic effect of hydrogen on the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions. Another key of the process is the catalytic effect of <b>molten</b> <b>salt,</b> which is used as the reaction medium. Although the general positive effect of the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> in the HAMR has been recognized, the role and mechanisms of <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> during the reaction are still not well understood. The focus of this work is thus placed on the effects of the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> on the kinetics of the redox of TiO 2 by Mg, and the possible mechanisms by which the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> facilitates the reaction. Experiments were specifically designed to elucidate the role of <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> when TiO 2 is separated from the reducing agent Mg when Mg is in vapor, liquid, or solid states. The results show that the kinetic rate of the reduction can be significantly enhanced by increasing the amount of salt. Although the reduction can take place directly between vapor, liquid, or even solid Mg and TiO 2, the ionization of Mg metal and the transport of Mg- 2 (2 +) through the <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> {{play a major role in}} the reduction of TiO 2 by Mg. The <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> must be a Mg 2 +-bearing <b>salt.</b> A <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> depleted of Mg 2 + is not effective. The possible pathways by which the reaction species form and react with TiO 2 are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some salts are so useful that isotope {{separation}} of the halide is worthwhile. Chlorides permit fast breeder reactors to be constructed using <b>molten</b> <b>salts.</b> Much less {{research has been done}} on reactor designs using chloride salts.

25|$|By contrast, most {{chemical}} oxidation reactions (such as burning coal or TNT) release {{at most a}} few eV per event. So, {{nuclear fuel}} contains at least tenmillion times more usable energy per unit mass than does chemical fuel. The energy of nuclear fission is released as kinetic energy of the fission products and fragments, and as electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} gamma rays; in a nuclear reactor, the energy is converted to heat as the particles and gamma rays collide with the atoms that make up the reactor and its working fluid, usually water or occasionally heavy water or <b>molten</b> <b>salts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract – One of {{the pending}} {{questions}} concerning <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors {{based on the}} 232 Th/ 233 U fuel cycle is the supply of the fissile matter, {{and as a consequence}} the deployment possibilities of a fleet of <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors, since 233 U does not exist on earth and is not yet produced in the current operating reactors. A solution may consist in producing 233 U in special devices containing Thorium, in Pressurized Water or Fast Neutrons Reactors. Two alternatives to produce 233 U are examined here: directly in standard <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors started with Plutonium as fissile matter and then operated in the Th/ 233 U cycle; or in dedicated <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors started and fed with Plutonium as fissile matter and Thorium as fertile matter. The idea is to design a critical reactor able to burn the Plutonium and the minor actinides presently produced in PWRs, and consequently to convert this Plutonium into 233 U. A particular reactor configuration is used, called ‘unique channel’ configuration {{in which there is no}} moderator in the core, leading to a quasi fast neutron spectrum, allowing Plutonium to be used as fissile matter. The conversion capacities of such <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors are excellent. For <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors only started with Plutonium, the assets of the Thorium fuel cycle turn out to be quickly recovered and the reactor’s characteristics turn out to be equivalent to <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors operated with 233 U only. Using a combination of <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors started or operated with Plutonium and of <b>Molten</b> <b>Salt</b> Reactors started with 233 U, the deployment capabilities of these reactors fully satisfy the condition of sustainability...|$|R
50|$|<b>Molten</b> <b>salt</b> baths {{belong to}} the oldest thermal {{cleaning}} systems. Cleaning with <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> is fast: 15 to 30 minutes process time. The process has the risk of dangerous splatters due to chemical reactivity, or other potential hazards, like explosions or toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. Another disadvantage is that parts can be warped or altered in design tolerances. <b>Molten</b> <b>salt</b> baths can be environmentally unfriendly. Due to their disadvantages, they are rarely used today.|$|R
25|$|<b>Molten</b> <b>salts</b> can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and corrosivity increases with temperature. For the primary cooling loop, a material is needed that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, operating experience is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C thermochemical production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and refractory metal based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E
25|$|One design {{weakness}} of the two-fluid design is the necessity for a barrier wall between the core and the blanket region, a wall {{that would have to}} be replaced periodically because of fast neutron damage. Graphite was the material chosen by ORNL because of its low neutron absorption, compatibility with the <b>molten</b> <b>salts,</b> high temperature resistance, and sufficient strength and integrity to separate the fuel and blanket salts. The effect of neutron radiation on graphite is to slowly shrink and then swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and a deterioration in physical properties. Graphite pipes would change length, and may crack and leak. ORNL chose not to pursue the two-fluid design, and no examples of the two-fluid reactor were ever constructed.|$|E
