500|$|According to Ronald D. Moore, Roddenberry [...] "felt very {{strongly}} that contemporary Earth religions would be gone by the 23rd century". Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking {{were not to be}} included. Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of The Next Generation resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that Star Trek had evolved [...] "into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass". Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: [...] "Understand that Star Trek is more than just <b>my</b> political <b>philosophy,</b> <b>my</b> racial <b>philosophy,</b> <b>my</b> overview on life and the human condition."

500|$|Rand {{acknowledged}} Aristotle as {{her greatest}} influence and remarked {{that in the}} history of philosophy she could only recommend [...] "three A's"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, [...] "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of <b>my</b> <b>philosophy</b> myself." [...] However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed. Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a [...] "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.|$|E

In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but <b>my</b> <b>philosophy</b> is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E

The pieces analyzed are Michael Daugherty’s Motown Metal, Stanley Leonard’s Antiphonies, and Ira Hearshen’s second movement, “after the Thunderer” from Symphony on Themes of John Philip Sousa. I seek to highlight the significance of these works to the literature of their mediums, and show how they are valuable pieces of literature in the contemporary repertoire.

2500|$|Stylistically, Rosenthal {{attempted}} {{to recreate the}} elements and themes of the original film. The opening title features a jack-o'-lantern that splits in half to reveal a human skull. In the original, the camera zoomed in on the jack-o'-lantern's left eye. [...] The first scene {{of the film is}} presented through a first-person camera format in which a voyeuristic Michael Myers enters an elderly couple's home and steals a knife from the kitchen. Rosenthal attempts to reproduce the [...] "jump" [...] scenes present in Halloween, but does not film Myers on the periphery, which is where he appeared in many of the scenes of the original. Under Rosenthal's direction, Myers is the central feature of a majority of the scenes. In an interview with Luke Ford, Rosenthal explains,The first movie I ever did [...] was a sequel, but {{it was supposed to be}} a direct continuation. It started one minute after the first movie ended. You have to try hard to maintain the style of the first movie. I wanted it to feel like a two-parter.

[...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage.
