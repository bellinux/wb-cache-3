50|$|Victoria has large {{reserves}} of brown coal {{located in the}} Latrobe Valley, {{to the east of}} Melbourne. Brown coal has a low energy density due to the high moisture content and would have been uneconomic to transport to Melbourne. However, advances in electrical transmission technology allowed electricity to be generated near the fuel source and transmitted to the consumer. Following an overseas tour in 1911, Herbert Reah Harper, engineer with the Melbourne City Council Electricity Supply Department, recognised the potential for Victorian brown coal, after seeing Germany's use, and recommended the establishment of a public utility on the lines of the Ontario Hydro Electricity. He was subsequently appointed to the Victorian Government Brown Coal Advisory Committee (chaired by Department of Mines director Hyman Herman), which reported in September 1917. It recommended the establishment of an Electricity Commission to develop the brown coal reserves, construct a power station and transmission lines. In December 1918, Parliament passed a bill to establish a Commission with both regulatory <b>and</b> <b>investigative</b> <b>powers,</b> including taking over the enforcement of the existing Electric Light and Power Act, which regulated all electricity generators and distributors.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the instances and motivations for noble cause corruption perpetrated by NSW police officers. Noble cause corruption {{occurs when a}} person tries to produce a just outcome through unjust methods, for example, police manipulating evidence to ensure a conviction of a known offender. Normal integrity regime initiatives are unlikely to halt noble cause corruption as its basis lies {{in an attempt to}} do good by compensating for the apparent flaws in an unjust system. This paper suggests that the solution lies in a change of culture through improved leadership and uses the political theories of Roger Myerson to propose a possible solution. Evidence from police officers in transcripts of the Wood Inquiry (1997) are examined to discern their participation in noble cause corruption and their rationalisation of this behaviour. The overall findings are that officers were motivated to indulge in this type of corruption through a desire to produce convictions where they felt the system unfairly worked against their ability to do their job correctly. We have added to the literature by demonstrating that the rewards can be positive. Police are seeking job satisfaction through the ability to convict the guilty. They {{will be able to do}} this through better equipment <b>and</b> <b>investigative</b> <b>powers...</b>|$|R

Half the membership was drawn from the Committee on Government Operations and half from the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. McClellan, Ervin, McCarthy, and Mundt were drawn from Government Operations, and Kennedy, McNamara, Ives, and Goldwater from Labor. An equal number of Democrats and Republicans sat on the Select Committee. Senator McClellan was named chair of the Select Committee, and Republican Senator Irving Ives of New York vice chair. Democrats and liberals, primarily, criticized the committee for not having a neutral attitude toward labor. Only three of the committee's eight members looked on organized labor favorably, and only one of them (Senator Patrick McNamara) was strongly pro-labor. The committee's other five members were strongly pro-management, and that included the Select Committee's Southern conservative chair, John L. McClellan. McClellan hired Robert F. Kennedy as the subcommittee's chief counsel and investigator. Kennedy, too, did not have a neutral opinion of labor unions. Appalled by stories he had heard about union intimidation on the West Coast, Kennedy undertook the chief counsel's job determined to root out union malfeasance and with little knowledge or understanding of or even concern over management misbehavior. The biases of the Select Committee members and its chief counsel, some observers concluded, led the committee to view corruption in labor-management relations as a problem with unions, not management, and management as nothing more than a victim.|$|R

Council Regulation 1419 / 2006 repealed Council Regulation 4056 / 86 and amended Council Regulation 1 / 2003 by including in its scope international tramp services. As arguably {{the most common type}} of arrangement in the tramp sector, it is interesting to see which challenges {{tramp shipping}} pools now face. The Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU (previously Article 81) to maritime transport services provide some assistance to tramp shipping pool participants needing to determine whether their arrangement is in compliance with competition law rules by conducting a self assessment of their arrangement. This thesis will exclusively focus on self assessments of tramp shipping pools. Whilst the Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU to maritime transport services will be to a certain extent assessed, this will only be done in the prevailing analysis of typical clauses of a tramp shipping agreement. These clauses will be the subject of an assessment under Article 101 TFEU and the step by step analysis required to determine whether they infringe Article 101 TFEU. The second chapter of this thesis will expand on the rationale behind self assessments as evidenced by the enforcement <b>and</b> <b>investigative</b> <b>powers</b> of the European Commission along with possible enforcement actions by individuals.

In doing so, he analyzes the modalities of confiscation of criminal origin present in modern legal systems and emphasizes the required standard of proof, as one of the key factors of their particularity. The following is a comparative review of the system for investigating and confiscation of criminal assets in Italy, Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, France and the United States. There are emphasized the normative elements which affect to scope of application of this institute, especially in light of its connection to the criminal proceedings, as well as jurisdiction to realization of the investigation process and procedure of confiscation. In the final part, the author concludes that appropriate social and institutional responses are very important for the effective fight against crime, every time if there is a suspicion about illegally acquired wealth. In doing so, particular attention arouses organized crime, particularly in the light of contemporary global trends, which, unfortunately, significantly affect the possibility of the development of organized crime, and development and/or covering up its financial component. In this sense, the author emphasizes that the basic characteristics of the system for investigation and confiscation of criminal assets connected to the criminal proceedings, which are used in developed European countries and the United States: (1) changed the rules of evidence, which means less convenient role of suspects, (2) the application of this mechanism to a limited number of crimes, which often includes drug trafficking and other serious crimes or organized crime, and (3) the existence of specialized subjects <b>and</b> <b>investigative</b> <b>powers,</b> which vary in relation to the classical powers related to the investigation of criminal offenses...|$|R
