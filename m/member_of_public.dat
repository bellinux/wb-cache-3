[...] Chuck D {{stated that he}} had been introduced to Electric Mud by a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Enemy, which sparked an interest in Muddy Waters' earlier work, and in roots-oriented blues. The documentary series The Blues, produced by Martin Scorsese, depicts the recording band for Electric Mud performing with Chuck D and members of The Roots.

2500|$|After {{arguing that}} both ASCAP and BMI were showing bias towards {{international}} broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations, Pandora announced on June 11, 2013 {{that it would}} attempt to acquire KXMZ, a radio station in South Dakota, under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iHeartRadio (which is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., itself America's largest radio broadcaster). The move was criticized by David Israelite, CEO of the National Music Publishers Association, who declared that Pandora was now [...] "at war with songwriters," [...] and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to [...] "lawsuits and gimmicks" [...] to make its point. However, a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Knowledge praised the move, by stating that it was [...] "a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system {{that is based on}} who wants a license instead of just {{what they want to do}} with the music they’re using." [...] ASCAP also objected to the deal, filing a petition to deny with the FCC. The organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of Pandora's intent to use it as a [...] "bargaining chip" [...] for royalty payments. ASCAP also alleged that Pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure, failing to prove that less than 25% of the company was owned by foreign interests. On January 14, 2014, the FCC denied the acquisition until Pandora [...] "demonstrate adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a {{name that}} touched Tancred, as {{it has all the}} youth of England, {{significant}} of a career that would rescue public life from that strange union of lax principles and contracted sympathies which now form the special and degrading features of British politics. It was borne by one whose boyhood we have painted amid the fields and schools of Eton, and the springtime of whose earliest youth we traced by the sedgy waters of the Cam. We left him on the threshold of public life; and, in four years, Lord Henry had created that reputation which now made him a source of hope and solace to millions of his countrymen. But they were four years of labour which outweighed the usual exertions of public men in double that space. His regular attendance in the House of Commons alone had given him as much Parliamentary experience as fell to the lot of many of those who had been first returned in 1837, and had been, therefore, twice as long in the House. He was not only a vigilant <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> and private committees, but had succeeded in appointing and conducting several on topics which he esteemed of high importance. Add to this, that he took an habitual part in debate, and was a frequent and effective public writer; and we are furnished with an additional testimony, if that indeed were wanting, that there is no incentive to exertion like the passion for a noble renown. Nor should it be forgotten, that, in all he accomplished, he had but one final purpose, and that the highest. The debate, the committee, the article in the Journal or the Review, the public meeting, the private research, these were all means to advance that which he had proposed as the object of his public life, namely, to elevate the condition of the people.|$|E
