5|$|A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Instead {{of trying}} to {{suppress}} his transformation, he successfully transforms in a controlled <b>manner.</b> <b>In</b> a final scene, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him a team is being put together.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> {{which the}} proofs might be {{undermined}} is if 1−0.999... {{simply does not}} exist, because subtraction is not always possible. Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative semigroups, commutative monoids and semirings. Richman considers two such systems, designed so that 0.999... < 1.|$|E

5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what is sought from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which the supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit {{up out of the}} ground to learn the future).|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} {{waterspout}} {{can occur in}} the same vicinity at the same time. As many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on Lake Michigan. The illustration on the left, by James Pollard Espy in 1841, shows the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which one spout, while forming, tends to generate others in its neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive <b>manner.</b> <b>In</b> motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming <b>manner,</b> <b>in</b> complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E

5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest is at stake the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified <b>manner.</b> <b>In</b> a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle {{did not need to be}} complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E
5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified <b>manner.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar <b>manner,</b> <b>in</b> April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
