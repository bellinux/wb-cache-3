Micro-scale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC) to measure the heat release rate per unit mass, heat release capacity and the total heat release of EPS and as well as the fiberglass for milligram specimen mass has been used. Cone colorimeter bench scale burning tests with the EPS specimens and EPS-fiberglass compound specimens have been carried out.

Comparative burning tests on the fire spread tendency of EPS and EPS-fiberglass compound specimens have been carried out.

Researchers measured threshold igniting powers {{as a function of}} beam diameter for butane and propane-air mixtures by laser-heating targets placed on optical fiber tips using a 1064 nm laser. The <b>minimum</b> <b>igniting</b> powers for propane-air and butane-air were about 250 and 300 mW, respectively. Threshold igniting powers for propane-air were approximately proportional to beam diameter for beam diameters from 0. 1 to 2. 0 mm. Results suggest that relatively powerful beams may be used in these atmospheres without causing ignition, provided the beam diameter is controlled. Threshold ignition delay times using 91125 and 62. 51 125 pm fibers were approximately proportional to the inverse square of the laser power. Ignition delays were about 45 ms or longer for laser powers up to 800 mW. Preproduction samples of a commercial optical fuse prevented ignitions under selected test conditions.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (NIOSH, PRL) conducted a study of laser safety in potentially flammable environments. Researchers conducted experiments to estimate the {{mean and standard deviation}} of laser powers needed to ignite 6 % methane-air atmospheres using single mode optical fiber tips covered by two types of iron oxide (Fe 304 and (FeMn) 203) mixed with a ceramic adhesive. The iron oxides, heated by a 1064 nm continuous wave laser, ignited the methane-air mixtures,at similar powers. The <b>minimum</b> <b>igniting</b> power and maximum non-igniting power (10 tests) were 407 and 350 mW, respectively, using a 62. 5 pm fiber.

40|$|Emerging laser {{technologies}} are quickly gaining acceptance {{in the industrial}} workplace. Besides the risk of human exposure, one safety concern with the more intense lasers {{is the potential for}} ignition of flammable gases, vapors, dusts, fibers, or flyings often found in hazardous (classified) industrial settings.

Current federal safety regulations for underground mines contain no specific guidance for evaluating the safety of optoelectronic components such as diode lasers.

40|$|Optical {{technologies}} have progressed {{rapidly in the}} past 15 years. One application of laser technology in underground coal mines currently under evaluation is the remote measurement of explosive methane gas. Federal regulations require that atmospheric monitoring systems used in gassy underground mines where permissible equipment is required shall be intrinsically safe. Mine Safety and Health Administration criteria for the evaluation and testing of intrinsically safe apparatus and associated apparatus contain no specific guidance for optoelectronic components such as diode lasers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting a study to help provide a scientific basis for developing appropriate safety guidelines for optical equipment in under- ground coal mines.

If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the chemical {{evolution of the}} solar neighbourhood which takes into account three families of galactic objects, according to their condensation states: stars, refuses and gas.

We have developed equations for the mass evolution of each family, and have studied the gas metallicity distribution within the framework of the instantaneous recycling approximation, adopting different initial conditions.

And if they do, there's {{got to be a}} consequence. We make directly culpable the people who love him most." [...] Bob Guza on the consequences of Michael's actions. From November 2007 to February 2008, then headwriter, Robert Guza temporarily vacated his post during the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike and was temporarily replaced by Garin Wolf. It was during this time that the first gun violence storyline with Michael unfolded and Michael accidentally shoots Kate Howard (Megan Ward). Though his family uncovers his involvement in the shooting, Michael does not face any consequences. When Guza returned to his post as head writer, rumors circulated on Internet message boards that Michael would be the next casualty of a mob war. According to one poster, Michael would be left comatose in order to [...] "spirit the character off the canvas and <b>ignite</b> the <b>current</b> true-loving Jason's bloodlust for the Zaccharas." [...] It was originally speculated that the character would be killed off the show entirely. The storyline culminated on April 4, 2008 and the character ends up in a coma. [...] "It will play out for months. It's a major, major thing. And the ripple effect on the emotional lives of the characters {{is going to go on}} for maybe years… You're going to see relationships shatter, new relationships forged out of grief and a need to understand the un-understandable. That's the only way you can justify doing it." [...] Bob Guza on the aftermath of Michael's shooting. It was Guza's belief that the most appropriate way to address fan disapproval of the lack of consequences for Michael's recent actions was to have Michael take a bullet himself. According to Guza, the incident also forces—Sonny, Carly, Jason, and Jax—the adults in Michael's life to reevaluate their choices. Guza's dialogue for the Johnny Zacchara character expresses that all four are to blame, stating, [...] "kill each other for power and money and turn around and lie and say that we have honor, that we protect family, that women and children are safe." [...] However, Michael's shooting would not completely do away with the violence in the show. It instead serves as a catalyst forcing those around Michael to make life-altering decisions.|$|R
