40|$|The {{electron}} spin dependence of reactions involving helium metastable atoms is investigated using optical pumping and <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostic</b> techniques. Wigner (1927) proposed that {{electron spin}} angular momentum is conserved in atomic collisions. This rule of elec-tron spin conservation is {{tested in the}} collision of two helium triplet metastable atoms in the afterglow of a helium discharge at 2 Torr: If the Wigner spin rule holds, the above reaction will be dependent upon the spin states of the colliding metastable atoms. A simple theory is developed showing the influence of spin conservation {{on the number of}} electrons produced in such reactions. The effect of electrons resulting from other collisions in the afterglow is introduced, and the two treatments are combined to yield a quantitative prediction of the results of experimental observation. Optical pumping is used to change the normal distribution of the spin states. <b>Microwave</b> <b>diagnostic</b> techniques are used to observe any corresponding change in the number of electrons in the helium afterglow. A very definite and measurable change in electron number density results, indicating that the Wigner spin rule holds in the collision of helium triplet metastable atoms. The experimental data lie within 20 % of the theoretical predictions in the early afterglow period, with the agreement decreasing at later times. [see PDF for formulas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose the}} use of a polycaprolactone (PCL) -based {{thermoplastic}} mesh as a tissue-immobilization interface for microwave imaging and microwave hyperthermia treatment. An investigation of the dielectric properties of two PCL-based ther-moplastic materials in the frequency range of 0. 5 – 3. 5 GHz is pre-sented. The frequency-dependent dielectric constant and effective conductivity of the PCL-based thermoplastics are characterized using measurements of microstrip transmission lines fabricated on substrates comprised of the thermoplastic meshes. We also examine the impact of the presence of a PCL-based thermoplastic mesh on microwave breast imaging. We use a numerical test bed comprised of a previously reported 3 -D anatomically realistic breast phantom and a multi-frequency microwave inverse scattering algorithm. We demonstrate that the PCL-based thermoplastic material and the assumed biocompatible medium of vegetable oil are sufficiently well matched such that the PCL layer may be neglected by the imaging solution without sacrificing imaging quality.

40|$|In {{conventional}} multichannel/imaging <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostics</b> of interferometry, reflectometry, and electron cyclotron emission measurements, a {{local oscillator}} (LO) signal is commonly supplied to a receiver array via irradiation using LO optics. In this work, {{we present a}} 60 -GHz interferometer with a new eight-channel receiver array, called a local oscillator integrated antenna array (LIA). An outstanding feature of LIA is that it incorporates a frequency quadrupler integrated circuit for LO supply to each channel. This enables simple and uniform LO supply to the receiver array using only a 15 -GHz LO source and a coaxial cable transmission line instead of using an expensive 60 -GHz source, LO optics, and a waveguide transmission line.

Kinetic analysis of the instability in the descending auroral flux indicated that the phenomena scaled with the cyclotron frequency.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of EM radiation past wavelength-sized inhomogeneities {{is not well}} understood, yet is of importance for both <b>microwave</b> heating and <b>diagnostic</b> applications in tokamaks. The work presented in this thesis improves this understanding; for this purpose, EMIT- 3 D, a new finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code implementing a cold-plasma model has been written to extend full-wave simulations of propagation in magnetized plasmas to 3 D. The numerical development of the algorithm is presented and supported with a new stability analysis. Studies of propagation past density filaments (`blobs') are presented and compared with 2 D simulations. The synergistic effects of blob density and width on scattering angle are investigated, resulting in the conclusion that even filaments of densities below beam critical density can cause significant deviation in beam paths over a wide frequency range. Further to this, the case of oblique incidence is an explicitly 3 D interaction, and its effects have been calculated. The broadening and defocusing effect on microwave beams caused by realistic edge turbulence, observed in all magnetic fusion devices, is also investigated. A fluid model for edge turbulence is used to produce realistic turbulent profiles, which in turn are used to initialise a set of microwave propagation simulations. The effect of propagation through a turbulent layer is observed even at low fluctuation amplitude, and observed to have a peak when eddy sizes approach beam wavelength.

40|$|Spherical tokamak plasmas are {{typically}} overdense and thus inaccessible to externally-injected microwaves in the electron cyclotron range. The electrostatic electron Bernstein wave (EBW), however, provides {{a method to}} access the plasma core for heating and diagnostic purposes. Understanding {{the details of the}} coupling process to electromagnetic waves is thus important both for the interpretation of <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostic</b> data and for assessing the feasibility of EBW heating and current drive. While the coupling is reasonably well-understood in the linear regime, nonlinear physics arising from high input power has not been previously quantified. To tackle this problem, we have performed one- and two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of the two possible coupling mechanisms, namely X-B and O-X-B mode conversion. We find that the ion dynamics has a profound effect on the field structure in the nonlinear regime, as high amplitude short-scale oscillations of the longitudinal electric field are excited in the region below the high-density cut-off prior to the arrival of the EBW. We identify this effect as the instability of the X wave with respect to resonant scattering into an EBW and a lower-hybrid wave. We calculate the instability rate analytically and find this basic theory to be in reasonable agreement with our simulation results...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{experimental and}} computational studies of air plasmas sustained by high repetition rate high-voltage nanosecond pulses. Current and voltage measurements, together with earlier <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> {{allowed us to}} determine the efficiency of ionization. The energy cost per newly produced electron in these diffuse volumetric plasmas {{was found to be}} on the order of 100 eV, two orders of magnitude lower than in diffuse quasineutral DC and RF plasmas, and comparable with or even lower than in the cathode sheaths of glow discharges. A plasma kinetic model was developed and tested against the experimental Paschen breakdown curve in argon. The kinetic model was found to adequately describe the Paschen curve, and the important role of ionization by fast ions and atoms near the cathode, as well as the increase in secondary emission coefficient in strong fields described in the literature, was confirmed. Modeling of plasma dynamics in high-voltage nanosecond pulses yielded the energy cost of ionization, which was found to agree well with the experimental values.

Preliminary modeling shows that an MHD accelerator placed downstream of the electron beam heated region and a subsequent expansion can increase the test section Mach number. Due to the low static temperature, an efficient artificial ionization in the MHD channel is necessary, for which purpose arrays of electron beams would be used. Similar cold-air hypersonic MHD devices with artificial ionization are attractive for power extraction and hypersonic flow control application. A Mach 3 experimental facility has been developed at Princeton University to demonstrate MHD effects with nonequilibrium ionization.
