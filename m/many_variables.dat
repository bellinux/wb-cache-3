25|$|Machinability can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so <b>many</b> <b>variables.</b> Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.|$|E
25|$|Infinitary logic generalizes first-order {{logic to}} allow {{formulas}} of infinite length.

However, {{it is also possible}} to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely <b>many</b> <b>variables.</b> Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree.

25|$|The {{sampling}} theorem {{is usually}} formulated for functions {{of a single}} variable. Consequently, the theorem is directly applicable to time-dependent signals and is normally formulated in that context.

As a result, images require two independent variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, {{and one for the}} column.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} exact {{inference}} methods are: variable elimination, which eliminates (by integration or summation) the non-observed non-query variables {{one by one}} by distributing the sum over the product; clique tree propagation, which caches the computation so that <b>many</b> <b>variables</b> can be queried at one time and new evidence can be propagated quickly; and recursive conditioning and AND/OR search, which allow for a space-time tradeoff and match the efficiency of variable elimination when enough space is used. All of these methods have complexity that is exponential in the network's treewidth. The most common approximate inference algorithms are importance sampling, stochastic MCMC simulation, mini-bucket elimination, loopy belief propagation, generalized belief propagation, and variational methods.|$|E

An otolaryngologist is a physician/surgeon who specializes in diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck, sometimes with expertise in balance disorders. He or she will usually obtain a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to start to sort out possible causes of the balance disorder. The physician may require tests and make additional referrals to assess the cause and extent of the disruption of balance. The kinds of tests needed will vary based on the patient's symptoms and health status. Because there are so <b>many</b> <b>variables,</b> not all patients will require every test.|$|E
25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with <b>many</b> <b>variables.</b> This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E
25|$|Silver {{staining}} is {{used when}} more sensitive {{method for detection}} is needed, as classical Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining can usually detect a 50ng protein band, Silver staining increases the sensitivity typically 10-100 fold more. This {{is based on the}} chemistry of photographic development. The proteins are fixed to the gel with a dilute methanol solution, then incubated with an acidic silver nitrate solution. Silver ions are reduced to their metallic form by formaldehyde at alkaline pH. An acidic solution, such as acetic acid stops development. Silver staining was introduced by Kerenyi and Gallyas as a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels. The technique has been extended to the study of other biological macromolecules that have been separated in a variety of supports. <b>Many</b> <b>variables</b> can influence the colour intensity and every protein has its own staining characteristics; clean glassware, pure reagents and water of highest purity are the key points to successful staining. Silver staining was developed in the 14th century for colouring the surface of glass. It has been used extensively for this purpose since the 16th century. The colour produced by the early silver stains ranged between light yellow and an orange-red. Camillo Golgi perfected the silver staining {{for the study of the}} nervous system. Golgi's method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety.|$|E
