25|$|With the {{enactment}} of the 1991 Local Government Code, municipalities and cities have both become more empowered to deal with local issues. Regular municipalities now share many of the same powers and responsibilities as chartered cities, but its citizens and/or leaders may feel that it might be to their best interest to get a larger share of internal revenue allotment (IRA) and acquire additional powers by becoming a city, especially if the population has greatly increased and local economy has become more robust. On the other hand, due to the higher property taxes that would be imposed after cityhood, many citizens have become wary of their town's conversion into a city, even if the municipality had already achieved a high degree of urbanization and has an annual income that already exceeds that of many existing lower-income cities. This has been among the cases made against the cityhood bids of many high-income and populous municipalities surrounding Metro Manila, most notably Bacoor and Dasmariñas (which finally became cities in June 2012 and November 2009 respectively), which for many years have been <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>to</b> become cities than others.|$|E

500|$|Kowalski {{feels the}} {{isolation}} of the precogs ensures that they see their visions merely as facts, and removes them from having to justify them. The precogs' ignorance of the results of their visions prevents them from knowing the effectiveness of the program. He feels the PreCrime officers are thus <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>to</b> evaluate their efficacy [...] "than the precogs themselves." [...] In the December 2003 edition of the academic journal Film Criticism, scholar Mark Garrett Cooper moved past that point by asserting that not only have the precogs [...] "yet to fully understand" [...] their visions, but that the process by which the images are interpreted makes it so that no one individual could understand them without the use of the apparatus. The machinery is so effective and precise according to Cooper however, that the [...] "omnipresent system effectively makes capture more certain than the crime." [...] When the system targets Cruise, instead of fleeing, he remains in the vicinity in the belief that the system will, in its inexorable logic, correct itself. The apparatus is considered so infallible according to Cooper that Cruise knows once he is cleared by it, his life can immediately return to normal. In this respect, Cooper feels that [...] "far from indicting a security state, the film legitimates one." [...] Gareth Higgins argues that [...] "he government is playing God, using an all-seeing eye to prevent murder." ...|$|E

When pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>to</b> be President, Romney quoted P. J.

[...] He considered voting for the Libertarian ticket of former Republican Governors Gary Johnson and William Weld, saying that he would [...] "get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for", adding that [...] "if Bill Weld were {{at the top of the}} ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president." [...] In September he called for Johnson to be included in the presidential debates and in October it emerged that Independent candidate Evan McMullin was using an email list of 2.5 million Romney supporters to raise money. McMullin's chief strategist said that it was purchased from Romney for President and that [...] "we'll let other folks discuss what that may mean and certainly never speak for [...] ". A spokeswoman for Romney said that the list had been [...] "rented by several political candidates in the presidential primary, and by countless other political and commercial users in the time since the 2012 campaign" [...] and Romney made no public comment on McMullin's candidacy. Romney and his wife cast early ballots in Utah, but he declined to say who he voted for.|$|E

The {{findings suggest that}} in the case of an emergency, when people believe that there are other people around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>to</b> help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance.

2500|$|Also, an {{editorial}} in the American College of Chest Physicians' (pulmonologists') journal CHEST in 1999 was quite concerned about the Conundrums in Sleep Medicine.

Anyone can open a sleep laboratory, and it seems that just about everyone is." [...] On the accreditation process for sleep laboratories, she continues: [...] "This accreditation, however, is currently not required by most states, or more importantly, by most insurance carriers for reimbursements...

2500|$|The Ode: Intimations of Immortality is {{the most}} celebrated poem {{published}} in Wordsworth's Poems in Two Volumes collection. While modern critics believe that the poems published in Wordsworth's 1807 collection represented a productive and good period of his career, contemporary reviewers were split on the matter and many negative reviews cast doubts on his circle of poets known as the Lake Poets. Negative reviews {{were found in the}} Critical Review, Le Beau Monde and Literary Annual Register. George Gordon Byron, a fellow Romantic poet but not an associate of Wordsworth's, responded to Poems in Two Volumes, in a 3 July 1807 Monthly Literary Recreations review, with a claim that the collection lacked the quality found in Lyrical Ballads. When referring to Ode: Intimations of Immortality, he dismissed the poem as Wordsworth's [...] "innocent odes" [...] without providing any in-depth response, stating only: [...] "On the whole, however, {{with the exception of the}} above, and other innocent odes of the same cast, we think these volumes display a genius worthy of higher pursuits, and regret that Mr. W. confines his muse to such trifling subjects... Many, with inferior abilities, have acquired a loftier seat on Parnassus, merely by attempting strains in which Mr. W. is <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>to</b> excel." [...] The poem was received negatively but for a different reason from Wordsworth's and Coleridge's friend Robert Southey, also a Romantic poet. Southey, in an 8 December 1807 letter to Walter Scott, wrote, [...] "There are certainly some pieces there which are good for nothing... and very many which it was highly injudicious to publish.... The Ode upon Pre-existence is a dark subject darkly handled. Coleridge is the only man who could make such a subject luminous." ...|$|E
