5|$|The {{attack of}} myelin starts {{inflammatory}} processes, which triggers other immune cells {{and the release}} of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.|$|E

Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in August 480 BC, {{when the}} Persian army was {{approaching}} Thessaly, the Allied fleet sailed to Artemisium, and the Allied army marched to Thermopylae. Themistocles himself took {{command of the}} Athenian contingent of the fleet, and went to Artemisium. When the Persian fleet finally arrived at Artemisium after a significant delay, Eurybiades, who both Herodotus and Plutarch suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting. At this point Themistocles accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at Artemisium, and used some of it to bribe Eurybiades to remain, while pocketing the rest. From this point on, Themistocles {{appears to have been}} more-or-less in charge of the Allied effort at Artemisium. Over three days of battle, the Allies held their own against the much larger Persian fleet, but sustained significant losses. However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of Thermopylae to the Persians made their continued presence at Artemisium irrelevant, and the Allies thus evacuated. According to Herodotus, Themistocles left messages at every place where the Persian fleet <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> for drinking water, asking the Ionians in the Persian fleet to defect, or at least fight badly. Even if this did not work, Themistocles apparently intended that Xerxes would at least begin to suspect the Ionians, thereby sowing dissension in the Persian ranks.|$|E

25|$|Vergara's plan {{avoided the}} bloody frontal attack, nullified all defense works, cut any Peruvian {{withdrawal}} {{line to the}} east into the formidable Andes and would have a demoralizing effect on the Peruvians. However, there were no steady roads for movement of Chilean artillery and baggage, no water, no support from the navy was possible and many bottlenecks – where a small force <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> the whole Chilean army either {{on the way to}} Lima, or if it had to withdraw – were a feature of this line of approach. In addition, Vergara's plan required a well trained and disciplined army. Baquedano pushed and eventually succeeded in having his plan adopted.|$|E
25|$|Whipple also {{discloses}} that Japan {{has retained}} its militarism, {{with reference to}} its bushido code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have moved towards a closer military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan and the United States {{are the only two}} major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the Soviet threat. Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of Lord of the Swastika, could accomplish.

500|$|The Allied fleet now rowed from Artemisium to Salamis {{to assist}} with the final {{evacuation}} of Athens. En route Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause. [...] Following Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities that had not surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before marching on the now evacuated city of Athens.

2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of Hume's epistemology {{is the problem}} of induction. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go [...] "beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory". Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is [...] "consistent and conceivable" [...] that nature <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> being regular. Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because {{it has been in the}} past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.|$|E

2500|$|In later years, Lake became {{increasingly}} involved in archeological expeditions. [...] He had remarkable abilities as an organizer and an uncanny skill {{in finding the}} necessary money to fund his various undertakings. [...] In the spring of 1927, with Robert P. Blake, he traveled to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt in order to study biblical manuscripts. [...] While passing through Cairo they met the Egyptologist Alan H. Gardiner who suggested that on their return they <b>might</b> <b>stop</b> by Serabit el-Khadim, {{which was in the}} neighborhood of the monastery, and attempt to locate a number of previously noticed inscriptions in a Proto-Sinaitic script. [...] As Lake remarked in his account of the adventure: [...] "It should be noted that 'in the neighborhood' is a relative matter, for, stated in terms of time instead of space, the monastery was about as far from Serabit as New York is from San Francisco." [...] After a week's journey on camels they were able to locate the site and the inscriptions, as well as identify two additional inscriptions not previously known. [...] "It is a pity that we could not identify the fragments more accurately," [...] Lake noted, [...] "but the temperature in the shade was over 115° Fahr., and the fragments were in the sun and almost too hot to touch" [...] (HTR 21 : 3-4, 5). [...] Lake would return to further investigate the site, as well as the adjacent temple of Hathor in 1930 on an expedition led by him and Blake, this time accompanied by Silva (his future second wife), at the time a Guggenheim fellow, who would handle the photography. [...] In the results of the expedition that were published in 1932, Lake described the camp: [...] "It was not exactly luxurious, and on two days when in rained it was extremely uncomfortable, as we had to spend the whole time in the cave, in which it was impossible to stand upright except in a few spots. [...] The cooking was shared by Professor Blake and Mrs. [...] New, and consisted chiefly of rice, with canned meat dissolved in tomato-sauce and curry-powder" [...] (HTR 25 : 98-99). [...] A final trip was made in 1935; unfortunately, this time Lake was injured during the trip. [...] He received internal injuries when bumped by a camel, but continued the journey, and was carried by litter {{to the top of the}} mountain. [...] After supervising the start of the excavation, his condition worsened and he was rushed to Jerusalem with his wife to receive medical attention. [...] In 1929, Lake approached John Winter Crowfoot of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ) about a joint excavation with some other institutions of Samaria, to complete the earlier work of Harvard's George A. Reisner. [...] The new dig began in 1931 and Lake was there for four seasons (1931–34), accompanied again by Silva and Blake. [...] The joint team also included Eleazar Sukenik from Hebrew University and Kathleen Kenyon from the BSAJ. [...] The excavation would yield many important results. [...] As for accommodations in the camp, Kenyon reports that [...] "although they had a hotel-trained Egyptian cook and Palestinian servants to do the washing, the expedition staff lived in tents, sleeping on camp beds" [...] and [...] "the social life of the dig consisted of having cocktails at the end of the day, playing bridge after dinner, and in 1933, listening to jazz records." [...] In 1938–39, Lake along with Silva and Robert P. Casey from Brown University were allowed to conduct a small excavation of Van Fortress in Turkish Armenia. [...] For 15 years he had been seeking permission from the Turkish government to make the expedition. [...] He told the press that until 1937, [...] "the savage tribes of Turkish Armenia, the Kurds, have not been sufficiently pacified for the government to recommend the trip." [...] Details of the expedition were published in 1939.|$|E
