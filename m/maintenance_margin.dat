40|$|The Chinese {{commodity}} futures markets {{neglect the}} existence of the risk hedge and diversification between futures contracts, thus leading to overcharge futures portfolio holders’ <b>maintenance</b> <b>margins.</b> To this end, this paper proposes a new method, namely, the multivariate t-Copula-POT-PSRM method, which combines three models, that is, the multivariate t-Copula, the peaks over threshold (POT), and the power spectral risk measures (PSRM), to set futures portfolios’ <b>maintenance</b> <b>margins.</b> In the empirical analysis, we first construct four kinds of futures portfolios and set their <b>maintenance</b> <b>margins</b> by using the new method. Then, we introduce two evaluation indicators, namely, the prudence index (PI) and the opportunity cost index (OCI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also compare the outcomes of the two evaluation indicators of the new method with those of the widely used linear additive model. The empirical results show that the new method can, respectively, lower the OCI value of all four kinds of futures portfolios for the In-sample period and the Out-of-sample period without significantly reducing the PI value as against the traditional model, which implies that the proposed method can be used to balance security and investment efficiency in the futures market...|$|R

40|$|Field voles (Microtus agrestis) {{were trapped}} in 14 field margins and their {{behavioural}} and demographic parameters measured. Strong support was found for thresholds in margin width below which vole abundance was extremely low. Narrow margins were male biased with individuals moving greater distances and {{a large proportion of}} males behaved as transient individuals. However, no effect was observed on the age structure or survival of the population. Individuals were able to compensate for the lack of habitat through alterations in their behaviour sufficiently to maintain their survival. Within intensive agro-ecosystems, narrow strips between crops are important links for voles between wider margins and, if available, other more suitable habitats. <b>Maintenance</b> of narrow <b>margins,</b> along with larger areas of suitable habitat, is therefore effective in farmed landscapes for sustaining populations of specialist species where they show sufficient flexibility...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Pitfall {{trapping}} {{was carried}} out in northern Hungarian winter wheat fields and their ad-jacent margins during the growing seasons of three consecutive years, 1992 – 1994. The dominant species of both habitats was the wolf spider Pardosa agrestis (Westring). A total of 8403 adult individuals of 19 families of 149 spider species was identified: 118 species from the winter wheat and 118 from the margins with fewer traps. The efficiency of detecting species by trapping was 90 %, according to the Baule-Mitscherlich extrapolation model. Provided that the sampling effort is the same in both habitats, traps in the margin may catch higher number of individuals and species, than traps located within the field. Calculations, however, indicate that the field, with an area more than a hundred times larger than that of the margins, has a higher total number of species. Although the spider species spectrum of the field and of the margin had a considerable overlap, the Renkonen similarity index indicates that the spider fauna of the two types of habitats were different. Spider assemblages of the margins were more diverse (Rényi diversity), than those of the fields. The species richness of epigeic spiders in our Hungarian winter wheat fields was high, and it was increased by the presence of margins. Thus, {{for the purposes of the}} protection of our fauna and promotion of integrated pest management, establishment and <b>maintenance</b> of <b>margins</b> is strongly desirable...|$|R

We jointly consider the biodiversity effects of land use intensity (i. e. nitrogen application rates and mowing frequencies) and landscape development (e. g. provision of landscape elements) using a rich indicator set and region specific species-area relationships. The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental measures in attaining alternative biodiversity targets is assessed by scenario analysis.

40|$|As {{a public}} policy goal, {{moderation}} of financial instability has gained considerable prominence {{in the face of}} the recent credit contraction. Not surprisingly perhaps, the role of the tax system in exacerbating instances of financial instability has begun to receive some attention in the tax-policy literature. Consistent with the general thrust of that literature, this article explores, in a very preliminary way, how some selected tax-base rule choices line up with an explicit goal of ensuring that the tax system supports regulatory and monetary policies intended to moderate financial instability. The article frames the inquiry in terms of Hyman Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 financial instability hypothesis 2 ̆ 2 as an explanation of the sources of financial instability. Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s work suggests how excessive leverage and risk taking arise and can be seen as defensible targets informing the choice of certain tax base rules, many of which are conventionally characterized in the tax-policy literature as efficiency-reducing concessions to revenue concerns. In this respect, the article draws on tax-expenditure analysis to reconceptualize the possible design of some of these familiar income base rules whose justification is altered somewhat when framed against Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of the sources of financial instability. More particularly, the article reviews the incomplete manner in which dividend imputation systems commonly address a tax bias in favor of corporate debt, and how this incompleteness can be justified as a means to promote <b>maintenance</b> of <b>margins</b> of safety. The article also reviews the case for and design of loss limitations, as applied to financial instruments, as well as restrictions on the deduction of interest expense under the personal income tax as a form of loss limitation. No claim is made to definitively resolve any of these base design issues; nor is there a complete canvassing of all of the possible issues whose resolution is potentially affected by a focus on financial instability. The purpose of the article is the much more modest one of suggesting how standard analyses of interest deductibility and the treatment of losses might be reframed with moderation of financial instability as {{a public policy}} goal...|$|R
40|$|Background. In current {{economic}} downturn, industries {{have to set}} good control on production cost, to maintain their profit <b>margin.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> department as an imperative unit in industries should attain all maintenance data, process information instantaneously, and subsequently transform it into a useful decision. Then act on the alternative to reduce production cost. Decision Making Grid model is used to identify strategies for maintenance decision. However, the model has limitation as it consider two factors only, that is, downtime and frequency of failures. We consider third factor, cost, in this study for failure-based maintenance. The objective {{of this paper is}} to introduce the formulae to estimate maintenance cost. Methods. Fish bone analysis conducted with Ishikawa model and Decision Making Grid methods are used in this study to reveal some underlying risk factors that delay failure-based maintenance. The goal of the study is to estimate the risk factor that is, repair cost to fit in the Decision Making Grid model. Decision Making grid model consider two variables, frequency of failure and downtime in the analysis. This paper introduces third variable, repair cost for Decision Making Grid model. This approaches give better result to categorize the machines, reduce cost, and boost the earning for the manufacturing plant. Results. We collected data from one of the food processing factories in Malaysia. From our empirical result, Machine C, Machine D, Machine F, and Machine I must be in the Decision Making Grid model even though their frequency of failures and downtime are less than Machine B and Machine N, based on the costing analysis. The case study and experimental results show that the cost analysis in Decision Making Grid model gives more promising strategies in failure-based maintenance. Conclusions.

30|$|Farmers {{who fail}} {{to comply with the}} legally binding PPP-specific risk {{mitigation}} measures {{for the protection of the}} environment are subject to fines. Key requirements concern the <b>maintenance</b> of untreated <b>margins</b> of fields adjacent to bodies of water and terrestrial habitats (e.g., marginal biotopes and forest margins). As a rule, however, the yield and crop quality is lower for these untreated areas of farmland, resulting in financial losses as a consequence of compliance with result from observing the spacing requirements [57]. Just as road speed limits tend to be ignored if there are no regular speed checks, there is a risk here too that without regular checks and the prosecution of transgressions, these “inconvenient” regulations will lose their effectiveness and the number of transgressions will increase. However, the extent to which plant protection products are applied in accordance with the regulations in Germany is unclear. The results of the checks carried out by the Federal States are documented in annual reports on the plant protection monitoring programme (www.bvl.bund.de/psmkontrollprogramm), but these do not provide a basis for drawing conclusions. The 2013 report shows that relatively few checks were carried out. Compliance with the spacing requirements for the protection of surface water bodies was only checked for 423 application areas of 421 agricultural holdings in Germany—less than 1 % of all German farms. The main reason for this is the understaffing of the Federal States plant protection services. However, the results from 2013 also point to non-compliance with legal requirements: Transgressions were identified in 10 % of the inspections, but the report does not specify whether these were intentional or due to a lack of relevant knowledge. Intentional breaches of the legal requirements must be countered with increased controls and the penalisation of all transgressions. However, if a lack of specialist knowledge is the root cause, then this calls for a review of the further training courses offered for professional PPP users seeking to obtain the legally required certificate of competence. A central module of the curriculum should explain the importance of nature conservation and environmental protection and the obligation to comply with the relevant legal stipulations.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the <b>maintenance</b> <b>margin</b> requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present an {{alternative}} method of computing volatility for the purpose of setting margins. The setting of margins is closely related to the volatility of futures price changes. If volatility for the forthcoming week is expected to be high, then margins should be set larger. If volatility is expected to be low, then margins may be smaller. Margins posted by trading members are costly to them, so excessively large margins are not desirable. On the other hand, inadequate margins would result in frequent intra-day margin calls, and even if the trading firms do not pose any risk of default, it may reflect unfavorably on the Exchange 2 ̆ 7 s margin management. Thus, the setting of margins is an important exercise. Using an alternative volatility prediction model might give estimates that are significantly closer to the true volatilities than using historical averages of price deviations. In the context of margin setting, the issue is whether margins based on such a model, as compared to margins based on historical averages, would give the Exchange more confidence in typical future price movements being contained within the <b>maintenance</b> <b>margin...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} sentiment from routine financial news and outlines {{the impact of}} the media content on three main index futures contracts of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Bursa Malaysia and Singapore Exchange. The sample selection is based on high a percentage of English usage, thus enabling cross-country comparison. I generate several news factors from routine financial news and find that factors that represent pessimistic market sentiment are more prevalent. Highly pessimistic news factors (Pessimism, Negative and Weak) predict lower returns on the same day, while the negative impact will reverse within the next five days. The finding is consistent with the noise trader theory that investors initially overreact to negative market news and drive the price lower, before the price corrects itself. Since investors are only obligated to pay <b>maintenance</b> <b>margin</b> when trading futures contracts, the trading strategy based on this finding becomes more economically significant compared to paying full price in the spot market. The second part of this thesis examines the role of sentiment in predicting the mean-variance relationship. I argue that sentiment will affect returns volatility. Risk-averse rational investors require higher returns for holding risky assets, which implies positive mean-variance relationships. During a high sentiment period, noise traders dominate the trading activities, leading to a weaker mean-variance trade off. Evidence points to negative mean-variance relationships during a high sentiment period, but the results are mixed during a low sentiment period. The finding suggests that sentiment can be incorporated into the index futures pricing model, through its interaction with returns volatility...|$|E
