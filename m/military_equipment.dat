Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had to be quick, with the army taking only enough <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals Tat and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of soldiers and their dependents on the ground. Sang {{was responsible for the}} movement of vital <b>military</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using air force fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.|$|E
