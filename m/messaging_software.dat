500|$|Comverse {{became a}} market leader in voice <b>messaging</b> <b>software</b> and boomed {{during the late}} 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use. [...] Much of its market focus was on {{wireless}} operators and overseas companies, and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market. The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box. [...] Comverse expanded this application into a full-blown short message service center (SMSC), which receives, buffers, processes, and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network. [...] Comverse branded and productised this as the Intelligent Short Message Service Center, or ISMSC. [...] Typical of telecomm software, it ran on Unix-based platforms, such as UnixWare and later Linux. [...] Comverse's ISMSC found success as a lower-price solution for lower-traffic networks, where it competed with Logica's Telepath solution. [...] Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and Openwave. [...] ISMSC found considerable market penetration, exemplified by all six of Hong Kong's wireless carriers using it.|$|E

[...] Much of its funding came from Israeli government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi-tech firms. [...] By the mid-1990s, {{one of its most}} successful products allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from intercepted communications. [...] Starting in the late 1990s, Comverse's voice <b>messaging</b> <b>software</b> became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use, passing the $1 billion mark in revenues. [...] It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short message service center (SMSC) product. [...] While headquartered in the US, most of the company's research and development was done in Israel; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel's hi-tech industry. [...] It was one of Israel's largest employers of software engineers, was closely followed in the nation's business press, and was the first Israeli-associated company to join the S 500 index.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{significant}} improvements in network interfaces and <b>software</b> <b>messaging</b> layers, <b>software</b> communication overhead still dominates the hardware routing cost in most parallel systems. In this study, we identify the sources of this overhead by relating user communication services to particular network hardware features. Based on {{a detailed analysis of}} the active messages layer on the CM- 5, we assign the <b>software</b> <b>messaging</b> cost to specific user communication services and network features. Our study shows that 50 [...] 70 % of the <b>software</b> cost of <b>messaging</b> can be attributed to providing end-to-end flow control, in-order delivery, and reliable transmission services. This overhead is a direct effect of specific network features [...] arbitrary delivery order, finite buffering, and limited fault-handling [...] and is unlikely to be eliminated through improved software implementations. We conclude that reducing this software overhead requires changing the constraints on messaging layers [...] ...|$|R
