The {{computer}} security community has recently begun re-search {{on the security}} and privacy issues associated with implantable <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> <b>and</b> identified both existing flaws and new techniques to improve future devices. This paper surveys {{some of the recent}} work from the security community and highlights three of the major factors affecting security and privacy solutions for implantable medical devices: fundamental tensions, software risks, and human factors. We also present two challenges from the security community with which the biomedical community may be able to help: access to <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> for in vitro experimentation...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} intends {{to present the}} {{relevance}} of cellulose {{by means of the}} technological foresight study through citing and cited documents from a patent application (WO 9745131 A 1) as indicators of innovation. The European database of patents (espacenet) was used, combining keywords and IPC. The major applicants, countries of publication and uses were mapped. The patent requests collected are mainly distributed in the area of polymers to <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> <b>and</b> therapeutic <b>methods</b> that utilize cellulose. The results obtained revealed that the US was the main country with studies directed to this technological area (18 patent applications) and the major applicant was the company Micro Therapeutics Inc. Therefore, we can understand that this is a promising technology that may reflect in an increase of R&D activities and in the patent deposits in this area...|$|R
5000|$|... “Industry” {{is a broad}} {{concept that}} {{includes}} manufacturing industries, agricultural, fishing and forestry industries, mining industries, commercial industries, and service industries. Medical industries are excluded from “industries”, however, and grants of patents for inventions of acts of medical treatment are not recognized, {{on the ground that}} they are not industrially applicable. This exclusion stems from the ethical consideration that diagnoses and treatments available to medical practitioners in their treatment of patients must not be limited in any way by the presence of any kind of patent rights, and it is a legal construction adopted {{due to the lack of}} any statutory provision expressly denying the validity of patent rights vis-à-vis acts of medical treatment. However, patent rights can be obtained over aspects of medical treatment including pharmaceuticals <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>methods</b> of their manufacture (note that Article 69(3) of the Patent Act however stipulates certain limitations on the effect of patent rights obtained for pharmaceuticals).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Long-term {{multicentre}} {{studies are}} subject to numerous factors that may affect the integrity of their conclusions. Quality control and standardization of data collection are crucial to minimise the biases induced by these factors. Nevertheless, tools implemented to manage biases are rarely described in publications about population-based cohorts. This report aims to describe the processes implemented to control biases in the Constances cohort taking lung function results as an example. Methods Constances is a general-purpose population-based cohort of 200, 000 participants. Volunteers attend physical examinations at baseline and then every 5  years at selected study sites. <b>Medical</b> <b>device</b> specifications <b>and</b> measurement <b>methods</b> have to comply with Standard Operating Procedures developed by experts. Protocol deviations are assessed by on-site inspections and database controls. In February 2016, more than 94, 000 participants yielding around 30 million readings from physical exams, had been covered by our quality program. Results Participating centres accepted to revise their practices {{in accordance with the}} study research specifications. Distributors of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> were asked to comply with international guidelines and Constances requirements. Close monitoring enhanced the quality of measurements and recordings of the physical exams. Regarding lung function testing, spirometry acceptability rates per operator doubled in some sites within a few months and global repeatability reached 96. 7  % for 29, 772 acceptable maneuvers. Conclusions Despite Constances volunteers being followed in multiple sites with heterogeneous materials, the investment of significant resources to set up and maintain a continuous quality management process has proved effective in preventing drifts and improving accuracy of collected data...|$|R

The first approach used PS-SME and cumulative incidence (time-to-event), the second approach used PS-SME and cumulative risk (Data Extraction and Longitudinal Trend Analysis [DELTA]), and the third approach used PS-ML and cumulative risk (embedded feature selection). Safety-signal surveillance was conducted for eleven dual-chamber ICD models implanted at least 2, 000 times over 3 years. Between 2006 and 2010, there were 71, 948 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who received dual-chamber ICDs. Cumulative device-specific unadjusted 3 -year event rates varied for three surveyed safety signals: death from any cause, 12. 8 %– 20. 9 %; nonfatal ICD-related adverse events, 19. 3 %– 26. 3 %; and death from any cause or nonfatal ICD-related adverse event, 27. 1 %– 37. 6 %. Agreement among safety signals detected/not detected between the time-to-event and DELTA approaches was 90. 9 % (360 of 396, k= 0. 068), between the time-to-event and embedded feature-selection approaches was 91. 7 % (363 of 396, k=– 0. 028), and between the DELTA and embedded feature selection approaches was 88. 1 % (349 of 396, k=– 0. 042). Conclusion: Three statistical approaches, including one machine learning method, identified important safety signals, but without exact agreement. Ensemble methods may be needed to detect all safety signals for further evaluation during <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> surveillance.
