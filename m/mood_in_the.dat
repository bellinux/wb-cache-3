5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} the result of a {{descriptive}} qualitative research which examine to what extent the theory of Interpersonal Metaphor of mood postulated by Halliday (1994) is relevant to be applied to the verses of the Holy al-Qur’an. The Interpersonal Metaphor applied in this survey covers the three kinds of mood which constitute indicative mood, interrogative mood and imperative mood. This work, however, does not cover the Interpersonal Metaphor of modality. The result shows that some verses of the Holy al-Qur’an use <b>the</b> transference of <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> conveying messages: some indicative <b>moods</b> are expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interrogative and imperative, some imperative <b>moods</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> indicative and interrogative, and some interrogative <b>moods</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> indicative and imperative.

The only evidence of mood fluctuation over <b>the</b> menstrual cycle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concurrent reports was that normally cycling women report-ed more pleasant <b>moods</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follicular and menstrual phase than did men and women on oral contraceptives.

Once normal play resumed with Paul Collingwood England {{continued}} to dominate, setting their targets high with a 69 partnership before Collingwood gloved Murali to short leg for 238/5 {{and was replaced by}} skipper Andrew Flintoff who was surprisingly tame. Pietersen went on to hit three 4s in as many balls before hitting a reverse-sweeper 6 but then being bowled lbw by Murali, achieving three Test centuries in consecutive Tests. After the departure of their number four, England crumbled hopelessly from 290/6 to 295 all out just before tea. The <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English camp was swiftly revitalised by the hot drinks as Hoggard bowled Upul Tharanga for a golden duck, having been bowled for nothing in the first innings. Two more men went to see the tourists at 43/3 with a 111 run deficit and before the close of play Geraint Jones redeemed his missed catch to Thilan Samaraweera by stumping soon after, unbeaten opener Michael Vandort remained at the crease for 30 when play closed at 7:30 due to the missed play earlier. After persistent rain over Birmingham, play was started at 4:45 and the fifth wicket held up for 125, helping them take the lead. Both batsmen fought off good efforts by Panesar and Plunkett but eventually it was Hoggard who made the only breakthrough on a day where Sri Lanka stood tall for a short day at 194/5.|$|E
