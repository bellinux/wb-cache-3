It also investigates the possible effect of the input acceleration on the degree of this <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling.</b> A sensitivity study is also done to assess the dependence of the degree of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the geometry of the beams that form the proof mass support system. By doing a modal analysis using both a Finite Element and a mass-spring model of the accelerometer, it is shown that <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> does exist between the two oscillators, and {{is a function of the}} input acceleration on the device. It is also shown that the effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the frequencies of the oscillators are the greatest at the input acceleration where the oscillator's frequencies, if completely uncoupled, would approach the same value. Finally, several design changes are suggested that reduce the amount of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the oscillators. by Kara Susanne Meredith. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.)

40|$|A Sturmian {{theory of}} three-body {{recombination}} is presented {{which provides a}} unified treatment of bound states, quasi-bound states, and continuum states. The Sturmian representation provides a numerical quadrature of the two-body continuum which {{may be used to}} generate a complete set of states within any desired three-body recombination pathway. Consequently, the dynamical calculation may be conveniently formulated using the simplest energy transfer mechanism, even for reactive systems which allow substantial rearrangement. The Sturmian theory generalizes the quantum kinetic theory of Snider and Lowry [J. Chem. Phys. 61, 2330 (1974) ] to include metastable states which are formed as independent species. Steady-state rate constants are expressed in terms of a pathway-independent part plus a non-equilibrium correction which depends on tunneling lifetimes and pressure. Numerical results are presented for H$_ 2 $ recombination due to collisions with H and He using quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupled</b> states and infinite order sudden approximations.

An in-house software is developed based on finite element method that can predict in-process growth of nugget diameter, penetration and electrode-sheet contact diameter for different combinations of welding current, weld time, electrode force. Non-linear, temperature-dependent, thermo-physical material properties as well as latent heat of fusion/solidification have been considered. An exponential decay of initial contact resistance is considered with different values of initial contact resistance for different surface conditions of aluminium alloys. It is observed that the formation of weld nugget is completed within the very first cycle considering a 50 Hz AC power supply. Increase of welding current enhances the area of molten zone substantially. Change in the initial value of contact resistance does not influence the overall nugget zone significantly. Overall, the present work indicates that such a simulation model can be very useful as an off-line monitoring tool to estimate the influence of process parameters on the final weld dimensions...|$|E

The stochastic stress and electric-potential boundary {{conditions of the}} piezoelectric hollow cylinder are converted into homogeneous boundary conditions by transformations that yields the electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> partial differential equations of motion with damping and stochastic excitations. The equation for electric potential is integrated radially to obtain the electric potential {{as a function of}} displacement, and the displacement is expanded as a series in terms of the Legendre polynomials.

40|$|By {{virtue of}} various {{theoretical}} techniques, the fundamental mechanisms responsible for intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in isolated molecules are studied in this thesis. One such mechanism, the nonlinear resonance, is examined {{in some detail}} for several systems. In particular, nonlinear stretch-bend resonances {{in a series of}} isotopically substituted methanes are predicted to have a large effect on the spectral properties of those molecules. By using a semiclassical analysis, the general properties of stretch-bend interactions are further examined, and the quantum mechanical manifestations of classical resonances are characterized in detail. A related problem, the role of classical resonances in the multiphoton absorption process by an anharmonic oscillator, is also analyzed. In addition, it is demonstrated that the quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupled</b> equations which describe the fundamental IVR process may be simplified. This simplification is achieved by virtue of an "adiabatic" approximation for those state amplitudes which are sufficiently off-resonant with (i. e., different in energy from) the experimentally prepared quantum state. The approximate coupled equations are based on an effective Hamiltonian which contains renormalized self-energies and interactions between the zeroth-order quantum states. This formalism may be applied to describe the quasidissipative flow of probability out of an initially prepared vibrational state in a large molecule, and it may also be adapted to treat multiphoton absorption processes in polyatomic molecules when one or more lasers are present. ...|$|E
