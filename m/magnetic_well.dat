50|$|The H-1 {{flexible}} Heliac is a three field-period helical axis stellarator {{located in}} the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering at Canberra, Australia. Optimisation of the H-1 power supplies for low current ripple allows precise control of the ratio of secondary (helical, vertical) coil to primary (poloidal, toroidal) coil currents, resulting in a finely tunable magnetic geometry. Slight variation in the current ratio between shots (plasma discharges) in a sequence corresponds to a high resolution parameter scan through magnetic configurations (i.e.: rotational transform profile, <b>magnetic</b> <b>well).</b> The programmable control system allows for repetition rates of around 30 shots per hour, limited by data acquisition time and magnet cooling time.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} spin and charge {{dynamics}} of electrons in n-doped II [...] VI semiconductor multiple quantum wells when {{one or more}} quantum wells are doped with Mn. The interplay between strongly nonlinear inter-well charge transport and the large tunable spin-splitting induced by exchange interactions with spin-polarized Mn ions produces interesting new spin dependent features. The tunneling current between quantum wells can be strongly spin polarized and, under certain conditions, can develop self sustained oscillations under a finite dc voltage. The spin polarization oscillates in both magnetic and nonmagnetic quantum wells and the time average in <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> can differ from its zero-voltage value. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the amplitude of the spin polarization oscillations depends {{on the distribution of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> within the sample.

40|$|In the Tohoku University Heliac (TU-Heliac), high-beta-discharge {{experiments}} {{were done with}} hydrogen storage electrode biasing by varying the magnetic configurations and the magnetic field. High-beta plasma was produced in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> and hill configurations (the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> depth at the last closed flux surface (LCFS) were 3. 3 % and- 1. 6 %) at the magnetic field on axis B 0 = 0. 075 T with hydrogen storage electrode biasing. The electron density increased within a short time, and this density increment was degraded. In both the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> and hill configurations, this density increment was observed; however, the rates of increase and decrease in the well and hill configurations were different. When short-term high-pressure plasma was produced in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> configuration, the local beta value was the highest, about 5 -fold that before biasing. The fluctuations of ion saturation current observed at the electrode biasing differed between the well and hill configurations.

40|$|Ion kinetic {{effect in}} the tilt {{disruption}} of a field-reversed configuration is investigated {{by means of a}} three-dimensional particle simulation. It is found that the tilt disruption is completely suppressed when bar{s} approx 1, where bar{s} measures the number of ion gyroradii over the radial distance between the magnetic separatrix line and the field-null line. Prolate <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> is formed around the field-null line, in which ions do not execute gyration but meander along the field-null line. For the case of bar{s} approx 1 a large number of ions exist in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> and move on stable orbits around the major axis with the average rotation velocity nearly equal to half of the thermal velocity. As bar{s} becomes larger than 1, the number of ions in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> decreases and the stabilization effect is reduced. It is also found that an anisotropy is created in the ion thermal pressure profile owing to the anisotropy of the meandering orbits and that the electric field fluctuation always remains at a low level, thus the electric field plays no essential role in the tilt stabilization. ...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{transport}} through diluted {{magnetic semiconductor}} nanostructures is investigated. We have considered a II–VI multiquantum well nanostructure whose wells are selectively doped with Mn. The {{response to a}} dc voltage bias may be either a stationary or an oscillatory current. We have studied the transition from stationary to time-dependent current {{as a function of}} the doping density and the number of quantum wells. Analysis and numerical solution of a nonlinear spin transport model shows that the current in a structure without magnetic impurities is stationary, whereas current oscillations may appear if at least one <b>well</b> contains <b>magnetic</b> impurities. For long structures having two <b>wells</b> with <b>magnetic</b> impurities, a detailed analysis of nucleation of charge dipole domains shows that self-sustained current oscillations are caused by repeated triggering of dipole domains at the <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> and motion towards the collector. Depending on the location of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> and the voltage, dipole domains may be triggered at both wells or at only one. In the latter case, the well closer to the collector may inhibit domain motion between the first and the second well inside the structure.

A Chapman-Enskog-like approach is adopted with the time-dependent distribution function written as the sum of a dynamic Maxwellian and a kinetic distortion expanded in Legendre polynomials. The drift kinetic equation is solved on a discrete grid in normalized speed, and an FFT algorithm is used to treat the onedimensional spatial domain along the magnetic field. The dependence of the steady-state temperature on collisionality and <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> depths is discussed in detail.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{difference of}} neoclassical bootstrap current {{and its effects}} on MHD equilibria are described for the CHS heliotron/torsatron and the CHS-qa quasi-axisymmetric stellarator. The direction of bootstrap current strongly depends on collisionality in CHS, whereas it does not in CHS-qa because of quasi-axisymmetry. In the CHS configuration, it appears that enhanced bumpy (Bs 1) and sideband components of helical ripple (By 1) {{play an important role in}} reducing the magnetic geometrical factor, which is a key factor in evaluating the value of bootstrap cuffent, and determining its polarity. The bootstrap current in CHS-qa is theoretically predicted to be larger than that in CHS and produces significant effects on the resulting rotational transform and magnetic shear. In the finite B plasmas, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>well</b> becomes deeper in both CHS and CHS-qa and its region is expanded in CHS.

40|$|Resonant quantum {{tunneling}} of the Néel vector between nonequivalent <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> is investigated theoretically for a nanometer-scale single-domain antiferromagnet with biaxial {{crystal symmetry}} {{in the presence}} of an external magnetic field applied along the easy anisotropy axis, based on the two-sublattice model. Both the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin exponent and the preexponential factors are evaluated in the instanton contribution to the tunneling rate for finite and zero magnetic fields by applying the instanton technique in the spin-coherent-state path-integral representation, respectively. The quantum interference or spin-parity effects induced by the topological phase term in the Euclidean action are discussed in the rate of quantum tunneling of the Néel vector. In the absence of an external applied magnetic field, the effect of destructive phase interference or topological quenching on resonant quantum tunneling of the Néel vector is evident for the half-integer excess spin antiferromagnetic nanoparticle. In the weak field limit, the tunneling rates are found to oscillate with the external applied magnetic field for both integer and half-integer excess spins. We discuss the experimental condition on the applied magnetic field which may allow one to observe the topological quenching effect for nanometer-scale single-domain antiferromagnets with half-integer excess spins. Tunneling behavior in resonant quantum tunneling of the magnetization vector between nonequivalent <b>magnetic</b> <b>wells</b> is also studied for a nanometer-scale single-domain ferromagnet by applying the similar technique, but in the large noncompensation limit...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the transport improvement in helical magnetic axis stellarator is proposed. First of all, the proposal is presented for L= 1 helical axis systems with roughly quasihelical symmetry, then its compatibility with equilibrium and stability would be optimized and controlled.

The important features {{is to find the}} field modifications to satisfy the other two requirements. The reduced εT configuration is found to be nearly omnigenous while far from quasihelical, giving rise to the possibility of stellarator design study in a wider parameter domain than quasisymmetry approaches.
