25|$|The Executive Mansion was retaken by Democrats in 1974 and {{remained}} under Democratic control for 20 years under Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo. Latecentury Democrats became more centrist, including US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1977–2001) and New York City Mayor Ed Koch (1978–1989), while state Republicans began to align {{themselves with the}} more conservative national party. They gained power through the elections of Senator Alfonse D'Amato in 1980, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> in 1993, and Governor George Pataki in 1994.

In 1984, Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry the state, although Republican Michael Bloomberg served as New York City mayor in the early 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, {{as they did}} about the Democrats, about {{potential}} Republican candidates for President in 2008. In November 2006, Former New York City <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain. The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age {{and support of the}} unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul. MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> {{closed the}} Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. The City {{did not have}} a {{subsequent}} plan for garbage disposal. An interim system was put in place in which most of the city's garbage was trucked out of the city to land fills in other states. This generated an unacceptable amount of truck traffic in low-income neighborhoods, leading to exacerbated air pollution. In 2006 Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation establishing a new solid waste management plan, which will use barges and trains to export 90% of the city’s 12,000 daily tons of residential trash. Under the previous scheme trucks and tractor-trailers were used for 84% of the trash. Passage of the new legislation was delayed by opponents in a Manhattan neighborhood who protested the use of a marine transfer station in the Hudson River Park. Environmentalists and social activists argued the plan promoted environmental justice because no one borough or neighborhood would bear a disproportionate burden under the proposal, and they therefore supported it.|$|E

500|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{starting}} on September 15, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued {{for much of the}} Eastern Seaboard, including portions of New York. These warnings were discontinued by September 19. New York City <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> urged private businesses to close early and ordered non-emergency city workers to return home between 12 pm and 3 pm on September 17. For the first time since 1996, in an [...] "almost unprecedented" [...] decision, schools in the city were closed due to the hurricane's threat. On September 16, 20 shelters were opened, able to accommodate as many as 70,000 people. Lawrence Reuter, president of New York City Transit, reported that in an effort to prevent flooding, storm drains were cleared and other precautions were taken. People were urged to remove loose objects that could be blown around by high winds. By September 16, city officials had distributed 50,000 brochures on preparing for the storm. Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney advised residents of Fire Island to evacuate before the storm made leaving by ferry impossible, and in Long Beach, officials readied emergency vehicles. Also, 4,000 sandbags were given out there in anticipation of high storm tides.|$|E

2500|$|An {{investigation}} by the New York City Comptroller's office in October 2016 showed that Trump and/or the Donald Trump Foundation may have failed to honor at least one pledge to charities established to provide relief for victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump had made a pledge of $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund on The Howard Stern Show in late September 2001.

2500|$|The city rebounded in the mid- {{and late}} 1990s {{due to the}} steady {{expansion}} of the national economy and the Wall Street stock market boom that took place concomitantly, {{as well as the}} precipitous drop in crime, although stubbornly high unemployment remained a local problem. <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> a former federal prosecutor, is credited by many for revitalizing Times Square and making the city more [...] "liveable" [...] by cracking down on crime. Changes in the worldwide economy during this time proved to be especially favorable to New York because of its highly developed transportation and communications infrastructure, as well as its massive population base. Over the course of the decade, the city's image transformed from being one of a bygone, decaying metropolis to one of the world's preeminent [...] "global cities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Envisioned in 1999 by <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> and Borough President Claire Shulman {{to revive}} the park, the {{original}} concept of a moderately sized pool was enlarged to an Olympic-size pool with an indoor ice rink as well. [...] The building's foundation was completed in 2001 but after the September 11 attacks the project was halted due to funding issues. Finally, in 2003, the Natatorium was designated as the swimming arena in New York City's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Parks Department partnered with the Economic Development Corporation and plans re-commenced for New York City to build its first public indoor swimming pool in 40 years. Upon its completion in February 2008, the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Natatorium and Ice Rink became the largest recreation complex ever built in a city park at 110,000 square feet.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, the Brooklyn Museum did battle with then-New York <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> over the {{exhibition}} [...] "Sensation," [...] with charges of presenting sexually and religiously offensive art. [...] In {{the face of all}} this, and the series of battles in the American culture war, The Art of the Motorcycle stood as a counterpoint, and possibly the high-water mark for the other kind of museum show: [...] not offensive, not exclusive, but welcoming to the sensibilities of the general public. [...] People who were baffled and irritated by modern and postmodern art could feel good about this show. [...] The financing, while critics cried foul, was private. [...] The show was by nature consented to directly by those who paid the bills, rather than passive taxpayers, and it was aimed at keeping the audience happy, rather than inciting rage with, say, US flags stuffed into toilets, as had been done in one famous museum exhibit decades earlier.|$|E

25|$|Although Queens {{is heavily}} Democratic, it is {{considered}} a swing county in New York politics. Republican political candidates who do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections.

Republican State Senator Serphin Maltese represented a district in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo.

2500|$|In the mid-1990s, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> led {{an effort}} {{to clean up the}} area, an effort that is {{described}} by Steve Macek in Urban Nightmares: The Media, the Right, And the Moral Panic Over the City: Security was increased, pornographic theatres were closed, and “undesirable” low-rent residents were pressured to relocate, and then more tourist-friendly attractions and upscale establishments were opened. Advocates of the remodeling claim that the neighborhood is safer and cleaner. Detractors have countered that the changes have homogenized or [...] "Disneyfied" [...] the character of Times Square and have unfairly targeted lower-income New Yorkers from nearby neighborhoods such as Hell's Kitchen. The changes were shaped in large part by the actions of The Walt Disney Company, which bought and restored the New Amsterdam Theatre's after several attempts at redevelopment had fallen through. As part of a contract with Disney, officials from the city and state evicted the pornographic theaters and contracted with Madame Tussauds and AMC Theatres to move onto 42nd Street. This spurred the construction of new office towers, hotels, and tourist attractions in the area.|$|E
2500|$|The Sensation {{exhibition}} of {{works from the}} Saatchi Collection was controversial in both the UK and the US, though in different ways. [...] At the Royal Academy press-generated controversy centred on Myra, a very large image of the murderer Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey, but when the show travelled to New York City, opening at the Brooklyn Museum in late 1999, it was met with intense protest about The Holy Virgin Mary by Chris Ofili, which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was smeared with elephant dung, although Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collage images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional cherubim. Among other criticism, New York <b>Mayor</b> <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> who had seen {{the work in the}} catalogue but not in the show, called it [...] "sick stuff" [...] and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the Brooklyn Museum hosting the show, because [...] "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion." ...|$|E
