Dark matter annihilations in the Galactic halo inject {{relativistic}} {{electrons and}} positrons {{which in turn}} generate a synchrotron radiation when interacting with the galactic magnetic field.

40|$|Aim The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give an {{overview}} of the imaging techniques that are currently used to study the effects of exercise on bone architecture. Current knowledge It is now widely accepted that the prevention of osteoporosis must be initiated in childhood, because the immature skeleton is more responsive to physical loading. Exercise recommendations for bone health promotion must consider the effects of loading not only on the more traditional measures of bone mineral content and macroarchitecture, but also on the microarchitecture and structural properties of the skeleton. The latter requires high precision 3 D methods like quantitative computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> resonance imaging. <b>Prospects</b> Imaging resolutions used most commonly in exercise studies of children have sufficient precision to assess bone density and gross geometry. However, they remain insufficient to clearly depict and quantify the trabecular bone microarchitecture in vivo in humans. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{piezoelectric}} and seismo-electrokinetic phenomena are manifested by {{electrical and}} electromagnetic processes {{that occur in}} rocks {{under the influence of}} elastic oscillations triggered by shots or mechanical impacts.

40|$|The Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology (LBI ArchPro) {{together}} with its partner the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) has developed motorized magnetic prospection systems to survey entire archaeological landscapes within reasonable time at high spatial sampling resolution. With these novel prospection system, the LBI ArchPro has successfully surveyed in total more than 32 square kilometres {{over the past}} five years resulting in magnetic maps containing millions of anomalies. While data collection data positioning and the processing of the data have been automated (with exception of the operation of the survey vehicles), the outlining (data segmentation and classification) and interpretation of the <b>prospected</b> <b>magnetic</b> anomalies has become in regard of large amount of generated data a tedious, very time consuming, so far manually conducted task. In order to speed up the interpretation process we have therefore developed a workflow and algorithms for the automatic detection, outlining and classification of magnetic anomalies. Relevant magnetic prospection anomalies are automatically classified into two classes, which are "iron litter'' objects that are located dosed co the surface, and deeper reaching individual "pit" objects. Based on this classification we calculate several physical and geometrical properties for each object and export this data to a Geographical Information System (GIS) for further interactive classification and subsequent data interpretation...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured {{ferromagnetic}} {{materials have}} gained considerable attention recently {{for use in}} novel devices {{in the areas of}} data storage, microwave signal processing and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Structural modifications allow a control over the internal magnetic properties of the system down to the nanoscale. Lateral confinement gives rise to a distribution of demagnetisation fields in the plane of the thin film which can create interesting effects on static and dynamic magnetic properties. In the context of this dissertation, nanostructuring is used as a means to engineer the static and dynamic response of magnetic systems. In particular, periodic arrays of holes embedded in continuous films are studied. With patterning one observes the emergence of an anisotropic field dependence as well as the emergence of non-uniform spin precession modes due to the dipole distribution at the film interfaces. These properties were probed primarily using a technique called broadband ferromagnetic resonance, whereby a microwave field drives the local spin dynamics of the magnetic system. A way to further modify the magnetic properties induced due to the symmetry of the periodic structuring is by introducing an unidirectional field contribution which is characteristic of an exchange biased system. It was found that the magnetic pole distribution in antidots is particularly sensitive to the effects of exchange bias, giving rise to an asymmetric frequency response with respect to the applied field. The asymmetric microwave properties of an exchange biased FeMn/NiFe system with antidot structuring, obtained using electron beam lithography, are investigated. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra exhibited several magnetostatic spin wave modes with 8 -fold and 4 -fold anisotropy components. Moreover, it was observed that large frequency asymmetries are obtained along the directions 10 degrees off the main antidot lattice axes, as result of the competing anisotropies. Brillouin light scattering measurements showed the presence of a magnonic band gap as expected for this type of structure. To interpret these observations, the spin precessional modes obtained experimentally are correlated with localised mode profiles obtained by micromagnetic simulations. This hybrid structure is a good candidate for applications such as selective microwave filtering and for use in multi-state <b>magnetic</b> logic. The <b>prospects</b> of using patterned exchange biased systems to engineer microwave properties is greatly increased if one goes beyond the 2 -dimensional perspective. In multilayered structures, one can modify the magnetic properties layer-by-layer to achieve the desired response. This concept is demonstrated here by using a three dimensional structure in which an exchange biased and a free magnetic layer are stacked upon one another and patterned with an antidot configuration. The exchange bias acts as a pinning field for one layer, while the free layer reverses, promoting a zero net moment state. Interlayer dipole interactions are found to result in the partial cancellation of the microwave response. Micromagnetic simulations support the existence of a diminished microwave response which was confirmed by FMR measurements of an equivalent structure. The net moment cancellation, indicative of the antiparallel alignment, was observed on a Lorentz differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with an FMR probe, which was designed and built for the purpose. This unique tool allows access to complex microwave response while the ground state of a nanostructured film is imaged via Lorentz microscopy. From the magnetostatic viewpoint, our results differ greatly from previous studies in a way that this sample shows distinct magnetic history and the near remanence states exhibit unique magnetic textures: magnetic vortices. The applicability of the TEM in-situ FMR probe was extended to the mapping of radio frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields using low angle diffraction (LAD) imaging. The electron beam, propagating in a sample free environment, experiences the field distribution generated by the microstrip waveguide, which alters the electron amplitude and phase, as described by the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and results in different intensity profiles at the detector. As the microwave frequencies were varied, the different polarisation states are imaged directly. Microwave simulations allowed the EM field distribution to be calculated, which was used to reproduce the LAD results. A knowledge of the near field distribution in antennas is often a challenging task so this technique opens up new opportunities for planar devices operating in high vacuum conditions...|$|R

30|$|An easy-to-use {{computer}} algorithm {{was developed}} in MATLAB to estimate the depths {{to the top of}} thin dike-like causative bodies by using higher-order horizontal derivatives of observed magnetic data. The proposed approach is based on the analyses of the numerical second-, third-, and fourth-order horizontal derivative anomalies obtained from the observed magnetic data by using some filters of successive graticule spacings. The nonlinear depth determination problem is rapidly solved in the code. The accuracy and effectiveness of the developed code were tested on synthetically produced magnetic datasets with and without noise. Additionally, the usability of the algorithm was evaluated by reanalysing some well-known magnetic anomalies from {{different parts of the world}} (USA, Sweden, and Canada). The results show that the outputs of the algorithm yielded satisfactory solutions, which are in good agreement with the actual, previously published, and PSO results. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not need a priori information for determining the depth and can be easily used for short or long profile datasets having anomalies due to single thin dike-like sources. Further, the solutions are independent from the magnetization and ambient field directions, namely, inclination and declination angles. Consequently, the developed algorithm using higher-order horizontal derivative analyses was proved useful in interpreting magnetic anomalies observed over single isolated thin dike-like source bodies and may be an efficient tool in <b>magnetic</b> <b>prospecting.</b> Furthermore, one of the greatest benefits of the developed code is that it is an open source algorithm. Thus, it is easy to modify and adapt the algorithm to suit the benefits of the other researchers studying similar or special topics.|$|E
40|$|The {{place name}} Aiali is sited on lowland between the medieval town of Grosseto and the Roman town of Roselle in central Italy. The site {{discussed}} in this paper was detected from the air during the Aerial Archaeology Research School organized by the University of Siena in 2001 (Campana et al. 2006). Aerial survey allowed us to recognize an area within which {{the growth of the}} wheat varied {{in such a way as}} to reveal an articulated group of traces that made up the plan of a complex of structures interpreted as a Roman villa, 4 hectares in extent. In the following years Aiali has become the most important test site for the Laboratory of Landscape Archaeology and Remote Sensing at Grosseto. Since 2001 we have collected, processed and interpreted many different kinds of data: Quickbird- 2 satellite imagery, historical and recent vertical coverage (from 1954 to 2001), oblique air photographs in various years, seasons and lighting condition; field-walking survey, and in the course of the XV International Summer School in Archaeology at Grosseto several geophysical methods were tested for archaeological prospection at the Roman site at Roselle-Aiali for demonstration to the students.

40|$|In <b>magnetic</b> <b>prospecting</b> the {{aeromagnetic survey}} is a {{widespread}} method used for research in large territories or in the areas with difficult access (forests, swamps, shallow waters). At present, {{a new type of}} mobile carriers – remotely piloted vehicles or drones – is becoming very common. The drones supplied by magnetometer can be also used for underground utility location (for example, steel and concrete constructions, buried power cables, to name a few). For aeromagnetic survey, obtaining of 3 -component magnetic field data gives higher processing precision, so the fluxgate magnetometers (FGM) seem to be the most preferable by reason of low weight, noise, power consumption and costs. During movement of FGM fixed to a drone practically permanent attitude changes in the Earth’s magnetic field arises with corresponding changes of its projection at FGM axes. Also the electromagnetic interference from the drone motor and uncontrolled oscillations of drone and suspension are the factors which limit the magnetometer sensitivity level. Aroused because of this, signals significantly exceed the expected signals from a studied object and so should be removed by proper interference filtration and use of stabilized towed construction, as well as at data processing. To find the necessary resolution threshold of a drone-portable FGM, the modeling was made to estimate magnetic field value from a small sphere about 1 cm radius at the minimal altitude of drone flight and it was shown that such a small object can be reliably detected if the FGM noise level is less than 0. 15 nT. Next requirement is the necessity to decrease as much as possible the FGM power consumption with retention of low noise level. Finally, because of drone movement, the broadening of a frequency range should be done. The LEMI- 026 magnetometer was developed satisfying all requirements to the drone-mounted device. The field tests were successfully performed using two of LEMI- 026 magnetometers and it was concluded that the parameters of these magnetometers allow their using for the magnetic survey with moving platforms. ...|$|E
