30|$|There {{are three}} key factors {{affecting}} fire behaviour: fuel, weather, and topography. Among these factors, it is acknowledged that only fuel can be actively controlled or managed (Schmidt et al. 2008). Finney (2007), Reinhardt et al. (2008) and Kim et al. (2009) also recommend reducing fuel load {{as the best}} possible way to slow fire growth. Fuel management is the process of altering the amount and structure of fuels through methods including prescribed burning and <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing</b> (King et al. 2008). Fuel management is undertaken for wildfire hazard reduction as well as for ecological restoration (Reinhardt et al. 2008; Penman et al. 2011). Consequently, much effort is expended by these counties in the planning, prioritising and operational activities of prescribed burning.|$|E
30|$|Pinus pinea and Pinus pinaster, {{sometimes}} Pinus nigra plantations or residuals {{of native}} Pine forests, are sometimes converted in park forests (Bianchi et al. 2005). The under-storey {{is rich in}} palatable plants but also some unpalatable shrubs and very few pasture plants. Forage production in these plantations or forests {{is not enough to}} sustain grazing, but they are visited occasionally by livestock from nearby farms. These forests, owned either by private farms or public administrations, are part of silvo-pastoral systems as an external farm component. A better integration of these forests with periodical grazing could reduce shrub growth and consequently reduce fire risks and the costs of periodical <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing.</b> Fruit plantations are normally specialised, however winter grazing sometimes occurs, by livestock from nearby farms. This reduces mowing costs and increases soil fertility.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] control of invasive alien plants often involves the integration two or more approaches, including <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing,</b> the application of herbicides, burning, and biological control. More than one species of invasive plant can threaten the same area, which necessitates prioritization in the allocation of scarce resources to support the control of different species. This paper describes the integrated control of the invasive shrub Hakea sericea over four decades in South Africa. The species is widespread across an area of approximately 800 × 200 km, and occurs mainly in rugged, inaccessible and fire-prone mountain areas. The species is serotinous, and produces copious amounts of seed that are wind dispersed after fires. We present {{a brief history of}} the control measures which included a combination of felling and burning, augmented by biological control. We used data from two surveys, 22 years apart, to assess changes in distribution and density of the species. The assessment suggested that the overall distribution of the species was reduced by 64 %, from ~ 530, 000 to ~ 190, 000 ha between 1979 and 2001. The species either decreased in density, or was eliminated from 492, 113 ha, while it increased in density, or colonised 107, 192 ha. We conclude that initial programs of <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing</b> were responsible for reducing the density and extent of infestations, and biological control was largely responsible for the failure of the species to re-colonize cleared sites, or to spread to new areas following unplanned wildfires. We propose that {{a significant portion of the}} resources used for clearing Hakea in the past can be reallocated to mechanical control efforts against other invasive species (such as alien pines) for which effective biological control options are not available, provided that sufficient resources are allocated to ensure the widespread and effective implementation of all biological control agents to maintain the advances reported on here. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Hakea sericea is a shrub, {{introduced}} into South Africa from southern Australia, {{that is now}} invading the indigenous "fynbos" vegetation in the Cape mountains. Presently an area of 480 000 hectares is affected. One of the main factors contributing {{to the success of}} H. sericea as a weed is its copious seed production. The seeds are accumulated on the plant throughout its life-time. When the plant eventually dies, usually after a fire, the fruits dehisce and all the seeds are released within the space of a few days, resulting in seed densities of up to 7 500 seeds per m². Dense, impenetrable stands of H. sericea develop which suppress the indigenous vegetation. Apart from the labour intensive <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing</b> of H. sericea, biological control appears to be the only other means of control.

However, microorganisms play a vital role for the functioning of the soil ecosystem and, hence, pasture sustainability. Here, we studied the links between soil microbial (belowground) community structure (using amplicon sequencing of prokaryotes and fungi), other soil physicochemical and biological properties and, finally, a variety of pasture management practices. To this aim, during two consecutive years, we studied 104 environmental sites characterised by contrasting elevation, habitats, bedrock and pasture management; located in or near Gorbeia Natural Park (Basque Country / Spain). Soil pH was found to be one of the most important factors in structuring soil microbial diversity. Interestingly, we observed a striking correlation between prokaryotic, fungal and macrofauna diversity, likely caused by interactions between these life forms.

40|$|Australian Acacia are {{invasive}} in {{many parts}} of the world. Despite significant mechanical and biological efforts to control their invasion and spread, soil-stored seed banks prevent their effective and sustained removal. In response South Africa has had a strong focus on employing seed reducing biological control agents to deal with Australian Acacia invasion, a programme that is considered as being successful. To provide a predictive understanding for their management, seed banks of four invasive Australian acacia species (Acacia longifolia, A. mearnsii, A. pycnantha and A. saligna) were studied in the Western Cape of South Africa. Across six to seven sites for each species, seed bank sizes were estimated from dense, monospecific stands by collecting 30 litter and soil samples. Average estimated seed bank size was large (1017 to 17261 seed m- 2) as was annual input into the seed bank, suggesting that these seed banks are not residual but are replenished in size annually. A clear relationship between seed bank size and stem diameter was established indicating that <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing</b> should be conducted shortly after fire-stimulated recruitment events or within old populations when seed banks are small.

Although these tools are widely used, the science is sketchy on the benefits and tradeoffs of the different treatments. In response, the national Fire and Fire Surrogates Study (FFS) set up a national network of research sites to study the effects of fire “surrogates,” such as mechanical thinning, mechanical slash treatments, and prescribed fire on forests. Early findings for the Sierra Nevada FFS site are reported here. The study used four treatments: prescribedfire- only, mechanical-only, mechanical-plus-fire, and no-treatment controls. All three active fuel treatments significantly reduced fire risk, but the two treatments that used prescribed fire to reduce surface fuels achieved the greatest reductions in potential fire behavior. The mechanical-only treatment (mechanical thinning followed by mechanical slash treatment) reduced crown bulk density and ladder fuels but increased surface fuels, and it was less effective in reducing fire risk. The active treatments also had noticeably different consequences on forest structure and predicted tree mortality.

30|$|Results {{from the}} joint {{study suggest that}} total {{eradication}} of P. juliflora is impossible and not sustainable. The efforts and resources should be directed to clearing of P. juliflora in some selected areas with use of the wood for either charcoal or fuel wood and (b) immediate utilization of the cleared land for either pasture or crop farming {{with the objective of}} diversifying livelihood strategies. Implementation of this recommendation will require creating innovative ways of involving pastoralists in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing</b> of P. juliflora by tapping into local knowledge, local institutions and providing land use rights of the cleared land as well as suitable tools for farming, especially generators for irrigation. Pastoral clans, institutions and locations should be mapped and documented. Each clan should be empowered to oversee the clearing of P. juliflora. The clans should be supported (financially and technically) and community rules should be revised to identify weaknesses and strengths in the management of P. juliflora. This support should essentially come from the government and even development partners. In addition, the same clans should also be offered secure rights to use the land for crop or forage production. Secure rights are important because currently the land belongs to the government, and households who were members of the cooperative noted that the land they cleared off P. juliflora was given away to the investor. This loss in ’ownership’ certainly is one of disincentives to the management of P. juliflora in Afar.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor centuries, the dry {{grassland}} of {{the plain}} of La Crau (south-eastern France) {{has been subjected to}} numerous disturbances resulting in the destruction and the fragmentation of this emblematic rangeland ecosystem of the Mediterranean. Today, this ecosystem is facing a new threat from a proliferating native species, the bramble (Rubus ulmifolius Schott), which preferentially colonizes areas that were formerly cultivated and/or exposed to water infiltration. To identify a strategy for effective control of this colonization, in situ experiments testing disturbance regimes (shrub clearing and/or mixed grazing by sheep and goats) combined with the control of access to water resources (with or without drainage trenches) were undertaken between 2010 and 2013. Only clearing and grazing combined over 3 years led to significant changes in vegetation height and bramble cover as well as modifications in the floristic composition, diversity, similarity, and richness of the plant community. Neither a clearing operation carried out in 2010 alone, nor grazing alone, reduced bramble cover, and neither treatment increased the species richness of the plant community. Similarly, digging drainage trenches had no significant impact either on the plant community or on bramble cover. Our study suggests that only annual <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearing</b> coupled with sheep and goats grazing can significantly reduce bramble cover.
