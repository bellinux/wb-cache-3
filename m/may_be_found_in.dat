5|$|Beryllium <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> coal slag. When the slag is {{formulated}} into an {{abrasive agent}} for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne {{and become a}} source of exposure.|$|E

50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> dry shrubland up to 500 m altitude. It <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> moist or drier lowland forest.

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{places such as}} airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most}} of limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E
5|$|Lead <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> food {{when food}} is grown in soil that {{is high in}} lead, {{airborne}} lead contaminates the crops, animals eat lead in their diet, or lead enters the food either {{from what it was}} stored or cooked in.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the {{importance}} of iron's symbolic role <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the German Campaign of 1813. Frederick William III commissioned then the first Iron Cross as military decoration. Berlin iron jewellery reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription Gold gab ich für Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.|$|E

5|$|At present, the {{majority}} of the frieze is at the British Museum in London (forming the major part of the Elgin Marbles); the largest proportion of the rest is in Athens, and the remainder of fragments shared between six other institutions. Casts of the frieze <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Beazley archive at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, at the Spurlock Museum in Urbana, in the Skulpturhalle at Basel and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> yurts {{to keep warm}} during the winter, as {{they do not have}} {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal {{balls are}} more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, {{than those in}} Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|Cut sod bricks, called terrone in Spanish, {{can be used}} to make {{tough and}} durable walls. The sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> river bottom lands. It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of attack}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} tiny piles of book-dust and specks of frass. Damage may be {{concentrated}} in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. Treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In North Bengal, {{among the}} Rajbanshis, Manasa (called Bishohora, Bishohori or Padmavati) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} goddesses, and her thaan (shrine) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the courtyard of almost every agrarian household. Among the lower-caste Hindus of East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh)too, she is worshiped with great pomp.|$|E

5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It {{may also be}} found in central Asia and China. In Russia it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the tundra zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it is rare in one district, endangered in another.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{neuroblastoma}} {{may be due}} to a mutation {{inherited from}} a person's parents. Environmental factors have not been found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy. Occasionally it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis the cancer has usually already spread. The cancer is divided into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what the cancer looks like.|$|E
5|$|Several effects {{influence}} the steering angle, the angle {{at which the}} front assembly is rotated about the steering axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, so that they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> one place.|$|E

5|$|The floury {{baker is}} found from the Daintree River in North Queensland to Bendalong in {{southern}} New South Wales. It is a highland {{species in the}} northern part of its range, restricted to the Atherton Tableland and Eungella National Park to the west of Mackay, but more a lowland species in the remainder of its range. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> varied habitats, from rainforest margins to suburbs, even in the centre of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{distinctive}} vestment of metropolitan archbishops, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> their bearings {{as well as}} the corporate arms of archdioceses, displayed either above or below the shield. The pallium is sometimes seen within the shield itself. With the exception of York, the archiepiscopal dioceses in England and Ireland include the pallium within the shield.|$|E
5|$|The scleractinian corals {{filled the}} niche vacated by the extinct rugose and {{tabulate}} species. Their fossils <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> small numbers in rocks from the Triassic period, and became {{common in the}} Jurassic and later periods. Scleractinian skeletons are composed of a form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite. Although they are geologically younger than the tabulate and rugose corals, the aragonite of their skeletons is less readily preserved, and their fossil record is accordingly less complete.|$|E
