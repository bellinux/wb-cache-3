5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.|$|E
5|$|For the 10metre air {{pistol and}} air rifle {{disciplines}} match diabolo pellets are used. These pellets have wadcutter heads, meaning the front is (nearly) flat, that leave clean round holes in paper targets for easy scoring. Match pellets {{are offered in}} tins and <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> packagings that avoid deformation and other damage that could impair their uniformity.|$|E

The Forum Shops at Caesars opened in 1992; {{it was one of the}} first venues in the city where shopping, particularly at high-end fashion house stores, was an attraction in itself. A new redevelopment opened on October 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Purpose built munitions are <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> {{in flight}} and control capabilities, warhead size and design, and {{on-board}} sensors for locating targets. Some loitering munitions use a human operator to locate targets whereas others, such as IAI Harop, can function autonomously searching and launching attacks without human intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of the vault is another significant feature of English cathedrals. The vaults range from the simple quadripartite vault in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) vault at Exeter, the similar vault with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne vaults at Bristol, the net-like stellar vaulting of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan vaulting of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant vaulting of the choir at Oxford, where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended from the ceiling like lanterns. Many of the <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> forms are unique to England, with stellar vaulting also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|E

5|$|The drip {{painting}} {{works of the}} modern artist Jackson Pollock are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 Number 14 has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> patterns. One of his last works, Blue Poles, took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can be far <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> {{than a single}} thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed}} at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E

5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on their sleeves. <b>More</b> <b>elaborate</b> braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} set {{goals in the}} fields of {{financial}} attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} {{one of the}} <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> {{and politically}} strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side.

40|$|International audienceCovariant-contravariant {{simulation}} and conformance simulation are two generalizations of {{the simple}} notion of simulation which aim at capturing {{the fact that it}} is not always the case that "the larger the number of behaviors, the better". Therefore, they can be considered to be more adequate to express the fact that a system is a correct implementation of some specification. We have previously shown that these two <b>more</b> <b>elaborated</b> notions fit well within the categorical framework developed to study the notion of simulation in a generic way. Now we show that their behaviors have also simple and natural logical characterizations, though <b>more</b> <b>elaborated</b> than those for the plain simulation semantics...|$|R
5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a <b>more</b> <b>elaborate,</b> mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E
5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much <b>more</b> <b>elaborate,</b> like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E
30|$|Since the {{multiplex}} {{formulation of}} flows in citation networks offers {{a wide range}} of possibilities for new measures of influence, we present three measures of flows: two straight-forward extensions of the ascending flow to the multiplex case, and one <b>more</b> <b>elaborated.</b>|$|R
50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1985 as Generative Grammars and later <b>more</b> <b>elaborated</b> upon, Christiansen grammars (apparently dubbed so by Shutt, possibly due to conflict with Chomsky generative grammars) are an adaptive extension of attribute grammars. Christiansen grammars were classified by Shutt as declarative.|$|R

5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It {{operates at}} 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the late stage is marked {{by the use of}} simple 16-point patterns at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338–1390. These patterns are rarely found outside these two regions. <b>More</b> <b>elaborate</b> combined 16-point geometrical patterns are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri in India in 1571–1596, but in few other places.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} church {{interiors}} {{went through a}} final stage that lasted into the 16th century. This was the development of fan vaulting, first used in about 1370 in the cloisters at Gloucester, then in the retrochoir at Peterborough in the early 15th century. In a still <b>more</b> <b>elaborate</b> form with stone pendants {{it was used to}} roof the Norman choir at Oxford and in the great funerary chapel of Henry VII at Westminster Abbey, at a time when Italy had embraced the Renaissance.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{features a}} series of side columns, with capitals having vegetable motifs, used to reinforce the central vault.
