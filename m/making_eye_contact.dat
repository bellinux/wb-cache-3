5|$|The {{transport}} is {{intercepted by}} Clu's warship; as a diversion, Quorra allows {{herself to be}} captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, reprogrammed by Clu. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter on the flight deck. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Upon <b>making</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, but Clu uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the I/O portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra, having switched discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape together to the real world. In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then finds a waiting Bradley and tells him he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Bradley chairman of the board. He departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, a {{study by}} Lippa (1978) found {{evidence}} for {{the extent to which}} individuals present themselves in a different way. This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a math class. The students' level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the percentage of time they spent talking, the amount of time they spent <b>making</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self-monitoring. This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations.|$|E

Once there, Christian insists that she sign a {{non-disclosure}} agreement forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of BDSM toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of dominance and submission, {{and there will be no}} romantic relationship, only a sexual one.

The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was homosexual, because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.|$|E

The intimate pose depicted two seated genderless figures engaged in conversation, <b>making</b> direct <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> The non-intimate pose also depicted two genderless figures engaged in conversation, <b>making</b> indirect <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> Conversations were either issue-based or event-based.

Results indicated that the intimate pose was identified as more intimate than the non-intimate pose. Results also indicated that women rated their friendships as more intimate than men. Men reported that they were less intimate and expressive with their friends than women. Correlational analyses indicated that loneliness was inversely related to self-reported levels of social intimacy and emotional expressiveness for both genders...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was {{to analyse}} the {{communication}} between two autistic boys. An analysis of pre-verbal, verbal and non-verbal communication has been carried out. The pre-verbal and verbal communication represent {{the sum of the}} following variables: scream, cry, individual voices, individual words and repetition of words (echolalia). The non-verbal communication represents the sum of the following variables: mime, body language, hand movement, gestures, <b>making</b> and keeping <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> symbols, melody and prominence of voice. All research information was gathered by making recordings at primary school, where I am employed. The school is for children with special educational needs. The recordings were reviewed by five assessors, who noted down any presence of pre-verbal, verbal and non-verbal communication on an observation form. Every assessor made his assessment individually while having been previously informed with the contents of an individual variable. The results have shown that two boys lack social and communication skills. Regarding pre-verbal communication, individual voices were used the most frequently, verbal communication used only individual words. While observing non-verbal communication, body language, <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> and melody were used the most frequently and voice prominence the least frequently. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPrimates {{explore the}} visual world through eye-movement sequences. Saccades bring details of {{interest}} into the fovea, while fixations stabilize the image [1]. During natural vision, social primates direct their {{gaze at the}} eyes of others to communicate their own emotions and intentions and to gather information about the mental states of others [2]. Direct gaze {{is an integral part}} of facial expressions that signals cooperation or conflict over resources and social status [3 – 6]. Despite the great importance of <b>making</b> and breaking <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> in the behavioral repertoire of primates, little is known about the neural substrates that support these behaviors. Here we show that the monkey amygdala contains neurons that respond selectively to fixations on the eyes of others and to <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> These “eye cells” share several features with the canonical, visually responsive neurons in the monkey amygdala; however, they respond to the eyes only when they fall within the fovea of the viewer, either as a result of a deliberate saccade or as eyes move into the fovea of the viewer during a fixation intended to explore a different feature. The presence of eyes in peripheral vision fails to activate the eye cells. These findings link the primate amygdala to eye movements involved in the exploration and selection of details in visual scenes that contain socially and emotionally salient features...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—Two {{experiments}} {{explored the}} ramifications of endorsing color blindness as a strategy for appearing unprejudiced. In Study 1, Whites proved adept at categorizing faces {{on the basis of}} race, but understated their ability to do so. In Study 2, Whites playing the Political Correctness Game—a matching task that requires describing other individuals—were less likely to use race as a descriptor when paired with a Black partner than when paired with a White partner, a strategy that impaired communication and performance. In addition, avoidance of race was associated with Whites <b>making</b> less <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with and appearing less friendly toward Black partners. In many conversations, people are called upon to describe others {{solely on the basis of}} their appearance: Who was it that showed up late for the meeting? Which character in the movie said that? The new guy—what does he look like again? In such cases, the best information to use is that which is most diagnostic in distinguishing the target from other individuals—for example, hair color, height, gender, and race. We propose (and anecdotal experience suggests) that people vary in their willingness to use certain descriptors: Although having red hair and being Black might be equally diagnostic in a particular setting, we suggest that many individuals are more reluctant to use race than hair color in their descriptions. The present investigation explored how White individuals behave in situations in which the desire to appear unprejudiced leads to efforts to appear color-blind. Why would simply mentioning someone’s race serve as evidence of bias? There is, after all, nothing inherently racist about Address correspondence to Michael I. Norton, Harvard Busines...|$|R
