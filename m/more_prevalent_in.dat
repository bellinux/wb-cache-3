5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are {{generally}} less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E

50|$|Hostas are {{eaten by}} deer, rabbits, voles, slugs and snails, {{which can cause}} {{extensive}} damage to collections in gardens. Some varieties seem more resistant to slug damage, which is <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> later <b>in</b> the growing season, than others.|$|R
5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area. The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is also what makes agriculture <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E
5|$|Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but {{insoluble}} thulium salts {{are completely}} nontoxic. When injected, thulium can cause degeneration {{of the liver}} and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> male mice than female mice. Despite this, thulium has {{a low level of}} toxicity. In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions. Radioactive thulium isotopes can cause radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>in</b> some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E
