50|$|Despite {{being one}} of the world's longest-running sports {{television}} programmes, there had only been five <b>main</b> <b>anchors</b> in its 51 years on air, largely due to the 32-year tenure of Arthur Montford, who retired in 1989. Subsequent <b>main</b> <b>anchors</b> of Scotsport were Jim White (now with Sky Sports), Jim Delahunt (who later joined Setanta Sports), and finally, the pairing of Grant Stott and Andy Walker, who also anchored STV's Champions League coverage.|$|R

25|$|One {{factor in}} WPVI's long {{dominance}} is talent continuity. Most of WPVI's on-air staff {{has been at}} the station for over ten years, and several for 20 years or more. Gardner has been the station's main weeknight anchor since May 1977, the longest tenure for any <b>main</b> <b>anchor</b> in Philadelphia history.

In 1992 {{he was the}} <b>main</b> <b>anchor</b> for ITN's election night programme, broadcast on ITV; he presented the programme alongside Robin Day, Alastair Stewart and Julia Somerville. (Previously ITN's programme had typically been presented by Alastair Burnet, who left ITN in 1991. The 1992 election night programme {{was the only one}} hosted by Snow. He was replaced by Jonathan Dimbleby from 1997 onwards.)

25|$|In August 1992, {{general manager}} Vaughn Tozer hired Jim Wicks, a Canadian-American {{broadcaster}} {{to be the}} <b>main</b> <b>anchor</b> and managing editor. Tozer and Wicks reorganized the newsroom and the on-air team to help accomplish their goal. Within three ratings periods, the newscast had climbed from third place to first place, replacing CBWT's 24 Hours as the highest-rated newscast in Winnipeg. At one point, the newscast was advertised on billboards throughout the city as Wicks at 6. The on-air chemistry between Wicks and sports director Steve Vogelsang was unique in broadcasting, adding to {{the popularity of the}} program. Although the personalities have since changed on several occasions, the station's newscast has remained Manitoba's #1 newscast, increasing its lead in recent years {{due in part to the}} demise of CHMI's newscasts and budget cuts at CBWT. Currently, CKY is the market's only station with a weekday noon newscast. As of today, CKY-TV is the oldest private television station in Manitoba since CKX-TV's demise.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} been {{well known in the}} Bay Area for its news programming; KTVU's news {{department}} began operations along with the station on March 3, 1958, with the launch of The 10 o'clock News (modified to a fully spelled titling in 2001, before switching to a partially numerical-based titling—as the Fox 2 10:00 News, mirroring similar titing schemes for newscasts used by some of its sister stations such as Los Angeles O KTTV—for six months starting in February 2015 under Fox ownership, before reverting to the previous title form), which for years had been the market's only local television newscast at 10:00p.m. Initially airing for a half-hour on Monday through Friday nights, the program was originally anchored by Les Nichols (who served as KTVU's managing editor) and Al Helmso (who also served as the station's first news director). The program has long established itself with top-drawer talent, many of whom have worked at KTVU for more than ten years. Though, early on, the program experienced turnover with its <b>main</b> <b>anchor</b> team. Nichols and Helmso stepped down as main anchors in the early 1960s, replaced by Gary Park and Stan Atkinson. The program was reformatted in 1971 as The Tuck-Fortner Report, with Mike Tuck and Ron Fortner at the helm; they were replaced by Marcia Brandwynne and George Reading in 1974 (Reading would later be replaced by Atkinson and eventually, Judd Hambrick). The weeknight editions of The 10 o'clock News would expand to one hour in 1975; hour-long weekend editions were eventually added in September 1979, which were first by anchored by Elaine Corral.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{remained}} out {{of service}} during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and next saw active duty in 1867, when she was recommissioned on 12 March for service as a tender in Kiel. On 15 October, she retrieved the <b>main</b> <b>anchor</b> from the corvette , which had been lost during an emergency anchoring. Camäleon remained in Kiel through 1868. During this period, she towed the steamer [...] and carried a 75-pounder gun to the coastal fortification on Friedrichsort on 30 March. On 16 April and 25 May, Prince Adalbert of Prussia came aboard to visit the ship. She carried Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia to Sonderburg on 15–16 June. A boiler explosion that destroyed one of her boilers forced her decommissioning on 26 August for repairs. She remained laid up until {{the outbreak of the}} Franco-Prussian War in July 1870. She was stationed as a guard ship off Friedrichsort {{for the duration of the}} conflict. On 1 April 1871, with the war all but over, Camäleon was decommissioned again. She was stricken from the naval register on 19 March 1872, owing to her poor condition. The ship was used as a harbor vessel in Kiel, and later converted into a coal storage hulk. While in Kiel, parts of the ship were removed for use in the construction of the new gunboat [...] Camäleon was broken up for scrap some time after 1878, but the exact date is not known.|$|E
