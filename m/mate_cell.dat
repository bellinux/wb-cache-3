40|$|Finding a {{compatible}} mating {{partner is}} an essential step in {{the life cycle of}} most sexually reproducing organisms. Fungi have two or more mating types, and only cells of different mating type combine to produce diploid cells. In mushrooms, this is taken to extremes, with the occurrence of many thousands of mating types. But, having gone to such extraordinary lengths to ensure that almost any two mushroom mycelia in the wild can <b>mate,</b> <b>cell</b> fusion is not followed by nuclear fusion and true diploidy. Instead, the fused cells form a characteristic mycelium, known as the dikaryon, in which haploid nuclei are paired but actively prevented from fusing. The mating-type genes, which encode pheromones, pheromone receptors and homeodomain transcription factors, have crucial roles in regulating the complex developmental programme by which the dikaryon is formed...|$|E
40|$|In the ciliate Euplotes crassus, {{millions}} of new telomeres are synthesized by telomerase and polymerase -primase during macronuclear development in <b>mated</b> <b>cells.</b> Concomitant with de novo telomere formation, telomerase assembles into higher-order complexes of 550 kDa, 1, 600 kDa, and 5 MDa. We show here that telomerase is physically {{associated with the}} lagging-strand replication machinery in these complexes. Anti-bodies against DNA primase precipitated telomerase activity from all three complexes from <b>mated</b> <b>cells</b> but not the 280 -kDa telomerase complex from vegetatively growing cells. Moreover, when telomerase was affinity purified, primase copurified with enzyme from <b>mated</b> <b>cells</b> {{but not with the}} 280 -kDa vegetative complex. Thus, the association of telomerase and primase is developmentally regulated. Intriguingly, PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was also found in the 5 -MDa complex from <b>mated</b> <b>cells.</b> We therefore speculate that this complex is a complete telomere synthesis machine, while the smaller complexes are assembly intermediates. The physical association of telomerase and primase explains the coordinate regulation of telomeric G- and C-strand synthesis and the efficiency of telomere addition in E. crassus. One function of telomeres is to circumvent the end replica-tion problem that arises because DNA polymerase is unable to completely replicate the 5 end of a linear chromosome (45) ...|$|R

40|$|Fungal adhesins {{represent}} {{a large family}} of serine/threonine-rich secreted glycoproteins. Adhesins {{have been shown to}} play roles in heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell adhesion processes, morphogenetic pathways and invasive/pseudohyphal growth, frequently in response to differentiation cues. Here we address the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-specific adhesin Fig 2 p. Cells lacking FIG 2 possess a variety of mating defects that relate to processes involving the cell wall, including morphogenetic defects, cell fusion defects, and alterations in agglutination activities. We found that mating-specific morphogenetic defects caused by the absence of FIG 2 are suppressible by increased external osmolarity and that, during mating, fig 2 Δ cells display reduced viability relative to wild-type cells. These defects result from alterations in signaling activated by the <b>mating</b> and <b>cell</b> integrity pathways. Finally, we show that fig 2 Δ zygotes also have defects in zygotic spindle positioning that are osmoremedial, whereas the requirements for FIG 2 in normal cell-cell agglutination and <b>cell</b> fusion during <b>mating</b> are insensitive to changes in the extracellular osmotic environment. We conclude that FIG 2 performs distinct functions in the <b>mating</b> <b>cell</b> wall that are separable with respect to their ability to be suppressed by changes in external osmolarity and that a fundamental role of FIG 2 in <b>mating</b> <b>cells</b> is the maintenance of cell integrity...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of sexual maturity in Tetrahymena thermophila {{has been shown}} to include an intermediate stage, adolescence, during which cells are capable of <b>mating</b> with mature <b>cells</b> but not other adolescent cells. When the progeny of successfully <b>mated</b> <b>cells</b> are grown logarithmically and tested frequently for the ability to mate, they are unable to form mating pairs for about 65 generations. This period is known as immaturity. During the next stage, the progeny pair with mature cells but not with other adolescent cells despite the presence of complementary mating types. Adolescence persists for 20 - 25 generations before the cells attain maturity, which is defined as the ability to <b>mate</b> with any <b>cell</b> of different <b>mating</b> type. Once paired with mature cells, adolescents successfully complete conjugation. Cytological preparations show that both members of the pair undergo meiosis and form macronuclear anlagen.

50|$|All ciliates, {{including}} karyorelicteans, possess {{two different}} kinds of nucleus, which separate the functions of gene expression and sexual recombination. The macronuclei, or somatic nuclei, are the site of transcription, while the smaller micronuclei, or germline nuclei, are only active during sexual reproduction, where they first undergo meiosis to form gametic nuclei, which are exchanged when two <b>mating</b> <b>cells</b> conjugate. Two gametic nuclei fuse to form a zygotic nucleus, which divides by mitosis into two daughter nuclei, one of which develops into a new micronucleus and the other into a macronucleus; the old macronucleus typically disintegrates (see main article).|$|R

Although the mechanisms used by bacterial and fungal species to promote genetic exchange are distinct, recent studies have uncovered surprising parallels between pheromone signaling in these species.

40|$|<b>Mating</b> yeast <b>cells</b> {{remove their}} cell walls and fuse their plasma {{membranes}} in a spatially restricted cell contact region. Cell wall removal {{is dependent on}} Fus 2 p, an amphiphysin-associated Rho-GEF homolog. As <b>mating</b> <b>cells</b> polarize, Fus 2 p-GFP localizes {{to the tip of}} the <b>mating</b> projection, where <b>cell</b> fusion will occur, and to cytoplasmic puncta, which show rapid movement toward the tip. Movement requires polymerized actin, whereas tip localization is dependent on both actin and a membrane protein, Fus 1 p. Here, we show that Fus 2 p-GFP movement is specifically dependent on Myo 2 p, a type V myosin, and not on Myo 4 p, another type V myosin, or Myo 3 p and Myo 5 p, type I myosins. Fus 2 p-GFP tip localization and actin polarization in shmoos are also dependent on Myo 2 p. A temperature-sensitive tropomyosin mutation and Myo 2 p alleles that specifically disrupt vesicle binding caused rapid loss of actin patch organization, indicating that transport is required to maintain actin polarity. Mutant shmoos lost actin polarity more rapidly than mitotic cells, suggesting that the maintenance of cell polarity in shmoos is more sensitive to perturbation. The different velocities, differential sensitivity to mutation and lack of colocalization suggest that Fus 2 p and Sec 4 p, another Myo 2 p cargo associated with exocytotic vesicles, reside predominantly on different cellular organelles...|$|R

40|$|GROWING {{evidence}} suggests that the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons function interdependently during a number of cellular processes, including cleavage furrow positioning, neuronal growth cone steering, organelle transport, and nuclear migration (Gavin, 1997).

40|$|Haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells {{find each}} other during {{conjugation}} by orienting their growth toward each other along pheromone gradients (chemotropism). However, when their receptors are saturated for pheromone binding, yeast cells must select a mate by executing a default pathway in which they choose a mating partner at random. We previously demonstrated that this default pathway requires the SPA 2 gene. In this report we show that the default mating pathway also requires the AXL 1, FUS 1, FUS 2, FUS 3, PEA 2, RVS 161, and BNI 1 genes. These genes, including SPA 2, are also important for efficient cell fusion during chemotropic <b>mating.</b> <b>Cells</b> containing null mutations in these genes display defects in cell fusion that subtly affect mating efficiency. In addition, {{we found that the}} defect in default mating caused by mutations in SPA 2 is partially suppressed by multiple copies of two genes, FUS 2 and MFA 2. These findings uncover a molecular relationship between default <b>mating</b> and <b>cell</b> fusion. Moreover, because axl 1 mutants secrete reduced levels of a-factor and are defective at both cell fusion and default mating, these results reveal an important role for a-factor in cell fusion and default mating. We suggest that default mating places a more stringent requirement on some aspects of cell fusion than does chemotropic mating...|$|R
40|$|The A mating-type {{factor is}} one of two gene {{complexes}} that allows <b>mating</b> <b>cells</b> of the mushroom Coprinus cinereus to recognize self from nonself and to regulate a pathway of sexual development that leads to meiosis and sporulation.

Four genes, one-alpha and three-beta, all coding for proteins with a homeo domain-related motif, determine A-factor specificity; their allelic forms are so different in sequence that they do not cross-hybridize. It requires only one of these four genes to be heteroallelic in a cell to trigger A-regulated sexual development, and it is the different combinations of their alleles that generate the multiple A factors found in nature.

40|$|Background: In Paramecium primaurelia, an exconjugant cell {{can produce}} two Lines with {{different}} mating capacities. <b>Mating</b> type II <b>cells</b> can form a higher food vacuole number and digest the nutrient {{taken up in}} a shorter time; thus, <b>mating</b> type II <b>cells</b> grow {{at a faster rate}} than do <b>mating</b> type I <b>cells.</b> The present study was done to determine whether cells that ingest more nutrients also have a larger amount of storage lipids. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative determinations of neutral lipids were obtained by means of cytofluorometry and fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), respectively, by using nile red on cells in different physiologic states. Results: Lipid droplet number and neutral lipid content were higher in <b>mating</b> type II <b>cells</b> than in <b>mating</b> type I <b>cells</b> in the early logarithmic growth phase (i. e., immature well-fed cells). These values were reversed during the middle and the late logarithmic phases and became equal in the stationary phase (i. e., mature starved cells). In well-fed cells maintained with food excess, differences in neutral lipid content between the two mating types also were present in mature cells. Conclusions: Although differences between mating type I and mating type II lines were not correlated to cell size, a relation was found between lipid content and food ingestion capacity. A depletion of bacteria in the culture medium could be responsible for the lack of differences in mature starved cells. CLSM allowed us to gather volume information about the lipid droplet distribution within the cell...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Yeast <b>cells</b> <b>mate</b> by an {{inducible}} pathway {{that involves}} agglutination, <b>mating</b> projection formation, <b>cell</b> fusion, and nuclear fusion. To obtain {{insight into the}} mating differentiation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we carried out a large-scale transposon tagging screen to identify genes whose expression is regulated by mating pheromone. 91, 200 transformants containing random lacZ insertions were screened for �-galactosidase (�-gal) expression in the presence and absence of � factor, and 189 strains containing pheromone-regulated lacZ insertions were identified. Transposon insertion alleles corresponding to 20 genes that are novel or had not previously been known to be pheromone regulated were examined for effects on the mating process. Mutations in four novel genes, FIG 1, FIG 2, KAR 5 / FIG 3, and FIG 4 were found to cause mating defects. Three of the proteins encoded by these genes, Fig 1 p, Fig 2 p, and Fig 4 p, are dispensible for cell polarization in uniform concentrations of mating pheromone, but are required for normal <b>cell</b> polarization in <b>mating</b> mixtures, conditions that involve cell–cell communication. Fig 1 p and Fig 2 p are also important for cell fusion and conjugation bridge shape, respectively. The fourth protein, Kar 5 p/Fig 3 p, is required for nuclear fusion. Fig 1 p and Fig 2 p are likely to act at the cell surface as Fig 1 :: �-gal and Fig 2 ::�-gal fusion proteins localize to the periphery of <b>mating</b> <b>cells.</b> Fig 4 p {{is a member of}} a family of eukaryotic proteins that contain a domain homologous to the yeast Sac 1 p. Our results indicate that a variety of novel genes are expressed specifically during mating differentiation to mediate proper cell morphogenesis, cell fusion, and other steps of the mating process.
