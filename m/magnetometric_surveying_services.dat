40|$|The {{detection}} of illegal buried waste {{by means of}} geophysical techniques has recently become a major effort in shallow geophysical investigations. In particular, detection and location of underground metallic storage tanks can be accomplished using different instruments and techniques. In this paper we describe {{the results of an}} investigation carried out in a tuff quarry in Riano Flaminio (north Rome, Italy). A preliminary <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey</b> revealed the existence of anomalous zones in the analysed region. Excavation in some of the selected areas confirmed that the anomalies were generated by underground magnetic material: over 160 steel drums were found. After their removal, a new <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey</b> was performed. On the basis of the new map, a multifrequency induction survey, a geoelectrical profile and GPR measurements were taken to extend the characterization of the subsoil...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the topography and the main archaeological features of the “Vigna Parrocchiale” area, located on the urban plateau of the ancient Etruscan town of Cerveteri, where a geophysical survey has also been carried out (cfr. Colosi et al., this volume). The accurate description of data coming from field surveys, excavations and archival research {{makes it possible to}} recognize in this area a long archaeological stratification from the Villanovan through to the Roman period. These results, achieved over many years of archaeological research, can be profitably linked to those coming from the application of geophysical surveying techniques. The article closes with a technical Appendix, relevant to a <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey</b> carried out in 1987 during the excavations conducted by CNR in the “Vigna Parrocchiale” area...|$|R

In 1996, he discovered what he {{believed to be the}} wreck lying in [...] of water. With the assistance of an Australian diving team, it was determined in October 1997 that the wreck was that of an old steamer. After a further thorough side-scan sonar and <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey</b> of the reported scuttling site of the AE2, Kolay located the submarine in June 1998, lying in [...] of water. The wreck was first dived in July, while subsequent dives by an Australian team in October were able to confirm the wreck as being AE2. The Australian government makes no claim to the shipwreck, and the submarine is not a war grave.|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{methods are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to detect}} and locate illegal waste disposal and buried toxic steel drums. This study describes {{the results of a}} test carried out in clayey-sandy ground where 12 empty steel drums had previously been buried at 4 - 5 m below ground level. This test was carried out with three geophysical methods for steel-drum detection: a <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey,</b> electrical resistivity tomography with different arrays, and a multifrequency frequency-domain electromagnetic induction survey. The data show that as partially expected, the magnetometric and electromagnetic induction surveys detected the actual steel drums buried in the subsurface, while the electrical resistivity tomography mainly detected the changes in some of the physical properties of the terrain connected with the digging operations, rather than the actual presence of the steel drums.

50|$|The {{site was}} {{occupied}} {{for a relatively}} short period during the late third and early second millennium BC, roughly coinciding with the Early Bronze IV period. It was founded around 2400 BC and finally abandoned in circa 2000 BC. The <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey</b> revealed a circular street pattern with streets radiating away from the centre of the site. Both the temple and the circular street pattern find parallels in Tell Chuera, located in a similar environment to the northeast of Al-Rawda. At least three temples were identified, of which one has been excavated. The largest temple excavated had an entrance with a columned front porch, a square cella and faces a 50 m long sacred enclosure to the outside. Offerings that were found in this temple include alabaster from Egypt, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan and agate from India. The city was defended by a double rampart built of mudbricks on a stone foundation and two ditches. The town was accessible through five gates.|$|R

40|$|The Molnieboi Spur {{is located}} at the northwestern margin of the Katun Range, the high-mountain part of the Altai Mountains. Unique {{geological}} and geophysical characteristics of the Molnieboi Spur made it an attractive target for complex botanical studies including botanical, soil, geological, geochemical, geophysical, radiation, and soil gas surveys and analyses. In this paper, we present the first version of the geographic information system (GIS) application for the Molnieboi Spur developed using the software QGIS. A digital elevation model for the study area was derived from a detailed topographic map. The database was filled with tabular data on about 100 parameters including: eight botanical characteristics of the Lonicera caerulea local population, two cytogenetic indices of Lonicera caerulea seeds, five types of biochemical parameters of Lonicera caerulea leaves and fruits, three types of geochemical characteristics of the local soils, three types of radiation parameters of the local soils and Lonicera caerulea plants, and one soil gas parameter. The results of the <b>magnetometric</b> <b>survey</b> were inserted as a raster image. A visual analysis of the maps produced allows one to better understand the spatial relationships between various natural components of the Molnieboi Spur.
