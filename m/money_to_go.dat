5|$|Turner was {{introduced}} to Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in 1973 by a friend of Ike's named Valerie Bishop. Turner wrote in her autobiography I, Tina that after Valerie taught her to recite the Buddhist chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, Tina observed that Ike, instead of hitting her for singing supposed wrong notes during recording sessions, would give her <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> shopping, something she regarded as a benefit of her newfound spiritual practice.|$|E
5|$|By May 1944, {{the parishioners}} {{had contributed to}} the war having given {{thousands}} of pints of blood to the Blood Banks; given money to the war relief campaigns; been active on the home front, and sent 808 {{men and women to}} the Armed Forces. There was a group that prepared and sent out a weekly special bulletin to the parishioners in the Armed Forces. These parishioners were happy to receive news from home on the progress of their new church and many of them sent home <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> towards the building fund. During the war, hundreds of dollars came in from these parishioners fighting in the war. Of the 808 parishioners who went off to war, seven died and their names were engraved on a piece of granite outside of the church: James DiMuzio, Arthur Capo, Nick Costelli, Justine DeFelices, Neal Chipoletti, and Anthony Zaffuto.|$|E
5|$|While Parke's {{conviction}} cleared Euston, another {{trial began}} on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, {{was charged with}} obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty {{to one of the}} six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.|$|E

Paxton returned to Omaha in 1875, but did not sell his ranches until 1883.|$|E

25|$|Early {{correspondence}} {{shows that}} he always liked school, and was always seeking meaning—seeking {{to do something with}} his life. In 1876, he had the chance to attend high school in Columbus, Wisconsin, which had opened that year. Like many youth, he struggled with what to do with his life. After attending a year of high school, he began to teach at a Hampden school, while continuing his studies. In 1879, he attended college at the Oshkosh Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh). He left there after only one year due to financial reasons, and took a job teaching in Columbus, Wisconsin. He hoped to earn enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to college.|$|E
25|$|Martin Bryant {{inherited}} about $570,000 AUD (£300,000 GBP or $450,000 USD) {{worth of}} property and other assets from a friend, Helen Harvey, who left her estate to him. He used part of this <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on many trips around the world from 1993 onwards. Bryant also withdrew many thousands of dollars during this period. He used {{at least some of}} this money in late 1993 to purchase an AR-10 semi-automatic rifle through a newspaper advertisement in Tasmania. In March 1996, he had his AR-10 repaired at a gun shop and made enquiries about AR-15 rifles in other gun shops. At the time of purchase, no registration of guns outside of handguns was required in Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|Many male prostitutes offer {{services}} at hotel rooms booked {{for the purpose}} instead of the client's residence. This is because while accompanying a client to his residence prostitutes become vulnerable to assault or robbery. Some prostitutes have sex with clients {{in the back seat}} of the client's car. There are many part-time prostitutes who are students, salespersons, workers in hotels and garages. They become involved in the profession to earn extra money, and often to get a job in the film industry. Some involved in prostitution often manage to save enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> abroad in search of a job. Many boys are frequently used by the police without getting paid. Plainclothes police officers are often involved in the extortion and blackmail of male prostitutes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean men {{traveled}} to Hawaii as cheap labor {{to work on}} the sugarcane plantations. Some continued on {{to work on the}} mainland. These men had originally planned to leave plantation work and go back home after a few years or a contract was up. Between the years of 1886 and 1924, 199,564 Japanese entered Hawaii and 113,362 returned to Japan. However, many men did not make enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back home. Also, in 1907 the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited immigration from Hawaii to the United States for laborers. Because now these men were put in situations with limited mobility, they had to make Hawaii or the United States their home, and part of that was getting married. In Hawaii, the plantation owners also wanted to see the laborers get married. Though they had originally preferred single men, when the contract labor system was abolished, the owners thought that wives would make the men more likely to settle down and stay. Also, the plantation owners hoped that wives would limit the amount of gambling and opium smoking the workers did, and act as a morale booster for the men.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in {{the west}} end, had become the most {{prevalent}} loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan sharking business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to {{pay a visit to}} one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and the interest of the loan was substantial usually sitting around 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would take the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois {{he had no choice but}} to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have.|$|E
500|$|The band {{first began}} writing songs at their {{rehearsal}} space in their hometown of Minneapolis, which they nicknamed the [...] "Dungeon", {{due to its}} ability to [...] "suck the life and energy out of the band." [...] For Pierre, the album came at {{the brink of a}} transitional period for him, in which he began to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. He left the band during the writing stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Afterwards, the band rejoined Pierre in Los Angeles to begin recording demos for a month; the change of scenery brought about new energy for the group, according to Pierre. Commit This to Memory would be the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. In addition, the band had more time and funds to spend time working on the album. [...] "It was also the first time we had a lot more time and <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in and feel like we were making a real record this time, whereas I Am the Movie was recorded in little segments here and there and eventually pieced together," [...] said drummer Tony Thaxton.|$|E

Nonetheless, Thomas Jefferson started the first public university, The University of Virginia, in 1819. The first free public school systems were established around 1851, although unlike Northern and Western states, public education was not required under the Virginia state constitution until 1870, after an innovation in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 (although paying for such education became controversial in the next decade).|$|E

2500|$|Genre {{pictures}} made at {{very low}} cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. According to Naremore, between 1945 and 1950, [...] "the average B western from Republic Pictures was made for about $50,000." [...] Among the established studios, Monogram was exploring fresh territory with what were being called [...] "exploitation pictures." [...] Variety defined these as [...] "films with some timely or currently controversial subject which can be exploited, capitalized on in publicity or advertising." [...] Many smaller Poverty Row firms were folding because there simply was not enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> around: the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, were now [...] "taking in around 95 percent of all domestic (U.S. and Canada) rental receipts."
