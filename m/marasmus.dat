25|$|<b>Marasmus</b> (‘to waste away’) {{is caused}} by an {{inadequate}} intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels. <b>Marasmus</b> can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival. It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of anorexia. Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.|$|E

25|$|In humans, an {{unhealthy}} diet can cause deficiency-related {{diseases such as}} blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition {{can lead to the}} wasting of kwashiorkor in acute cases, and the stunting of <b>marasmus</b> in chronic cases of malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations {{where there is}} a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutrition is most common among young children. <b>Marasmus,</b> a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kwashiorkor, a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect physical and mental development. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.|$|E
25|$|Undernourishment is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: <b>marasmus</b> (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been {{observed}} in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first {{thought that this was}} an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and <b>marasmus,</b> associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% {{linoleic}} acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% stearic acid and 10.9% palmitic acid. Vitamins Thiamin, Niacin, B1 and B2 are also {{prevalent in the}} seed, {{as well as many}} micronutrients. Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate. The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient vegetable protein. This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories. Just 100 g of seed daily provides essential fatty acid, amino acid and Vitamin E requirements. There is potential for these seeds as a critical tool for interventions in diseases such as <b>marasmus</b> and kwashiorkor.|$|E
500|$|The intellectuals {{were stuck}} at a bypass; they {{recognized}} the government’s increasing normalization, {{but they were}} unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek’s promises for reform, Milan Kundera published the article “Cesky udel” (Our Czech Destiny) in Literarni listy on 19 December. He wrote: [...] "People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting {{that there are not}} enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a <b>marasmus</b> of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "severe malnutrition" [...] or [...] "severe undernutrition" [...] {{is often}} used to refer {{specifically}} to PEM. PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency. Two forms of PEM are kwashiorkor and <b>marasmus,</b> and they commonly coexist.|$|E
2500|$|Another area of {{uncertainty}} {{lies in the}} descriptions of disease given by tenants as {{to the cause of}} their relatives' deaths. Though the 1851 census has been rightly criticised as underestimating the true extent of mortality, it does provide a framework for the medical history of the Great Famine. The diseases that badly affected the population fell into two categories: famine-induced diseases and diseases of nutritional deficiency. Of the nutritional deficiency diseases, the most commonly experienced were starvation and <b>marasmus,</b> as well as a condition at the time called dropsy. Dropsy (oedema) was a popular name given for the symptoms of several diseases, one of which, kwashiorkor, is associated with starvation.|$|E
2500|$|Gibbons {{moved to}} Gower Street (London) in 1876. [...] Gibbon's first wife, Matilda, died on 11 August 1877 in Devon from a wasting disease, <b>marasmus.</b> [...] The Post Office Directory lists the main {{occupier}} of the Gower Street property as ‘Stanley Gibbons & Co publishers’ or ‘Stanley Gibbons & Co postage stamp dealers’. In 1887, Gibbons married his assistant and housemaid, Margaret Casey and in 1890, sold his business to Charles Phillips of Birmingham for £25,000 and retired. (It had first been offered to Theodor Buhl for £20,000.) In 1891, Phillips opened a shop at 435 The Strand, {{as well as}} keeping the office at 8 Gower Street.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{published}} in the Lancet has highlighted a lower risk of HIV transmission with exclusive breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers (4 percent risk), compared to mixed feeding (10-40 percent risk). Research on the timing of HIV transmission in 2000 revealed that a [...] "substantial transmission occurs early during breastfeeding," [...] concluding that 75% of all breast milk transmission had occurred within the first 6 months during a randomized control trial in Kenya. This research is of particular importance in developing countries where infant formula is not widely available or safe to prepare. In fact, the World Health Organization recommended breastfeeding in 1987 and 1992 for seropositive and seronegative women in areas where malnutrition and infectious diseases are the major cause of infant mortality. In 1996 UNAIDS issued a recommendation that women in developing countries consider {{the risks and benefits}} of each feeding practice on an individual level; they recommended women make an informed choice about infant feeding. [...] In the days before the AIDS epidemic was clearly understood, some researchers pointed to the need to increase breastfeeding rates and pointed to the risks of formula feeding, citing increased rates of <b>marasmus</b> and diarrhea. D. Jelliffe and E. Jelliffe also criticized the marketing of infant formulas by U.S. companies to resource-poor countries, something they termed [...] "comerciogenic malnutrition." [...] A more recent article from 1992 describes how the health of an infant can be compromised by water, which in many resource-poor countries holds the risk of environmental pathogens that are not present in breastmilk.|$|E

50|$|<b>Marasmus</b> {{is a form}} {{of severe}} {{malnutrition}} characterized by energy deficiency. A child with <b>marasmus</b> looks emaciated. Body weight is reduced to less than 62.36% of the normal (expected) body weight for the age. <b>Marasmus</b> occurrence increases prior to age 1, whereas kwashiorkor occurrence increases after 18 months. It can be distinguished from kwashiorkor in that kwashiorkor is protein deficiency with adequate energy intake whereas <b>marasmus</b> is inadequate energy intake in all forms, including protein. This clear-cut separation of <b>marasmus</b> and kwashiorkor is however not always clinically evident as kwashiorkor is often seen in a context of insufficient caloric intake, and mixed clinical pictures, called marasmic kwashiorkor, are possible. Protein wasting in kwashiorkor generally leads to edema and ascites, while muscular wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat are the main clinical signs of <b>marasmus.</b>|$|E

50|$|Essential {{amino acid}} {{deficiency}} should {{be distinguished from}} protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as <b>marasmus</b> or kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories ("sugar baby syndrome").
