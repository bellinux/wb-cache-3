40|$|We {{demonstrated}} that aldose reductase inhibition corrects the impaired microvascular responses to inflammatory mediators in diabetic rats. To study the mechanism {{involved in the}} restoring effect of aldose reductase inhibition, we {{examined the effects of}} <b>minalrestat,</b> another aldose reductase inhibitor, on the re-sponses of mesenteric microvessels studied in vivo to perme-ability-increasing agents in diabetic and galactosemic rats. The diabetic group was treated from 3 days after the alloxan injec-tion with <b>minalrestat</b> (10 mg/kg/day) for 30 days and the minal-restat treatment (10 mg/kg/day/ 7 days) of galactosemic rats started concomitantly with the induction of galactosemia. The mesenteric microvessel reactivity was studied using intravital microscopy and changes in vessel diameters were estimated after the topical application of vasoactive agents. The impaire...|$|E
