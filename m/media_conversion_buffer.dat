Therefore, the system relieves the user from predefining and foreseeing every possible situation in communication. Instead, the user can focus on his major goals in communication and general preferences in reachability management and let the system do the detailed work. Thereby, such a system can be considered as an 'electronic secretary'. The work is embedded in the concepts of Personal Communication Support. An appropriate prototype system has been built. It is able to evaluate the assumed outcome of such <b>media</b> <b>conversions</b> and to automatically propose the most suitable way of conversion and delivery, based on the reachability of the user as well as the technical quality and the semantics of the communication content. To reach this goal, a new model of <b>media</b> handling and <b>conversion</b> is proposed, and the impacts of <b>media</b> <b>conversion</b> on the semantic of information are discussed from the theoretical point of view. A new generic model of telecommunication services is proposed, a new concept of evaluating the quality of complete chains of concatenated conversion modules is applied. Methods from the area of automatic decision making are adapted to the specific problem, and algorithms for selecting and configuring chains of concatenated software and hardware modules and techniques for controlling and stream binding such modules are developed. Supporting complex kinds of <b>media</b> <b>conversion,</b> the system provides a generic interface for integrating third party products such as Text-to-Speech, Speech recognition, Optical Character Recognition. This concept of easy integration of conversion and filtering tools allows further enhancements. Beyond considering the technical quality of the message, content semantics (inteligent content handling), ranging from keyword recognition to multimedia content screening, can be used for evaluation. Closely following design principles of the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing, and based on a vendor-open middleware using CORBA, the system proves interoperability between heterogeneous components, and is widely scalable, allowing tailoring for various purposes and environments...|$|R

Text to speech <b>media</b> <b>conversion</b> quality measurements has general and specific mechanisms for its functional and nonfunctional requirements. The main objective of this thesis is to introduce QoS framework which is able to evaluate and analyze the perceived quality of services (QoS) for text to speech (TTS) web services. To achieve this goal, the framework combines two main mechanisms for measuring the speech quality. General quality attributes measure the response time of TTS services, specific quality attributes measure intelligibility and naturalness through subjective quality measurements, which are mapped onto mean opinion score (MOS). Twenty /' individuals participated the experiment to test the speech quality by comparing three services frorntexttospeech. com, Natural Reader and Yakitome. Aggregate scores {{has been used to}} calculate the combination of general and specific nonfunctional QoS on TTS Web services.

The limited power, storage capacity, communications bandwidth, and user interface capabilities of these devices, however, present challenges for effective presentation of multimedia data. In this paper, we discuss how automated multimedia processing techniques {{can be used}} to address some of these challenges. <b>Media</b> <b>conversion</b> is used to generate presentations that fit the device and/or user capabilities. Content-based video sampling is used to generate a compact presentation of visual information using a small set of still images. Multimodal content processing is employed to extract relevant video clips based on a user profile of interests. The combination of these techniques creates personalized information delivery systems that reduce the storage, bandwidth, and processing power requirements, and simplify user interaction.

40|$|When dysarthrics, {{individuals}} with speaking disabilities, try to communicate using speech, {{they often have}} no choice but to use speech synthesizers which require them to type word sym-bols or sound symbols. Input by this method often makes real-time communication troublesome and dysarthric users struggle to have smooth flowing conversations. In this study, we are developing a novel speech synthesizer where speech is gener-ated through hand motions rather than symbol input. In re-cent years, statistical voice conversion techniques have been proposed based on space mapping between given parallel ut-terances. By applying these methods, a hand space was mapped to a vowel space and a converter from hand motions to vowel transitions was developed. It reported that the proposed method is effective enough to generate the five Japanese vowels. In this paper, we discuss the expansion of this system to conso-nant generation. In order to create the gestures for consonants, a Speech-to-Hand conversion system is firstly developed using parallel data for vowels, in which consonants are not included. Then, we are able to automatically search for candidates for consonant gestures for a Hand-to-Speech system.

40|$|Individuals with {{speaking}} disabilities, particularly people suf-fering from dysarthria, {{often use}} a TTS synthesizer for speech communication. Since users {{always have to}} type sound symbols and the synthesizer reads them out in a monotonous style, {{the use of the}} current synthesizers usually renders real-time opera-tion and lively communication difficult. This is why dysarthric users often fail to control the flow of conversation. In this pa-per, we propose a novel speech generation framework which makes use of hand gestures as input. People usually use tongue gesture transitions for speech generation but we develop a spe-cial glove, by wearing which, speech sounds are generated from hand gesture transitions. For development, GMM-based voice conversion techniques (mapping techniques) are applied to esti-mate a mapping function between a space of hand gestures and another space of speech sounds. In this paper, as an initial trial, a mapping between hand gestures and Japanese vowel sounds is estimated so that topological features of the selected gestures in a feature space and those of the five Japanese vowels in a cepstrum space are equalized. Experiments show that the spe-cial glove can generate good Japanese vowel transitions with voluntary control of duration and articulation.

40|$|Currently {{internet}} client {{varies widely}} both in {{hardware and software}} properties. The ever increasing requirements of clients to support heterogeneous environment, demand techniques to adapt the same content to diverse devices by pervasive computing. Content service may perform <b>media</b> <b>conversion</b> such as from text to audio. The transcoding function changes the data from one format into another. To address all these types of variation {{and to provide a}} suitable content and presentation to client proxy-based transcoding approach is used. The computational load caused by object transcoding is shared among the proxies by flexible delegation of services which reduces the transcoding load and provides fast response to the client. The data server also ensures data security by maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. The Lease Technique is proposed to ensure cache consistency among the intermediaries in CDN. A cache hit also reduces access latency for the clients. System performance thus improves, especially when a large amount of data is involved. Besides these improvements, caching makes the system robust by letting caching proxies provide content distribution services when the server is not available. With the emergence of various network appliances and heterogeneous client environments, there are other relevant new requirements for content services by intermediaries...|$|R
