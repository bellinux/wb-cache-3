Armed with four 20mm cannons in its nose and being 160km/h (100mph) faster than the Fw 200, it proved to be potent. On 6 April 1941 a Beaufighter shot down a Fw 200. Two more Fw 200s were damaged in 1942 by the Beaufighters and five were shot down in 1943 despite Condors <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to stay away from Beaufighter-escorted convoys.

500|$|After the mid-1920s, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the Aleutian Islands as a potential strategic area. United States President Herbert Hoover did not concentrate his government's resources on developing the nation's military due to the economic challenge posed by the Great Depression. In 1930, one of Hoover's aides claimed that North America's coastal islands would play little part in a potential war between the United States and Japan unless the Navy was rendered ineffective and Canada turned against its southern neighbor. In June 1933, a Japanese ship visited Attu Island three times. Although the ship was purportedly only carrying farming and forestry specialists, John Troy, then the Governor of Alaska, believed that the Aleutian Islands was a possible target for enemy navies and lobbied the federal government for military support. While Major General Benjamin Foulois was willing to commit to deploying more military resources in the resource-rich strip of land stretching from Fairbanks to Anchorage, he was not willing to devote more of his military's resources to the Aleutians, as, according to him, there was [...] "nothing in southeastern Alaska or along the Aleutian Islands which is worth <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to defend." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{described}} the album as [...] "their most underrated, {{and on this}} set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record". KNAC.coms Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a [...] "grandiosity and imposing presence" [...] which makes the record [...] "so magnificent". Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song [...] "Silent Scream" [...] for the first time: [...] "It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." [...] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood [...] "was just speed", South of Heaven proved that the group could write [...] "slow material as well". Metal Forces reviewer gives [...] "the band credit for at least <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to try something new}} and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating [...] "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while".

And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} natural {{predator}} of sperm whales is the orca, but pilot whales and false killer whales sometimes harass them. Orcas prey on target groups of females with young, usually <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to extract and kill a calf. The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them. [...] They may face inwards with their tails out (the 'marguerite formation', {{named after the}} flower). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows. Alternatively, they may face outwards (the 'heads-out formation'). Other than sperm whales, southern right whales had been observed to perform similar formations. However, formations in non dangerous situations have been recorded as well. Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members. If the orca pod is extremely large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales. Solitary mature males are known to interfere {{and come to the}} aid of vulnerable groups nearby. Individual large mature male sperm whales have no non-human predators, and are believed to be too large, powerful and aggressive to be threatened by orcas. In addition, male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate orca pods. An incident was filmed from a long-line trawler: an orca pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler's long lines (as the lines were being pulled into the ship) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the orca pod in an attempt to drive them away; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish. The orcas employed a tail outward and tail slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking orcas.|$|E
