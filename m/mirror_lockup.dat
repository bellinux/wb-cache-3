50|$|Single-lens reflex cameras have to flip up {{the viewing}} mirror before {{the picture is}} taken, which can also shake the camera. It is not {{uncommon}} for a camera to combine <b>mirror</b> <b>lockup</b> with the two-second self-timer mode, which reduces camera shake still further.|$|E
50|$|The Nikkormat FS, {{manufactured}} from 1965 to 1971, was an FT {{stripped of}} the built-in light meter with its exposure information {{system and the}} <b>mirror</b> <b>lockup</b> feature. The FS was unpopular when new {{because of the lack}} of a built-in meter, but this makes it rarer and more valuable than the FTs to collectors today.|$|E
5000|$|The Nikkormat FT {{accepted}} all lenses {{with the}} Nikon F bayonet mount (introduced in 1959 on the Nikon F camera) and a [...] "meter coupling shoe" [...] (or prong, informally called [...] "rabbit ears"). The FT had a <b>mirror</b> <b>lockup</b> allowing its use with some specialised lenses for which an auxiliary viewfinder was provided.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for having}} an {{enormous}} variety of lenses {{with the popular}} K mount to choose from, the K1000 has fewer features compared to higher-level SLRs of the mid 1970s. The camera has a flash synchronization speed of 1/60th second, a sleeve-bushing equipped shutter and film advance mechanism, no self timer, no depth-of-field preview, no <b>mirror</b> <b>lockup,</b> no interchangeable focusing screens, no motor drive option, and no autoexposure. The K1000 is a completely manual camera.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, single-lens reflex cameras {{cannot be}} made as small or as light as other camera designs—such as {{rangefinder}} cameras, autofocus compact cameras and digital cameras with electronic viewfinders (EVF)—owing to the mirror box and pentaprism/pentamirror. The mirror box also prevents lenses with deeply recessed rear elements from being mounted close to the film or sensor unless the camera has a <b>mirror</b> <b>lockup</b> feature; this means that simple designs for wide angle lenses cannot be used. Instead, larger and more complex retrofocus designs are required.|$|E
50|$|The Leicaflex SL {{replaced}} the mirror lock-up {{function of the}} original Leicaflex with a depth of field preview. The principal effect of this change was to obsolete the rangefinder-derived 21mm f/3.4 Schneider Super-Angulon lens which, due to the protrusion of the rear element into the camera body, was designed {{to work with the}} mirror locked up in conjunction with an external viewfinder. This lens cannot be mounted on the SL or its followers without <b>mirror</b> <b>lockup.</b> The original Leicaflex Super-Angulon was replaced by the retrofocus type 21mm f/4 Super-Angulon-R, which can be mounted in the conventional way.|$|E
