5|$|In October 1998, three {{bodies were}} {{retrieved}} from a well in Erdut. Days later, <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were retrieved from a well in Daljski Atar, where {{a total of}} 23 victims were found. A total of 32 sets of human remains were recovered {{in the village of}} Ćelije by 2012. The mass grave in Ćelije is toured annually by a procession commemorating the victims buried there and in several other locations in eastern Slavonia, while the site in Daljski Atar is marked by a monument to the civilian victims since 2013.|$|E
5|$|In Nuevo León, fifteen {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have died: one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed {{on top of}} him; two men {{and a woman who}} died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi-trailer truck due to the intense rainfall; a 25-year-old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence; an elderly man who died after a wall toppled over him, a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home, and a young man who fell onto the Arroyo Topo Chico. Eight <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were found after floodwaters began receding, although one {{is believed to have been}} washed away from a cemetery. Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E

25|$|A {{few months}} later, in late March and early April 2011, four <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were {{discovered}} in another area off the parkway. Suffolk Police expanded the search area up to the Nassau County border, looking for more victims.|$|E
25|$|It was {{feared that}} <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> might be {{recovered}} from the scene, but when {{the wreckage of the}} aircraft was removed on 24 August these fears proved to be unfounded. All the recovered components of the aircraft were taken to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) facility at Farnborough, Hampshire, for examination.|$|E

One hospital recorded 12 <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> brought to its morgue on 9 November, including seven pulled from a destroyed village. Another five people who were being treated for burns died.|$|E
25|$|Over time, as <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were added, {{the small}} vault became crowded, so other chiefs and {{retainers}} {{were buried in}} unmarked graves nearby. In 1865 a selected 20 coffins were removed to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii called Mauna ʻAla in Nuʻuanu Valley. But many chiefs remain on the site including: Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku, Kalaniopuu, Chiefess Kapiolani, and Timothy Haalilio.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In 219 {{recreational}} male runners, {{we investigated}} changes in body mass, total body water, haematocrit, plasma sodium concentration ([Na(+) ]), and urine specific gravity {{as well as}} fluid intake during a 100 -km ultra-marathon. The athletes lost 1. 9 kg (s =  1. 4) of body mass, equal to 2. 5 % (s =  1. 8) of body mass (P    0. 05). In conclusion, faster runners lost <b>more</b> <b>body</b> mass, runners lost <b>more</b> <b>body</b> mass when they drank less fluid, and faster runners drank more fluid than slower runners...|$|R

25|$|Five <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were {{recovered}} on February 20, and Ordinary Seaman Frank Fisher died that {{day of his}} wounds. Several <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> {{were recovered}} on February 21. Divers discovered another 20 bodies trapped below the forward hatch of the center section on February 23, but only three {{were brought to the}} surface as wreckage prevented the rest from being immediately retrieved. Two more of the wounded died that day as well. Another 12 bodies were recovered from near the engine rooms on February 22, all of them dismembered and badly disfigured. Work to free the bodies below the forward hatch continued on February 22, and was largely successful the following day. All but one was brought to the surface, and that body was too tightly caught in the wreckage to free. Another body rose of its own accord to the surface, and divers reported seeing several bodies trapped in twisted metal or in places where divers could not reach.|$|E
25|$|Three of the rescued {{people who}} were on board the Norman Atlantic were Afghan illegal {{immigrants}} who stowed aboard in lorries in the hold. Judge Volpe said that he expected that <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were to {{be found on the}} ferry. Among those killed was Ilia Kartozia, a Georgian Orthodox priest, who, according to an eyewitness, helped other to evacuate, but the rescuers failed to save him. His body was recovered off Lecce on 30 December 2014.|$|E

Vanvooren would do two <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> alike, one (Chassis 57808) for the French government, who gave it, in 1939, as a marriage gift of Prince Reza and Princess Fawzia, and another one (Chassis 57749). These two cars are in private collections in the United States.|$|E

25|$|A binary {{resonance}} {{ratio in}} {{this article should be}} interpreted as the ratio of number of orbits completed in the same time interval, rather than as the ratio of orbital periods, which would be the inverse ratio. Thus the 2:3 ratio above means Pluto completes two orbits {{in the time it takes}} Neptune to complete three. In the case of resonance relationships between three or <b>more</b> <b>bodies,</b> either type of ratio may be used (in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other) and the type of ratio will be specified.|$|E
25|$|Sea-based searching did not {{commence}} until mid-afternoon, {{when the}} Bombo's owwners {{arranged for the}} tug Warung to leave Port Kembla to look for survivors. The local fishing trawler Pacific Gull, skippered alone by Albert Barnett, made the first discovery near Coledale, being the body of Captain Bell, still wearing his binoculars and cap. His wristwatch had stopped at 10:15. Barnett spotted <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> closer to shore, but the conditions made it too dangerous to attempt to retrieve them. Further searching was carried out the next day, including by a Tiger Moth aircraft of South Coast Aviation Services, but {{the bodies of the}} remaining ten men were never found.|$|E
25|$|A {{constraint}} condition implies a restriction in the kinematical {{degrees of freedom}} of one or <b>more</b> <b>bodies.</b> The classical constraint is usually an algebraic equation that defines the relative translation or rotation between two bodies. There are furthermore possibilities to constrain the relative velocity between two bodies or a body and the ground. This is for example {{the case of a}} rolling disc, where the point of the disc that contacts the ground has always zero relative velocity with respect to the ground. In the case that the velocity {{constraint condition}} cannot be integrated in time in order to form a position constraint, it is called non-holonomic. This is the case for the general rolling constraint.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with her back against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of {{multiple}} eruptions considered to exceed the intensity and duration of those in 1872 on 10 November 2010 the intensity and frequency of eruptions was noticed to subside. By this time 153 people had been reported to {{have been killed and}} 320,000 were displaced. Later the eruptive activities again increased requiring a continuation of the Level 4 alert and continued provision of exclusion zones around the volcano. By 18 November the death toll had increased to 275. The toll had risen to 324 by 24 November and Syamsul Maarif, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) explained that the death toll had risen after a number of victims succumbed to severe burns and <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> were found on the volcano’s slopes.|$|E
25|$|At noon on 7 December 2016, {{the death}} toll was revised by Indonesian {{authorities}} to 45, according to the Head of Health Instance of Pidie Jaya, later rose to 49. The Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management sent around 740 personnel to Pidie Jaya from Pidie, consisting of the Indonesian National Army and Pidie Regency's Tagana. The death toll was later revised again to 52, as rescuers retrieved <b>more</b> <b>bodies</b> under the rubble. Most of the dead were residents in Pidie Jaya Regency. The death toll increased to 54 when 2 additional fatalities were reported in Bireuën Regency. On the afternoon of 7 December, {{the death toll}} jumped to 92, while army official had told Metro TV that 97 {{people were killed in}} the quake. On the evening, the death toll was revised to 97.|$|E
