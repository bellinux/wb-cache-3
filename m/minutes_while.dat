5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world.

The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts {{for a few seconds}} every few <b>minutes,</b> <b>while</b> Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E

5000|$|An average diver with a fully closed-circuit rebreather needs 1.5 {{liters of}} oxygen per <b>minute</b> <b>while</b> {{swimming}} or [...]64 liters per <b>minute</b> <b>while</b> resting. As a result, at least 192 L of sea water per minute {{would have to}} be passed through the system, and this system would not work in anoxic water. Seawater in tropical regions with abundant plant life contains 5-8 mg of oxygen per liter of water. [...] These calculations are based on the dissolved oxygen content of water.|$|R

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen <b>minutes,</b> <b>while</b> I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2006–07 season, {{he scored}} his first NHL goal on October 13, 2006, against Vesa Toskala {{in a loss}} to the San Jose Sharks. Bieksa rapidly {{developed}} {{into one of the}} Canucks' top blueliners and finished the season leading all team defencemen with 30 assists, 42 points and 134 penalty <b>minutes,</b> <b>while</b> also tallying a career-high 12 goals. Paired with stay-at-home defenceman Willie Mitchell, he was also regularly given a shutdown role against opposing teams' top forwards. At the end of his first full NHL season, he was awarded the Canucks' Babe Pratt Trophy as best defenceman and Fred J. Hume Award as the unsung hero. In Bieksa’s first NHL playoff game he had just over 55 mins of ice time in a quadruple Overtime victory against the Dallas Stars. Later in the series Bieksa suffered three stomach oblique muscle tears in Game 6 sidelining him for five games, before the Canucks were eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in the second round.|$|E
5|$|In the 41 NHL seasons between 1972 and 2013, 457 skaters {{have played}} for the Islanders, from 18 {{different}} countries.

The record for most penalty minutes is held by Mick Vukota with 1,879 <b>minutes</b> <b>while</b> the record for most goals is held by Mike Bossy, who scored 573 goals over a ten-year time period.

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{have been seen}} {{sleeping}} and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs {{one out of every}} three days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several <b>minutes.</b> <b>While</b> feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight <b>minutes,</b> <b>while</b> Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} diurnal, and forage {{on the ground}} or onto low {{vegetation}} in search of food, but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most Myrmecia ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, M. pyriformis is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. M. pyriformis also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals who went out to forage left the nest in 40–60 <b>minutes,</b> <b>while</b> 60% of workers would return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move {{in the direction of the}} nest. M. vindex ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and place them on refuse piles, a behaviour known as necrophoresis.|$|E
