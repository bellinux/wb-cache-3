5|$|Christmas clubs were savings {{programs}} first {{offered by}} banks in 1909. The concept was simple: bank customers deposited a set {{amount of money}} each week into a special savings account, and received the <b>money</b> <b>at</b> a later date for Christmas shopping.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending <b>money</b> <b>at</b> New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines {{and member}} of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and fellow Filipino Imelda Marcos also spent much time and <b>money</b> <b>at</b> the hotel. Another {{connection}} with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James <b>Money</b> <b>at</b> High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E

He was later found murdered {{on the corner of}} Minnesota and Mariposa Streets, on the edge of San Francisco's Potrero Hill and the Dogpatch District with his left shoe and sock missing.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was not prepared to spend further <b>money</b> <b>at</b> this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{citizens}} {{had only}} three days from 23 - 25 January to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes for the new currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, long queues formed in front of Soviet savings banks, {{even though it was}} also possible to exchange <b>money</b> <b>at</b> workplaces and post offices. This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as <b>money.</b> <b>At</b> first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually {{the shape and}} look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, Boone {{returned}} to North Carolina {{to bring his}} family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning <b>money</b> <b>at</b> this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.|$|E
5|$|At a {{bachelor}} auction, the available bachelors on display are deemed undesirable, and the auction generates no <b>money</b> <b>at</b> all. Marge then nominates Apu, who is deemed a success {{by the women}} at the auction. He goes out on dates {{with many of the}} town's women, and begins to enjoy his bachelor lifestyle. However, he receives a letter from his mother in India, reminding him of his arranged marriage to Manjula, the daughter of a family friend. Not wanting to get married, Apu asks Homer for advice, who suggests Apu tell his mother that he is already married. Days later, Apu thinks that he has escaped the marriage until he sees his mother walking towards the Kwik-E-Mart. To cover him, Homer tells Apu to pretend that Marge is his wife.|$|E
5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were growing and called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists {{had taken over the}} League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of <b>money</b> <b>at</b> the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E

By age 10 he was already singing, and performed {{at the opening of the}} Triborough Bridge, standing next to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted him on the head. Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art.
