50|$|<b>Methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> (MCA) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that contains several functional groups, a methyl ester, a nitrile, and an alkene. It is a colorless liquid with low viscosity. Its chief use is {{as the main}} component of cyanoacrylate glues. It can be encountered under many trade names. <b>Methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> is less commonly encountered than ethyl cyanoacrylate.|$|E
50|$|A nitrile is any organic {{compound}} {{that has a}} −C≡N functional group. The prefix cyano- is used interchangeably with the term nitrile in industrial literature. Nitriles are found in many useful compounds, including <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate,</b> used in super glue, and nitrile rubber, a nitrile-containing polymer used in latex-free laboratory and medical gloves. Nitrile rubber is also widely used as automotive and other seals since it is resistant to fuels and oils. Organic compounds containing multiple nitrile groups are known as cyanocarbons.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} other uses {{associated}} with its reducing power. As a polymerization inhibitor, hydroquinone prevents polymerization of acrylic acid, <b>methyl</b> methacrylate, <b>cyanoacrylate,</b> and other monomers that {{are susceptible to}} radical-initiated polymerization. This application exploits the antioxidant properties of hydroquinone.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, E.I. Cueto {{created the}} first sealant {{material}}, which was <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate.</b> However, this material was susceptible to bacterial breakdown over time, therefore was not an acceptable sealing material. Bunonocore made further advances in 1970 by developing bisphenol-a glycidyl dimethacrylate, which is a viscous resin commonly known as BIS-GMA. This material {{was used as the}} basis for many resin-based sealant/composite material developments in dentistry, as it is resistant to bacterial breakdown and forms a steady bond with etched enamel.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a safe, effective nonsurgical method of female sterilization that can be performed by paramedical personnel remains a high priority. The method should haze a blind delivery system and require only one application. <b>Methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> and quinacrine hydrochloride {{are the two most}} promising chemical agents. Quinacrine has evolved from instillations of a solution to the {{development of}} pellets to the use of an IUD vector. By using an IUD vector to deliver the quinacrine, tubal occlusion can be achieved with a reduction in total dosage and with one insertion instead of the three necessary with the solution and pellet methods.

(2017) compared different cyanoacrylates (methyl, ethyl, n-butyl and 2 -octyl) for developing latent fingermarks on glass, plastic and metal surfaces. The use of <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> {{for the development}} of fresh and aged latent fingermarks on glass and plastic while n-butyl cyanoacrylate for plastic surface was recommended. They observed that composition of latent fingermark residue effect the polymer structure. Tahtouh et al. (2011) compared different alkyl 2 -cyanoacrylate monomers (alkyl[*]=[*] 1 -cyanoethyl, 2 -cyanoethyl, trideuteromethyl and pentadeuteroethyl) {{for the development of}} latent fingermarks on wide range of semi-porous and non-porous surfaces and observed that 1 -cyanoethyl 2 -cyanoacrylate monomer gave the best results even on difficult surfaces like white opaque and fluorescent acrylic sheets and polymer banknotes printed with intaglio ink.|$|E
40|$|Nitriles {{are found}} in many useful compounds, {{including}} <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate,</b> used in super glue, and nitrile butadiene rubber. So {{we have done a}} vibrational spectroscopic investigation on 5 -Bromobenzene- 1, 3 -dicarbonitrile which has a nitrile group. The optimized geometry of the 5 -Bromobenzene- 1, 3 -dicarbonitrile molecule has been determined by the method of density functional 10 theory (DFT). For both geometry and total energy, it has been combined with B 3 LYP functional having 6 - 311 g (d, p) as the basis set. Using this optimized structure, we have calculated the infrared wave numbers, which are very useful in absence of experimental data. On Based on these results, we have discussed the correlation between the vibrational modes and the crystalline structure of 5 -Bromobenzene- 1, 3 -dicarbonitrile. A complete assignment is provided for the observed FTIR spectra. 1...|$|E

40|$|Considering that {{instrumentation}} of the apical foramen {{has been}} suggested for root canal infection control, this study analyzed {{the relationship between the}} files that bind at the apical foramen and the foraminal openings in 50 maxillary central incisors. After preparation of the pulp chamber, access to the canal was obtained with # 1 and 2 LA Axxess and K-files with tip cut were inserted up to the apical foramen until binding was felt. The files were fixed with <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> and the tooth-file sets were cross-sectioned 10 mm short of the apex. Scanning electron microscopic analysis was carried out and files and foraminal areas were measured using Image Tool software. Statistically significant difference (p< 0. 0001) was found between files and the apical foraminal areas. The mean foraminal area was 3. 8 times larger than the mean file area. The {{results of this study suggest}} that it would require 4 files of greater size beyond the one that bound to the foramen in order to allow a better relationship between files and apical openings of maxillary central incisors...|$|E
40|$|Aerogels are {{extremely}} high surface area, low density materials with applications including thermal and acoustic insulators, radiation detectors and cometary dust particle traps. However, their low density and aggregate structure makes them extremely fragile and practically impossible to machine or handle without breaking. This {{has led to}} the development of aerogel composites with enhanced mechanical properties through the addition of polymers or surface modifiers. To date, attempts to strengthen aerogels have come with significant increases in density and processing time. Here I will describe our search for a solution to these problems with our invention using <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to strengthen silica, aminated silica and bridged polysilsesquioxane aerogels. This approach led to a strength improvement of the composites within hours and the strongest composite prepared had a 100 x strength improvement over the precursor aerogel. We also developed the first approach to control the molecular weight of the polymers that reinforce silica aerogels using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Although PMMA reinforcement of silica aerogels improved the mechanical properties, further strength improvements were achieved by cross-linking the grafted PMMA. Additionally, we developed the first silica aerogels reinforced with polyaniline nanofibers that were strong and electrically conductive. Reinforcing silica aerogels with polyaniline allowed them to be used as a sensor for the detection of protonating and deprotonating gaseous species. Finally we developed a new approach for the synthesis of silica and bridged polysilsesquioxane spheres using a surfactant free synthesis. This approach allowed for the first in-situ incorporation of base sensitive functionalities during the sol-gel polymerization...|$|E
40|$|It is 15 {{years since}} Corfman {{reviewed}} transcervical oviduct occlusion and chronicled {{the history of}} the concept. * In 1849 a technique was developed to produce tubal occlusion with the application of silver nitrate to the cornua. Many other agents have since been evaluated for their tubal occlusive capabilities, such as zinc, phenol, chloride, sodium morrhuate, salicylic acid, a mixture of gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde, and cyanoacrylates. 4 Richart and others at Columbia University have worked extensively with a variety of these drugs and methods, and currently, they are working exclusively with <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate.</b> Zipper, of Santiago, Chile, has worked extensively with quinacrine and his technique has finally evolved into the quinacrine pellet concept discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. EVOLUTION OF IUD DELIVERY SYSTEMS As our interest in the further development of the concept of chemical sterilization with quinacrine was pursued, we realized that we must determine the exact pathologic changes induced by quinacrine. In 1980, Bhatt and associates reported on the quinacrine-induced pathologic changes in fallopian tubes. ’ This limited study was accomplished by inserting one application of 250 mg quinacrine pellets into the uterine cavity of 23 women awaiting hysterectomies; therefore, 46 tubes were studied. The changes induced by quinacrine were documented, and in about 50 % of the cases an obstructive lesion commensurate with tubal closure was induced. As a result of this study, a concept was developed to provide a better delivery system of quinacrine to attempt to ensure a more accurate application of the drug to the tubal ostia and to reduce the delivery system to a single event. At that time, studies were initiated using the IUD as a vector for delivering quinacrine. Requirements for these studies were that the par-The authors wish to express their gratitude to the many collaborators in the IFRP network who have contributed data used in the preparation of this chapter.
