Climate change, in particular, adds urgency to the call for renewed focus, prioritisation and integrated adaptation approaches to natural resource management, land use policies and long-term <b>macro-economic</b> <b>frameworks</b> and where these intersect. Through participatory research and interviews with women in farming communities in Dominica and Antigua, Tandon (2013) argues for small-scale, ecologically sensitive farming and fishing as a critical way to anchor local food security of rural populations, shelter domestic food markets and secure the natural bio-diversity of Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Women play a core role in articulating what food security looks like to them—and have a keen appetite for peer-to-peer networks of training, technical knowledge sharing and distribution of information to suppor...|$|R

The {{scholarly}} contributions of this thesis are (1) providing {{a history of}} chancellor rhetoric about finance, (2) describing how chancellors used their rhetoric to establish, propagate, and protect financialization, and (3) illustrating how chancellors' rhetoric indicated their pro-financialization intentions. Scholars of financialization and the state have speculated {{that the state has}} participated in discourses for financialization, but they have not investigated the historical progress of state-elite communication. Furthermore, the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>frameworks</b> used have had difficulty assessing elite intention, and institutionally-focused research can under-appreciate the agency of individuals in history. I conducted a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of the rhetoric of budget statements delivered between 1976 and 2013, supported this with quantitative, corpus-linguistic techniques, and interpreted my findings in light of the historical development of financialization in the UK. At financialization's establishment, Healey's rhetoric was explicitly ante-financialization yet implicitly proto-financialization, especially in terms of industry, while Howe's rhetoric was radically pro-financialization, especially in terms of finance and mass enrolment in it. During the two financialized booms, Lawson strengthened Howe's rhetoric, while Brown mimicked Lawson and Howe and constructed the financialized economy as secure and stable. During the first financialized bust, Major employed very awkward constructions in order to avoid admitting that finance and debt had made the UK economy vulnerable. Darling explicitly defended finance more vigorously than any chancellor, and constructed a state-sponsored right-to-credit. Osborne followed Darling, and also used his new Office of Budgetary Responsibility as an apolitical, expert guarantor in his rhetoric, mediating between financial markets and the Treasury. Since 1976 these UK chancellors have actively and intentionally supported the process of financialization with their public rhetoric by intentionally constructing descriptions in aid of financialization's establishment, propagation, and protection...|$|R

In particular, the analysis focuses on the limits imposed by the neoliberal <b>macro-economic</b> policy <b>framework,</b> Growth, Employment and Redistribution, which drastically reduced the new state’s abilities to coherently steer and plan the fundamental reconstruction and transformation of HE. The article also examines the most recent phase in the development of HE policy, which has been largely to do with attaining institutional efficiencies through mergers—a key element of HE restructuring across the globe during the past two decades.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Southern Africa, {{when viewed}} {{in the context of}} a {{developing}} region, is an area of extremes. Sophisticated urban development, financial markets, agricultural development and technically-advanced production processes form a direct contrast to the squatting, subsistence agriculture, malnutrition and unemployment found in a single complex Southern Africa socio-economic environment. The most important goal of economic development in Southern Africa is the raising of the standard of living of the entire population. The interests and needs of the individual play a prominent role in this pre-determined goal. The results that are obtained in this process are largely determined by the element of planning. In the planning stage, vision and insight need to be displayed to determine the anticipated end results.

However, given the difficulties posed by institutionalization of the CGE model and the priorities of the Finance Division, {{it was agreed that}} the modeling exercise should be compatible with the financial programming framework. Furthermore, it was agreed that the consultant team would improve the existing <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> maintained by the Finance Division. In accordance to their recommendation, the following features are added to the existing framework. •	Introduce behavioral specifications for some key variables — namely production behavior, revenue functions, capital formation, private investment functions, private consumption etc. •	Improve the interdependence between variables of different blocks namely between real side and government budget; government budget, money and BOP; money and real side. •	Introduce policy instruments to expand the simulation possibility. The range of instruments may include direct and indirect tax rates, tax base, subsidy, exchange rates etc. •	It is argued that the transfer of technology to run the proposed model partly depends on the simplicity and user’s friendly feature. Although, the simplification limits the simulation capability of the model, considering the important objective of technology internalization the model will be constructed in an ‘Excel’ spread sheet. •	The following provides specifications of the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework.</b> In accordance to the existing practice, the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> contains blocks: Real side; Government Budget; Money; and Balance of Payment. In addition to these blocks, a debt block is appended to capture debt dynamics. Data period considered in this framework is 2002 to 2007. Almost all data used in the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> has been provided by the Finance Division and the FMRP project. Breakdown of value added (i. e. GDP) by labor value added and capital value added was obtained from the updated social accounting for Bangladesh for 2005. World Economic Outlook forecasts were reviewed to get parameters for external sector (e. g. world price of imports and exports, world inflation rate etc.). It is important to note from the objective and purpose of the ‘financing programming’ that, it is essentially a framework to assess the financing options in accordance to a targeted economic growth and inflation rate. In contrast to the simulation feature of a CGE model, it is primarily an accounting framework limiting the scope to conduct policy simulations. Moreover, it is specified at the macro level restricting the scope of sectoral impacts analysis and output generation. Despite its’ limitation as a simulation framework, a number of scenario generation capabilities are incorporated. A possible list of policy simulations available in the framework is given below: •	Altering indirect tax bases (both domestic and external) various types of indirect tax bases. For instance, these may include bases of VAT, excise duty, import duties, supplementary duty, and all other taxes. •	Altering indirect tax rates. For instance, these may include VAT rates, excise rates, import duties, supplementary duty and other rates. •	Expanding direct tax bases by raising the threshold, reducing the exemption and deduction levels. •	Changing the direct tax rates. For instance, these may include personal income tax rates, and corporate tax rates. •	Expanding non-tax revenue sources. •	Expanding the coverage of the government expenditure program both re-current and capital. For instance, full or partial indexing of pay-allowance item to CPI. •	Re-setting world price of imports. •	Re-setting the growth rates of various components of money and credit. They include private credit growth; net other asset growth etc. Variations in them affect net domestic assets leading to changes in money supply. •	Re-setting the growth rates of various balance of payment. For example, they include current transfer; loan disbursement, grant disbursement. Variations in them affect current account balance and resources for deficit-financing implicating the requirement for bank borrowing. The projection outcomes cover period 2008 to 2015. Outcomes coverage include: (i) incomes and prices; (ii) government income, expenditures, budget deficit and their financing sources; (iii) money supply and usage by components; and (iv) receipts from and payments to the external sectors and balances of current and capital accounts.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade a new {{approach}} to industrial policy has been maturing, after a long period of abandonment of state-centred, top-down, and product-specific industrial policies. The new approach, stimulated by the revival of traditional industrial districts as well as new patterns of regional revival based on high tech industries, is bottom-up, associationalist, and cluster-based. As an approach that does not radically threaten the market foundations of neo-liberal thinking that has become so prevalent around the world, the new decentralised approach to industrial policy has rapidly grown from its modest beginnings into a new policy orthodoxy for dealing with spatial inequality through attempts to boost local economic competitiveness. In this paper we examine the central tenets of the new policy approach, which combines supply-side intervention with regional boosterism as a new form of industrial policy. We then critically review the applicability of the new approach in the context of countries with fragile or absent macro-economic stability, based on a detailed case study of a relatively buoyant industrial district in Argentina. We conclude that decentralised policies {{in the absence of a}} stable and interventionist <b>macro-economic</b> policy <b>framework</b> risk becoming, at best, blunt instruments, and, at worst, unwitting agents in a broader policy framework that might actually be increasing economic inequality...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The seventeenth {{edition of}} Employment in Europe appears at a {{challenging}} moment. In the international context of {{rapid economic growth}} {{in much of the}} developing world and sustained economic growth in the US, the EU seems to be mired in economic difficulties. This is why, at their 2005 Spring summit, Heads of State and Government have put employment and growth as the two main objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy, in order to raise the living standards and {{the quality of life of}} EU citizens. As set out by the new Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (2005 - 2008), the Strategy implies raising growth performance of the EU on a sustainable basis and striving for full employment, improved quality and productivity at work, and greater social and territorial cohesion. Indeed, linking economic and social progress is at the heart of the European Social Model. Creating more and better jobs largely depends on a subtle balance between the macro-economic policy mix, micro-economic reforms and effective employment and social policies. First, an appropriate <b>macro-economic</b> policy <b>framework</b> is important to reassure consumers and entrepreneurs and help maintain or restore high levels of demand. Second, reform of product markets and achieving a fully integrated economic area would bolster economic activity and thus trigger employment creation. Third, effective employment and social policies are crucial elements to attract and retain more people in employment, to improve the adaptability of workers and enterprises in the context of rapid economic change, and to increase investment in human capital through better education and skills. Action is all the more necessary in the EU in the context of current demographic trends, as the working age population will gradually diminish. These issues will feature prominently in the National Reform Programmes which Member States will adopt this autumn. Against this background, the current report sees encouraging signs of global economic recovery which should spill over and benefit Europe, if Europe actively enacts further reforms and does not simply wait for growth to appear. The benefits from such structural reforms, which have already translated into structural improvements in the past few years, should not be jeopardised by inaction. Five issues developed in detail are politically prominent. • The findings confirm that macro-economic, micro-economic and employment policies go hand in hand to deliver more and better jobs. • Overall, positive employment prospects depend on the economic cycle and on improvements in domestic demand, especially in some larger countries in the EU. • Particular concerns remain regarding the unemployment situation of young people; this is in large part why the European Council recently adopted the Youth Pact. • In the face of an ageing and declining workforce, Europe still has a large potential labour reserve to draw upon; this should receive urgent priority. • Attention must be paid to social inclusion and cohesion, preventing exclusion from the labour market and reducing regional disparities in terms of employment, unemployment and earnings, as there are worrying signs that the recent economic slowdown may have affected Europe’s record in this regard...|$|R

40|$|Attempt {{has been}} made to {{identify}} dominant forms and factors for output realization in Bulgarian farms. New Institutional and Transaction Costs Economics framework is used to estimate comparative efficiency of various modes for realization of farm outputs in farms of different type (unregistered, cooperative, agro-firms) and various sizes (small, middle-size, large). Study is based on a large-scale microeconomic data collected through interviews with managers of 0. 5 % of commercial farms in the country. Big institutional, economic, and behavioral uncertainty combined with high assets specificity and low recurrence of transactions, have blocked formation of agrarian markets in the country. Market has “failed” to organize significant part of inputs supply and outputs realization transactions. However, agrarian agents have developed various private modes to overcome transacting difficulties and to govern their dependent transactions. A great variety of in-farm production and processing, personal contacts, long-term marketing contracts, and interlinked modes etc. have come to existence and they characterize dominant structures for outputs realization in Bulgarian farming today. Major type of farming outputs realization (household consumption and giving to friends and relatives; production in-farm consumption; additional processing in-farm; long-term contract for outside processing; sell) in farms of different types and sizes has been identified and their relative share in brut farm output determined. Product specificity (grain, vegetables, fruits and grape, live animals and meat, milk, others) and its relation to specific organizational choice of outputs realization (member cooperative; other farm, cooperative or firms; retail trade; wholesale trade to store, hotel, restaurant; commodity exchange; wholesale market; in-farm processing; state reserve; direct export) have been identified and microeconomic factors for governance choice discussed. Importance of diverse factors for preferring a particular buyer or mode for realization of farm outputs (lack of alternative buyer; best prices; maximum profit; minimum risk; cheapest way; maximum security; high trust; tradition; frequency of transactions with the same partner) have been specified. Prominence of various transacting problems for realization (lack of buyers; low prices; unstable prices; no price information; no buyer information; buyer is better informed; unreliable partner; not-fulfillment of negotiated terms; controlling and enforcement of contracts; non-business factors etc.) for main farming products and type of farms have been specified. In the same way the significance of chief factors for successful realization (mutual benefits for partners; written contract; oral agreement; third-party assistance; good will of partners; tradition; trust; beneficial for farm prices; lack of competition) have been identified. High marketing costs along with the big enforcement costs of contracts in general, and enormous credit supply costs are the major factors restricting farm enlargement of Bulgarian farms as present stage. Besides, the most important factors for farm development in future relate to improvement of institutional environment (guaranteed marketing, enforcement of Laws and private contracts, <b>macro-economic</b> stability, legislation <b>framework,</b> access to free markets), and own and family experience in farm management. governing of output realization and marketing; transaction cost economics; transitional farm organization...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the second}} paper {{from a series of}} {{articles}} on governing of different types of transactions in Bulgarian farming applying the framework of New Institutional and Transaction Cost Economics. It is based on a large scale microeconomic data from 194 typical commercial farms of different sizes and types from all regions of the country. This study concentrates on factors and modes for organization of labor supply in Bulgarian farms. Structure of kind of labor (permanent, seasonal, irregular, others), and type of labor use (in production, in administration, in management, for protection, others), and labor source (own labor, family labor, hired labor, cooperative members, others) in farms of different types and sizes has been determined. Microeconomic factors responsible for various organizational and contract choices for labor supply (own cultivation, using of family labor, hiring of workers, cooperation etc.) have been specified. Dominant governing modes have been explained by comparative advantages for saving on transacting costs (for finding partners, contracting, monitoring of hired labor, conflict resolutions, renewal of contracts etc). Limits of farm extension (optimization) through effective alternative (to outside labor supply) modes for “internal” service, and inputs, and land supply have been determined. Transaction costs economizing framework has been used through analysis of: types of wage formation (time based, output based, mixed) for different categories of labor; reasons for hiring labor (extension of business, support of own labor, support of family labor, replace of family labor, others); ways of application of hired labor (in production, in administration, in management, in protection, others); personality of different types of hired labor (relatives; close friends; known before hiring; unknown before first hiring; same persons every time; from universities, agricultural schools etc; others); frequency of experiencing problems leading to suspension of labor contracts; main reasons for conflicts with hired labor (lack of qualification; lack of desire for hard work; lack of entrepreneurial spirit; cheating, stealing etc); kind of contracts with different types of labor (informal, written) and extend of specifications of contract obligations; ways of income formation (fixed monthly wages, daily based, output based, based on final year results, others) of different categories of labor in crop, livestock, services and management. Relative level of farms transaction costs associated with labor supply (for finding needed labor, negotiation and contracting, for directing and monitoring of hired labor, for contract enforcement and disputing etc.) has been determined. Besides high governing costs associated with labor contracts other factors restricting farm enlargement of Bulgarian farms as present stage are: high enforcement costs of contracts in general, and enormous credit supply and marketing costs.

40|$|The unpretentious acronym, “PRSP”, embodies {{a concept}} of {{thorough}} reform in the policies of international development. With {{the adoption of the}} Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Initiative in September 1999, the World Bank and the IMF declared the notions of national ownership and social participation to be the fundamental principles for both their loan policies and the extension of debt relief to highly indebted poor countries (HIPC II). Since then, the recipient countries have to set up their own development plans, i. e. PRSPs. And “civil society” and in particular “the poor” themselves have to assist in the setting up, operation and control of such programmes. In principle, with the PRSP approach democratisation has finally been integrated in IMF and World Bank strategy. The following report considers the extent of this conceptual change. As a concept, PRSP embraces far-reaching changes and opens up far-reaching chances. However, in the reality of PRSP processes ownership collides with the still dominant role of IMF and World Bank, participation appears as mere consultation steered by respective governments, while the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> largely remains excluded from public debate. A review of the debate on experiences with PRSP as well as two case studies on Bolivia and Tanzania demonstrate that these inconsistencies, contradictions and limitations are as far reaching as to query the concept itself...|$|E
40|$|The poverty {{effects and}} in {{particular}} the impact of trade liberalization on smallholder livestock producers in African and South East Asian developing countries (Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Mozambique, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Philippines) is addressed by disaggregating income sources within agriculture into earnings from crop and livestock production. Given that livestock production in our developing country sample is a marginal activity with very little concentration households are stratified according to a small dependence on livestock earnings, and thus separating them from crops specialized earnings households, households who are wage labor specialized, transfer dependent households, and diversified households. We combine a <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> based on a Computable General Equilibrium global model, with a micro-economic follow-up simulation drawing on information contained in eight countries' household surveys. In the assessment of poverty impacts of global trade liberalization we find significant cross-country differences between the short and long run. For all countries in our sample, with the exception of Philippines in the short run and Zambia in the long run (no change), the national headcount measure of poverty is reduced after trade liberalization. We provide an in-depth look at poverty changes in one of these economies Malawi where {{a substantial portion of the}} population is engaged in small-holder agriculture. The differential effects by stratum and the distributional welfare impact along the income distribution constitute a significant resource for policy makers concerned about the impact of trade liberalization on the agriculture sector and more specifically on livestock activities.

40|$|The Reconstruction and Development Programme {{represents}} government's {{commitment to}} eradicate poverty. For this vision to materialize, policies must be orientated towards {{the provision of}} basic needs, the development of human resources and a growing economy which is capable of generating sustainable livelihoods. The success of government's strategy for growth, employment and redistribution (GEAR) {{is dependent on the}} maintenance of a sound fiscal and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework.</b> Rural development will contribute to this policy Eradication of poverty and provision of basic minimum services is integral elements of any strategy {{to improve the quality of}} life. No development process can be sustainable unless it leads to visible and widespread improvement in these areas. There is by now enough evidence to show that rapid growth has strong poverty reducing effects and given a public policy stance, which is sensitive to the needs of the poor a focus on accelerated growth will also help in realizing the objectives of alleviating poverty. Economic growth and employment opportunities in themselves may not be sufficient to improve the living conditions of the poor. They need to be accompanied by measures that enhance the social and physical conditions of existence. Against this backdrop, the paper, critically analyses the chronological evolution and reformation of poverty reduction strategy over the successive Five-Year Plans. It also tries to capture the dilemma of the policymakers in addressing development and justice over the Successive plans in India...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of forest products in households people need to {{understand the}} nature of rural livelihoods and the characteristics of forest products. Rural households typically have a wide livelihood portfolio, encompassing a range of activities. They also generally face low availability of capital, are prone to risks and have little formal education. Many forest products are common pool resources, with some showing very little exclusivity. Many of them can be brought into a marketing chain with minimum capital investment. In the face of risk, forest products are often a source of sustenance or can be used to raise cash in the case of emergencies. Most forest products do not require high skill levels to bring them into production. There is thus a strong match between the characteristics of the rural poor and the characteristics of forest products. While this book is focussed on households, it is always necessary to see the household within the broader framework, of national policies, of a specific <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework,</b> of international tourist markets, of a global climate, etc. The book is directed to non-economists working in the context of developing countries. The purpose is to provide an overview of methods that may be used to assess the economic importance of forests to household livelihoods. The methods are presented with a number of examples of their use, most of them drawn from developing countries. There is a danger that the numbers derived by valuation become ends in themselves. A valuation exercise is only one part of a much broader understanding that is required. The authors stress the need to understand the complexity inherent in rural livelihood strategies, to fully understand the context of particular case studies, and to use valuation only as one step towards understanding decision-making within rural households...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{increasingly}} {{suggests that}} the industrial system is a large contributor to anthropogenic climate change, is increasingly creating resource scarcity, and is generating unmanageable waste to land-fill. To develop more sustainable industrial systems and sustainable societies, policy makers and industry need to better understand how to transform industrial behaviour leveraging on appropriate investment and implementation of technology. The phenomena to be studied originate in classical economic externalities. In recent years, a bottom-up approach to economic analysis, referred to as “agent-based modeling,” has been motivated by new insights on the limitations of traditional economic approaches, as well as computational advances. The key advantage of agent based modeling {{in this context is}} to explicitly treat the incentives that face behaviorally realistic agents in empirically credible environments and its ability to take into account behavioural heterogeneity and interactions, which can lead to emergent behaviour which might be very difficult to foresee in an aggregate model. We employ the EURACE agent based macro-economic model and simulator (Cincotti et al., 2010, Raberto et al. 2012) and enrich it to encompass industrial sustainability considerations. In particular, we endow the firms’ production function with an additional raw material input (provided by the environmental agent at costs rising with the demand), and with an additional output representing the creation of waste/emissions. The fiscal policy of the government agent is also enriched to include possible fiscal incentives to the industry to support investment in ecoproductivity enhancement to avoid potential future obligations to pay for mitigation/adaptation to address negative environmental impacts of industry. Preliminary computational experiments show non trivial complex behaviros, where the fiscal incentives to the sustainable transition may have different macroeconomic and environmental outcomes, depending on both the business cycles {{and the size of the}} rebound effect of the improved technology. The contribution of this work is then to initiate a new research field into the use of an agent-based <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> for investigating industrial sustainability and to assist policy makers by providing a framework to better assess policy options for investments and incentive systems to drive sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The Ecodesign Directive (EDD) {{is a key}} {{instrument}} of the EU’s energy policy framework {{and is expected to}} have a substantial impact on energy efficiency and energy demand in the European economy. We have conducted a model-based ex-ante assessment of the energy savings induced by the EDD until 2020 and 2030 for the sectors industry, tertiary and households. We first screened the regulations and lots (i. e. product-groups) to finally quantify 16 individual lots in detail. We use bottom-up models that have a very high level of technological detail, which allows simulating the EDD on the level of individual member states and lots (e. g. in the industrial sector, we simulate the electricity demand for electric motors in each member state). We calculate two scenarios: a baseline scenario without the EDD and a scenario with the current EDD implementation. The scenario analysis is preceded by an assessment of implementing measures (mostly regulations) for all lots [...] We use information from the regulations and further calibrate the models to data from preparatory studies. The <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework</b> data is calibrated to the most recent official EU projections from 2013. The results show a strong impact from the EDD. The potential savings from the evaluated lots amounts to about 225 TWh/a of electricity (and about 30 TWh of other fuels) by 2030, which equals roughly 8 % of current EU 28 electricity demand. Furthermore, the results allow comparison of the impact by country, lot and year. The major share of the savings results from appliances and lighting in the residential sector, while the importance of individual sectors varies substantially among countries. The calculations only consider implemented regulations for 16 lots. Including additional lots for where regulations are not yet in force, would considerably increase the potential savings – particularly in the industrial sector where only a few regulations are implemented so far. On the other hand, we did assume full compliance and excluded rebound effects. Both, non-compliance and rebound effects could diminish the calculated saving potential...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate over}} the virtues of free capital {{movement}} in North Africa raises extremely important and controversial issues. Why should these coun-tries liberalize their capital accounts whereas the free movement of capital is a relatively recent phenomenon? Should they take {{the development of their}} financial sector into account before opening up their capital account? What policies and reforms are necessary to ensure the success of such financial liberalization? What lessons can be learned from countries that successfully pulled off their financial integration, with a view to increasing the region’s capital flows? For now, it is still difficult to argue that capital flows constitute the engine for recovery and growth in developing countries. Accounting data show that capital flows have always supported the growth process. However, the causal link between capital flows and growth remains controversial. Empi-rical studies have not proven that capital movements have an undeniable positive impact on growth. The multi-dimensional specificity and difficulty of measuring liberalization, on the one hand, and the multiplicity of possible strategies, on the other, partly explain the results of such empirical studies. In terms of results, studies conducted so far on the impact of capital account liberalization on growth remain mixed. However, the key lesson from them is that easing control over capital movements can only be benefi-cial within a stable <b>macro-economic</b> <b>framework,</b> especially a sound financial system and near-balance real exchange rate. Furthermore, the process should be conducted cautiously and gradually over time. Otherwise, it could gene-rate disastrous consequences for North African countries. In this study, we will examine the capital flow intensity between North African countries, as well as the advantages and disadvantages that the ope-ning of capital markets could engender for these countries. The purpose of the study is to determine the possible repercussions of capital movement on the growth of North African countries, before identifying the necessary conditions in terms of macro-economic policy that would enable these coun-tries {{to make the most of}} such an option...|$|E
