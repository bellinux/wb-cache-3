25|$|Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> of Tebbetts's {{character}} is his recollection of an umpire who suffered dizzy spells following {{his return from}} the war. Afraid of losing his job, the umpire asked Tebbetts, then the Tigers catcher, to help calling balls and strikes, and Tebbetts tipped him off with hand signals following each pitch.|$|E
25|$|Critique by Fritz Lehman: Given {{that this}} book is {{intended}} as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates, Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief preserver of separate Islamic identity in India, yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given. Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the <b>most</b> <b>revealing.</b> The tone of the book in general is more reasonable and moderate than such earlier publications. Assessment of the Marathas, for example, while unsympathetic is fair to the facts.|$|E
25|$|The single <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> {{property}} of wood {{as an indicator}} of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986), as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity (Timell 1986).|$|E

25|$|The Dacians {{knew about}} writing. Permanent {{contacts}} with the Graeco-Roman world had brought {{the use of the}} Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but {{there is no doubt about}} the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century {{it became}} common {{among the men}} of the noble and knightly classes to connect the hose {{directly}} to their pourpoints (the padded under jacket worn with armoured breastplates that would later evolve into the doublet) rather than to their drawers. In the 15th century, rising hemlines led to ever briefer drawers until they were dispensed with altogether by the most fashionable elites who joined their skin-tight hose back into trousers. These trousers, which we would today call tights but which were still called hose or sometimes joined hose at the time, emerged late in the 15th century and were conspicuous by their open crotch which was covered by an independently fastening front panel, the codpiece. The exposure of the hose to the waist was consistent with 15th-century trends, which also brought the pourpoint/doublet and the shirt, previously undergarments, into view, but the <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> of these fashions were only ever adopted at court and not by the general population.|$|E

500|$|In Orkeyinga saga, the notability of Hnefatafl {{is evident}} in the nine boasts of Jarl Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, who tops his list with skill at Tafl. In Friðþjófs saga, a {{conversation}} over a game of Hnefatafl reveals that the king's men are red and the attackers white, and that the word hnefi does indeed refer to the kingpiece. [...] The <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> – and yet most ambiguous – clues to Hnefatafl lie in a series of riddles posed by a character identified as Odin in disguise (see Gestumblindi) in Hervarar saga. [...] One riddle, as stated in Hauksbók, refers to [...] "the weaponless maids who fight around their lord, the [...] ever sheltering and the [...] ever attacking him", although there is controversy over whether the word weaponless refers to the maids or, as in other versions, to the king himself, which may support the argument that a [...] "weaponless king" [...] cannot take part in captures (see Balance of play). [...] One may also note that the assignment of the colours of brown or red to the defenders and fair or white to the attackers is consistent with Friðþjófs saga.|$|E
500|$|RCA Victor {{released}} Presley's eponymous {{debut album}} on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks {{were of a}} broad variety. There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: [...] "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic Robert Hilburn—and three R numbers that {{had been part of}} Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters. As described by Hilburn, these [...] "were the <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> of all. Unlike many white artists... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases." [...] It became the first rock-and-roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position it held for 10 weeks. While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argues that the album's cover image, [...] "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands {{played a crucial role in}} positioning the guitar... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are <b>most</b> <b>revealing.</b> Now I look at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E

[...] A writer of NME felt that Grande [...] "shows herself as someone who continues to be determined to challenge the norm." [...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] does sound empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up your wrists within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that feels like it was extrapolated from the <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> scene of a James Bond film."

The single was the least successful in the US, charting only at No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, yet it managed to reach the top 10 in Japan and Canada, and top 20 in Australia. A version of the song was recorded in which the chorus was replaced with lyrics in Mandarin.|$|E
2500|$|His Head is {{a brutal}} {{asymmetrical}} {{reconstruction of the}} motif that submerges featural identity by a logic of thrusting planar forms. The result, unlike that if Filla, is the redesigning of the head {{that is no longer}} dependent upon a frontal confrontation for the <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> view, and the consistency of this sculptural context discourages trying to project missing features on the blank planes. The blunt force-fulness with which the head is shaped and thrusts in and out suggests that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling.

2500|$|David Kopf {{points out}} that <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> was Ray’s {{attempts}} to compare Krishna with Christ. For Ray, Christ and Krishna were similar as religious and ethical reformers who sought the same end of sanctifying earthly conditions. The original Buddha could also be placed in this category. [...] "The fact is," [...] wrote Ray, [...] "that essentially all reformers respond to the same conditions with identical ideas that transcend the particular time and country of birth." [...] One must understand the pattern of evolution from the Vedas to the Bhagavad Gita, as against the pattern in West Asia from the Old to the New Testament. Ray also reasoned that both Krishna and Christ were providentially designed for man’s salvation. However, Christ’s death on the cross to save mankind was a unique resolution {{of the problem of}} evil, [...] "which had no parallel in the Krishna of Gita." ...|$|E
2500|$|After so many {{exchanges of}} recrimination {{with his own}} men, and after various {{attempts}} to regroup what was becoming a progressively disorderly army, 'Ali is reported by Tabari in a <b>most</b> <b>revealing</b> passage to have explained his acceptance of the arbitration as such: [...] "It is no sin but only a failure of judgement." [...] Nothing sums up the moral and religious complexity of the situation better than this sentence. The group that made a big issue of 'Ali's dilemma were the Kharijites, who for reasons of their own could see clearly the religious and political issues involved, who agreed neither with 'Ali nor with his opponent but were in turn incapable of administering a polity of their own. Tabari's account also brings that out very clearly when he relates (p.115) how the assembled Kharijites, who were quite willing to expound {{the reasons for their}} recession from 'Ali's forces, would one by one refuse to take the leadership of their own group, a situation quite characteristic of religious purists when confronted with [...] "dirty" [...] politics.|$|E
