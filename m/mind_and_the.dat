5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system. Tour de France 1904 winner Cornet would enter the Tour de France for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.|$|E
5|$|France's {{blockade}} {{had lasted}} for two years, and the 'American' government, inspired by 'American' spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social {{results of the}} French blockade, however, had been fruitful for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate in all their nakedness {{the current state of}} <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new elements of struggle, which were to ignite a fierce war that can end only with the fall of that monstrous government.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|The first {{published}} {{depictions of the}} shell of this species appeared in 1681 in the earliest book solely about sea shells, Recreatio mentis et oculi in observatione animalium testaceorum (Refreshment of the <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eye in the observation of shell-bearing animals) by Italian scholar Filippo Buonanni. The species was shown in the 1742 Index Testarum Conchyliorum, quae adservantur in Museo Nicolai Gualtieri (List of the shells of shellfish which are preserved in the museum of Niccolò Gualtieri) by Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri. In both books, the morphology of an adult shell was shown from different perspectives.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Fosen Trafikklag {{purchased}} Inderøy Municipality's {{shares in}} Innherredferja, while Verran Sparebank bought those previously owned by Mosvik Municipality. In its {{last year of}} operation, the Skarnsund service carried 267,894 people, 108,482 cars, 13,878 trucks, 840 buses and 312 motorcycles. Skarnsund II was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK23,357,778. In 1992, the annual meeting had to be postponed due to a ferry strike, which prevented the shareholders from Ytterøy attending. Levanger Municipality and Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality were the only remaining public shareholders, and in 1992 Levanger announced that they intended to sell the Trondheim-based ferry operator Fosen Trafikklag. However, the politicians changed their <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> municipality remained as a shareholder. In 1994, both ferries were out of service and a small passenger ferry was used for a few days. In 1996, the company was again hit by a strike. Normally the service was not chosen {{to be subject to}} strikes due to the high regularity needed by the chicken manufacturer Trønderkylling, who would otherwise have to proceed with unnecessary slaughtering of animals. In 1997, a cooperation with Fosen Trafikklag started, including the two using a shared reserve ferry, Austråt.|$|E

5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans he had in <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding {{to the concerns of}} the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible reactions of the Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was the avoidance of any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern <b>Mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E
