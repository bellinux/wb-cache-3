During an August performance at Øyafestivalen in Norway, Ocean lost his voice and ended his set early. He later withdrew from his European tour dates altogether, including English rock band Coldplay's Mylo Xyloto Tour, on which he would have been the opening act during the tour's European leg in August and September. Although he did not specify his reason, Ocean issued a statement to organizers of the Way Out West Festival in Sweden, saying that [...] "Let me start by saying I feel like an asshole right now, but a tough decision had to be made in regard to <b>my</b> <b>schedule</b> over the next months ...

2500|$|Chowder was {{cancelled}} by Cartoon Network in August 2010, as {{the network}} felt the show {{did not fit}} its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as Destroy, Build, Destroy instead. On his blog, C.H. Greenblatt expressed relief about having his schedule freed up by the cancellation, saying: [...] "I didn't really think there'd be this many upsides to having a show officially cancelled by a network, but I'm feeling happier than I've been in a long time. Since we've only got post-production, <b>my</b> <b>schedule</b> finally eases up. I haven't had a break like this in a long, long time... Chowder has opened {{up a lot of}} awesome possibilities for me, and creatively I'm feeling more inspired than ever." [...] C.H. Greenblatt also noted that many of the staff signed on to a new project at Disney, which would end up being the Disney Channel animated series Fish Hooks, which Greenblatt worked on as an episode director. The cancellation of Chowder also led to Greenblatt developing a new project for Nickelodeon, Bad Seeds.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy arose {{before the}} start of the 1976 season when Golden Gaters {{co-owner}} Larry King acting in his capacity as WTT president changed the date of a match between the Pittsburgh Triangles and Boston Lobsters from May 8 to May 16, to free up Evonne Goolagong for a promotional event. Triangles owner Frank Fuhrer protested the change and called for a vote of the owners to overrule the decision. The Golden Gaters abstained from voting. The Lobsters, who were hosting the match in question, voted to accept the schedule change. However, Fuhrer got six other owners to side with him to overrule King's decision. Later, the sponsor of the promotional event appealed to Fuhrer personally and bought $10,000 worth of tickets to two Triangles matches resulting in Fuhrer accepting the schedule change. The conflicts of interest that were pervasive throughout WTT clearly caused dissent among some owners. Fuhrer was quoted as saying, [...] "We're the defending champs, and I'm not having Larry King change <b>my</b> <b>schedule</b> on me to accommodate his own interests. We're going to get all the conflict of interest out of this league." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{a lengthy}} world tour {{in support of}} Stadium Arcadium, the Chili Peppers {{decided to take a}} break in 2008. During this break, Smith joined the hard rock {{supergroup}} Chickenfoot, whose other members are Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani and Michael Anthony. The group has released two studio albums, a live album and a box set to date with Smith. Due to touring commitments with the Chili Peppers in 2011, Smith was unable to tour with Chickenfoot and was replaced by Kenny Aronoff. In 2012, Smith rejoined Chickenfoot for a four-song encore and the band briefly reunited for only two shows on May 7, and May 8, 2016 at Harrah's Showroom at South Lake Tahoe. During the show, the band debuted a brand new song titled [...] "Divine Termination." [...] In June 2016, Smith discussed the future of Chickenfoot touring and recording new music saying that [...] "everyone has different things going on.

60|$|I {{stopped the}} {{chronograph}} and wrote them down, {{and the time}} they occupied. I soon got into the way of doing all this in a very methodical and automatic manner, keeping the mind perfectly calm and neutral, but intent and, as it were, at full cock and on hair trigger, before displaying the word. There was no disturbance occasioned by thinking of the forthcoming revulsion of the mind the moment before the chronograph was stopped. My feeling before stopping it was simply that I had delayed long enough, and this in no way interfered with the free action of the mind. I found no trouble in ensuring the complete fairness of the experiment, by using a number of little precautions, hardly necessary to describe, that practice quickly suggested, {{but it was a}} most repugnant and laborious work, and it was only by strong self-control that I went through <b>my</b> <b>schedule</b> according to programme.

I went through them on four separate occasions, under very different circumstances, in England and abroad, and at intervals of about a month. In no case were the associations governed to any degree worth recording, by remembering what had occurred to me on previous occasions, for I found that the process itself had great influence in discharging the memory of what it had just been engaged in, and I, of course, took care between the experiments never to let my thoughts revert to the words. The results seem to me to be as trustworthy as any other statistical series that has been collected with equal care.|$|E

6000|$|When (if ever) {{you receive}} this {{you will know}} that (with the [...] {{exception}} of some definite bequests) I have left to you, under [...] certain conditions, the entire bulk of my fortune--a fortune so great [...] that by its aid as a help, a man of courage and ability may carve out [...] for himself a name and place in history. The specific conditions [...] contained in Clause 10 of my Will have to be observed, for such I [...] deem to be of service to your own fortune; but herein I give my [...] advice, which you are at liberty to follow or not as you will, and my [...] wishes, which I shall try to explain fully and clearly, so that you [...] may be in possession of my views in case you should desire to carry [...] them out, or, at least, to so endeavour that the results I hope for [...] may be ultimately achieved. First let me explain--for your [...] understanding and your guidance--that the power, or perhaps it had [...] better be called the pressure, behind the accumulation of my fortune [...] has been ambition. In obedience to its compulsion, I toiled early [...] and late until I had so arranged matters that, subject to broad [...] supervision, my ideas could {{be carried out by}} men whom I had selected [...] and tested, and not found wanting. This was for years to the [...] satisfaction, and ultimately to the accumulation by these men of [...] fortune commensurate in some measure to their own worth and their [...] importance to my designs. Thus I had accumulated, whilst still a [...] young man, a considerable fortune. This I have for over forty years [...] used sparingly as regards my personal needs, daringly with regard to [...] speculative investments. With the latter I took such very great [...] care, studying the conditions surrounding them so thoroughly, that [...] even now <b>my</b> <b>schedule</b> of bad debts or unsuccessful investments is [...] almost a blank. Perhaps by such means things flourished with me, and [...] wealth piled in so fast that at times I could hardly use it to [...] advantage. This was all done as the forerunner of ambition, but I [...] was over fifty years of age when the horizon of ambition itself [...] opened up to me. I speak thus freely, my dear Rupert, as when you [...] read it I shall have passed away, and not ambition nor the fear of [...] misunderstanding, nor even of scorn can touch me. My ventures in [...] commerce and finance covered not only the Far East, but every foot of [...] the way to it, so that the Mediterranean and all its opening seas [...] were familiar to me. In my journeyings up and down the Adriatic I [...] was always struck by the great beauty and seeming richness--native [...] richness--of the Land of the Blue Mountains. At last Chance took me [...] into that delectable region. When the [...] "Balkan Struggle" [...] of '90 was [...] on, one of the great Voivodes came to me in secret to arrange a large [...] loan for national purposes. It was known in financial circles of [...] both Europe and Asia that I took an active part in the haute [...] politique of national treasuries, and the Voivode Vissarion came to [...] me as to one able and willing to carry out his wishes. After [...] confidential pour-parlers, he explained to me that his nation was in [...] the throes of a great crisis. As you perhaps know, the gallant [...] little Nation in the Land of the Blue Mountains has had a strange [...] history. For more than a thousand years--ever since its settlement [...] after the disaster of Rossoro--it had maintained its national [...] independence under several forms of Government. At first it had a [...] King whose successors became so despotic that they were dethroned. [...] Then it was governed by its Voivodes, with the combining influence of [...] a Vladika somewhat similar in power and function to the [...] Prince-Bishops of Montenegro; afterwards by a Prince; or, as at [...] present, by an irregular elective Council, influenced in a modified [...] form by the Vladika, who was then supposed to exercise a purely [...] spiritual function. Such a Council in a small, poor nation did not [...] have sufficient funds for armaments, which were not immediately and [...] imperatively necessary; and therefore the Voivode Vissarion, who had [...] vast estates in his own possession, and who was the present [...] representative a family which of old had been leaders in the land, [...] found it a duty to do on his own account that which the State could [...] not do. For security as to the loan which he wished to get, and [...] which was indeed a vast one, he offered to sell me his whole estate [...] if I would secure to him a right to repurchase it within a given time [...] (a time which I may say has some time ago expired). He made it a [...] condition that the sale and agreement should remain a strict secret [...] between us, as a widespread knowledge that his estate had changed [...] hands would in all probability result in my death and his own at the [...] hands of the mountaineers, who are beyond everything loyal, and were [...] jealous to the last degree. An attack by Turkey was feared, and new [...] armaments were required; and the patriotic Voivode was sacrificing [...] his own great fortune for the public good. What a sacrifice this was [...] he well knew, for in all discussions regarding a possible change in [...] the Constitution of the Blue Mountains it was always taken for [...] granted that if the principles of the Constitution should change to a [...] more personal rule, his own family should be regarded as the Most [...] Noble. It had ever been on the side of freedom in olden time; before [...] the establishment of the Council, or even during the rule of the [...] Voivodes, the Vissarion had every now and again stood out against the [...] King or challenged the Princedom. The very name stood for freedom, [...] for nationality, against foreign oppression; and the bold [...] mountaineers were devoted to it, as in other free countries men [...] follow the flag.|$|E
