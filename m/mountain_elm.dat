5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The forest protects {{communities}} of 'southern' taiga, exemplified by dark needle conifers: fir, spruce and Siberian pine. Due to intensive commercial logging in the Kologrivsky {{area in the}} 20th century, this type of forest has been giving way to successional species of birch, aspen and alder. (Before 1960, 80% of the area was covered with dark conifers.) Today, most of the reserve is forested, but the actual islands of old-growth southern taiga are relatively small and scattered. The largest virgin stand of southern taiga in the Kologrivsky Reserve is only 918 ha. A key purpose of the reserve, therefore, is to regenerate the surrounding forest from commercial clear-cutting, through the secondary forest types and ultimately preserve a mature forest. [...] The large northern sector (the Kologrivsky site) is predominantly a spruce forest, where virgin stands are inter-mingled with second-growth forests on the sites of windfalls and wildfires. The largest spruces are 45 m in height; the lower stories include Norway maple (Acer platanoides) and <b>Mountain</b> <b>elm.</b> Some logging was done on a selective basis 75-100 years ago, but the under story was left intact; these plots have the highest biodiversity today. The Kologrivsky sector is scientifically useful for studying the dynamics of forest regeneration under various conditions. [...] Scientists on the reserve have recorded 495 species of vascular plants. [...] The animal life of the reserve {{is a mixture of}} boreal forest and mixed deciduous forest. Although the fauna is mostly representative of the Kostroma region, there are recently introduced species. The terrain, with many small slopes and soft soil favors burrowing animals such as shrews, moles, and badgers; and the extensive network of small streams and ponds supports large populations of beaver, mink and otter. The sharp continental climate with cold winters reduces the number of wintering birds and large mammals. The small number of swamps in the reserve limits waterfowl. Extensive fields of ref bilberry do support some birds and bears.|$|E

40|$|Distribution, {{biodiversity}} and reforestation {{dynamics of the}} platyphyllous forests in the Northwest European Russia were investigated. Data assembled from 21 landscape regions (250 – 350 sq. km each) show special features of small-leaved lime, Norway maple, <b>mountain</b> <b>elm</b> and English oak reforestation {{during the last two}} decades. New tendencies were found for the taiga areas with natural Norway spruce and Scots pine vegetation. Natural platyphyllous reforestation in cut spruce areas poses as supposed a special question for forest management policy in the relationship to global climate changes. Feasible unsustainability of the common types of succession (Norway spruce – European birch; Norway spruce – European aspen) is discussed. Biodiversity of herbs, shrubs and tree species of platyphyllous forests is high and complex and is situated in 4 – 15 oldgrowth relics in each landscape region. Low level genotype heterogeneity of nemoral flora species of such isolated populations is presumed. Special biodiversity conservation regulations are proposed. Part II Biodiversit...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the success of woody plantings carried out in order to revitalize small streams. For selected restorations was assessed dendrological composition, establishment, health and care after planting. The most common species planted in the revitalization of small streams is the alder (Alnus glutinosa), a pioneer tree species reinforcing shores, to which it was coupled with flowing water home. Sometimes forming groups with gray alder (Alnus incana) {{but that does not}} fit stagnant water and silver birch (Betula pendula). Also <b>mountain</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra) and willow species (Salix sp.) are widely planted along streams. Locally, there were planted common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) but mostly in very poor condition, and oak (Quercus robur), sporadically rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), dogwood (Swida sanquinea) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides). A statistical evaluation shows that the biggest influence on species composition and state of health of trees has the revitalization age. Also important is the care of the vegetation in later years after planting...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} with weak boric acid (50 g in 10 L water) was performed around trees of <b>mountain</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra) in an Ulmeto-Aceretum forest community, Šumava National Park, {{to establish the}} impact of the acid on soil Collembola, Protura and Pauropoda. Boron should improve the physiological condition of the elms and their resistance to graphiosis. Soil samples (10 cm 2 and 10 cm deep) were taken around 10 trees on 15 th July 1984. Eight of these trees (A-F, I, H) were without any previous treatment, whereas two trees (G, K) had received an application of boric acid eight months before. Immediately after the July sampling, boric acid was applied around five trees (A-E). Eight days later, a second sampling was done around trees A-E and control trees F and I. Five samples were taken around each tree at each sampling - 50 samples at the first sampling and 35 samples the second time. The soil fauna was extracted in a high-gradient apparatus, sorted into higher taxonomic groups and determined to species level in Collembola, Protura and Pauropoda. The community data and their differences before and after boric acid treatment were statistically evaluated using Sorensen's Average Linkage Method. The studied community was composed of 44 Collembola, 6 Protura and 2 Pauropoda species. The density of Collembola around the trees reached 8000 - 36 800 ind. m- 2. The Shannon-Wiener index of diversity was high (H= 3, 077). Isotomiella minor, Protaphorura s-vontoernei and Parisotoma notabilis were the most dominant species. The first two species were euconstant and constant, while the third one (C= 49, 94) was almost euconstant. All other species were recedent or subrecedent. Twenty-one species of Collembola were present eight days after the treatment around trees A-E. Five recedent species occurred in lesser numbers after the treatment. Mesaphorura tenuisensillata became constant and P. notabilis recedent. The differences in collembolan density around individual trees before and after the treatment were not significant. Also, Sorensen's Average Linkage analysis did not show differences in this mesofauna community betweeen the treated and untreated trees...|$|E

Navedeni parkovi predstavljaju istočni dio zelene potkove grada Zagreba i dio su gradske jezgre. Autor opisuje njihove dendrološke karakteristike i predlaže oblikovanje i obnovu okoliša. U ostalim parkovima zelene potkove dane su dendrološke karakteristike. To je park ispred zgrade Sveučilišta u Zagrebu te na trgovima Josipa Broza Tita, Mažuranića i Marulića. Iz opisa se vidi bogatstvo izabrane dendroflore, koja predstavlja izbor vrsta drveća i grmlja prema hortikulurnim načelima estetike i prilagodbe ekološkim prilikama. U članku autor predlaže i nekoliko preinaka kojima bi se riješili estetski i ekološki problemi. U radu se upozorava kako je potrebno posvetiti više skrbi zdravstvenome stanju drveća, posebice platana, koje su u velikom broju propale. Preporuča korištenje kirurgije drveća i zamjenu propalih vrsta. Autor naglašava kako je park prostor oblikovan elementima prirode, ali je i djelo ljudskih ruku, čovjekove invencije, znanja i mašte. The parks on Tomislav Square, Strossmayer Square and Zrinjevac {{compose the}} eastern part of the Lenuci’s Horseshoe, or the Zagreb Green Horseshoe. The {{significance}} of the existing old parks, their dendroflora, and the tending and protection in the heart of the old city is priceless Called “White City” since the ancient times, Zagreb should also remain a green city. Since the proclamation of Croatia as independent state, Zagreb has become a true metropolis, requiring a better care of its parks, particularly those in the very city centre. In the times of increased air pollution caused by city traffic, more attention should be paid to the health of the people living in the city, whose parks are best air-purifiers. Nutrients (manure) should be added to the plane trees and other dendro-plants. Tree surgery should be applied. New species should be planted in the emptied places. The existing plants should be maintained by hoeing, weeding and regular lawn mowing. Zagreb parks are great assets of the city, particularly of its centre. The valuable exotic species require special attention. Once brought from other continents, these species are being increasingly endangered by the severe air pollution. The following are some of the highly endangered exotic species: Japanese apple and Lawson’s cypress on Tomislav Square, and <b>mountain</b> <b>elm,</b> red ornamental beech, hybrid beam-tree, Himalayan juniper, hop tree bushes, groups of five fingers bushes – all on Strossmayer Square. The lines of plane trees, once 220 in number, today only 135, are the best sign of poor tending and protection of the city’s lungs. Permanent supervision and security service are necessary for the protection of all parks. Woody plants have a great value in the city architecture. They are the cultural and historical monuments. Zagreb parks were designed in the French style, which should be retained. The described dendrological properties of other parks of the Zagreb Horseshoe are not supplied with recommendations for regeneratio...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{research}} {{progress has}} recently been made in estimating fluorescence in the oxygen absorption bands, however, quantitative retrieval of fluorescence data is still affected by factors such as atmospheric effects. In this paper, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance is generated by the MODTRAN 4 and SCOPE models. Based on simulated data, sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the sensitivities of four indicators—depth_absorption_band, depth_nofs-depth_withfs, radiance and Fs/radiance—to atmospheric parameters (sun zenith angle (SZA), sensor height, elevation, visibility (VIS) and water content) in the oxygen absorption bands. The {{results indicate that the}} SZA and sensor height are the most sensitive parameters and that variations in these two parameters result in large variations calculated as the variation value/the base value in the oxygen absorption depth in the O 2 -A and O 2 -B bands (111. 4 % and 77. 1 % in the O 2 -A band; and 27. 5 % and 32. 6 % in the O 2 -B band, respectively). A comparison of fluorescence retrieval using three methods (Damm method, Braun method and DOAS) and SCOPE Fs indicates that the Damm method yields good results and that atmospheric correction can improve the accuracy of fluorescence retrieval. Damm method is the improved 3 FLD method but considering atmospheric effects. Finally, hyperspectral airborne images combined with other parameters (SZA, VIS and water content) are exploited to estimate fluorescence using the Damm method and 3 FLD method. The retrieval fluorescence is compared with the field measured fluorescence, yielding good results (R 2 = 0. 91 for Damm vs. SCOPE SIF; R 2 = 0. 65 for 3 FLD vs. SCOPE SIF). Five types of vegetation, including ailanthus, <b>elm,</b> <b>mountain</b> peach, willow and Chinese ash, exhibit consistent associations between the retrieved fluorescence and field measured fluorescence...|$|R
