25|$|Today {{the only}} {{permitted}} grape in Corton-Charlemagne is Chardonnay. However, its {{presence on the}} hill is a relatively recent occurrence. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century, Aligoté was the <b>main</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> with Pinot Beurot (Pinot gris) and Pinot blanc also being widely planted at one point. In fact, Master of Wine Remington Norman noted in his book The Great Domaines of Burgundy that when the white wines of Corton and Montrachet were receiving widespread recognition in the 8th century, during the period of Charlemagne, that it was likely from wine that was made from field blends of indigenous grape varieties rather than the single grape of Chardonnay that both regions are known for today.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> {{throughout}} Provence is Mourvèdre, {{which is}} the primary component in many red wines and rosés. Provence makes over 1,000 kinds of wines.
