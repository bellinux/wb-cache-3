The reasons for the failure of present MRP systems to address ETO environments are discussed along with an analysis of the planning systems of real companies. A new framework for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling in ETO environments is proposed.

5000|$|The first Zetec-branded {{engine was}} the Zeta family, {{introduced}} for the 1992 model year powering the fifth {{generation of the}} European Ford Escort, the third generation Orion and the Mk.3 Fiesta. The engine was originally available in 1.6 and 1.8 liter versions with a 2.0 liter version appearing in 1993 in the all-new Mondeo. The [...] "Zeta" [...] name was dropped in favour of [...] "Zetec" [...] when Italian car maker Lancia threatened to sue Ford for trademark infringement.The codename [...] "Zeta" [...] was originally used {{for the design of}} the cylinder head. A number of different systems were evaluated, and each one had a different codename using the Greek alphabet. The Zeta concept was the winner and the 4-valve-per-cylinder, DOHC design was used for the head of the replacement for the CVH in Europe and the US. The original <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan</b> involved replacing the Dearborn manufactured CVH with Zeta. This resulted in the need to retain much of the architecture of the US CVH block. However, later in the development process, the plan was changed and the Chihuahua engine plant in Mexico was rebuilt to allow manufacture of the US engines. For Europe the decision was taken to build Zetas in Bridgend (Replacing CVH) and in Cologne.The US (2.0L) and European base engines were almost identical. However, crucially, the US management insisted that the US engines had to be [...] "freewheeling", or a non-interference engine design. The fuel economy penalty with the freewheeling system (around 1-2%) was considered to be too great for European engines. The result was that the engines used different pistons. Another difference was that the US engines featured sinter forged connecting rods versus conventional cast rods in Europe. Early versions of the engine had a problem with sticking valves [...] - [...] far more evident in the UK (and in cold climates), where a driving style with earlier gear changes is more common than on the Continent [...] - [...] unless a special Ford formulation of oil was used. After small changes in 1995 to fix this problem the engine was known as the Zetec-E. This engine received a plastic inlet manifold and EGR derived from the Mondeo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{the structure and}} the functioning principles of a supervising distributed and hierarchical architecture as a necessary complement for the real-time control architecture of a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). Supervision has as its main goal to solve local-rescheduling problems as answers to breakdowns occurred during the execution of a given <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan.</b> The constraints of the re-scheduling problem include {{the achievement of the}} initial <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan</b> of the FMS and the “as restrained as possible ” propagation of breakdown effects. Basic activities of a supervision module are: detection of perturbations in FMS functioning, identification of causes and synthesis of a new local control policy corresponding to modifications occurred in the system structure. The formalism used in modeling the FMS structure and functioning specifications {{as well as in the}} synthesis of control policies is T-temporal Petri Nets. Heuristic rules are used in order to identify classes of perturbations, update process models and synthesizing controllable control policies...|$|E

Set-based concurrent engineering (SBCE) paradigm is pronounced in literature and believed to form the foundation of lean thinking in PD. In SBCE, alternative product-subsystems are explored simultaneously and weak design choices are progressively eliminated as more knowledge about manufacturability becomes known.
