50|$|Mycoplasmas {{have been}} {{isolated}} from tissues of a white-rumped vulture. <b>Mallophagan</b> parasites such as Falcolipeurus and Colpocephalum turbinatumhave been {{collected from the}} species.Ticks, Argas (Persicargas) abdussalami, have been collected in numbers from the roost trees of these vultures in Pakistan.|$|E
40|$|Three {{groups of}} ectoparasites, namely, Mallophaga, ticks and feathermites, were {{recovered}} from {{two hundred and}} sixty-seven alcids of six specie's (Alca torda, Uria aalge, Uria lomvia, Plautus alle, Cepphus grylle, Fratercula arctica) examined. Mallophaga of the genera Saemundssonia, Quadraceps (Ischnocera) and Austromenopon (Amblycera) were recovered from five alcids; only Saemundssonia and Quadraceps from C. grylle. One species of ixodid tick, Ixodes (Ceratitodes) uriae, was recovered from all but P. alle and C. grylle, the majority of which were examined in the winter. Only A. torda and F. arctica harboured feathermites belonging to the genus Alloptes. Four new geographical records and one new host record are reported. [...] No significant difference (P > 0. 05) {{was found in the}} <b>mallophagan</b> infestation of hosts and in the tick infestation of U. aalge from year to year. The tick infestation of F. arctica differed in 1972 and 1973, probably due to few immature Larus argentatus being present in the colony during the latter year. No significant difference was noted for the <b>mallophagan</b> and tick infestation of hosts with regard to sex of the hosts. A correlation was noted only between the weight and <b>mallophagan</b> infestation of U. lomvia. [...] Data on the degree of infestation of both adults and chicks with each parasite species are presented. The infestation of adult hosts was related to the host habitat. Chicks were always more heavily infested with Mallophaga than adults. Fluctuations, related to tho host biology, occurred in the <b>mallophagan</b> population on F. arctica. Details on the transfer of Mallophaga from adults-to-chicks are given. [...] The distribution of each parasite species on the hosts was determined; the same <b>mallophagan</b> genus generally occupying the same habitat on the different host species. The tick distribution on hosts varied with the host species. [...] The population dynamics of each <b>mallophagan</b> species on each alcid was examined. Due to increased reproductive activity, nymphs were more common on adults during the winter and were always dominant on chicks. The sex ratio of each species varied with the host, females being generally more common in winter and on chicks. Correlations were determined for the stages and sexes of each species population on hosts. [...] An ischnoceran and an amblyceran occupied virtually the same habitat on the hosts with correlations always existing between them. No interspecific competition existed between the genera on each host. All stages and sexes of the total <b>mallophagan</b> population on hosts were correlated. [...] Ixodes ariae preferred U. aalge as hosts. Their distribution in the colony was affected by the density of the hosts and the substrate. The seasonal activity of the tick in the hesting areas and on the hosts were similar. The engorgement time for each stage on various hosts was determined and their percentage increases in weight recorded. The pathological reaction bf the host's skin to tick attachment is described. Observations were made on reproduction and measurements made of a spermatophore. The oviposition rate and the development of each stage under different temperatures and humidity regimes was determined. The life-cycle, based on field and laboratory data, is presented...|$|E
40|$|In 1971, 1983 and 1984, ectoparasites were {{identified}} on 61 ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) from Nebraska. Birds were collected {{throughout the state}} from 11 of 93 counties. Four species of chewing lice (Mallophaga) were collected: Lipeurus maculosus, Goniodes colchici, Lagopoecus coichicus and Amyrsidea megalosoma. One species of analgid mite, Megninia sp. was collected. Apparently, this species is new and undescribed. The four <b>mallophagan</b> species have not been reported from Nebraska...|$|E
40|$|Feather holes have {{traditionally}} been suggested to be feeding traces of chewing lice (mallophagans). There is controversy whether mallophagans are the real source of feather holes. We studied <b>mallophagan</b> infestations and holes in tail feathers of 528 rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta collected 2007 – 2012 in northeast Iceland. Three mallophagans were found, Amyrsidea lagopi (prevalence 13 %), Goniodes lagopi (72 %) and Lagopoecus affinis (51 %). The prevalence of feather holes was 15 % and based on pattern the holes could be separated into two groups termed feather hole swarms (FHS), prevalence 9 %, and single holes (SH), prevalence 6 %. Holes for FHS were concentrated in the central tail feathers and decreased outwards, but holes for SH did not show any such pattern. There was a significant positive relationship {{between the number of}} holes for FHS birds and A. lagopi number, and the prevalence was similar. No other combinations of FHS or SH and the mallophagans indicated any relationship. The observed differences between FHS and SH suggest that feather holes have different origin. Our thesis based on known feeding habits of amblycerans like A. lagopi is that the holes in FHS are created during the pin feather stage when the lice bite the pin feather to draw blood. The holes in FHS were often in lines parallel to the feather shaft and the distance between adjacent holes was similar to the daily growth band, and where apparent the holes were sitting in the light portion of the band suggesting diurnal rhythm in lice feeding activity. Concluding, feather holes in ptarmigan may have various origins, but there is a clear correlation between the presence and numbers of A. lagopi and FHS. This is a novel finding for the grouse family and the genus Amyrsidea and should be a valuable contribution to the studies of feather hole formation.
