Gender, Occupation Choice and the Risk of Death at Work Abstract: Women and men tend to work in different occupations. There has been substantial movement over the last forty years toward a more even distribution of men and women across occupations, but differences persist. Although a great deal of research has been devoted to the measurement of trends in occupation segregation by gender, very little work has focused on the underlying job choice process that generates this segregation. What makes men and women choose the jobs they do? Using employment data from the 1995 - 1998 Current Population Surveys and data on occupational injuries and deaths from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we estimate conditional logit models of occupation choice {{as a function of the}} risk of work-related death and other job characteristics. Our results suggest that women choose safer jobs than men.

5000|$|Learning: Learning can be {{social or}} nonsocial. Consider {{the example of}} a child {{learning}} about bees. If is child is exploring and playing with no one else around, the child may see a bee and touch it (out of curiosity). If the child is stung by the bee, the child learns that touching bees is associated with pain. This is nonsocial learning, since no one else was around. In contrast, a child may benefit from social learning about bees. If the child is with <b>mom,</b> <b>dad</b> <b>or</b> anyone else, the child's inquisitive approach to a bee may lead to some kind of social intervention. Maybe Aunt Emy sees the child reaching for a bee and simply points the child in another direction, saying [...] "Look at that pretty butterfly." [...] Maybe Uncle Ed would say, [...] "Don’t touch the bee, because it can hurt you and make you cry." [...] Maybe Mom would have said, [...] "Honey, stay away from bees because they sting." [...] There are all sorts of ways that people can interact with a child to help the child learn to avoid ever being stung. Any and all of these social interventions allow the child to benefit from social learning, though some of these social interventions may be more educational and useful than others.|$|R

5000|$|The tone of {{the album}} is {{intended}} to be happy and upbeat. Abrams wanted to [...] "put out good vibes" [...] with the music, explaining that he hoped to help people [...] "feel good about the world". The album progresses into somewhat more negative subject matter as it goes on though. [...] "We all thought it would be funny if we started the album off really happy and then got to the negative content", Abrams said. Opening track [...] "Simple Life" [...] was a collaboration with Toby Gad. A bass line that Gad played on the piano reminded Abrams of relaxing in his hammock and [...] "looking up at the sky." [...] The song developed from a discussion that the two had about [...] "how nice" [...] it is to take a break from technology every now and then and just go outside to enjoy nature. One time when Abrams wanted to do this, he was at a friend's house, in an area that he was unfamiliar with. Despite his desire to [...] "go play guitar behind the house and be in nature", he was wary of the location. Reminding himself that he was now an adult, he [...] "tuned his guitar down to a dropped D" [...] and told himself, [...] "I'm not scared of ghosts no more." [...] From this emerged the song [...] "Ghosts", which he took to Rune Westberg for further development. An additional element was then added, to make the song about staying the same in a relationship even when other aspects of your life are changing. [...] "Great Bright Morning", which Abrams described as [...] "a friendship song", was written with Andy Stochansky and Jamie Hartman. The song continues the theme of exploring nature and is about Abrams' dog, Rocky. [...] "He's got a stub instead of a tail", explained Abrams. [...] "I think that is probably the coolest part...it is so funny because whenever someone comes home, if I come home or my <b>mom</b> <b>or</b> <b>dad</b> walks in, he gets really excited and starts shaking his little stub." [...] Abrams has had Rocky since the fifth grade and adopted him out of a bundle. He pictured the two of them [...] "walking through the hills of Idyllwild" [...] for the song - his hometown, where he has called the hills [...] "magical", and of which he said, [...] "You can watch a sunset there, and the only other person to enjoy it with you is your dog." [...] "To be honest, I've probably eaten mangos three times in my life, but 'eating mangos in a mango tree' is fun to say" [...] Casey Abrams on one of the lyrics to [...] "Stuck in London". Another location that had influence on the album was London. Abrams recorded all of the songs in that city, at Kensaltown Studios. He found this to be a unique experience, as the room was [...] "totally open" [...] and had windows. The mixer was not in a separate room - he could hear all of the music. Most of Abrams' vocals were recorded while sitting on a couch. Since Abrams played live, sounds of the city, such as buses, clock towers, and birds, made it onto the recordings and can be heard on the finished album. [...] " [...] I think recording anywhere else other than LA has different kinds of vibes", Abrams said about the experience. He felt that recording in London [...] "captured the wonder" [...] and the [...] "wanderlust" [...] that he felt about the city. An initial two week stay extended into six, and during this time, Abrams wrote two songs - one of these is [...] "Stuck in London". While walking around the city, Abrams began forming a melody for the song. After playing his ideas for Terefe, he was advised to [...] "reverse the chords of the chorus". Joined by co-writer Sacha Skarbek, the trio then took the song in a [...] "party jazzy" [...] direction. [...] "I loved it. He just went along with my madness and made it into the Caribbean dance party fun track", Abrams said. Wanting to use evocative imagery in the song, Abrams came up with [...] "fun" [...] lyrics that held little bearing on his actual life.|$|E

40|$|A set of {{training}} wheels {{on a bicycle}} {{is a classic example}} of scaffolding. It is adjustable and temporary, providing the young rider with the support he or she needs while learning to ride a two-wheeler. Without an aid of this sort, the complex tasks of learning to pedal, balance, and steer all at one time would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for many youngsters. This scaffold— training wheels—allows the learners to accomplish a goal, riding a bicycle successfully, and then to happily pedal his or her way into the wider world. ” ~Michael F. Graves, Bonnie Graves, and Sheldon Braaten, “Scaffolded Reading Experiences for Inclusive Classes” Over the years, instructional scaffolding has been compared to many things. There have been thoughts that scaffolding was comparable to the braces used by workers construct a new building. Or, as you read in the quote above, like the training wheels on a bike that help ensure the rider has help even if <b>mom</b> <b>or</b> <b>dad</b> are not there to hold the seat as they ride down the sidewalk. Teachers and parents have been using scaffolding perhaps even before the term was named. And, while analogies may differ, the basic premise that scaffolding is one of the most effective instructional strategies available to teachers still remains true (Graves, Graves, & Braaten, 1996). The term scaffolding was first used, in instructional context, by Wood, Bruner, and Ross in their 1976 article, “The Role of Tutoring in Problem Solving”. They used the term “scaffolding ” as a metaphor to describe a “process that enables a child o...|$|E
