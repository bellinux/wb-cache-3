Also listed were 2,004,976 wounded and 6,074,552 sick and injured. Total losses were not broken out for the UK and each Dominion, the figures are for losses in combat theaters only and do not include casualties of forces stationed in the U.K from accidents or disease, casualties of the Royal Naval Division are also not included in these figures; the losses of the Gallipoli Campaign are for British forces only, since records for Dominion forces were incomplete.

25|$|Hill had a {{distinguished}} career {{in research and}} teaching and as author of a very successful textbook, Principles of <b>Medical</b> <b>Statistics,</b> but he is famous for two landmark studies. He was the statistician on the Medical Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their study evaluating the use of streptomycin in treating tuberculosis, is generally accepted as the first randomised clinical trial. The use of randomisation in agricultural experiments had been pioneered by Ronald Aylmer Fisher. The second study was rather {{a series of studies}} with Richard Doll on smoking and lung cancer. The first paper, published in 1950, was a case-control study comparing lung cancer patients with matched controls. Doll and Hill also started a long-term prospective study of smoking and health. This was an investigation of the smoking habits and health of 40,701 British doctors for several years (British doctors study). Fisher was in profound disagreement with the conclusions and procedures of the smoking/cancer work and from 1957 he criticised the work in the press and in academic publications.|$|E

2500|$|Despite all this, {{scholars}} remain divided {{as to how}} [...] "special" [...] {{the human}} vocal tract really is. It {{has been shown that}} the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent. As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costsnbsp&— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing foodnbsp&— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefitnbsp&— so it is claimednbsp&— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact not seriously at risk of choking on food: <b>medical</b> <b>statistics</b> indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens. A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was initially driven by selection pressures for speech.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was conducted}} to determine which syndromic surveillance tools complement traditional surveillance by serving as earlier indicators of influenza activity in Sweden.

The web query algorithm and <b>medical</b> hotline <b>statistics</b> performed equally well as {{each other and to}} the traditional surveillance tools. School absenteeism data were not reliable resources for influenza surveillance.
