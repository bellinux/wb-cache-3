6000|$|Aunt Rebecca, a trim {{little woman}} with brown eyes, {{looked at us}} reflectively, [...] "Well, now, I don't know. I guess we'll have to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> for them on the floor." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Pinkeye", {{an episode}} of South Park Eric Cartman appears to be dressed as a Klansman for Halloween when his {{principal}} <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> sheet ghost costume with a pointed hood.

6000|$|At length Alday {{rose and}} {{addressed}} me. [...] "Señor, {{if you are}} ready to rest I will now conduct you to another room, where you can have some rugs and ponchos to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> with." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with {{a cheerful}} voice, [...] "that {{the horse was}} {{properly}} suppered up, and that the gudewife should <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> up {{for him at the}} house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the like o' them could gie him." ...|$|E

60|$|After {{about two}} hours' steady work he had cut {{enough of the}} tender {{branches}} to <b>make</b> himself <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> into which he and the monkey could burrow and sleep as comfortably {{as if they were}} in the softest bed in Uncle Daniel's house.|$|R
6000|$|HERBERT [...] Why so? a roofless rock {{had been}} a comfort, [...] Storm-beaten and bewildered as we were; [...] And in a night like this, to lend your cloaks [...] To <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> for me!--My Girl will weep [...] When she is told of it.|$|E
60|$|LADY CICELY. I'm {{going through}} every room in this castle {{to find a}} proper place to put that man. And now I'll tell you where YOU'RE going. You're {{going to get some}} water for Marzo, who is very thirsty. And then, when I've chosen a room for him, you're going to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> for him there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just now, for {{she told}} me she should go deeper into the woods, lest she should be seen; but an hour afore sundown she's to come {{to the foot of the}} great chestnut, just ag'in the berry lot; and I promised to meet her, or to carry her out suthin' for supper, and to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> on." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{that he went}} to work happily to <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> to suit him, and by {{the time}} the first Black Shadow had crept as far as the big maple tree, Happy Jack was curled up fast asleep in his new house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty much," [...] said Raymond. The {{squirrel}} lay gasping helplessly in Raymond's hands. [...] "Here, {{put him in}} my cap," [...] said Caleb; [...] "that will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good <b>bed</b> for him, {{and perhaps}} he will come to life again." ...|$|R

60|$|Then Charnock said {{something}} and Festing let them talk while he looked about. Since a temporary job was required, {{he thought the}} plan was perhaps the best that could be used. It called for a timber framework, beginning about half-way up the bank, although its height would vary with the ground. The gaps between the frames would be faced with rockwork and then filled with rubble in order to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> for the rails on top.|$|E
60|$|This point decided upon, {{the next}} {{was to try}} to fix up {{something}} soft for a bed. He had his pocketknife with him, and in his little valley were pine and hemlock trees in abundance. From the tips of their branches he knew that he could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> as soft and fragrant as any that could be thought of, and he set to work at once, while Mr. Stubbs continued his antics above his head.|$|E
60|$|The {{moon was}} getting low and ragged pine {{branches}} cut against the light. The track {{was wrapped in}} shadow that was only a little less dense than the gloom of the surrounding bush. It was not really cold for North Ontario, but the fur coat was hardly enough protection to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> {{in the open air}} comfortable. Foster had slept in the Athabasca forests when the thermometer marked forty degrees below zero, but he then wore different clothes and had been able to make a roaring fire and build a snow-bank between him and the wind. Moreover, he was still liable to be overtaken by the men on the train.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to sleeping," [...] {{the woman}} said, [...] "John and I {{have been talking}} it over, {{and the best way}} we can see is that you should sleep with me, ma'am, and we will <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> on the floor here for my husband and yours." ...|$|R
60|$|Old Toller made a last {{attempt to}} persuade {{me that it}} was not worth a gentleman's while to accept his hospitality, and found me immovable. I was equally obstinate when Cristel asked leave to <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> for me in the counting-house at the mill.|$|R
60|$|AUNT JUDY. Indeedn you'e not goin to a hotel. You'll {{stay with}} us. I'd have put you into Larry's room, only the boy's pallyass {{is too short}} for you; but we'll <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{comfortable}} <b>bed</b> for you on the sofa in the parlor.|$|R
6000|$|When the King {{awoke in}} the early morning, he found that a wet but {{thoughtful}} rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom. Being disturbed now, it scampered away. The boy smiled, and said, [...] "Poor fool, why so fearful? I am as forlorn as thou. 'Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so helpless. Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king has fallen so low that the very rats do <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> of him, it surely meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no lower go." ...|$|E
60|$|The men {{unpacked}} and unsaddled the horses, and, hobbling their forefeet together, {{turned them}} loose. Twilight had fallen and each man {{appeared to be}} briskly set upon his own task. Glenn was cutting around {{the foot of a}} thickly branched cedar where, he told Carley, he would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> for her and Flo. All that Carley could see {{that could be used for}} such purpose was a canvas-covered roll. Presently Glenn untied a rope from round this, unrolled it, and dragged it under the cedar. Then he spread down the outer layer of canvas, disclosing a considerable thickness of blankets. From under the top of these he pulled out two flat little pillows. These he placed in position, and turned back some of the blankets.|$|E
60|$|They {{found it}} dry work, eating this without water; and soon desisted, {{gathered}} some grass to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> and were asleep {{a short time}} after it became dark. They were now in an open district, not having seen a tree since they started in the morning, and they had therefore less fear of being disturbed by wild beasts. They had, indeed, talked of keeping watch by turns; but without a fire, they felt {{that this would be}} dull work; and would moreover be of little avail, as in the darkness the stealthy tread of a lion would not be heard, and they would therefore be attacked as suddenly as if no watch had been kept. If he should announce his coming by a roar, both would be sure to awake, quickly enough. So, lying down close together, with their spears at hand, they were soon asleep, with the happy carelessness of danger peculiar to youth.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would the}} {{stranger}} had found some other shelter {{in which to}} pass his short resting season. That he hath made free with my flock, and that he hath administered to his hunger at some cost, when a single asking would have made him welcome to the best that {{the owner of the}} Wish-Tori-Wish can command, are truths that may not be denied. Still is he mortal man, as a goodly appetite hath proven, even should our belief in Providence so far waver as to harbor doubts of its unwillingness to suffer beings of injustice to wander in our forms and substance. I tell thee, Ruth, that the nag will be needed for to-morrow's service, and that our father will give but ill thanks should we leave it to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> on this cold hill-side. Go to thy rest and to thy prayers, trembler; I will close the postern with all care. Fear not; the stranger is of human wants, and his agency to do evil must needs be limited by human power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well said, {{youthful}} scribe! With such listeners as you two, I {{could go}} on forever. Consider yourselves clapped jovially on the back, my gentle Briggs; I can't get up to do it from the hollow of your bed here. As you were saying, the wonder about these elderly widows who keep boarding-houses is the domestic dilapidation they fall into. If they've ever known how to cook a meal or sweep a room or <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> these arts desert them {{in the presence of}} their boarders. Their only aim in life seems to be preventing the escape of their victims, and they either let them get into debt for their board or borrow money from them. But why do they always have daughters, and just two of them: one beautiful, fashionable, and devoted to the piano; the other willing to work, but pale, pathetic, and incapable of the smallest achievement with the gridiron or the wash-board? It's a thing to make a person want to pay up and leave, even if he's reading law. If Wallace, here, had the spirit of a man, he would collect the money owing him, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|After a while, he {{ran over}} to a hole between the stones of the old wall and pretended to be very busy there, just as if it really were the new house he had found. He kept popping in and out and looking around as if afraid that some one was {{watching}} him. He even got some dry leaves and took them inside, as if to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed.</b> All the time, although he hadn't seen a sign of Peter, he didn't have the least doubt {{in the world that}} Peter was watching him. When he grew tired, a new idea popped into his shrewd little head. He popped out of the hole and sat up on the wall. Then he said aloud that verse which had made Peter's ears burn so. He had meant to make Peter's ears burn. He said that verse just as if he really did believe that Peter was not spying on him and was glad of it. When he had finished, he whisked out of sight again to give Peter a chance to get away. But this time Chatterer did some peeking himself. He hid where Peter couldn't see him, but where he himself could see both ways along the old stone wall, {{and so it was that}} he saw Peter crawl out from under the little bush where he had been hiding and sneak away in the direction of the Old Briar-patch. And he knew that this time Peter had gone for good.|$|E
5000|$|Usually <b>a</b> flat <b>bed</b> sheet is {{overlocked}} {{around the}} edges to form four seams. One of the seams is wider than the other three and helps with orienting the sheet correctly on the mattress. The wider seam goes at the head end of the mattress. Sometimes the sides do not have seams, but are finished with the selvedge only. When placing a flat sheet on <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> the manufacturer has designed the printed side to be softer, and thus it {{should be placed on}} the bed printed side [...] "down". When folding back the covers, this also allows the printed side to show, for aesthetic purposes. When one <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> the patterned or monogrammed side of the top sheet is placed facing down and then the top edge is folded towards the foot of the bed, exposing the design.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what we will do," [...] said Mary Bell. [...] "We will go to another window where there are no blocks below, and throw all the {{shavings}} out from the kitchen. That will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> soft <b>bed</b> for us to jump upon." ...|$|R
