This work compares real costs for one <b>machine-hour,</b> which are paid for machine work and theoretical counted costs. These costs contain all possible costs which can inflict change of cost of <b>machine-hour.</b> By comparing of that results is find out, when the machine is busy enough and if this machine makes some kind of profit or if this is totally other way round. For this results is designed work optimisation, which sets up the profit border which should not be exceeded by machines. This is the way how to reduce useless burden and also reach to profit and other prosperity of company...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanized}} harvest {{system was}} analysed, {{working in a}} radiata pine clear cut operation and compound by a feller buncher, a grapple skidder, a grapple processor and a three-wheeler. A Discrete Event Simulation Model was built with the goal to balance the system. The mechanized wood processing was the bottleneck according to the time study results, then this process was supported adding 3 chain saw felling operators to reach a yield of 60. 82 m³/Productive <b>Machine-Hour</b> (PMH) in the configuration proposal. Also the simulated skidding was done, operating the grapple skidder at 80 m Average Skidding Distance (ASD) with one loading stop at a bunch for four stems to balance the obtained processing yield. Finally, the feller buncher can spend 1. 6 extra minutes grouping the modify bunches to accomplish the expected yield of the system. The simulation experiment gives 60. 39 m³/PMH expected yield of the system if all the proposed modifications in felling, bunching, skidding and processing are done...|$|E
40|$|Selection of {{construction}} methods, scheduling, site layout and component procurement arrangement affect efficiency of operations on the jobsite. Efficiency {{has been previously}} measured by such parameters as; budget, on time completion and meeting specification standards. Little {{attention has been given}} to the interim processes which create these. Efficiency in man- and <b>machine-hour</b> management may translate to cost and time gains and enhanced quality. The study reported recognises that there are numerous aspects to the question of efficiency of operations. To focus the study and narrow the scope to a manageable size, the issues of efficiency that can be addressed in the scheduling process are those considered. Extensive and thorough literature search identified guidelines for effective construction scheduling. Empirical data were collected following these guidelines to develop a scheduling procedure aimed at making the process more effective and which may enhance efficient use {{of construction}} resources on the jobsite. The developed framework show that activity criticality based on time analysis alone is a necessary condition but not usually sufficient to declare an activity critical. Other tasks not on the critical path which have very high delay potential should be considered. Therefore though the study does not out rightly refute the idea of criticality based on time analysis alone, it adds to it that if criticality means those things that should be done so as to progress the works to a scheduled finish, criticality should be re-assessed to include several other tasks not hitherto identified on the critical path...|$|E

40|$|Batched stream {{processing}} {{is a new}} distributed data processing paradigm that models recurring batch computations on incrementally bulk-appended data streams. The model is inspired by our empirical study on a trace from a large-scale production data-processing cluster; it allows a set of effective query optimizations that are not possible in a traditional batch processing model. We have developed a query processing system called Comet that embraces batched {{stream processing}} and integrates with DryadLINQ. We used two complementary methods {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of optimizations that Comet enables. First, a prototype system deployed on a 40 -node cluster shows an I/O reduction of over 40 % using our benchmark. Second, when applied to a real production trace covering over 19 million <b>machine-hours,</b> our simulator shows an estimated I/O saving of over 50 %.

40|$|Abstract: As cloud {{services}} grow to span {{more and more}} globally distributed datacenters, there is an increasingly urgent need for automated mechanisms to place application data across these datacenters. This placement must deal with business constraints such as WAN bandwidth costs and datacenter capacity limits, while also minimizing user-perceived latency. The task of placement is further complicated by the issues of shared data, data inter-dependencies, application changes and user mobility. We document these challenges by analyzing monthlong traces from Microsoft’s Live Messenger and Live Mesh, two large-scale commercial {{cloud services}}. We present Volley, a system that addresses these challenges. Cloud services make use of Volley by submitting logs of datacenter requests. Volley analyzes the logs using an iterative optimization algorithm based on data access patterns and client locations, and outputs migration recommendations back to the cloud service. To scale to the data volumes of cloud service logs, Volley is designed to work in SCOPE [5], a scalable MapReduce-style platform; this allows Volley to perform over 400 <b>machine-hours</b> worth of computation {{in less than a}} day. We evaluate Volley on the month-long Live Mesh trace, and we find that, compared to a stateof-the-art heuristic that places data closest to the primary IP address that accesses it, Volley simultaneously reduces datacenter capacity skew by over 2 ×, reduces inter-datacenter traffic by over 1. 8 × and reduces 75 th percentile user-latency by over 30 %. ...|$|R
40|$|A company´s {{production}} at best is efficient, flexible and lean {{at the same}} time. Vice versa, a production is not well prepared for future challenges when changes and turbulences pose a serious danger {{to the performance of}} production processes or there is too much waste instead of value-adding within a process. As lean principles and flexibility are hard to quantify, existing approaches evaluate either the efficiency or the implementation of lean principles, which are aimed at flexibility. However, as efficiency, flexibility and lean principles are partly competing objectives, an approach to evaluate a company´s production has to be focused on their interdependencies. As production not only includes the production processes themselves but also supporting processes, necessary for the production activities but not value-adding (e. g. maintenance, planning and controlling, administration), the consideration of these processes within the evaluation of the production is essential. Activity based costing enables a company to assess processes and calculate the different costs of different product variants within production support operations. The appropriation of production assets to the product variants occurs by the <b>machine-hour</b> rate. These approaches imply a predicted production program and associated costs. If the production program changes - in volume, allocation of volume between different variants and the number of variants itself - costs along the value stream will change. For example, a new production program requires an adjustment of lot sizes, work in process increases and thereby efforts for logistics and changeovers alter. Along the value stream it is also possible, that other bottlenecks anticipate the designated production program and require additional investments to achieve the intended output. This paper describes the principles of an approach evaluating the flexibility of the production processes to produce a changing production program (product variants and production volume) and its impacts on the cost curves of a complete value stream including its support processes with the help of activity based costing. It facilitates the evaluation of production´s efficiency as well as its flexibility to react on changing product variants and production volume. It also locates cost intensive processes that can be eliminated or reduced and shows effects on key performance indicators of lean principles, like throughput time and processing time...|$|E
40|$|Usage {{efficiency}} {{of mechanical engineering}} products is determined by level of their operating capability. Expenses connected with provision of operating capability for the whole operational period exceed initial cost of the products by 6 - 10 -fold. Moreover, while being used the expenses {{have a tendency to}} increase with reduction of output parameters that ensure product application efficiency for its intended purpose. It is necessary to take into account these changes at manufacturing stages of mechanical engineering products. Maximum efficiency can be obtained at the operational stage of the product life cycle only as a result of complex and interrelated measures during designing, manufacturing and usage of the specific product for its intended purpose with due account of its output parameter dynamics. While using the product an analysis of its output parameter dynamics will make it possible to determine maximum value of the operating capability, operational expenses and best practices for obtaining maximum profit per operating time unit. Taking hydroficated excavators of the 5 th grade as an example the paper presents dynamics of main output parameters at the operational stage of their life cycle; reveals the main factor influencing on intensity of hydroficated machine operating capability reduction; substantiates an expediency of taking into account output parameter dynamics while evaluating {{efficiency of}} its usage; proposes a methodology for determination of or a pay-off time period for recoupment of expenses pertaining to machine procurement and optimum time period for operational stage, its life cycle that corresponds to obtaining maximum profit. Nowadays constant values of main output parameters (operating capability, self cost of <b>machine-hour)</b> corresponding to the beginning of operation are {{to be taken into account}} while determining expediency of machine creation. Practically they significantly change in the process of machine operation this fact must be taken account while creating a machine and using it for its intended operational purpose and ensuring its operating capability. The proposed methodology for maintaining and restoration of operating capability of construction and road-building machines was published previously [3]. The paper proposes a methodology for its implementation on the basis of expenses for machine manufacturing and dynamics of main output parameters at the operational stage of its life cycle. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{reduction}} {{treatments are}} especially urgent near homes, where a stand replacement fire would also endanger property and human lives. However, the forested properties associated with homes are often {{too small for}} cost-effective mechanized fuel treatment performed with traditional methods and equipment. This project tested a small rubber-tracked skid-steer specially modified for forestry operations that can provide all the functions of a complete harvesting system. The skid-steer can, alternately, carry a hot saw for tree felling, a processor to delimb and buck felled trees, a brush cutting head for mastication, and a log-grapple to transport logs and trees. All of the equipment can be transported on a trailer pulled by a heavy pickup truck, which makes for fast, economical movement between project sites. The study confirmed that this system is well suited to small-parcel conditions around home sites and performs best on even terrain, moderate slopes, and softwood trees with a dbh between 5 and 8 in. It took from 7 to 15 productive <b>machine-hours</b> ac- 1 to perform all treatment phases (i. e., mastication, felling, processing, and skidding). The occurrence of delays significantly increased this figures, bringing the average 9. 7 productive hours ac- 1 to 13. 5 worksite hours. Treatment cost was estimated at $ 480 ac- 1 and $ 1, 146 ac- 1 for whole-tree and cut-to-length harvesting, respectively. In addition to offering a reasonable treatment cost, the system {{has the advantage of}} requiring a low investment, which allows small-scale enterprises to get into the business.
