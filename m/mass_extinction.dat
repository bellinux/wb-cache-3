5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.

5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Permian saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic extinction event: probably the most severe <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> event of the phanerozoic.

5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> {{of marine}} {{plankton}} {{appears to have}} been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> have profoundly {{impacted}} {{the evolution}} of life through not only reducing taxonomic diversity but also reshaping ecosystems and biogeographic patterns. In particular, they are considered to have driven increased biogeographic cosmopolitanism, but quantitative tests of this hypothesis are rare and have not explicitly incorporated information on evolutionary relationships. Here we quantify faunal cosmopolitanism using a phylogenetic network approach for 891 terrestrial vertebrate species spanning the late Permian through Early Jurassic. This key interval witnessed the Permian–Triassic and Triassic–Jurassic <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions,</b> the onset of fragmentation of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the origins of dinosaurs and many modern vertebrate groups. Our results recover significant increases in global faunal cosmopolitanism following both <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions,</b> driven mainly by new, widespread taxa, leading to homogenous ‘disaster faunas’. Cosmopolitanism subsequently declines in post-recovery communities. These shared patterns in both biotic crises suggest that <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> have predictable influences on animal distribution and may shed light on biodiversity loss in extant ecosystems...|$|R
5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, and suggest that other events may have contributed to the end-Cretaceous <b>mass</b> <b>extinction.</b> In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day <b>mass</b> <b>extinction</b> only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt <b>mass</b> <b>extinction.</b> The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature.

Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene.

5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years).

40|$|Do <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> grade {{continuously}} {{into the}} background extinctions occurring {{throughout the history of}} life, or are they a fundamentally distinct phenomenon that cannot be explained by processes responsible for background extinction? Various criteria have been proposed for addressing this question, including approaches based on physical mechanisms, ecological selectivity, and statistical characterizations of extinction intensities. Here I propose a framework defining three types of continuity of mass and background extinctions-continuity of cause, continuity of effect, and continuity of magnitude. I test the third type of continuity with a statistical method based on kernel density estimation. Previous statistical approaches typically have examined quantitative characteristics of <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> (such as metrics of extinction intensity) and compared them with the distribution of such characteristics associated with background <b>extinctions.</b> If <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> are outliers, or are separated by a gap from background extinctions, the distinctness of <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> is supported. In this paper I apply Silverman 2 ̆ 7 s Critical Bandwidth Test to test for the continuity of <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> by applying kernel density estimation and bootstrap modality testing. The method improves on existing work based on searching for gaps in histograms, in that it does not depend on arbitrary choices of parameters (such as bin widths for histograms), and provides a direct estimate of the significance of continuities or gaps in observed extinction intensities. I am thus able to test rigorously whether differences between <b>mass</b> <b>extinctions</b> and background extinctions are statistically significant. I apply the methodology to Sepkoski 2 ̆ 7 s database of Phanerozoic marine genera. I conclude that <b>mass</b> and background <b>extinctions</b> appear to be continuous at this third level-continuity of magnitude-even though evidence suggests that they are discontinuous at the first and second levels...|$|R

India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.

Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased volcanism, particularly the massive Deccan Traps eruptions that occurred around the same time, and climate change, checking against the fossil record.
